<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good, how are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  So what's new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not too much.  Um, I think this —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's working a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least I don't feel, I mean I'm still, you know, going through everything, but it just seems that it's not making me more anxious.  Like the other medicine just seemed I was getting like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was getting a little bit more anxious or some —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is the Prozac doing do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just feel like I'm a little bit calmer.  Like it just kind of helps me take a step back a little bit from the situation, and kind of re—evaluate from an outside prospective so I'm not so, like, wound up and freaked out at everything.  So that's just kind of how I feel about the, that that's how it's working.  I just seem to be able to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you less obsessed about pregnancy or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's still definitely much in the fourth of my mind but I don't feel as, I don't feel like I'm, like, crawling up the side of a tree about it anymore.  Like it's still there, it's still, I think it's always going to be important you know.  I think as a woman, having children is, once you decide you want them it kind of can become all consuming.  So I don't, I just find that I don't feel crazy about it anymore like I was.  It, I feel more in control of it then it does of me a little bit.  So, it's just, yeah, it's still there and now I'm just a little, for other medical reasons I just haven't, my cycles are very abnormal now.  So that's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Cycles are what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My cycles are very abnormal now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I just haven't had a period in like 3, I'm 3 and a half weeks late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  So, but I'm, you know, it happens, you know, so I think if this would happen —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're not pregnant though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Or at least, you know, according to the urine test I'm not.  So, and I'm just kind of, I don't feel like I'm getting the brush off from my doctor but it's one of those, "Call me back in 2 weeks."  "Call me back in 2 weeks."  Which I know is, because they're used to people having abnormal cycles.  So I just, you know, I'm just trying to take it with a grain of salt in all of it.  I'm sure all of the stress I was under a month ago didn't help and things just kind I'm sure out of whack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I just need to, I'm trying to be calm about it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has this ever happened before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—hum.  I think I was very, like, clockwork.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, I've never been pregnant before so, I mean, the miscarriage could have —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thrown everything kind of out of whack too so.  So, I'm just trying to be calm about it.  It's not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you thinking less about the miscarriage or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm not, I'm not so much, like, stressed about that anymore.  I mean, it happened, it's over.  I just, I'm excited for better perspectives next time I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're more looking forward to something rather —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Than worrying about what happened —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Before.  You seem more at peace.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.  I feel a little bit like my mind is healed a little bit.  Like it's not so crazy anymore, you know.  It's still there, you know, but I just, I feel like it's, I can kind of breathe myself a little bit out of it.  So, I just my body was cooperating now because I feel like everything is in sync in here.  And that just follow suit, like, just get myself back in this natural rhythm of things.  But now I feel like I'm kind of feeling much better in here but now, you know, that's not cooperating.  But, you know, it eventually, I think will just take a while to regulate itself out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, boy that's a different approach.  I mean, you're just going to let it happen —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Rather than force it to happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On a 0 to 10 scale, 0 being no change, 10 100% improvement, how would you rate it, so far with the Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four, so you've still got a ways to go.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't know if that's necessarily something that's going to be fixed with medicine or if it's something that I just need to, if it's just kind of become a whole oriented process.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, Prozac works over two, it works by dose but it also works with time.  The longer you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  And it has only been 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not even Saturday it will be 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you're up to the full 20 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twenty, um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, my inclination is just give it more time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, we could go to 40, but I would say take 20 for maybe another month or so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And let's see how much improvement there is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, yeah, because I feel like I'm on some sort of like upward trend right now.  Like I don't think I need, uh, and I haven't had any, like, like, any —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—hum.  From what I understand, there doesn't seem to be too —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people get nauseas when they first start taking the medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—hum.  I feel like I've got an iron stomach when it comes to most medications though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  How about sleep problems?  Nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sleeping's been actually a little bit better I'd say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I still wake up, I still like wake up before my alarm which has never happened before in my life, like usually I was one of those, like, snooze button, like, you know, like, it's, you know, and now I'm, like, waking up before it, like, uh, and that nausea is still there in the morning pretty bad but not as bad.  Like I feel like I'm kind of like breathe out of it a little bit.  Um, but I, I mean, I really, I feel much better than I did.  I mean, so I just, I mean, I'm kind of realizing now that, um, you know, shit happens to everybody unfortunately and, like, this was what, you know, this was what was put on my plate and, um, thankfully it was that and not something else horrible that could've happened.  And I'm still so young and I need to relax and I need to appreciate this time with my husband.  And so, you know, so I think I'm trying to just keep on the bright side of it a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does he see any movement in you or changes in you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think he does.  He's always like, he's like, "Oh this."  He's like, "Right now you're up here."  He's like, "I don't want to say anything in case you go back down here."  So, um, but I think he does.  I just, I think, I had a talk to him about her and I think one of the things I kind of made a commitment to was that, um, I don't want to be over analytical with him.  And like, have to, like, drag conversation out of him but in due time when he wants to talk to me about things, like, he will.  I need to realize that maybe there's just some, some outlet that it's better for me to discuss things with my mom or with you or until I feel in a better place where he can feel because [NAME OTHER] doesn't like to feel unless he feels like he can help so it's kind of frustrating for him and, you know, I'm just kind of going off on these tangents —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he likes to fix things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and he's just kind of like, "What?"  You know, it's like, you're way off base and you need to relax.  And it's hard hearing that when you know, uh, you know that's what you need to do but you can't bring yourself to get there, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't know, I was just, now I'm just looking forward to trying to get, you know, everything physically back in all regards so I can move on and start a new one I guess.  It feels a little odd —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you exercising any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  So we're getting back into that, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And work is fine, there's no pressure there or anywhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, work is, work is work.  I got called off today so that's why I was able to move the time up so I'm looking —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they were slow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, the census must have been down.  I'm looking forward to getting out of school and having something consistent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often does that happen, you called not to go to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'd say maybe once every five shifts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they pay you for it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—hum</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or just you lose the money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because I'm just per diem nurse.  So, I mean it's good for now because I'm in school so it works well but long term it wouldn't be, you know, so it's hard it's like you got to take the risks of it but the benefits of it right now outweigh the risks.  It's just because I need flexibility with my clinical hours and working per diem I'm able to do that because I can make my own schedule also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then when do you finish, this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be done in June.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I'm excited to be done with school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your concentration is a little better too or you haven't noticed that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I mean, yeah.  I guess it's, yeah, I get, like I said before I kind of just get it done what I need to get done once I know it has to be, a deadline's approaching I just kind of hunker down and finish it, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was, I guess I was never a [INAUDIBLE], once I knew I had an assignment to complete I would put [INAUDIBLE] aside for a second and get it done and then go back to it, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not getting out as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But now it's much easier to do that, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the, the feel is much more relaxed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To you then it was a week and a half ago and still is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel a little bit more, because right now I was like, even, I feel like what's going on right now is being so late as I am.  But it just sort of happened like a month ago I think I would be freaking out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like, "What's going on?"  "What's going on?"  You know, like, calling them every 30 seconds and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Crying on the phone when they tell me to wait 2 weeks when I know if I was on their end I would probably tell me to wait 2 weeks because things don't happen overnight so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you think at all what we talked about, about, you know, the [INAUDIBLE] experience?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did.  I did think about it and I'm, I've completely appreciate where you're coming from.  I did go home and try to really, um, I adjusted a little bit and I don't feel that way at all.  I don't think it.  And I can see where you're coming from but I really, I think if I tried to, like, break myself down say is that really what's going on.  And I don't really think it is really truly in my heart of hearts.  I don't think that's what feeling this.  I just think it's, um, uh, I mean, I honestly think it's a very woman thing too.  So, I don't, I don't necessarily want to take all of what I'm feeling away to being something imbalanced.  Like, I think part of what I'm feeling, I think most of what I'm feeling is a very biologic yearning that when I've talked to a lot of woman who's been through this that are like, they felt the same exact way where it was just all consuming and a fear of never being able to do it and I think that it's just like I said it's a very feminine, biological instinct too that I've feeling.  It might be eviscerated by —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Be eviscerated by the fact that I don't know how to deal with it very well emotionally but I think the underlying anxieties I think are very natural.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that's why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel more normalized by it too?  I mean you feel that what you're going through is a storm with a little intensification.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I do.  I think it's, I think it's one of those fundamental things to being a woman that when you have it, kind of, ripped out of your hands essentially, it makes you question.  And I think, I just, having, maybe I think I just didn't cope with it very well.  But I don't think it was, uh, completely off base, you know.  So, that's just kind of the more, you know, women you talk to the more —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you talk to your mom anymore about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did but see she's never been through any of this so it's for her, it's hard for me to talk to women who's never been through any personal issues because it's just, it's a very different, um, different, very different school of advice that they give then women who have been through it.  So, I find them to be the most comforting like people who have, you know, have problems getting pregnant or problems with miscarrying or things like that.  They just tend to be the most, like, understanding.  I find cause —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have friends you talk to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And it's funny the more I talk about it the more everyone's been through it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Apparently you know.  So I think that helps a little bit, you know.  But yeah, my job is tricky.  I work in a NICU sometimes and I hate it still.  It's just like, uuhhh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just so, like, everybody, I think part of your job you want to be able to, like, not escape but just kind of move on like you know.  I feel like different things are going on in my life that are so great but I just, you know, I don't have to be consumed right now with having children, like, you know, I've got a good thing going elsewhere but then I have to go back to work and you're surrounded by it and like everything related is just like, ooh, it's fine like, I don't freak out about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just like, it'd be nice to have a job or just like you know I had something completely distant from —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kids but that's just, you know, ironic I guess.  But I [INAUDIBLE] in a, you know, a nursery and, um, the NICU but, um, yeah so I wasn't too bummed this morning when I got called off.  I was like, "Oh, darn."  And I go, "Really, oh shoot."  Especially at [DEIDENTIFIED], I'm not a huge fan of the hospital.  It's great as a patient, um, but as a nurse it's horrid.  It's just so boring so I don't mind getting called off there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why is it boring?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just like [INAUDIBLE] is not very high.  I just, I get bored easily, like, I like to have busy patients that have a lot going on medically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Slow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is slow.  A lot of down time and the nurses are not very friendly there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're, I mean, they're nice —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They keep to themselves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're all very cliquish, they're all older and they've been there for like 30 plus years and I'm the float nurse that just kind of comes in —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't really accept you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's just not.  Which is, because I know I'm temporary and they know I'm temporary so I don't really care but I used to work [DEIDENTIFIED] and it's just a much more fun environment because everyone's young and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> University?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just like a lot of young girls and you know, newly married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot more accepting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just a lot more fun, so, I'm excited, I'm looking forward to being done with school and getting into a consistent job and having, because I miss that, I used to have that, you know, before I was back to nursing, I had a job I had for two years and you know you got your people you see every day and there's camaraderie so.  That'll be nice to have that back.  I think, you know, the same job Monday through Friday.  So, I kind of miss that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're definitely, your mood is much lighter.  You're smiling much more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have that tension or angst in your face.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean really, [INAUDIBLE].  I think, yeah, [INAUDIBLE] was right.  I think it was definitely a serotonin issue then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's what you said your sister also was responding to this.  Did you tell her that you started this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, I did.  She's on the same 20 mg dose.  So, you know, coping, you know, so I hope it'll get me over the whole.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Oh, I definitely think it will.  I think if anything you'll see improvement over the next month because this is a step you take six to eight weeks to really peak in terms of benefit but you feel like a 40% improvement now you should easily be up to 80 or 90%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's really nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then the next questions will be due about the pregnancy though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they did change us to the schedule D so it's not something you really want to take.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it used to be a b and then a c and now it's a d.  They keep changing it.  Uh, I've had patients who have gotten pregnant on it and opted to stay on it and many of them, you know, the patients and the babies were fine but it's not really recommended.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Isn't it more [INAUDIBLE] the third trimester?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, first trimester, you know, is something I would be concerned about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, because I thought it was just Paxil was a category [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, they all changed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They all changed?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They all changed.  Except Wellbutrin, that's why we tried Wellbutrin first because that's the schedule B.  Um, and then the incidents, I think, were two out of a hundred, you know, 2% which is a very low incident but a jump from 1 to 2% that's why they changed it from a C to a D.  So, I think we, I think that's something we should consider.  I don't know how we're going to do that.  That's why I said maybe we should go four or five months, not try to get pregnant.  You know you're still on 29, right?  And then after that, maybe try to wean you off it.  How do you feel about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't we keep benefits first?  Why don't we keep benefits?  Are you actively trying to get pregnant now, every day, or, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I don't even have even, my cycles are so all over the place so I don't even know up from down right now in terms of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you checking frequently, I mean in terms of if you get pregnant or are you not expecting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you know, not really because I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, why don't we do this, we'll keep you on it because I think in the next month feel [INAUDIBLE] improved.  If you do get pregnant, call me, and then we'll discuss what we do.  Like I said, women who've become pregnant have opted to stay on it if the baby's fine but because of the switch I would prefer you to take it.  Um, the ideal, as I said, would be if we wait four or five months, get you stable then try to take you off it see if you maintain stability and then try to get pregnant.  That would be the ideal scenario.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.  I'm supposed to call my, my OB in a week if I don't have a period yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you tell her or him that you were on the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  So, I'll let them know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, let them know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I, because at this point it's just going to be me playing phone tag, or not phone tag just me calling letting them know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have an appointment with them in a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm supposed to call and just let them know if I have or have not started a period and if not then I'm supposed to go in and have —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My progesterone level drawn to see what's going on and then I'll, let's do my  [INAUDIBLE] unless they give me the brush off [INAUDIBLE] two week s then I'll.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well let's see what happens and like I said, I'm comfortable to just go ahead and give you the prescription I already gave you.  Did I give you refills on the prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like 2 refills</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  You're good for a while.  Just stay on it and then, um, I'm going to be on vacation in the middle of [INAUDIBLE] if you're okay, we'll just wait till I get back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless there's a problem then call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that should be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, uh, oh if you get pregnant or something in between then call and let me know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] feel if I get pregnant that could be my own little [INAUDIBLE] things so I could probably [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the thing about Prozac too is it's a long acting drug, it's not like Paxil.  You get rapid discontinuation because of the half life but it stays in your system a while is the problem so if you stopped Prozac, you could take the [INAUDIBLE] until it totally gets out of your kitchen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it's just a serotonin drug, you know what I mean.  Like, it's so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>The following is a session featuring Dr. Albert Ellis and a client, John Jones. Albert Ellis, Ph.D., was born in Pittsburgh in 1913. He received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in clinical psychology from Columbia University, and held many important psychological positions, including chief psychologist of the State of New Jersey and adjunct professorships at Rutgers and other universities. He is the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), the first of the now popular Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT).</p>

<p>In 1959 he established the Albert Ellis Institute, a non-profit organization whose mission was to promote Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) as a comprehensive educative and preventative theory. Dr. Ellis died on July 24, 2007.</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>The patient with whom the following recorded interview is held is a 31-year-old freelance copywriter who has been a fixed homosexual since the age of 14. He has had only a few heterosexual experiences, when girls have taken the initiative with him. And these have not turned out very well since he has shown himself to be too passive, effeminate and campy. And the girls, therefore, quickly sought other lovers.</p>

<p>He has been very promiscuous homosexually but even in this area has tended to be an unaggressive and passive individual and never to risk making the first overtures himself and thereby take the risk of being rejected.</p>

<p>The recorded interview comprises the fifteenth session with the patient, who has been seen irregularly for individual psychotherapy over a period of seven months at the time it occurs. However, he has more regularly attended group psychotherapy for the past five months. [0:01:12.7]</p>

<p>He first came to therapy largely because he wanted to do creative writing but did not have the courage to try, even though he was competent as a copywriter. After a few months of therapy he did actively try some creative fiction and has been steadily progressing at doing it ever since.</p>

<p>He also considerably improved his general working habits. At first, however, he made no attempt to work on his homosexual problem. And only in the few weeks before the fifteenth session has he shown any inclination to do so.</p>

<p>Both the therapist and his therapy group have been encouraging him to try going with girls, and he now seems ready to make a serious attempt to do so. Though as the contents of the present interview show, he is resisting heterosexual participation in several subtle and obvious ways. [0:02:05.1]</p>

<p>The technique of therapy employed with this patient is rational emotive psychotherapy, which has been outlined in several recent publications. Rational therapy, or RT, is based on the assumption that human beings normally become emotionally disturbed because they are born with biological predispositions which make it easy for them to think crookedly or irrationally and because they biosocially acquire illogical and nonsensical thoughts, philosophies or attitudes.</p>

<p>Human emotion is conceived of as largely being a certain kind - a biased, prejudiced kind - of thought. And it is held that people can be taught to change their negative and disturbed feelings by changing the thoughts that almost invariably underlie these feelings. [0:02:56.2]</p>

<p>The rational emotive therapist believes that people literally talk themselves into neurotic states by telling themselves illogical and irrational sentences or ideas which they have previously learned from their parents and their culture and have internalized and keep ceaselessly repeating.</p>

<p>The main emphasis of the therapist who employs rational technique is on analyzing the patient's current problems - especially his feelings of anger, depression, anxiety and guilt - and concretely showing him that these emotions arise not from past events or external situations but from his present irrational attitudes toward very logical fears about these events and situations.</p>

<p>Where in psychoanalytic techniques considerable time is spent on showing the patient how he originally became disturbed, in rational emotive analysis much more emphasis is placed on how he is sustaining his disturbance by still believing the nonsense or illogical ideas which first led him to feel and act in an aberrated (sic) fashion. [0:04:05.7]</p>

<p>RT differs from psychoanalytic procedures in that A, not merely the facts and psychodynamics of the patient's behavior are revealed; but more to the point his underlying philosophies are ideas which lead to and flow from this historical facts;</p>

<p>B, a concerted attack is made on the irrational beliefs that are disclosed in the course of the therapeutic process.</p>

<p>C, emphasis is placed far less on the disclosure of the individual's unconscious drives and feelings than on revealing his unconscious and irrational attitudes which underlie these drives or feelings.</p>

<p>D, the therapist literally teaches the patient how to observe his unconscious illogical thinking and how, instead, to think straight.</p>

<p>And E, the patient is usually encouraged, urged or commanded into emotionally reeducating activity. [0:05:05.8]</p>

<p>The recorded session that follows is a fairly typical interview employing rational emotive technique except that the patient - probably because of the previous individual and group sessions he has had - is more accepting than many other patients are and requires relatively little counterattacking and annihilating of his irrationally held positions. But he does give considerable lip service, as many patients do, rather than true allegiance to sane views and actions. And the therapist consequently keeps trying to induce him to question and challenge his lip service and to think and act in a manner that will lead to truly rational convictions and hence thoroughgoing emotional and behavioral changes.

<p>BEGIN SESSION TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty good. I haven't been too... Well I can't that. I haven't been too disturbed. I've been keeping pretty busy. However, I'm in that going-to-sleep routine again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't, you know. And I don't think I really need the sleep. But I just sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much have you been sleeping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Well like last... I've been making it a point to get home at midnight. And usually at best, you know, I go to sleep at midnight. And I feel that I should wake up around 8:00 or 9:00, you know, 8:30 in the morning. And it's to my advantage to wake up then, because then I can get a day started. And I'm discovering that I am waking up at 9:30 and 10:00 and 11:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then in the afternoon if I get tired... Like yesterday afternoon I went in and I thought, "Well I'll flop down." I was sort of - I had been drawing all day and my eyes were tired. And I thought, "I'll sleep for an hour or something." And then I'll go to sleep. And this was at 5:00, and I woke up at 8:30. [0:07:01.8]</p>

<p>And this is just too much sleep. You know, I'm just wasting too much time sleeping. And I...You know, if I were physically exhausted it might make sense. But I'm not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you sleeping past an alarm or anything like that? Or are you not following (ph) the alarm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I hadn't bothered with the alarm except that I know that for a fact last night I slept through a phone call. The phone rang, and it didn't wake me up. And the messenger boy from the desk had a package, and he came up about - he said about 6:00. And he said he knocked and knocked and knocked on the door. And I didn't wake up.</p>

<p>So evidently I'm really going out. You know, I'm not waking up to noises.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Literally sleeping right through them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, and then like an unexpected noise I would - I actually think I would wake up, you know, more rapidly. At least I used to be a very light sleeper; anybody walked through the room and I'd wake up. [0:08:02.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But don't you have an alarm on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well up until just recently - over the last year - I've always been able to flop down and say I'm going to sleep for an hour, and sleep for an hour and wake up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I'm getting, you know, like I don't know, an attitude if I can sleep... Or I don't respond to what I'm telling myself, that I'm going to wake up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have that internal alarm clock going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, which I used to could count on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, if I'd say, "I'm going to wake up at 7:00," I'd be up at, you know, five minutes 'til.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But isn't the thing then - if your internal alarm isn't working - to use the</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: external until it does work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's... It's just the... You know, it... If I have to get up I suppose I could... You know, I would use an alarm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But just the... What bothers me is this idea of, "Why am I wanting to sleep so darn much?" You know, when I know it's physically not necessary for me now because I'm getting more sleep than I ever have. [0:09:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless it's, you know, just a habit that I've had and it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you think it possibly might be that you are trying to evade work or evade life or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mindset, probably. This is the only thing I can figure.</p>

<p>But one thing: But one thing: Since I told you I was, you know, that I was quitting with the boys...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I have, you know, seen some of the boys that I've known; and we've gone to dinner and things like that. But this is why I've made the point to be home by 12 o'clock, and I hadn't... I ain't had no sex at all for two or three weeks. Because I haven't made it with any of the girls I've met yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, I have the feeling that maybe I'm sort of hiding behind sleeping, you know. I know - I don't - I'm not getting the sex I would like. So I go to sleep and sleep it off, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the only reason I think- thing I can figure. Of course I don't feel frustrated in any - particularly in any other areas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when you are awake do you feel sexually frustrated? [0:09:56.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No,. Now this is also a strange part. I was noticing this morning that since this - you know. Since I decided I was going to try - really working at getting girlfriends, I mean I haven't been at all particularly desirous of sex. You know, I haven't - just felt like, "Gee, you know, I've got to go out and find something or somebody."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course for one thing, frankly, the times I have felt I wanted to have some - you know, sex for relief, it's just too easy to masturbate. You know, I can always take care of myself that way, which isn't - you know, doesn't really solve the problem particularly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except it is relief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well again, do you think that your lack of sex desire is an evasion for...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I do. I think that I'm... In one hand I'm thinking, you know, that... You know, I want this, and logically this is what I want to do. And still I'm... There's something, you know, more subconsciously - and sort of sneaky subconsciously I must be fighting it. Or dodging it - dodging it, not... You know, taking the easy way out. [0:11:12.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Now let's ask ourselves... Let's assume for the moment that this is true, that you are "sneaky subconsciously", as you said, fighting it. Let's ask ourselves exactly what you would be saying to yourself sneaky subconsciously in order to fight it. What would you be afraid of with, let us say, the girl that would induce you, A, to sleep more - which you are doing - and B, when you are awake, not to have that much of a sex desire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's the que - that's the hard one, frankly. Because I don't think I'm afraid in the sense of being afraid of the girls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, I'm not physically afraid or even emotionally afraid, I don't think. I mean a sex relationship... I think what I'm afraid of is probably just the going out and the first... I'm really afraid of the first contact, the - how to get into it. [0:12:13.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Of the encounter, the meeting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you do have to go out first and get the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...getting to know the girl.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's when I, you know, I get terribly shy. And I get all - you know, messed up. And I think probably what I am doing is to - is - you know, "Well if you oversleep, then you don't have to go out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's true. And if you don't have the sex desire you don't have to go out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Now let's assume that for the moment, that you are afraid of the contact. Now let's get the exact sentence - what you are saying to yourself to make yourself afraid of this contact. What are you saying is dreadful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it sounds too simple to say they won't like me. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sure that's the bottom of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. In other words you are saying, "But if I don't..." [0:13:01.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But am I building a lot of crap? It's, "I hope they won't like me," I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's get that a little more specific. You're saying, "If I go out and meet the girls or a girl" - let's say - "then there is a good possibility that she won't like me. And that would be dreadful, that she didn't."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a sentence you think exactly...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I can't say if that's just it, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like... You know, I defeat myself before I go out. Because pretty - half the time I just said, "Well I'm going to go somewhere." And I'm - you know.</p>

<p>Like, you know, I joined the Museum of Modern Art. And I've gone a couple of times. And I walk in and I look around, and immediately... I don't even see a girl that is appealing looking to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. So already before I - you know. I'm cutting myself short before I even start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But again that's what? [0:14:01.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know whether...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another technique for the fear? Again, you've given two techniques so far. One, you stay asleep long enough to (inaudible at 0:14:09.2)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It probably is. It probably is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And three, you are saying the girl isn't good looking enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we still get back to the proposition that if you did have the desire - if you did get up early and if she were good looking enough and you did make some kind of an overture, that she then wouldn't like you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that would be terrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess... I'm - I mean that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't even think I gotten to the stage of finishing it up and saying, "That would be terrible."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't say that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm not rationally say... I mean I'm not logic - I'm not open to saying it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are consciously (ph) doing that. Right. But doesn't your behavior show, by inference, that you must be saying something like that? Because if you were saying just A, "If I went out and did these things, didn't sleep, had the sex desire and liked the girl physically, that she might reject me..." - just that, if you were saying that, wouldn't you then start going into these evasive dives of yours if you weren't saying, "And it would be terrible if she did reject me." Because if she rejected you, you'd lovely experience at being rejected. [0:15:22.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So on some level you must be saying, "That would be terrible. It would be awful. I couldn't take it. Look what a crumb I would be if she rejected me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also involved in there is that as we talk I am realizing that I am still very - too much on my own terms. Like when I go out to the Modern and I want to meet a girl and I don't meet her in the first ten minutes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...then, you know, it's a bad deal. And I want to go out and go home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I'm sort of making the effort but not really the effort. But it's just a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Now is there a little grandiosity here? Because really...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well but unfortunately I was - you know. I'm looking for somebody good enough for me, not me good enough for them. [0:16:08.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And is this... Is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think this is part of the...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff briefly at 0:16:15.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They ought to come flocking, and they don't right then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. And they don't. And this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's even more than the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean the fear of the fact that they are not going to come flocking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that more than the physical fear...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was so unfair that they are not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they should.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because, you know, I get... It's a crazy thing. I get all this shit from everybody that, you know, "You're a good-looking guy. And, you know, you shouldn't have any problems about meeting people."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do. You know, I just flat out do. And I go out with this great feeling of, "Gee. You know, I'm God's gift to women." And nothing happens. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But isn't that notion - that you are a good-looking guy and you shouldn't have any trouble meeting people - isn't that rather unrealistic? Because no matter how good-looking you are and how bright you are and how well educated, don't we all have trouble meeting people? [0:17:05.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know about the rest of the world, but I do.</p>

<p>No really, you know. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think that most people have some degree of trouble? Even though they have relatively less than others who are not good looking or stupid and uneducated, don't they always have some trouble? And don't they have to do some work to overcome that "some trouble"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's it. I think that's really... You know, a lot of the problem is that I... And it's... I finally made up my mind that I would work at it and... But I'm not performing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Up here I've said it once that I'm going work at it. But then I'm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Work at it. What is "it"? You know what that means?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...bucking it by going... At meeting people, at pushing myself a little more into walking up and saying, you know, "What's you name?" Just that. [0:18:00.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. But isn't that the second thing you have to work at? You do have to work at that. But don't you also have to work at that crap that you are telling yourself? "They should. They should..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...do this. But they are all..."</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:18:13.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...would be awful if they didn't." And so on. Isn't that where the work may first be required before you can, secondly, get off your ass and go out and actually talk to the girls and meet them and so on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are seeing "it" - "it" number two. That's why...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The goal. But I am not seeing that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But are you seeing the more important goal - which has plagued you all your life in so many other respects in your other work and so on - the "it" number one, that "I must work on me."? So - now are you seeing that very clearly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. That's where I get bogged down. And that was part of... The other day I was... I've noticed after I had been talking to the whole group that I keep talking about things. And that, in a sense, is my thing. [0:19:07.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is... I mean the goal is - I'm seeing some sort of a goal as a thing rather than working on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. That's right. You've got it with the others in the group.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could see it with the group. But are you really...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean - and like that first date is the thing I am shooting for. And it really shouldn't be that important to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's... Oh it should be important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it should be important. But it shouldn't be the base for later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. The main thing is changing...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:19:40.4)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So his ideas, his philosophies, which have kept you back - as we just said a minute ago - in lots of other respects including and especially this one with the girls.</p>

<p>Now shouldn't most or a great deal of the work, at least be there? Then finally you still will have to do the work of getting up and then getting off your ass and going out and meeting the girls.</p>

<p>But you never quite get to that when you are doing the counter-work, we might say, of falling asleep so much, of not having sex desire, of seeing that the girls are ugly and so on. [0:20:14.6]</p>

<p>That's what you are telling yourself at what I call Point B.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it. Yeah. At the same time I must - just out of sheer fairness to me and the discussion - admit that I have been noticing pretty girls more lately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, occasionally on the subway. I have not yet - I have yet to get the nerve to walk over to a real pretty girl I've seen in the subway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and say, you know, "I'd like to call you" or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The defenses are going down more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've been seeing a lot prettier girls than I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And discovering that I'm noting that the prettier girls I am seeing are younger...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...than me, which had... I never noticed people - girls - that were younger than me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't notice them at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were always my age or a little older. [0:21:01.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Because you edited out the most...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...eligible and best-looking ones so wouldn't have to do anything about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm - and I'm sure that's it. But I really am noticing them a lot more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So that... That...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that there are pretty girls around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That fearful and that grandiose sentence at Point B of, "Wouldn't it be awful if I failed?" or "They shouldn't do this to me," seems to be going down a bit, giving you leeway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least I can look at them now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. At least you can look. But it's still there and requires more work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Apparently you have done some on it, because you have asked yourself, "Would it be so awful?" And in your artwork and all, you are doing things now which you have never done before in your life. Isn't that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm. And I've even been active enough that I have made a couple of passes at people and, you know, been refused. But at I've - I'm sort of trying even there. Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Granted that one of the gals I made a pass at is as sick as I am, I think. "Er - I'm one, too." But, you know. At least I had a chance in the subway to make known what I wanted to ask them. [0:22:08.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you weren't too afraid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are contemplating the fact that maybe it isn't so awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, actually. And it was... As I was saying, you know, it was - it's a girl I know. She and I have known each other for a long time and sort of been, you know, just good friends for years. I still - I find...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:22:35.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And - but I don't think I'd ever get anywhere with her. She's just a little too keyed up on being a big businesswoman and - one of the editors of Harper's and Vogue, and her career is going to come first and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that she sort of builds the wall up, too. [0:22:55.2]</p>

<p>And we had dinner the other night. And she invited me up for a drink after dinner. And I went. And I made a pass. And she said, "No." And that was that. But at least I had tried. I'll - granted I was in pretty fancy territory, because I'm - you know. It was - I guess in a way I felt that I probably would be refused anyway. It was like practice, kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. But you were able to do it easier than some other girl that you wouldn't be sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That I had no idea of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But still it was an event. And the practice is good, isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Yeah. And I felt - and I really did find that I could make a pass without being embarrassed myself and having...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, made an proper approach or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't get hit. So I guess I came out on top.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you did get some experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean I came out more plus than minus, I guess. [0:24:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. How many girls have you made a pass at in your whole life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Four or five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, this was one of the four or five.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm. I've been very reticent in that area. I will admit it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As a matter of fact, Dave, even in carrying further back I don't think I've every made a pass at a guy. It was always, you know, they chased me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sure that this has a lot of bearing on it. I want the women to chase me, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's right, too. And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. It's an old habit pattern, one of those, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...isn't that one of those main reasons for homosexuality, that boys find that other boys will chase them while women won't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's much safer. And it wouldn't be so terrible, because they won't get rejected that often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can say yes without being the villain of the piece.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. You refuse them, but they are not going to refuse you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...unless you make the overture. And you don't have to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that's pretty true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we get back to changing...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:25:02.1)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...be so terrible if you got refused - even by a girl you didn't know - that there was a good chance beforehand she was going to refuse you. And you didn't know at all what was going to be. Or would it be so terrible if you grandiosely didn't get exactly what you wanted without any effort and with their selection of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It wouldn't be bad this time, you know. And this I can... I can logically believe this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But most of the time, more strongly you still believe the other thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And somehow I don't catch myself saying it to myself. But that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no type of pattern. And I... You know, I don't even really know when I say it to myself, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet isn't that value of these symptoms...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a dodge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...such as the sleeping too much and so on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that if you track them down you'll find that you must be saying these things to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That the symptom is still there. [0:26:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the - what I am saying is that I see it after the fact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: After I've fallen asleep and wake up I think, "Uh-oh. It's 8 o'clock. And Shatzi (ph) usually..." You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But isn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You goofed." But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. But if you clearly see it after the fact and keep admitting completely after the fact, even that, "Yes I still do have this horrifying idea," won't you get it back to before the fact in time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We must perceive that we have the negative notions - the fears and abilities and the grandiosities - before we can really get to work on them. And if you can perceive and perceive and perceive them through these symptoms - the lack of sex desire, the oversleeping and so forth - then you can finally get back and clip them, contradict them, challenge them, kick them in the teeth. [0:26:56.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also I must admit, too, that on this thing... It's not just that I... Work-wise I am still working, but not as... It's like in the last two or three weeks there's - everything is sort of like gotten soft-pedaled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've done some good work. And I haven't - I hadn't had too much commercial work coming in, so I've had time to do samples.</p>

<p>But I really haven't done as much work - as much samples as I should - as I feel that I should for the time I have spent. I haven't found the apartment that I've been saying that - to myself that I want to get. And I - you know, I don't know how much of this is involved with this just general, you know, turning off.</p>

<p>I think it's - a lot of the problem is just resistance in want - in change. And I logically know I want to change, and I'm just not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, because you are resisting the change in the sex area you think you are also resisting doing much in the other areas? [0:28:02.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little sitdown...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sort of - yeah. I'm sort of, you know, just in general procrastinating or even blaming one area for another.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Like, "Well I didn't get the work today - done today. So I have to work tonight." Or if that's not the excuse then, "I worked too hard today and I'm going to take a nap." Or, you know. And it - and I'm making a vicious circle, I think, of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the work and the apartment hunting become another excuse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another dodge, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. For not going out more and encountering the girls and taking the risks, committing yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, what is there to be afraid of? What is... What I'm saying is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically I think there is... It's a real shy... I think - or not basically. But part of this is that, you know, when I start thinking about, well the idea of, you know, going out and meeting people I start getting A, financially afraid. [0:29:07.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, it's... You know. So if I might find somebody and I do fall in love and I should want to get married, who can afford it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is also an excuse and a smokescreen, because I know a lot of people who have afforded it on a lot less than I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But right now something occurred to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Occurred to me, is one... I think one of the few pieces of motherly advice that I forgot was, "To get married is a drag."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From you mother, literally, you are talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um hm. Literally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I - how old would have been when [you literally heard that] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think 13 or 14.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And was it repeated several times over the years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. This was her general attitude: that, you know, she wasn't real happy with being housebound. She - and she... [0:30:00.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was told that a couple of times, "Now, don't get married." You know.</p>

<p>Of course then they reversed it when I got grown. And they said then - suddenly they decided they wanted grandchildren. It was all reversed. And the pressure was on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My little brother provided that commodity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the question is whether her telling you not to get married in itself started souring you, or whether you got soured for other reasons after you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to grab that as something to use.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. That was a good excuse. Mama said it, so that all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. If it came from the horse's mouth, the mare's mouth, then it must be so. And she didn't have such a great life. Why should I?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And also I must admit, this is one of the reasons I think that so much - really I'm very financially oriented in that sense. Or I'm scared shitless of property, let's face it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that was the more important doctrine they taught you, rather than...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...not to get married. Never be poor. [0:30:59.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that was involved with that, you see. And I'm sure that at the time that was Mother's bitch was. It was, you know, "Don't get married, because I got married and look how poor I am."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then in other respects...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And somehow marriage and poverty go together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then maybe - I'm sorry. They just do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in other respects, too, they would teach you - or she would teach you that poverty was an awful business.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And by all means do everything possible not to be poor. And so on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And this is why somehow... Well and even in the - when I was growing up I couldn't date because I never had money. I mean, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was very... And we were, you know, sort of in an unfortunate position of being one of the old families in the town with no money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you were expected to take your date to the country club or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least I was taught that that was you were expected to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That would be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I couldn't afford it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. But isn't this the shame again? How - what a shit I would be if I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [0:32:01.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...took my date not to the country club and took them on a cheap soda date or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, again, is what you were taught...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...to be the right kind of person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it was going to be all or nothing. And I didn't have the all. And - but maybe if I had... You know, if I saved my money and never got married, I might someday be able to afford to take somebody out. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's interesting that from beginning to end of the sequence, the fear exists that is inculcated. Because it's terrible to take the girl out, to encounter her, to have a date, and not do it right at the beginning. And at the end of the sequence it's terrible to be married to her and be poor and so on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And all along the line it's terrible; it's awful; it's catastrophic economically, socially, sexually and otherwise. What awful things would happen if you didn't do everything just right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From the beginning to the end of the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only trap that - the trap that I see to that is that you put everything off until you are too old to enjoy it. [0:33:00.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But you see? That's exactly the illogic of this position: that it's awful to do this and do that. But they never say that it's awful...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What you do do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...not to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They don't tell you what it's wonderful to do. That's the problem, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. And if - assuming that it was quite disadvantageous to take a girl out - not be able to take her to the right place and to marry her, not have enough money and so on - look how disadvantageous it is to sit on the sidelines, to become a homosexual and so on. That they don't paint the picture of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And as one of my patients keeps saying in one of my groups, when you do get some of the advantages it's a bargain even though you get the disadvantages of life. Because otherwise, without that bargain you will just get these disadvantages, the lack of participation, which - they don't tell you that. They don't emphasize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Because... No, I think... And that's what... I'm still fighting, you know. I've come to realize that, you know, I sort of wasted 15 or 20 years... [0:34:11.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...on, you know. Not wanting to be alone but being alone, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am still having to fight the other one about the economic crap and the "You wouldn't be so a good match if you didn't have it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And it would be disadvantageous. We're not denying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sure. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But would it be so disadvantageous, as your mother made it out to be and you are making it out to be and so on. It would have...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Logically, now I realize it wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just got to be able to accept it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Because again we said with that...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:34:50.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She sees lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm having that same trouble. I can tell myself the right sentences...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at the right time sometimes, you know. But I don't really accept them 100%, that that's really right. [0:35:02.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And it is true that - as you just said - you tell yourself the right sentences at times. But what are you saying the other times?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are saying just the opposite sentences, aren't you? "Oh my God. Is this terrible? I can't stand it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not even saying the sentences. I'm getting so busy in other areas - or making like I'm so busy that I guess... You know, back here somewhere I'm saying it. But I'm expressing it in work or in...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. You...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, running around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You - we can say the sentences instantaneously, a split second. And then immediately we go on to go to sleep or avoid sex - it is avoid sex desire in your case; it's nothing like that.</p>

<p>But the sentences still seem to be there. The philosophy is fundamentally there; because if it weren't, why would you have to go to sleep? If you really weren't afraid, weren't telling yourself, "Oh my God. If I encountered a girl, look what'll happen. She may reject me. And finally if I marry her I may be poor." And so on. If you weren't saying that, why would you have to use these dodges? [0:36:02.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't. You know. And this I know. I wouldn't if I weren't saying that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that the lack of action itself or the symptom itself is not important. Because you see, that re-propagandizes you further. You say the sentences. Then you start...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I say I'm not doing anything. And that makes it even worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. You start blaming yourself for falling asleep or evading the sex desire or so on. And round and round you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't pull your head off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I gotta take this [laugher leader] (ph) off, go answer the bell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You might need a longer string.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that's the upsetting thing about... Somewhere I can see logic or illogic when other people are talking sometimes. You know, not understandable. But I can talk myself into the most delightfully logical circles, you know. And I can't catch the flaw. [0:37:16.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't catch it. Not you can't catch it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - well yeah, I don't catch the flaw. I don't see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And isn't that where the word mainly gives up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you don't go after catching the flaw. You know something is wrong pretty quickly, because you go to sleep or something like that too much.</p>

<p>But then instead of doing the work and...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:37:34.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...as we said before, you start saying, "Well let's - what am I going to do about the other kind of work?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, "I'd like - I ought to go out tonight, but where am I going to go?" This is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is one of my standard sentences...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that I've got to learn how to say: "Well, you know, go anywhere. You know, go ride in the subway for two hours."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that, "I ought to go out tonight. Where am I going to go?" is what I call against the grain. Because the grain is still underneath.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Jesus Christ, what a horror it would be if I did go out." [0:38:00.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And did finally marry the girl." You know.</p>

<p>And that grain has to be worked on. And it's more important in many respects to work on that grain than the second grain of let's see the actual technique of going out and so on, which you still have to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Well actually I don't... You know, I suppose... You can't... The problem - part of the problem, too, is you can't just say, "Well I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do that." You have to be doing them both at the same time, and being aware that - what one is and what the other is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And as you've said...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Grain 1 and Grain 2 in this case for me, I think, have to come with - pretty much hand in hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's right. And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to work at it while I'm thinking about it. But I've had to start thinking more logically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And be aware, what you just said a minute ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Which is which?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be aware, to become aware. To perceive what you doing on both levels: on the inactivity with the girls and the inactivity with - the not looking at your own internal verbalizations, your own sentences - which are so, so important. [0:39:09.3]</p>

<p>The goofing, most of it in a sense is right there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it isn't an inability to look at it. And it isn't that it's deeply buried and unconscious. You could. But you are not making the effort there. You are slurring it over and saying, "Well I fell asleep again. Isn't that fascinating?" Something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I wonder what causes this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But no real attempt to find out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know what I'm doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And on theory you should know what causes it. Because there must be some crappy internalized sentence there, some "Be a grandiosity" or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's more in the terms of grandiosity than fear, although they - I'm sure they mean the same thing when you really work it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They are the other side of the same coin sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I have much more of a tendency to take the grandiose side than... Like I really basically... I don't think I feel that I'm a pretty shitty individual. I think I have more of a tendency to think I'm like the grandest little thing that ever hit the earth. [0:40:10.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Why doesn't everybody recognize it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Like somebody asked me one time what would I like to - what would I really like to do? And I said I'd like to... If I were completely honest, the thing I'd like most to be would be sort of the darling of the social world, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is a very grandiose attitude. And I - you know, it's not going to happen just by wanting it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. And I... Even looking at it I know it's a pretty crappy thing to shoot for. But if I just - you know, if wishes were horses and that was the wish I would make and then probably get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Until I learned how to - or until I catch myself and change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But the two are related because the reason you have to be the darling of the world is to prove...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is to prove that I'm not bad. [0:41:02.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that you're not. Yet you are saying, "I'm a piece of shit."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Either I am the darling of the world, or I am utter zero, crap." And are either of those things true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you really a piece of shit if you are not the darling of the world?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. See when I'm the... When I am alone and just working with myself, I cannot worry about whether I am being accepted or not accepted. Because I can get very absorbed in what I am working at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that is... It's a very pleasant little dodge: Get busy. Because then you don't have to think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. It has advantages in its own right...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...if it weren't all of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you tend to make it all of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't turn it off after the first eight hours and then go out to meet the girls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's right. There are other aspects, such as the closer relations with girls so far. And they would become rewarding, these other aspects, if you gave them chance as you've given the being alone. [0:42:02.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, incidentally, several months ago you weren't given that such a chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No I didn't like that so much. Now I've gotten to where I even fight to be alone a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very selfishly I have one friend, I must admit he's a grand friend to have because he's loaded and he loves to take you out and spend all the money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he'll take you to the best restaurants and the theater and all this, because he's scared shitless of being alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. And when I first met...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:42:35.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and he knew that we had sort of a falling out. And he liked me. And I said, "Look. You know, I'm through with guys. No hanky-panky involved I know your game. And if you want somebody, go pick on some other little boy."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I'll be glad to see you on occasion." And it's gotten to the point where every night he wants to go somewhere and do something that demand (ph) plans. And I've just had to learn how to say, "No. I'm sorry." [0:43:01.6]</p>

<p>He can help me very much business-wise, too, which is one of the reasons I really feel I don't want to drop that contact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not interested in him sexually. And he knows it. And as long as he wants to buy my company, that's fine and dandy by me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does take away from the time of going out and meeting girls, I must admit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have learned to say, "I'm sorry" and not feel, "Oh my God. This is terrible. He may not love me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. In fact, last night - or night before last, he had invited me to dinner. And I thought we were going out to dinner. And then he said meet him at the apartment. And I was there, and there were four or five people there for him. And the party got to looking like it was going to wind with everybody, you know, going to bed with each other. And this wasn't for me.</p>

<p>So I just calmly got up and put my coat on and said, "I have to be at home by midnight because I've got to get up early in the morning." Which was - you know. And I found this very easy to do. [0:44:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you weren't catastrophized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Finally good. I can - you know. So it's their problem if they can't accept the fact that I will do what I want to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. There you were not saying, "If they can't accept it, I am a piece of shit." You weren't saying that this time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I have found that in that area I have... You know, that's an area that I know well enough that I know I can turn my back on it, and to heck with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now why can't you do the same thing with girls? If you can say, "If he doesn't accept me..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now this is what I keep saying: "Now why can't I reverse the procedure?" But I'm not doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But obviously in theory you are able to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because if you used to be afraid of people like this - what they thought of you if you refused them something - and say, "Jesus Christ, that proves I'm no good," and you are not doing that, you can certainly do exactly the same thing with girls. While you still are afraid, "If they rejected me or if they ask too much money or something from me and I can't bear up, I'm a piece of shit."</p>

<p>That's the same basic thing, isn't it? 0:44:59.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really is. Well it's - a lot has to do with practice. In the area with them I'm beginning to practice this thing, "No."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're beginning to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm beginning to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't a few months ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But I mean look in the last two or three weeks...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...for instance. I said that I was through with all that crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm finding that it's very easy to - or not... But it's not difficult to say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...exactly what I want and what I intend to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know. What the world does to it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you do that with them. Why can't you do it with girls? And you will find some who will get highly insulted and won't take you the way you are, which is tough. But you will find others who will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm sure that's true. And I'd guess there is... Basically there has always been this thing, too, that I've never really accepted that females were - that girls were not different from men - very different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It's that I've always assumed that women reacted to everything differently. [0:46:03.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There is that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had never taken the trouble to really find out that they don't. That they want sex as much...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We are all human beings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...as men want sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They - you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they are human beings at bottom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I've never accepted that. So they were always like a little goddess somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's right - which is probably what your mother tried to get you to believe, or something along that line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even now I find if difficult to just be myself in the sense that it's just another human being I'm talking to, not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...something special and big, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I see...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's definitely enough of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...logically that it is possible for me to work on women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "To work on," you say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To really work on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. To really work on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On just accepting women as people, not women as some special thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Want to hear some of this back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:47:02.8]</p>

<p>END SESSION TRANSCRIPT</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>It can be seen from the previous recording that the therapist, using material that the patient brought up during the session, quite deliberately tried to structure the interview so that the patient would see and admit A, that he was evading really going with girls, even though he wanted - he said that he wanted to give up his homosexual behavior and to have a try at heterosexuality;</p>

<p>B, that behind his evasions lay a clear-cut catastrophizing philosophy of life concretely embodied in the internalized sentences, "Wouldn't it be terrible if I made attempts to relate to girls and they rejected me? What a thoroughly worthless individual I would then be";</p>

<p>C, that some of the patient's attitudes toward going with females were originally indoctrinated by his mother, who was herself somewhat embittered against marriage; [0:48:03.1]</p>

<p>D, that because of his general fear of failure he has been ceaselessly reiterating his early acquired attitudes and using them as an excuse for his continuing avoidance of heterosexual relationships;</p>

<p>E, that he doesn't have to be afraid of standing up for his own desires and saying, "No" to either males or females, and that if he keeps making progress in being decisive with males - as he has been doing - he will help himself to be more daring and more decisive with girls;</p>

<p>F, that there is nothing very special about females in that they are a regular part of the human race, and the patient can just as easily be easygoing and relaxed with them and accept possible rejections by them as he is now learning to do and to be with males;</p>

<p>And G, that there is no magic, that the patient is tackling his social sexual problems and becoming less of a patsy and more of an individualist. [0:49:05.1]</p>

<p>The main thing is that he must keep working and working by challenging his own internalized sentences and by taking active plunges into new patterns of behavior until he begins to find it easy to think and act in the heterosexual and un-catastrophizing ways that he is aiming for.</p>

<p>Following this fifteenth session, the transcript of which has just been reviewed, the patient was mainly seen for once-a-week group therapy sessions. He came in for the eighteenth individual session seven months later, mainly to report that he had been having regular intercourse with a girl for the previous two months.</p>

<p>And at first everything had gone very well, but more recently he was not always able to get an erection. Quite obviously this was because after a couple of failures he began worrying about failing again. And like any normal heterosexual male, the more he worried the more he failed. [0:50:05.9]</p>

<p>When this was explained to him and he began to examine his own catastrophizing sentences, he quickly saw how he was defeating himself; and immediately thereafter he began to be unusually potent.</p>

<p>He later stopped seeing this particular girl, but he started an affair with a married woman who had previously had a good many lovers - none of whom proved very satisfactory to her. She found the patient exceptionally sexually satisfying, since he was able to copulate for an hour or more at a time and to maintain an erection even after he had had an orgasm.</p>

<p>At the present writing, four months after his eighteenth session, he is still coming for group therapy. He is continuing to make progress in his work, has become considerably less passive and is completely satisfied with heterosexual relations.</p>

<p>Excerpts from his eighteenth session follow. [0:51:02.0]</p>

<p>BEGIN SESSION TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again is very obvious that you are quite capable of getting an erection and maintaining - no question about that. But when you think you are not then you are not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's the thought, "I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not," which is killing you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the main thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is to concentrate on the object and not on myself. I'm not...</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. And I'm on what you are doing instead of how you are doing. This is the essence of success in almost any motor task. Because just think of a guy driving an automobile. And he starts saying to himself, "You know, am I driving this well? Am I going to hit that car over there? You know, I might get into an accident."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a pattern in my life, that's suggesting everything that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. That's the point. In dancing, the same in ice skating, everything that you can try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But how you are doing instead of what you are doing with your confidence. Both of those gone, and that kills it. Almost any motor task will fall apart at the seams. [0:52:03.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that was... You know, at least that's good to know. Good. At least I don't feel like I'm absolutely - you know, and not involved about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the only thing we can say is that maybe physiologically you have less of a tendency to get easily erect than somebody else but more of a tendency to stay erect once you are erect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Once I am erect, that - you know. And actually I have gone all night without losing an erection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well you seem pretty happy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the [hope's there] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. And that's rather phenomenal. It's very unusual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But as I say, it sometimes takes forever to get me there. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you are not getting there. You're really trying to get there. You are trying to watch yourself get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are worrying about getting there. And as you can see...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff off at 0:52:51.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More worry. And you can say, "Look. None of this shit." Back to the issue, which is look how enjoyable this thing is. Not, "Look what a great guy I'll be, you know, if I satisfy her." How enjoyable it is. [0:53:06.1]</p>

<p>I don't see any doubt whatsoever that you will remain quite potent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, well not to... I don't think it's... Even now the panic has been kind of how great she's going to think I am. At least I don't consciously think it's, "Look out." It's, you know, "Look, if you don't perform you're going to lose this whole situation." You know. And when you are already capable...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're a piece of shit if you lose it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. See, that's where the panic comes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've been working on it, really caring whether she thinks I'm the greatest lover she ever had. Because I care about her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Right.</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:53:35.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's kind of it's still the POS that's in back of it all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Wow. At least that made the biggest... You know, I feel like I'm in a big performance. And it's like, you know, a year ago...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. There's no question you are going steadily with this girl, and generally you are enjoying her. And then most of the hassles that you thought would exist have not really come to bear, I would think. [0:54:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I feel fine. And I put myself in a position often of being, you know, like forcing her to be aggressive at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And these are old tricks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you would do that even with boys unconsciously (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't think I ever felt I approached a guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except putting myself in a place, in a location where it was obvious that I was out there to be picked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So you're still up to some of your old tricks. But there has been considerable improvement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. And I'm - in fact I feel better about it. I have also been...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:54:45.0)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...a new relationship I took up a few nights ago - well not a few nights ago. Actually it was I guess the week before Christmas, during the week before Christmas.</p>

<p>I had gone to a backers' audition and had dinner and then came to my house. And we got there and... [0:55:07.9]</p>

<p>...staying with me "temporarily". And I finally told her the other day, "You know, find another apartment pretty soon."</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:55:14.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her stuff was there. And, you know, we spoke to him. And he was watching TV in the living room. And we quietly went into the bedroom and sat and talked for awhile, you know, thinking that he had to go back to his room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we can take the TV because it's a portable, and he didn't need to take that for about a half an hour.</p>

<p>And finally, you know, I mean I feel good about this. I finally got up and walked into the living room and said, "Yvette (ph), could you please come into the bedroom?" Which I don't think I would have done - been able to do a long time ago, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least I was not conscious - I think I've gotten over this. Especially the fact that he is gay and he is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. [0:56:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you worry for - to face that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think now I've gotten to the point where, you know. What other people do is their business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've got to worry about me.</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:56:14.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you doing this time? The boys concerned - do they bother you? Do you have trouble...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No really I haven't. No I really haven't. I've - I still see quite a few, of course, because I... Or, you know, people that were particularly friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, you know, maybe at one time that I had had a little sex thing but had never spoke up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've made, you know, no bones about telling them that hey, I'm interested in meeting girls. And that I, you know, that I have a girl that I am going with.</p>

<p>And for this reason I am not being bothered. It has made them nervous at Christmas, though. I wasn't invited to nearly as many Christmas parties because all of the gay ones were no longer inviting me to their parties, which is good. [0:57:03.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really glad of this, because it certainly automatically removed its own temptation, kind of, you know, being - to go to the party.</p>

<p>But there's no real problem there. You know, just by opening my mouth and saying, "I won. I've solved this." And yet, you know, they can either like me or not like me depending on their personality. But it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...not my problem as to whether they worry about what I do. And then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And as long as you keep making it...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:57:31.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...no longer available, it's like you are not going to go around being obsessed with making it with boys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And actually it - you know. It's upended. I think they really... To be perfectly honest, it was a combination that was the easiest target and habit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But one that you had to be less aggressive with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They pick you up, and they take the role. And there was nothing much to be lost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because let's face it, you know. In fact it was very funny...</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:57:59.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...boasted, you know, background. But she has a lot of friends. And she knows that I've gotten through the gay bit. And, you know, unfortunately I didn't... I'd come out and tell her, but at one point she said - she asked me, you know, especially having met some of the guys I had been with and wondering. You know, I didn't lie about it. I said, "Well it was true."</p>

<p>Anyway, the other night we were doing it one time.</p>

<p>(Recorder cutoff at 0:58:25.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It scared me. And frankly this, you know. It was, you know, petting and making love and going to the bed. And she said, "Well I don't know whether you want to." And I said, "Well why?" And she said, "I'm in my period."</p>

<p>Well frankly I had never had any experience with anybody who is in her period or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "Well does that mean you can't?" Because I didn't know, honestly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said months ago, "Usually when a woman is in her period, you know, she's hotter than at other times because of her... But it's messy." And I said, "Well." Then I started laughing. And then I said, "Well I've gotten covered with shit. Who cares about a little blood?"</p>

<p>So find and dandy. We went to bed. And frankly I found that that one was pleasurefully with visions of blood. And we would have missed that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:59:10.8]</p>

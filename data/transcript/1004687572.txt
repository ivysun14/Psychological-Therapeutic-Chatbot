<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I popped it back on after struggling for a few minutes and I was on my way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like popped it back on in the usual way so that you're done with the problem? Well good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just like the plastic thing that covers the actual bumper. This has happened before. (both chuckle) After the first time calling AAA, "Oh my God, I don't know what to do." The guy was like, "Oh yeah, this happens all the time. Here's how you fix it." (chuckles) Yeah. So there's this thing that I don't really want to talk about that I can't get it out of my mind so it might help me to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is in addition to yesterday? [00:00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't even know where to start, but . . . I don't even know how to make sense of this because there are so many pieces to it. Two weeks ago I was at this convention where apparently I didn't see this because I don't move in those circles but a guy harassed a female author, so she complained to the board. This con is well known on science fiction fan convention culture as having a really harsh, no tolerance ban policy for sexual harassment, but this guy was a big-name fan who was very popular with lots of people and ran a big convention out West and has lots of friends. Even though the board determines that yes, what he did was sexual harassment and there is a pattern of him harassing women both at this con and other cons, they decided not to ban him because he said he was sorry. So most of my friends have been talking about that, obviously, because it's really an upsetting thing. And another friend of mine works for a voluntary rape crisis center as a rape crisis counselor. There's a man who is an acquaintance, not an acquaintance of mine; I don't know him. But he's in a bigger social community who raped another member of the community and has been posting all over various people's websites and blogs about how my friend, Linda, who is the rape crisis counselor, is unprofessional and horrible because she won't counsel him, even though it is not her job because he is a perpetrator and not a survivor. Linda is also a survivor of multiple sexual assaults. She was sexually abused as a child and raped by a boyfriend, grabbed off the street in Las Vegas and, certainly very rare, but the kind of real rape people think of when you say "rape", like a stranger grabbing you across the bushes. That actually happened to her. So she is wanting nothing to do with this guy for obvious reasons. He has been harassing her and sending letters to her house and complaining about how she's unprofessional and doesn't deserve to work for (inaudible at 00:03:44) because she has refused to counsel him. It's a mess. And then, of course, a lot of my friends have been talking about that and, of course, they're all very angry about that.</p>

<p>With this kind of context, another friend of mine, who is also a published sci-fi author who is also a rape crisis counselor, his name is Pat, he was going to do a forum, which if you're not familiar is a huge, huge website. So he is going to do a forum as a promotion for his book . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't hear about it. What is it? Is it relevant? If it's not relevant [we'll just let it there] (inaudible at 00:04:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just a giant talk site on the web. It has literally millions of users, forums, sub forums, sub sub forums, where you can just talk about things. So Pat was going to a promotion for his new book but then there was this thread where some idiot was like, "Yeah, we've had so many threads from the victim's perspective and I'm really getting tired of that. I want to hear from the perpetrators. What's it like to be a rapist? Tell your story," which is just asinine to begin with. I stopped reading it eventually but in the first three days it accumulated over 100,000 comments, mainly which were actual rapists telling their story and people saying, "Oh, that's not your fault. That wasn't really rape. It was all her fault." Blah, blah, blah. It was really ugly. (chuckles) I found out about this through Pat because he made a [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:25) about how he's canceling his promotional event because he doesn't want to be associated with a site that allows glorification of rape essentially. That's how I found out about what was going on, because it's a portion of the Internet I just stay away from because it's just gross in general. All of this was happening last week and so I think it was just morbid curiosity. I clicked over and started reading comments. That was a bad idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On that thread? [00:06:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So there is this incident 10 years ago — 11 years ago — that I have a hard time actually naming it as rape, although I've been told by rape counselors that what happened to me unequivocally was rape. I don't know. I try not to think about it that much. It's in the past. Water under the bridge. Whatever. But in the course in reading these comments, there was someone who described almost exactly what my ex-boyfriend did to me. It was really eerie. I think I had a flashback. I'm not sure because I've never had a flashback before, but I really did like sensationally experience the sensations I experienced 11 years ago with Phil and now I can't stop thinking about it. I keep replaying what happened over and over and over for the last week and I want not to be thinking about it anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that happened. [00:07:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean part of it is we could talk for hours really about why I dated Phil and why I stayed with him and why I made excuses for years after what happened — "Oh, it wasn't really rape. It was just a misunderstanding." (chuckles) There are hours worth of conversation there, but what it boils down to is I can't get over the self-recrimination of why didn't I understand what was happening and why didn't I get out earlier than I did, because after what happened I kept dating him for another eight months and he got progressively more emotionally abusive and I didn't leave and in hindsight it seems so clear. I thought I had worked through all of my feelings of contempt and self-blame for not getting out of that relationship earlier and I thought I was done with that 11 years ago. Now there is a part of me saying, "My God, [ ], (inaudible at 00:08:55) why don't you just get over it already?" But for the last week I've just been wallowing in those feelings of, "What the hell was wrong with you? Why didn't you leave earlier? Why didn't you do something different? Why didn't you fight back?" and it's just . . . (sighs) (pause) [00:09:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have other references or reminder of rape that have sort of come up over the last few years stirred up any of the same feelings? And you think it's the combination of all of these conversations or mostly the thing you read, or it's hard to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to say. Well, no. I think it's mostly the blog's fault. But I think I might not have clicked over out of curiosity if it weren't for all the other stuff going on. I've had this conversation with so many people and so many different contexts about rape culture and kind of the ambient misogyny we all live with. That's why I brought up the other stuff. I think it's mostly that for the longest time I told myself, "Oh, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I didn't say 'no' loudly enough. Maybe he didn't know if I'd been stronger he would have backed off." This post I read was by someone whose user name was "Serial Rapist" and who was very proud of what they'd done and their MO was so strikingly similar to what Phil did to me, things like invite the target over late at night when she's already sleep-deprived and not making good decisions. Have your air conditioner turned really low so that she's cold so you have an excuse to put a blanket over her. Don't hang out in the lounge of your dorm. Hang out in your room where there's no couch so you have to sit on the bed. While you're watching a movie slowly slide down inch by inch and pull her down with you, so that by the end of the movie you're lying down. That was exactly what happened. It was the realization that it might not have been a mistake or a miscommunication or Phil having been ignorant about enthusiastic consent, that it might have been deliberate with intent to rape. (pause) [00:12:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that re-frames.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's that whole relationship in hindsight I was just so desperate for any kind of male attention. There's just so much context that I haven't told you that's kind of hard to know where to start. In high school I realized that I was bi. I didn't date much of anyone of any gender, but I did fool around a little bit with boys and girls in high school. Not very much. And then I converted to Christianity the spring semester of my senior year of high school. There's a whole story that goes along with that, but [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:49]) fall semester and was looking for a church to join and I met these people who were just very gregarious and outgoing and nice and fun, who invited me to join their church, and so I did. And it turns out that group was later, a couple of years later, banned from campus for being [ ] cult (inaudible at 00:14:14) and so they started in on the behavioral control and all of that. Because of that, I started experiencing a great deal of shame and self-hatred for being queer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long were you involved with that group?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long were you involved with that church?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About two years before I finally got out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And were you pretty into it? Cults are pretty in or pretty out . . . [00:14:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was really into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but because part of that, you're saying, is there is a lot of self-loathing for being queer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There was just so much pressure in that group to pair up with a suitable good, Godly, Christian man/woman/whatever was appropriate for your gender and get engaged your freshman or sophomore year and get married as soon as you graduated. That just dovetails so nicely with all of the messages I got growing up. Diet, exercise, lose weight or you'll never find a man to marry. Learn how to cook or you'll never find a man to marry, and so on and so on. At the time I was living on Campus, which is somewhat notorious at school for being the stereotypical, if you've ever watched Real Genius, for super extra nerdly nerds, so we did [shut the lane of a] (inaudible at 00:15:48]) 20-foot-long pinball machine in the courtyard of our dorm. Lots of pranks. There was the year that the Lord of the Rings came out. We put the one ring around the dome. That was us. (laughs) I'm actually quite proud of that one. D&D roll-playing games, which most of the people in my church group they didn't understand and judged me for. I felt awfully defensive of it because even as deeply into it as I was, I was like, "Come on. A card game? You're going to say this is ungodly? Seriously? It's just a fun card game for Real's guys. [00:16:30]</p>

<p>Phil was pretty much the only person who was involved in the culture who was also acceptably Christian from my church group. He ended up joining my church group. In retrospect, once I got away from that church group, I recognized there were thousands if not hundreds of Christians who were in the dorms that comprised that side of campus, who were not crazy cultish Pentecostals, who were more mainstream Christians and not so much in the "assholes for Christ" model. I didn't know that at the time and I just felt so much pressure. And here is this guy who shares my hobbies and my interests and who was interested in me and who was acceptable to my church. So I really did feel like that was my only chance to get married and live a Godly life because at the time I really did believe that you could not, as a woman, live a Godly life unless you were married to a Christian. It seems so ridiculous in hindsight, with my current understanding of scripture and theology. That's completely crazy, but I was really deep into that mindset. That's why I stayed with him even after he raped me. Even after he had lied about his sexual history. Even after he routinely would unplug my alarm causing me to miss class. I actually missed an exam once because of that. It was just . . . [00:18:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what way sense of ways did he lie about his sexual history?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before we started "courting", because he couldn't call it "dating", he said that sexual purity was very important to him and he was a virgin and he expected to marry a virgin and then I found out that he had had penetrated vaginal intercourse with two other women before me. That's not even a "technical virginity" which I think is stupid, but still some people believe that matters. That was just bald-faced lying. Yeah. (pause) [00:19:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there other things that he did? I didn't know if you were partway through the list or . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I could go on and on. Things like he would invite me over to his apartment. He was older than me. He was a super senior. He didn't graduate after four years. He was in his fifth year. My sophomore year and he had an apartment off campus. He would invite me over to play video games or to watch a movie or cook dinner and promise he would drive me back to my place afterwards. I was living in university housing but - in a co-op, so getting home by public transit was something of a chore. So he would promise me rides home and it would start to be around 10, 10:30, 11 I would say you know, "I need to go to the T if I'm going to get home." He was like, "No, no, no, I promised. I'll drive you home. Let's watch one more episode" of whatever TV show we were watching, one more round of this game. [00:21:07] And then it would get to be midnight, midnight-thirty, T would be stopped. I would have no way of getting home by public transit. I have no money to pay for a cab and he would be like, "Oh, I'm sleepy. It's not safe for me to drive." And then there would be the whole charade about, "Here, let me get you a pillow so you can sleep on the couch. Oh, the couch is lumpy. Why don't you just come lay down in my bed? I promise we'll be chaste." And then I'd wake up in the middle of the night with his fingers inside me and just . . . yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like that happened a bunch of times. [00:21:50] (long pause) I'm wondering about the extent of your denial about how predatory he was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was pretty deep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess even to some extent in the present it was really reading this post that re-framed the rape away from being involving miscommunication and being predatory.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There is that and there is the fact that he was very careful to preserve my technical virginity, in that whenever he penetrated me he used fingers or an object, but never his penis so that he could say I'm still a virgin. My logical brain knows this is wrong and that any kind of unwanted sexual contact is assault and any kind of penetration is rape, but there is part of me that says, "Well, technically if there was no penis involved was it really rape?" 00:23:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, you are pretty actively contorting your thinking away from that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I assume it's because it is really awful to think about that having happened to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And no matter which way I frame it I come back to some kind of self-talk that blames me, like either I was a stupid victim or I made really bad choices because I was stupid. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to emphasizing how terribly vulnerable you were, how much the prospect of marriage, the tension, the sort of support from your church made you willing to ignore how much you were being hurt and manipulated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I started dating him in 2001, starting about March of '02 I would attempt to break things off with him and he would try to force me into getting back together with him. Among other things, because we had been sexual I was required to marry him otherwise it would make both of us adulterers and we would both go to hell and I didn't want to condemn him to hell because I was sinful and tempted him into lust. That was one of them. Another one was I told him I loved him and promised him I would love him forever and so he was going to hold me to that and it would make me a liar and, thus, violating the ten commandments if I stopped loving him. That was another one. He can't live without me. He'll kill himself if I break up with him. That was another one. [00:27:38] And so, after one of these - this had happened three or four times - I would say, "I don't know. I don't think I want to marry you. This is really weird and I'm so young." And I was also getting increasingly more disillusioned with the church, although I hadn't left it yet. By that point I kind of had one foot out the door, so I would be like, "You know, I'm not sure I believe all this stuff you're saying about marriage, love and relationships. Maybe we should take a break," and he would do some of the most manipulative crap and after a couple of days of not taking his calls, I would get back together with him. And that might have gone on indefinitely and I might have ended up back together with him if it weren't for the fact that [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:34) that it happened. After one of these interchanges where he was like, "If you break up with me I don't think I can live. I'm going to kill myself," he even posted to his public live journal about his roommate had a bag of walnuts in the freezer and he wanted to eat them because that would kill him - he had a walnut allergy — because he was so miserable about the fact that I left him and I was so horribly unchristian and unloving and unkind and he had given me his heart and since I turned out not to be worth of it, he had no reason to go on living and he was going to go eat his walnut and then his blog and his Iam and his Zephyr and everything went quiet and people were really worried about him. They thought he had actually killed himself via walnuts. And he didn't, of course. It was an empty threat. But some of my friends heard about this and they were like, "Oh, my God. We had no idea he was such a manipulative jerk to you." So I didn't really tell people what was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then he did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But he put this on his blog and people found it. And there was like Jesus fucking Christ, Constance, this is horrible. [00:29:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People drag you by the hair away from him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is almost exactly what happened. One friend of mine had quite a lot of social gravity, who is very charismatic, lots of friends, huge social network, a whole lot of influence. She just started telling everyone she knew about the story and she over-dramatized it. So by the time she, and another friend of ours got done with the story, Phil was sitting there at the table with the bag of walnuts desperately trying to eat them but he didn't have enough strength to break open the shells, and thus were his plans shattered. It morphed into this completely, utterly ridiculous, tall tale, (laughs) but everyone knew. [00:30:41] And so when people saw Phil approaching me, like in the hallways on campus or around the Square or wherever, they would get between us. There were people who would physically push him away from me and be like, "No. You do not get to talk to her." That's what gave me enough space away from his manipulation and his guilt and coercion and whatever else was going on. I don't even know what to call it. It gave me enough space to realize Holy shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For you to stop. Does it feel this can wait til next Thursday for us to talk more about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's been a big chunk of what's been on my mind for a week. Another couple of days . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well let me know if something changes with that and we'll figure something out, by the way.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:00:08.4) my girlfriend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's going - he says - first thing he does when he walks in (inaudible at 0:00:12.8), "Hi, where's Jodie?" So funny, I could have killed him. You know, I guess he was - it wasn't, like, after a while I thought, "Well, you know, like, he probably just wants to know where she is because she's not home and don't worry." But the first initial reaction is, like - you know, like, again, there it is again creeping up. You're, like, why does he ask about her, he doesn't even tell - he doesn't even ask how I am. First thing he does when he walks in the door says, "Where is she?" 0:00:33.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you still got a lot of the old things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still have that feeling, like, I guess it's not just her, it's just, like, girls in general, I still have that feeling, like - because I know what it is but I'm still not over it, you know? Like, I know with my brother and my father, every man I ever came in contact with, feeling they're going to reject me because of what happened. And it's just, like, it's still there and I'm trying to get, you know, get rid of it but it's not as bad. I mean, it's not like before, I would, you know, go all to pieces and I'd be no good for anything. Now it's just a hurt but it's still there, you know? (Inaudible at 0:01:07.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, it takes time, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess once I faced it I can maybe get rid of it. But it's still...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:01:17.3) a pain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can go back on the waiting list and it's, like, you have really high priority on the waiting list.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think they told you that at the beginning, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think they said that if - the 20 weeks aren't enough you can go (inaudible at 0:01:33.7). But this - would this other program be stopping too or is this just this special program is stopping tomorrow (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the other one is stopping too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't know what's going to happen after that. There might - they might be starting the institute and some of the people might be going into private practice. And so, like, there's - I don't know how to say how much chance there is, but there's a possibility anyway that something could happen after that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there is an idea - in other words, I can go back on the waiting list and maybe before July I'll be back in at least for a couple of months because it might not take longer than that. It might only be another ten sessions, I don't know. But I do know that, like, I'm not quite over it and I don't know what it is. I'm just sort of, like - I'm not exactly afraid but in a way I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:02:26.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I'm afraid to be on my own right now because - partly because of the move and partly because I'm not going to have anybody there. You know, and I have my therapist at least I know (inaudible at 0:02:35.6), there's somebody there that if something happens I can come and say, you know, I don't know what happened, I don't know what I did, I don't know why I did it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, I can't talk to just a normal person and say, "You know, I did something stupid and I..." because then they look at you like, umm, okay, you know? There goes your friends out the window.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's, like, you know, Jodie had some psychology and she also had friends that were in it, so, you know, like, she could help me a little bit at least to tell me where to go if nothing else, you know? And it's, like, with nobody around - and, you know, like, starting out on my own I need something, you know. And I also need to get the rest of the stuff out so that I can be my own person, you know, and it's not quite gone and I know it. So as far as I've come, I feel like, you know, like, it's not quite as bad because, like, there was even times even when I first started therapy that I thought of suicide. Before it I was, like, a complete wreck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kept saying, "Why do I do these stupid things?" You know, "Why, I can't understand it," you know? I know I'm hurting and I don't understand what's going on, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand a little more, it's, like, a complete rejection. It's, like, I don't know, you know, it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, I think you've changed a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I've come a long, long way but I'm not - I don't want to - see, I don't want to leave it right here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because it's, like, there's still a little ways to go. Maybe there's something else that's pretty big that hasn't come out yet, you know? And it's, like, I don't want to leave it with that in mind. But maybe - well, maybe it sounds - maybe it sounds selfish but I feel, like, now I'm pretty happy. You know, I'm not - I can't say always happy. There's lots of times that I still have depressed states and that. But I suppose even what I'm completely cured I'll have some of those, you know? But it's, like, I am so afraid that, like, I'm going to either regress or whatever because it's not a real true, you know, feeling. I don't know what it is, maybe it's just - maybe I'm must scared. 0:04:25.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I don't know so I think, you know, the best thing for me maybe would be to get back into the program, even if it's just for ten, you know, sessions or two months or whatever, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I can do that and I can give you names of other places too. And also I'd like you to feel like in the meantime or any time that you can call me if you need something. If you need help or if you need somewhere else to go or, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, like, yeah, it's just like a feeling like I'm not quite there and I'm scared stiff, you know, like, all of a sudden there's not going to be anybody there if I did need somebody. What the heck would I do, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, like, it's really something because I guess partly because, like, I've always had somebody. Like, the other day I thought about, you know, kids that never had anybody who cared, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, I've had so many people and lots of times, like, I've done things to turn them off and I know it. Like my own brother, there were things, like, I rejected him for Andy and things like this before he rejected me really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's, like - but still, I think in some way he still loves me, there is something there, you know? And it's, like, my mother, you know, all the times, like, I've been to her and she still loves me, you know? And it's, like, - it's, like, a nice feeling in a way to realize, you know, like, that there are people around that really do care but in another way, you feel like, oh, wow, you know, (inaudible at 0:05:52.9), which I would have cared if I were in the other situation, you know, because of the way I had acted lots of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:05:59.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's just - you know, it's, like, I can't really go to them. First of all, I wouldn't want to, you know, because I don't feel like it's their - you know, they've done enough, you know? It's, like, I don't want them to have to be burdened with my problems and all that baloney again because it's not right for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at any rate, that's my conclusion, I think I need more - aside from that, I don't know, like, things are happening and they're funny, like, I'm getting a couple of fellows that I've never - I've never had three fellows at one time wanting to date me and all of a sudden I have. You know, I'm going, what the heck is going on here? Matter of fact, there's another one, there's two more but, like, I - they don't have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute, I'm still (inaudible at 0:06:42.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm still stuck on Christian, I wonder - if I were you I would be feeling a little, I don't know what. I would like to say I didn't (inaudible at 0:06:55.5) know. I don't know, like, maybe a little abandoned or something, something like that. And I just wondered if, like, any of that fits for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was my initial reaction last week. Oh, Jesus, you know, it was partly because it was so sudden. I had thought - I had misunderstood something you said before about taking me through. And I thought that I had been already through 20 weeks before. And I thought, "Well, good, you know, like, maybe she'll take me along until I am finished." And, like, you know, whatever - maybe the program stopped or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the way it was. And this is why it shocked me and I thought, "Oh, Jesus, you know, here I am, what's going on?" And it was like a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like the floor dropped out from...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I felt when I walked out, but, like, I don't feel - in fact, I started thinking about it during the week. And I'm thinking to myself, "Well, maybe a lapse would be good of a month or two as long as it's not real long." It might be good for me to have to stand on my own two feet, and to have to, you know, to find out just where I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, try it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then if I still really need it then I can always go back. You know, I could get back and I would - this would be a good feeling for me that I wouldn't feel like now - everybody says, "Okay, you know, computer number 605, you're through, go," you know? And it's, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, we're trying not to do that. I mean, I feel really in a bind because it's - there's the research and then there's my obligation to you, you know, which under any other conditions I would feel like, you know, I really wanted to - well, I mean, I don't especially always believe in this 20 session time limit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I also believe in the research and, like, it's really hard to do that without, you know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have to go along with the format, you know, I can understand that. You know, it's, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very funny because I didn't feel like a personal rejection like I usually would have. You know, I would think, "She doesn't care," you know, and that would be, like, the first reaction. But, like, it's, like, I understand, you know, like, things like that has to be. You know, it's, like, I'm sad because, like, I figure, what am I going to do if I have problems, you know? Like, there's nobody there that would really help me. You know, Jodie can help to a certain point but she's not trained. You know, and then, like, who else, you know? And I can go to Chrissie too in a certain way because I have already confided in her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's not like you have nobody, but you don't have one person who you can do - you can just sort of lay all of your stuff on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I find, like, with Lee has got a big problem with this guy at work and she comes out, and after a while, you know, it's, like, we're friends and that's your - you know, psychoanalyst or psychoanalyst, and after a while you just like to say, "Look, if you don't like the guy, fire him, get the office, do something. Just don't bug me about this guy."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't want to do that to anybody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, this is - like, I feel like is somebody who's not trained and somebody who I'm not going to help for. I mean, you know, like, they can't help me, you know? And so why should I go to them and burden them with all my problems? And why should I make them listen to it, it's not fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:09:58.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, not to a friend, you wouldn't do that. So, you know, I just - I understand it, though, and, like, I think, you know, like, if I can get back in on a program where - even like I said, even if it's only another ten sessions, it might do it. Because Jodie says I - she thinks I need another year but I think she's full of baloney because of the way I've come in 20 weeks. I don't think it's going to take that long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think that's not necessarily true that you need a long time. I mean, you have to find out what it is for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well see, part of it is she says I don't show emotion, well, this is very true. And she says, you know, like, I keep things inside, which I used to do very much so. Now I don't keep things inside but I don't share them. You know, like, I'll go and cry by myself. I won't go and say, oh, this and that. She would go to her mother and they had a real close rapport. I can't do that, you know, with my mother because I've already told her, you know, and she thinks, "Oh, my God, you know." First thing I see in her face, "What did I do wrong?" You know, so I think, "Oh, Christ, if I only told her, you know, like, all the things." I'd be doing like I did that one day when I just, you know, like, (inaudible at 0:11:06.4) my grandfather, how is my father (inaudible at 0:11:09.3), tell me, tell me, tell me, you know, help me out, you know, like, and she couldn't because it was what I reacted to. It wasn't what actually happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think you show a lot of emotion. You know, you've really changed in that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's been happening for a while.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel like I can get emotion - like, since they left, it was (inaudible at 0:11:29.7) because, like, he was like - he is like my grandfather. Even (inaudible at 0:11:32.0) we know, you know, you love your grandfather, here you're going again on this and (inaudible at 0:11:37.3) say we know, you know. Because they do, they have very much insight into people and I had told them a little bit, you know, like, a little smidgen but not, like, telling them my problems, you know? Just a little background and he guessed, he had guessed that I was going to therapy because I come out with needs and wants and different people, and the way (inaudible at 0:11:53.0), you know? She's either a psyche major or she's going, you know, one of the two. And it's so funny, but, like, you know, when (inaudible at 0:12:02.0) left it was so cute because he called me his "little girl from New York," which was so cute. 0:12:06.2</p>

<p>"I have to leave my little girl from New York." And when I said goodbye to him we both had tears in our eyes, you know, because it was, like, there was really, like, an emotional bond that's starting. And it's, like - it's not like - I don't think it's a sick thing, I really don't. I think it's one of the most well things I've had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a long time. It's not like - and I don't feel possessive towards him. You know, he doesn't pay attention to me, well, so what, he's still there and I can pay attention to him whether he does or not, you know, I don't care, you know? But it's, like - oh, it's such a beautiful relationship that's starting to grow. I really miss him now that he's gone. But, like, I'm not dying without him either, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I miss him in the (inaudible at 0:12:39.5) and I miss him, you know, because sometimes afterwards we'd talk and that. But he's just a very beautiful man and I'm very glad I came in contact with, you know. And you just - I don't know, he's so loving, it's very beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he doesn't come out with all these (inaudible at 0:12:54.7), like, he doesn't come out, like, "I'm super intellect or I'm super this or super holy" or anything like this. He just says - because I said, "Well, I'm not intellectual either (inaudible at 0:13:05.1) like with my friends." And they said, you know, "This is the intellectual group." I said, "No, no, no, I'm just a bystander." He said, "Well, that's okay." He says, "I'm one too so come over and join the crowd." You know, but it's just a beautiful thing because he is very wise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In many ways in some of the things that he comes out with. And he hits the basic of life right on the head, you know? It's not, like, all this flowery stuff where I can memorize from a book and loud (ph) all these (inaudible at 0:13:27.4). He just comes out with some of the, you know, like, basic beautiful truths and it's so - he's such a beautiful person, you know, that I really have a love for that man. And it's really - I'm really glad I got into this because of him, you know? But again, you know, there's still some problems there that have to come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, I feel like I've seen you make some really fundamental changes, the things that are really basic to living. And I think that that's really solid in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that you're really strong in that. That's not to deny that you - you know, you feel like you need more but I think the changes you have made are really solid and fundamental.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I agree with that. Part of the reason I do is, like, last week I came out and I had met Dr. Kibler who's an osteopath, and I thought to myself, "I'd really like to be an osteopath." You know, like, I never thought before, you know, I say, "Well, maybe I'll go into nursing or maybe I'll go into this or maybe I'll going into that, or maybe I'll do - maybe I won't do anything, I'll just stay with what I am." You know, and, like, now it's, like, I'm starting to make solid plans for the future, which I never did before. 0:14:38.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I'm going to get my shorthand up so in case I have to change jobs right immediately - you know, immediate future, can take bookkeeping or beginning accounting. So I've got that too in case, you know, the depression gets worse that there's all - you know, you've got all this skill, you can probably put it to use more until you can, you know, through. And then I'm thinking, "No, maybe not being an osteopath." I have a thing like I want to help people, but I'm also good at writing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I think what I'll probably end up doing is going into writing. And, you know, I take my first two years at Ryder, like I was thinking of doing. But, you know, like, I was thinking what after that? I don't know, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now I'll probably go to NYU because they've got a good journalism. So then I - I'm pretty well planning on something that's solid, like, that some things in the future, like, I never though five years from now, what would I be? I don't know. You know, it's, like, I had no - at one time I wanted to be a nurse and I wanted to go through nursing school and teach nursing. But then, like, I guess maybe I see sickness for what it is in most cases. You know, it's, like, somebody saying, "Help," they don't want help physically, they want it in other ways, you know, like love or whatever. And it's, like, that's why they get sick, you know? They make themselves sick. And so I say to myself, "How can I take care of these people's bodies when, like - you know, if you can reach them on another level, like, if I made stories. The stories I write are very emotional, you know, usually, sometimes they're just flippant and little funny things. But, like, it's like - like with Jim, I wrote that story on Jim and it was, like, the emotional thing, like, he came back and he was so dehumanized and things like this, you know? 0:16:09.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just killed me to see him like that or anybody, you know? So this story brought that out. You know, my own views that are stuck in between the lines, you know, that they were very, you know, blatant, you couldn't very, you know, oversee them. You would have to see them, they were right there plain. But I guess that's - you know, that's one of the reasons I would like to write to help people that way. So that's something pretty solid with me now too, and like I said before, I never had any real - I said I do this and I do that. Maybe I should get educated so I should do this and I should - you know, but, like, nothing - partly, it wasn't even my own idea. Partly, it was Jodie's, you know, "You have to do this and you have to travel and you have to do this and..."</p>

<p>She says, "Find yourself in Rome." I want to go to a ranch town in North Dakota in summer for a week, you know, like, to me being with nature - you know, like, I don't have to be Rome, Paris and London, whatever, it doesn't have to be some place like that. All it has to be is away from, like, lots of cars running around and all the noise and all the pollution or at least most of it, and just get out, you know, get out to the country. And that's where I feel like I'm, you know, really at home, you know? And, like, she has to be by water, I don't have to be by water. All I have to be is out in the air, out in the fresh country type air and I'm fine. 0:17:30.3</p>

<p>You know, so, like, it's really funny how, like, sometimes I'm getting to be very - in some ways I'm getting to be very independent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's still that thing with fellows that still is not over with. And I don't know whether it's still, like, maybe just the scar tissue left from the hurt or whether it's that I really - it really, I know - but we were talking about this last night, to know when to see her, you know, like two different things. Like, I see it, I know I see a volcano. Something happened with my father, I mean, my mother tried to keep me away from my father so I can see that. And my step mother - you know, I went, like, in a - you know, a long spiral thing. It's, like - but I'm thinking to myself, "Is there something more?" Is it something in me, like, still like an inadequacy feeling or inadequate feeling that maybe there's something missing in me that really men - you know, like, I can't really explain it. Like, it's almost like that there's something missing in me that makes it impossible for somebody, like a fellow to really like me best.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, not so much the idea that, well, I can't help it because every girl that comes along tries to take a fellow away from me, you know? But a girl could not take a fellow away from me unless there was something initially lacking in the girl, that's the way I kind of see now. And so I'm wondering to myself where did I get this feeling of - in the first place, being so inadequate that just anybody could come by and take, like - like, my mother could take my father. And another little girl who just met my brother could take my brother, you know, things like this. And I often wonder, like, now what's there that I felt like I was missing, you know? And so I think the only way I'm going to find it is get down way to a root, that there is something (inaudible at 0:19:08.3). Maybe not one thing but, like, many things that I haven't reached in that line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except for the fact that I always ended up coming up second best, you know. And maybe that trails through too, is a feeling of second best so it went over with men too, I always felt second best. So therefore, no fellow could like me best because I was second best.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not just that second best you're saying, but that, like, is something in you or something wrong with you, something that's sort of basically...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unlovable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can't keep a fellow. But it seems funny now and I can't understand it. Just all of a sudden, you know, in the last month of two I've met people and, like, fellows and they've been asking me out. And, like, I could go - I'd be going out - I could be going out with five fellows now. But now, I never had this at the same time, like, five fellows and, like, they're not rum-dums (ph). At one time that's what I would, you know, attract, like real rum-dums (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, Judah is going for - well, he's a running instructor. And (inaudible at 0:20:04.9) so funny, every time I end up - I always end up teaching. You know, he says every time I get into something, I end up teaching it. I don't know how but, you know, he's just like a natural born teacher.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's hard to believe that they could really like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I said that last night to myself, I said, "Wow, you know, here I am just a high school grad, and I don't have - you know, I've read a little bit but I'm not really what you call educated." You know, in fact (inaudible at 0:20:24.6) the opposite. But, like, he'd say - like, I was talking and I was actually making I felt like pretty good headway in getting fairly deep into a conversation. And feeling like he actually did - could care for me, and here's this guy working for his masters, I don't know, something about history or something. And here I'm dating this other guy too who's a philosophy - going for his PhD in philosophy. I'm going what the hell, you know, how do I get these fellows all of a sudden, and I could never get anybody that was worth a hill of beans at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:20:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, they were just, like, rejects to society type, they were really nothing there mostly. There was a few that were okay, but usually they were pretty. I just can't understand that, you know, like, all of a sudden - and all of a sudden, like, my friend, Jim, is bringing me presents and I never had that happen before. And I guess the only thing I can chalk it up to I think is because I'm stopping to think - I've stopped thinking mostly about myself and how other people will react mostly. Like, I still come out with sometimes, like, maybe so and so didn't like this because I wasn't - or maybe if they meet so and so and they like her better it's because I'm not, you know, good enough. But, like, basically, I said to myself, like, "Maybe it's because now you're more interested in the other person." And maybe, like, maybe lots of girls aren't interested in a fellow, really interested in what they're doing and really concerned about them to the point where usually they reciprocate, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, with Jim I'm saying, "Look, you know, I can see that you need help and you need this, and I can see this thing, like, but why don't you look inside, you know, and see why everything is always so pessimistic around you." You know, "Because if everything is bad, then why don't you come to the conclusion that it's something you feel about yourself, you know, because if you felt good about yourself you could see the good in life too," but he can't. Everything is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you it's, like, you've really climbed out of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's sort of what it is. Yeah, well, that's another thing, I could never get feedback and I can do that now. Like, you know, I would sit and I thought about something and then I'd sit back and I'd say, "Ah-ha, everybody likes that." And now I can look and I can tell from an expression or from a comeback or whatever that you didn't phrase this right or that there was something there, or be careful because you're spouting or whatever, you know? And, like, you can sort of feel it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then if you said something that was taken wrong, you can always explain, "Now what I meant was this," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and before you were only caught up in something total, like, all of a sudden people would be going away from you and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I couldn't understand it. 0:22:56.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were being rejected and that's all there was, and now you can see sort of the fine details of the way people interact with each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's true. I felt, like, a big rejection all the time, and now I see that - well, partly that again, it wasn't - I used to always blame people, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I have a problem it's because she did it to me or he did it to me, you know? And, like, now, like, I realize that, like, most of it's - well, most of my hurt at any rate was my fault. I can't say most of the things that some people - there is just some people who would walk all over anybody, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you let them. But, you know, generally speaking, like, there were lots of really good people that came into my life, you know, as far as friends go. And I can remember rejecting them. Maybe not coming right out but it was because I was so selfish, you know, like, I wanted for me. And if somebody wanted to do for me, fine, but I wasn't going to turn around and do for you. I wouldn't put myself out for you at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it ends up that people are going to act that way, you know? Like, now, like, Will at work - this black girl got me this camera that I could use, she bought the film, she bought the flashbulbs and all this. I'm not saying, like, this is now I can say now look, somebody did something for me, that means I'm - you know, I'm just saying, like, this is something that I would never expect any - because I just mentioned it to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, "Oh, I'm trying to get in touch with this fellow who lives right next door to us and - you know, to get his camera. And then I would go out and get all this stuff and just borrow it for a couple of hours and bring it back." She said, "Ahh, don't do that, I'll bring it to (inaudible at 0:24:19.7)." So she gets all this stuff and writes these big directions down. You know, like, partly from the book and partly from her own experience on how to take pictures right and the whole bit with the thing. And she went out and bought all the stuff for it. So, you know, like, I took her out, I was going to take her out for the show but she already paid for it. And then we got mixed up, you know, by the time I met her she was in already so I just took her out for a drink, her and her and another girlfriend, I took them out for a drink. But it was, like - you know, it was like a really beautiful thing that people can do that.</p>

<p>And, like, again, I don't feel like - like, I could have gone out for a free dinner with my boss. And I could have gotten another hour overtime. You know, I'm weighing this against what I did do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, I said, "Hell with you." You know, like, I said I'd take her out and I want to take her out. And it was, like, not feeling like (inaudible at 0:25:00.0) just say it but feeling like, look, this is where I want to be even though I wouldn't mind having a nice free dinner and, you know, not having to pay for it because the budget's getting tight. You know, like, so what, you know? And, like, at one time I wouldn't feel that way, say, "Oh, well, this is better for Jane so, you know, Jane stays here." Say, "Oh, I'm terribly sorry but I can't do it tonight," you know, and the whole, you know, bit that I would go through. But I don't know, it's, like, I feel like I've come a long way but there's still that thing, and it's still that one basic thing that I came in for that doesn't seem like it's quite out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just that - like, with people in general, like, if I'm with lots of people - like, when I'm with Chrissie and, like, and the people from the (inaudible at 0:25:41.5), I don't have any problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:25:43.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partly because there is - again, like, there's not girl there who's really in competition. Most of the girls are either married or if there is a single - well, it's very funny because, like, I think there's Chrissie and then there's another girl that usually goes and they're both married. So maybe this is part of it, you know, like, they're not in competition as such for fellows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and where other girls - like, lots of girls want to get married. So, like, definitely, you know, any man that comes by, "Oh, he's not married, good," you know, and they try to put the claws in him. And if you happen to be with the guy, you know, like, ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think you're right. I mean, things do happen differently in different situations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you have to kind of sit down and say well, now why is it in this situation I'm this way, and in this one I'm this way? And that seems like an important change in itself for you because it's not just you anymore. And you can see that some ways - it happens in some ways with certain kinds of people and, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and people in different situations. Like, it's very funny because, like, I never really put it into words before. I realize, you know, like in the (inaudible at 0:26:43.9) I was one way and here (ph) is something else. But even though, like, with that one girl with Ned when I liked him, it didn't bother me. All I thought was, "Oh, you poor girl, you're such an idiot to do that." Because I mean, it wasn't the idea she came up and asked him, it was just, "Oh, would you help me." I thought, "Oh, Chri..." you know, and any dumbbell in, you know, like, third grade would see that this girl was trying to make a play for him, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, he did too. It was a funny thing because, like, he came back after five minutes going, (inaudible at 0:27:10.4), you know? But it's really funny that, like, I don't consider them, like, a big threat like I do maybe somebody - well, partly because I feel again inferior to someone who's very much ahead of me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, and suddenly - I'm sort of stuck on where's the main thing for you now that seems to be the thing that's hurting you the most? What is that and how does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, part of it is I think it's an idea of being - when I'm with somebody who is very - like a girl who is very, very feminine and, like, I don't really even mind the idea that most of the fellows dig her. But it's the idea that a fellow I dig digs her, it bugs me, you know, it's, like, I feel again, like, okay, so there are some girls, there's just a real attraction. But partially, that attraction, and I realize it now is temporary. You know, like, the girl is there and she's very feminine so a fellow really enjoys being with that girl. But when the night is over he doesn't want to be with that girl anymore. He wants to be with the girl he really dug for a long time and he really cares about.</p>

<p>However, after a fellow has done that it's, like, for him rejecting me, that's the way I feel. He's rejecting me and now because she's gone or because she's maybe surrounded by too many fellows so he can't get to her, then he'll come back to me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're second best?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when I'm with somebody who is very feminine or with somebody who is very - even very learned, you know, someone who is really up above me, I feel - I start to feel myself getting, you know, like, insecure again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:28:51.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because they're so different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, rather than just saying they're different. You know, they're different from me, they do their thing and I do my thing. I think - you know, right away I think (inaudible at 0:29:02.3) I'm worse. You know, I put it on best in, you know, that scale again, which is not good but I still do it and I know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And with a guy it's just, like, you're really afraid of losing him, is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, even though it's very funny, like, I can have, like, lots of boyfriends or I can go out with three or four fellows at the same time and I don't care, but I don't like - like, I don't like - I wouldn't say anything, like, you know, like, "I can't go out with you tonight because I'm going out with so and so," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, I've been with a fellow - I used to go out with a fellow quite a bit that used to do this. He'd talk about the senior prom and took this other girl to it. He must have told me about it 20 times. I (inaudible at 0:29:38.3) say, "Look, if you still dig the girl so why don't you go back and marry her." You know, because it just got to me, you know, like, I don't like that. I don't like being out with a fellow who talks about some other girl that he dated, I mean, like an obsession.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and, like - and I don't like friends who (inaudible at 0:29:53.4) like with Jim, like, five times in one night he asked about her and he said this about her and he said, oh, like something like, "Do you know any German restaurants up north?" Because I like German food and I want to practice my German. I said, "Well, I don't know but I can..." he said, "Well, that's right, you can ask Jodie, she'll know." You know, and it's, like, saying now wait a minute, you know, are you trying to tell me I have some kind of a - you know, like, a dummy or that I don't know anything just because, like, I haven't been around as much? This is the way I feel. 0:30:20.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's again, like, a little knife pricking, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So and so is better than you are because she, you know, knows this and she does that, you know? And, like, "Does she like the picture I gave you?" I was (inaudible at 0:30:30.8) say, "Well, what the hell do you care whether she likes it or not, it's going in my apartment not hers?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and the same thing over again. You know, it's, like, "Ask her, ask her."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you're just really sensitive to anything that comes up that could possibly be comparing you with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that's what happens, you know? It is almost a comparison. And, like, I don't like that idea. I don't like to be compared with somebody. Maybe that's why I'll be very glad to be out on my own and I won't have to have a roommate. And whether she's not as pretty or she's as pretty or she's prettier or she's sexier or she's not sexy, I don't want it because I don't like the idea of being in the other shoe either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've been in that situation.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:31:09.2) right, I mean, the more you have a sense or your own self and your own independence, the better you're going to feel about that and the less uptight you're going to get when you're compared with other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you'll feel like you're really okay, and if you're not then you do something about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, or whatever area that needs improving. But, yeah, I do think lots of it is a pressure. Even Jodie admits it's pretty much of a pressure to live with someone who is so much, you know, ahead of you in so many ways, you know, that here you sit, you know, like, how can you possibly come out on top or even, even in any way? Because, like, everything you try she's done and she's better at it.</p>

<p>COUNSLEOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not only that but she's a lot older than you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this is another thing too. And, like, again, like, with fellows she has a way of being able to - well, partly she's a wit, which I am not. And then when I try to be one it comes out ridiculous. But, you know, partly it's, like, she is the type of person that likes attention, likes to be the center and she can hold the center of attention for a long amount of time and be interesting. I find myself, unless I get into a serious discussion, I can't. You know, but she can be flippy and, you know, throw the remarks back and forth and the whole bit and keep going like that all night long. I can't, you know, like, I'll throw in maybe a couple of kind of creative things maybe, you know, like, but that's it. You know, and then I'm out, I would rather talk seriously. But, you know, most of the time you don't want to when you're with fellows. And so, you know, that's where I sort of end up sitting out by myself, and sometimes it's because I want to because I just - you know, I can't get into this. I just think, "Okay, you know, stop the bullshit and start into something that I can talk about," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know, it's just - it's a funny situation to be where I am because, like, I think I'm - you know, like, not on a brink of something, you know, fantastic but, like, almost to a point where I'm independent but not quite, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's still something there when I'm not feeling like I can really make it on my own completely, and I don't have to worry, you know, and I'm fine now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, what is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is left over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's still that feeling I think sometimes, it doesn't creep in very often but it's still that feeling, like, when I'm with her I don't like to spend any time with her except if we're just by ourselves, then we have fun. Or maybe sometimes when Eliza is there, sometimes no, you know, because if there's fellows around. Because it's so funny because I see the two of them doing the exact same thing they accuse me of doing. You know, like, one fellow good, which one of us is going to attract him? Funny as hell, you know, like, because I don't do that that much anymore. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is it, like feeling just sort of shaky because you think you might have to be like somebody else or what is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like the comparison. 0:33:57.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of myself with someone else. And actually, like, what (inaudible at 0:34:02.8) would try to tell you who is - so what? You know, so somebody compares you. He says they can compare - when I think about it, you know, and he didn't say this but I'm thinking about, like, he was in about six different businesses. Every one of his businesses bombed. If he compared himself to somebody else in that business he would have been really in trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, could say, "Look, I've got as much intelligence as this guy, how come he's making it, I'm not?" Because you're not suited for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that's not your thing. Teaching is your thing so that's what you should be in because he's a fantastic teacher.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And as far as aikido goes, there probably isn't a better one in the United States as far as I'm concerned because I've seen some of the other fellows teach, and they're good at technique and they're good at this, but they don't have what he's got, that serenity, the love, the real power of mind that, like, most of them don't have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so it's just, like - I guess what I feel is, like, if I find my own way, like, okay, she does this in writing but she hasn't done any in a while, and most of hers was poetry and a speech that she wrote, you know, was the big thing. But as far as writing short stories she doesn't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So this is actually an area I can go into, and even if I see her two or three years from now when she comes back, it's, like, I will then be starting probably to write for Jame's newspaper, some of the articles for his newspaper. And so I'll be doing something, and it will be something that I do that she doesn't do, not so much because I can do something better than her, but just that I can do something that she doesn't do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:35:27.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's into one area, I can come and talk to her and say look at the story I wrote, I did this. And, you know, like, something happened for me and then she could say well, I've done this in aerobics and I've done this is TP (ph), and I've done this, you know, like, whatever. And there's something there that I can say - partly that I can say - partly I think what it is, is to be able to say something is really mine that I can give. Like, I can give and be nice and things like this, you know? But I feel like I really want to be something that I can - or not even say be something, have something that I can say is really mine, that's me that I can give.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I don't feel like right now there is enough to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially in comparison...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, comparison to someone like her, in comparison to my other friends, you know, like, they've had six years of college and I think Jame's got two or thee degrees. And, like, they say to me - you know, like, "So what, we talk to you, we don't get technical in our fields with you because you don't understand it, but we can talk to you and we can present ideas, " and these types of thing and we can all present ideas. And I said well, yeah, it's, like - see, with them I don't feel in competition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't throw it up to you (inaudible at 0:36:29.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's not like - I know probably Jodie's trying to do this to get me into college, to get me educated, but I don't need that motivation anymore. I know what I need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I can see it very subtly by finding it hard sometimes to follow in a conversation that gets deep, or listening to something that's kind of interesting that I think I would really like to read about or like to study about, you know? And so it's, like, to me it's, like, I am already motivated, I don't need somebody to tell me I'm ignorant and that I've got to get to college, and I've got to do this and I've got to that, you know? I have already thought of these things, you know? And it's, like, I don't need that anymore. And it bugs me that it's put in a such a way that, you know, like, you have to do it because you're dumb and you're this and you're that, you know, and all (inaudible at 0:37:14.9), you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Leave me alone...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it gets - like, it crumbles at the edges when she starts poking at you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and it's the same thing when I went into running, she still does this, you know? It's, like, "Oh, I really like running because it's mine." We have the same thing in aerobics, but (inaudible at 0:37:32.7) it's not competitive, no, it's not, you know? And I know I was there, it's competitive already, you know? And it's, like - she said, "Well, that all depends on who brings it in." You know, like, saying you're competitive - she's as competitive. And when you're that competitive in life, you're competitive in the (inaudible at0:37:48.5) and I don't care what any - when she tries to say she's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to take away from your sense of what you need to work on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:37:56.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is a thing about - like, the hardest people to get out of your hang-ups with are the ones that you were with when you had them. And they...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They sort of come back. It's, like, everybody I know has the experience of going home to their parents and being thrown back into all the old hang-ups.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's the same thing with Jodie I think, that's it's really especially hard for you to break out of your thing (ph) with her because she was such a big part of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true, that's very true and it's, like - you know, and, like, I know exactly (inaudible at 0:38:31.5). I know exactly, like, the feeling because, like, I try to explain something to her and the first thing she says is, "Well, you've come away," you know, like, I'll say, "I feel like I've come a long way." Well, like, first of all, she sees me, like, maybe once a weekend, you know, because, like, we say good morning in the morning and we say good-bye at night and that's about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, I'm sorry, like, bye in the morning and, you know, sometimes at night she's sleeping. In fact, most of the time so how does she know me? You know, how does she know how Jane thinks? Because she doesn't see me that much anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I sit there and I try to explain something to her - (inaudible at 0:39:10.2) couldn't have done that just - I try to explain something to her, like, I say, you know, like, "I feel like I've really come a long way and, like, maybe I only need ten more weeks" or something. First thing she says, "Oh, no, you're going to need about another year, a year and a half."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And stay in - stay in - like, to me it's like saying I won't be here, in a way it's nice, I won't be here so you need somebody to take care of you, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is way it comes across to me. And I keep trying to say, "But, Jodie, I'd like just for once in my life to take care of me myself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and if I need some help...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like she's forcing you back into having her take care of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That and the idea, like, maybe you're not ready yet, you think you're happy but it's going - you know, like, a hole is going to fall in it and you're not ready yet, and you're still hung up in a bad way, and you haven't come very far. She hasn't even seen me with fellows in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So as far as that hang-up goes, she doesn't even know I have it, you know? So I can't - I (inaudible at 0:40:08.4) to myself and I say, "Well, then why - why does she keep saying, like, it's going to take so long?" I don't feel like I need that much more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like she keeps sitting on the bad things rather than seeing how far you've come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, she said that passing when I said, "Look, I feel like I've come a far way." She says, "Well, you've come pretty far but you've got a lot further to go because you always repressed your feelings," and you did this and you did that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:40:30.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's, like, maybe I don't get real emotional with her. Like, that one time we had that disagreement and, like, I just - I turned off and I realize now why I do it, it's partially a defense but mostly, it's something that - because of how sensitive I am and I always have been, although I didn't show it. And that is that when you say something to me, I'll remember it ten years later, you know? So it's, like, being that way for myself, I'm very careful what I see to somebody else because I know you can't take something back in anger. Like, with Jodie I never know where I'm standing because every time she gets mad at me she says, "Friendship is over, you've got to be out by next week," and things like this. Or, you know, like, "Go ahead and do what you want, I don't care about you. And maybe next time you have a friend." And, (inaudible at 0:41:15.5) okay, so I slighted (ph) the friendship, I'm sorry, you know, what can I do? But it's not like you can do anything, you know? You know, at that moment, that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So rather than coming back and saying, look, you know, what's the bit? Okay, so I'm sorry, you know, I did hurt you, okay, I'm sorry you feel that way and then try to explain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My feelings, the first thing I do is say uh, you know, and I still go into, like, a shell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's another thing I'd like to get out of. I'd like to get to the point where I would be secure enough that I wouldn't care if that person would decide, you know, like, that's it. But I would come back and tell them the way I felt about something and maybe what it might do is to save a lot of pain because then, you know, like, I don't have to wait until they get more upset and everything before they subside, you know?</p>

<p>But it's, like, that's the first thing I can think of, like, if I say the wrong thing, then I try to figure out, now how should I say it to her so that she understands, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:42:13.8) with that with anybody besides Jodie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually not so much, usually when I have something - you know, somebody else around it's, like, I can see a need and I try and fill it. Like, with Chrissie, when I see that James is paying too much attention to me, I try to fill that need by getting her into the conversation or focusing the, you know, point on her. Like, I'm stopping - Jodie did give me a good idea not to go out with them, just the two of them because maybe once a month or something, have them over for dinner or something. But now I always make sure if I do go out with them there's another fellow for me. 0:42:44.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So to speak, you know, like, we all end up interacting. But it's, like, then she doesn't feel like one fellow, two girls, you know? So that's one thing I tried to do because I really dig them as people, so what so they're married? You know, Jodie says, "You don't have anything in common with a married person." And I said, "These - first of all, they don't have kids." So that's a big difference too. And they're very independent people, one's a painter, the other one's a writer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, after they've done their painting and their writing, they get together and they talk about it, you know? And they go out and they - running is the only thing they do together, that's all. The rest of the things, they have their own things. She'll have a class, he'll have a class. He goes to work someplace, she goes to work someplace and does something completely different, you know? And so to me it's almost, like - it sounds funny but it's almost like two people just shacking up together, you know? They've got a real love there but it's not like a binding thing, like, aah, I got my claws on you and you got your claws on me and I'm insecure. And not - well, everybody is to a certain extent but it's not like typical married, you know, couple who has their suburban house and the whole baloney, you know. But - so I can't see anything wrong with hanging around with these people just because they're married. 0:43:56.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, like, Jodie says I can't spend that much time with married people, you know, that's not right, we don't have anything in common with them. I said, "Oh yeah, I didn't know you became a freak if you got married." You know, all of a sudden you're not human anymore, folks, you're under a different category. I mean, it's stupid. But anyway, that's the way I feel and I don't feel that way with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't. I don't feel like I have to - first of all, I don't feel like I have to compete. And I don't feel like I have to be - I can't really even explain, like, I don't feel like I have to have a lot of attention even from James. Usually with fellows, that's the way it would be if there was some competitive girl around, or even somebody who was just feminine, you know? Like, that's the way it would be. And Chrissie's feminine, you know, she's got fellows talk to her a lot too, but they talk to me too, maybe that's part of it because we're almost equal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, in the area of femininity we're almost equal. Like, we both attract a certain amount of fellows and a certain, you know, proportion, not everybody, we don't walk into the (inaudible at 0:44:56.5) and all the guys go, ahh, Chrissie and Jane are here, you know, like, the world has come to an end or something. But we still get enough people that we can, you know, really enjoy each other and fellows and not feel like he's paying more attention to me, and this one's paying more attention to her. And I'm jealous because, you know, all of this bull, which is a bunch of bull. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's feels comfortable, and sort of like you're getting what you need?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the only thing - you know, one thing I think I need, though, is I need to get - and I haven't felt this way, like, in six months. I used to have crushes, you know, on fellows, like, every week I was madly in love with somebody else, you know. And then they would - then I would see them, like, say, this fellow in the office and they'd be talking to somebody else, and I'd be crushed, you know? Like, he doesn't like me and all of this baloney. But, like, now I don't have that feeling. There are people that I kind of dig being with, like, I like Christian already, he's a very sweet, nice guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But not as - you know, not like I'm really madly in love. And I think what I have to do - and maybe it would have to be after therapy or maybe even during therapy - the rest of therapy, I have to get myself a boyfriend that I'm very serious about and then see if I can take it. You know, like, with (inaudible at 0:46:10.9) because I mean, there are other girls around that are feminine and more feminine that I am, and much prettier than I am, and much more intelligent, much more witty, much more everything, you know? There are girls around like that. And I've got to see what happens, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, to see if you'll get into the old possessive kind of (inaudible at 0:46:27.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and to see - because like I said, I haven't felt it partly maybe because I don't feel this - like I have to go through this surface thing. You know, like, it was, like, surface rejections really is what it was. I actually only looked for it. I fell madly in love with somebody who just met me, and, like, how is he supposed to be madly in love with me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and then I'd be crushed because he wasn't talking to me or he was talking to somebody else more than me. Some stupid little thing like that, whereas now, you know, you want to talk to somebody else, go talk to somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was kind of proud of myself last night because Christian said, "Well, what happens if I call you up and you're not home?" He says, "I'll talk to your roommate, take her out." I said, "Go ahead." And I was so surprised because it wasn't an offensive thing, I just said to myself, "ahh, go ahead." And I thought, "Wow, you know, like, it's a step." But I suppose if it really happened I wouldn't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:47:14.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's an idea, like, the first thing is I would say, "He doesn't even know her and already he likes her better than me." At one time I would have, you know, you're not really that important. Like, I'd go out with you or anybody else, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just feel like now I take it for what it was, it was a joke, that's all he meant it as, as a joke. And so I came back with a joke. But I don't know, I just - I've come that far but now I don't know when I get into a deep relationship with a fellow how it's going to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because again, like I said, I haven't been in one for a long time. And I really felt like I'd fallen in love with somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I get a sense that that's really unknown territory and that you feel mixed about it, like, feel pretty good about yourself and maybe you can do it. On the other hand, it's a little like a test.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I feel. Like, that will be probably the biggest test, to see how far I've come, to really, you know - like, with friends it's very funny because, like, with Chrissie and James, like, I feel like I'm pretty secure with them. Like, Chrissie said to me, "Have you gotten that apartment yet?" I said, "Well, I looked into the one that you said, it was too expensive." "All right, what are you doing Saturday afternoon?" I said, "What do you mean what am I doing Saturday afternoon?" You know, "Call me up, if it's nice weather I'll go walking around the neighborhood with you." It's, like, this type of thing and, like, I will do the same for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, if I feel like I see something I like for her, I'll pick it out for her. If I can do something for her I try to do it. Like, I'll wait for her if she's not ready to go out (inaudible at 0:48:39.4). And things - you know, just little things like this that it's not like I feel like I'm doing something really (inaudible at 0:48:44.3). Well, I guess I'll put myself out for - you know, like, I used to at one time. It was, like, a measuring cup, you know, like, you gave me half a cup so I have to give you half a cup back. Not an ounce more or less but just exactly what you gave. Stuff like this I don't feel like I have to do that anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:49:00.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's more, like, it's coming, you know, it's, like, something you really want to do. You want to see them happy because they're your friends and you really dig them, you know? But it's, like, I never felt that way before, partly because I was always thinking, you know, like, poor little Jane was rejected. And poor little Jane wasn't loved and poor little Jane never got her ass up to do something for anybody else, and that's why she wasn't loved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:49:23.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and so I see that now and, you know, in general relationships with people, they've come, you know, to a much better, you know place or whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then there's still this thing about getting what they got?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, that would be - it's almost as if you can't trust that someone will really want to stay with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, see, partly this is again, I can trace that back. Well, it's, like, you know, like, my father first of all, feeling like he liked my brother better, first of all. So in other words I really never had my father. And then when I get my foster father he takes my step mother's side. And that's again like saying, you know, I'm chucked over for another woman. And (inaudible at 0:50:10.7) no, that's what it is to me. It wasn't like, this is my wife and you're, you know - like, you're my foster child or you're my - that's the way I felt. Like, you know, well, maybe if I was really his daughter he wouldn't do that to me, you know? And then you get into your step parent's home and you can't really communicate with a father because, like, he's got his old ways and you try to say anything, and right away you're an upstart, you're this, you're that, you know? Think the way I do and you think, "Well, okay, dad, you know." But, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's, like, you've never felt any continuity with a man or any sense of a relationship for a long time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it was always broken off and yet, my step father now always says, you know, like, "No matter what happens I'll always be your father," you know? And that made me feel very good except, like, the next time I came out he didn't even want to kiss me on the cheek.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:50:50.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was all emotional, here's my father and then, you know, I come out there and I get this cold reception and I didn't understand it. I guess he had problems, you know, like, he had just gotten fired or he changed jobs and he wasn't making lots of money. And there was lots of things on his mind, you know? And so he's not going to be as giving the way he was, you know, he's seeing the hard times in life. But to me it was, like, right away a rejection. Of course, this was, like, a year ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or not quite a year ago, maybe about six or seven months ago, which is again, I was still really hung-up. Now I can probably - like, the other day I wanted to call (inaudible at 0:51:27.0). I was really getting emotional, I was thinking about all the kids that never had anybody. And I felt so - all of a sudden I could feel sorry for these people because I hadn't been in their position, but I had been in the opposite position and I blew it, you know, in plain English I blew it. I said to myself all these kids, it was like one chance at any one of these parents or any one of these people that came into their life. They just got one chance for somebody to care. And they would have, you know, really gone all over board for them. And here I was with all these chances and how I muffed every one of them, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just started crying. And the first thing I want to do is call ma and say, "Ma, I really love you," and it was my step mother. Mrs. Foley I wanted to call. And I wanted to talk to dad too and tell him I loved him because those were the two, as much as, you know, like, I didn't get along with them and our personalities clashed at the time, and she was going through change of life, I was going through pre-teen. And, you know, those are really rotten ages, you know, for one thing. And then, you know, like, I never really gave and I was expecting not to work and to be - I was a little kid when I came there. And all of a sudden I'm cleaning house and watching kids, and having all this responsibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, like, I wasn't ready for it. And she realizes that now and I do, but it was the idea, like, rather than trying to make myself better or tell her, look, I can't do it, I would just go into a shell, you know, and then push her away is what I was doing. And so, like, I just wanted to call her, she wasn't home. I called and she wasn't home but I just - I felt emotional, I just wanted to call her and say, "Look, I really love you no matter what I've ever done. You know, like, I just want you to know I love you." You know, and it's, like - it was a beautiful feeling, you know, to for once in my life not feel like - you know, like, if they don't love me or they love somebody better or they do this or they do that, it was just a feeling, like, you know, like, all these other kids with nothing, and here I had so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't take advantage of it, you know, and I didn't give when I could have given and, you know, had a really beautiful relationship going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess maybe it was partly because I'd like to get one going with her. And my own mother in any way I can, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was kind of, like, to make up for all that time you spent closed off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it was (inaudible at 0:53:35.5) and I know she wants to open up. You know, like, she still feels badly and I want to try to tell her, look, it's not your fault. She kept saying, "Well, if I had more education I could have done this and I could have done that." I don't think - it might have helped a little bit. But I don't think at the time it would have completely helped because, like, I was not receptive. And if you've only got one person trying and trying, you could hit your head against the wall. I've tried with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tried with Jim, you know, like, he's, like, my biggest failure because I care about him. He cared about me so much and I realize now - and I try to help him. You know, I guess, like, he's feeling a little bit caring for me anyway, which in a way is good for him. It's not good in the way that I think he's trying to - I think he's getting to another type of relationship that I don't want with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:54:19.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at least there's something there. There's, like, a giving of him that he's never done before. Like, he remembered I liked those pictures so he sent away to this fellow who was his friend over in Vietnam and he got this picture for me. You know, just because I said, "Oh, I really did that art, it's really great looking."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he thought of it. But see, to me it's such a great thing because it's not only because he thought of me, but it's the idea he thought of somebody besides Jim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, which he's never done before. And I don't know, it's just, like, wow, it's nice thing for him but now if he can only get himself straightened out and feeling better about himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like you want him to go through some of the changes that you've been through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, like, I know how...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know how...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:55:02.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I know how sad it is to live in that kind of a thing, to be so frustrated, to hate yourself, you know, to really hate yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think, "This is what he's going through." And the sad thing is that he doesn't realize it. He thinks he's sad because he's thinking about all these sad things in the world and how rotten people are in general. And he's sad because he's sad inside with himself, you know? And it's so sad to think about because, like, he's got a brain and he can be so sweet and so nice when he wants to be. But it's only, like, maybe when he's been drinking or something, you know, and people all get him into a mood, you know? Like, people around him are all happy, then sometimes he comes out of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then that's, like, depending completely on other people for your happiness. So I think of myself - I think to myself all these hours he spends he says he studies, I bet half the time he's just mulling over in his mind all the things, you know, like, that are wrong with everything. And I think of all these hours he's spending alone and there's nobody there that he can really talk to. You know, that he can really get this stuff out. And, you know, I tried to get him - they've got a good therapy thing down in NYU. I tried to get him into that, maybe this isn't for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at least it might - I don't think anybody can go through therapy and not get something out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and if he could just get, like, a light to see what's going on, you know, inside of him then maybe at least he'll be a little bit happier, even if he doesn't get to all his problems, you know? And he might stop blaming his father for everything. He hates his father, he blames his father for everything, you know? "It's all my father's fault that my brother turned out that way. It's all my father's fault because I try to achieve so much because I was the first child, he pushed me, and he read this study and the study said so." He reinforces it by reading about it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you're sitting there going, oh, come on, Jim, you know, it's, like, you know, there's a beautiful world out there, just go out and look for it. You know, get out there. Don't be saying, like, you know, this campus is this and I don't have any time to go out, and I don't have any time to meet people. And I don't have any time. You don't put an effort, that's what you don't do. It's not the time. And it's just - I don't know, I just feel so bad for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think we have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But let me give you my phone number, and in case you do need to call for anything that I can do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How long do you think the wait would be before I could get back into therapy? 0:57:41.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. But you'll be coming for a post (ph) test.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you can check or - yeah, I think probably then would be a good time to check.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Because, you know, if I can't get in, like, in the next month or two, I think what I'll probably do is try to get a private therapist until then anyway. It's going to be expensive, but, like, I don't want to leave too much of a lapse. I think a month or two is not going to hurt because it would give me a chance to try my wings and see how far I've come.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's true too, that really does help. And we can help you find names and places if for some reason you don't get back here for a while.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes me kind of sad, like, I really enjoy doing therapy with you and it's, like, it means a lot to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you. (Inaudible at 0:58:45.0) have my crying again. I thought I was over this. I don't know, I just feel, like - I feel like I've come a long way. And, like, I feel like you've done a lot, you know? Like, you've helped me guide me and yet, like, I feel really good because, like, you didn't come in, like, and tell me now, this is what's wrong with you, dummy. You know, like, lots of people try too, you know, well, you're that way because of this, dummy. You know, and you go, oh, you know. But it doesn't hit you. Like, you got me to the point where I admit it when things were and I could see threads, like, of rejection and threads of how I felt. And threads of how all of a sudden, like, it wasn't just me anymore. It was, like, other people's reactions too to what I have done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, I never realized that before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's very important to me to be that way with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it was nice doing business with you. It sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to know what to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know. All I can say is thank you very much for what you have given me. And I hope, you know, hope everything keeps going for you real well too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye-bye.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I received two phone calls of rejection this morning. I am really glad they called today and not over the weekend or last week, because I had a really good morning, especially the last four or five days. And I have—I feel like, I spent the last few days being like, "OK, I know I didn't get this job. These are all the reasons why that's a good thing," and so forth and so on. And both of them were like, "We really, really want you to stay in touch with us in the future." So, yeah, that was nice. But, yeah. If they called Friday, it would've been death (laughs), even though I really wanted them to call on Friday. But, yeah. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>I'm thinking a lot as, you know, often, but not always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm (ph) sorry you didn't at least get to decide whether you wanted it or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I had already decided that. I decided I want it. (pause) But that's fine. And then I had a chance to decide that I was okay with not Danng it before they called, (inaudible at 01:32).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it. Yeah, I wasn't sure from what you had just said whether you had actually (inaudible at 01:38) figured out whether you wanted it, you know, if they had offered it to you. What I really meant to say is, like, I'm sorry you didn't get it, but I wasn't sure if you were 100 percent decided if you had wanted it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I kind of had, like, you know... But yeah, so. You know, it's (inaudible at 01:55) OK actually. And, you know, all in all. And, yeah, I'm so glad. (laughs) I feel like I've been trying to have a shorter commute for two years. And it's finally going to happen. (laughs). I'm really excited to move, not because of anything other than, like, I can walk and it'll take me 20 minutes to walk. And if I'm running late, I can take the train and it'll take me ten minutes. And you're already ten minutes late anyways, so it'll be fine. Really excited about that. [00:02:32]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 02:37) like the day before yesterday was like, "Hey, can I come out and visit with you this week?" So—and I would've felt fine saying no if I didn't want him to, but I [felt like] (ph), I want him to and recognize that was going to make this week harder, probably. But, like, yeah—and then this morning he texted me and he was like, "So, [I'm home] (ph) either Wednesday and Thursday, or Friday and Saturday." And I was like, "Don't come Friday and Saturday. You can't come then. Because, well, James's going to be helping me move and my—one of my roommates is planning on Danng a group of friends—of who are rowdy—over that weekend anyway." (laughs) Like, no Dan, you can't be a part of this, I'm sorry. But my roommate will be out of town from Wednesday on, so, like, I can make new (inaudible at 03:36) and that will be a good deal, so... [00:03:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And James had been Thursday?</p>

<p>Yeah, Thursday night. (inaudible at 03:48) for, like, six weeks. There was one weekend that we were planning to both go to out and it just didn't happen. (inaudible at 03:58) planning it. But yeah, it's really strange how differently I feel about my situation, based on I don't know what. Nothing has changed since Saturday morning or Saturday all day. Nothing is different, I just feel (inaudible at 04:29). So I was like, "Well, you know, I'll find temp work and I'll be fine. And got an apartment and I'll be fine. And, you know, it's not—the world is going to end." [Hope not] (ph). (laughs) [00:04:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I think I said—I think this was like a week or two ago—I was talking about Dan (sp?). And I was talking about him kind of rounding up, in terms of thinking that things are better than they are. And I can't believe—I thought I didn't do that. Like, part of me is like, I cannot believe that I said, "Well, this is what Dan (sp?) does, this is not what I do." (inaudible at 05:25) like, preoccupied a lot right now. Well, what else am I (inaudible at 05:30)? (laughs). The answer is, probably a whole lot. That's one of the things I've been thinking about. [00:05:44]</p>

<p>Particularly, in terms of, like, having voiced all of these things aloud to you and—I don't know why it's important to—I feel like it's generally important to people—and it's not just me—but I don't know why it's important to feel like representing a united coherent front. Like, what I say one day and what I say another day should be the same thing but (laughs) well, that was out the window. So, I'm getting used to that. [00:06:24]</p>

<p>I felt—you know, I guess (pause) I've mostly been thinking about therapy, both in the context of, like, other therapies—therapeutic relationships I've had, but more largely under the rubric or model of teaching. Because, like, my whole life I've been in one educational institution or another. Like, that's, you know, my ideal and those have been my best relationships in some ways. Like most people—most (pause), you know, stable but in a good way. The things that are supposed to happen, happen. You know, not always, but they happen. And if they don't happen, I'm good at saying, "That's not my fault. That's on the other person." You know, if I have a bad teacher, sometimes it's just a relationship thing, but a lot of times it's just the teacher's not very good. And I'm okay with saying that. But that's not really what it is, is it? Like, I think that—I think the teacher role is not serving me anymore. (laughs). Like, [I treat a lot] (ph) of my kind of (inaudible at 07:55) about what you're doing and like what I should be doing comes from trying to make this fit... [00:08:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the theory (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Both in terms of, I have been a teacher—so I'm interpreting what you're doing from the perspective of, like, "What would Chad do if he were a teacher?" And I (pause)—I have a very—particularly since I taught—have a very clear idea of what my role is as a student in order for, like, things to work. So like, Professor Mills (sp?) has—I mean, I found this incredibly, incredibly irritating for, like, the first month and a half of taking his classes. And I got over it. He has to work things out in his own time. Like, he has a script and you have to let him follow the script. The problem is that your responses are part of the script, and so, you have to figure out what he wants you to say and then say it so that he can move on with his script. And for most teachers, this is a fucking disaster. Like, a lot of people do this, and most of the time, it just doesn't work at all. But it works for Mills (sp?) because he's a genius. And because if you just sit back and let him get where he wants to go, and let him get where he wants to go in the way that he wants to get there, the end result is something really fantastic. [00:09:37]</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's actually better than, like, an actual dialogue—an actual dialogue is actually strongly preferable—but I don't think Mills (sp?) is really capable of an actual dialogue at this point in the script. Like, that's just not what he does. So (pause) I feel like I've kind of been doing that by saying, "OK, I'm—I need to let things unfold, but I also need to be participating in their unfolding." But—I guess I'm saying, somewhere along the line I picked up the sense that you have an idea of where this was going. (laughs). You knew, (inaudible at 10:24). [00:10:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Trying (inaudible at 10:33). Sorry, when I don't see you for a really long time, I think a lot—as in there's like a lot of to—just, like, dumb. (laughs). So, yeah. But it's also—part of the problem for me is that (pause) I felt that a teacher knows a lot of things that they're not going to tell me right away, because the way that a course works, the way that education works, is step-by-step-by-step. And you can't jump. I mean, you can jump sometimes but it's usually better not to. [00:11:26]</p>

<p>But I'm uncomfortable with that in other relationships. You know, I'm uncomfortable with the idea that you have drawn conclusions about me that you're not telling me. And it's not like I—you know I thought it was something—[for a moment] (ph) was like, I know that you've drawn conclusions about me that you're not telling me and, in theory, that doesn't bother me, because I trust you to make those decisions about what's going to be good for me. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I have something to do with (inaudible at 12:14). </p>

<p>CLIENT: In practice, really way less OK with it than I would like to be. (laughs). And it's hard to tell the difference between what I think and what I'm feeling, or what I'm—[00:12:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of conclusions are these? That are drawn?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if I knew then (laughs). Well, things like, I can't believe that I thought I didn't lie to myself. I'm sure that you never thought I wasn't capable of lying to myself. You know, that's not how people are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Not (ph) in my world, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Things like, I said—what, like the first day? I was like, "I don't believe I'm being conscious. I think subconscious, I don't know." You know, that you didn't take that off (ph) with me. Because you couldn't at that point, you can't. [00:13:25] </p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I'm trying to think about some other things that (inaudible at 13:44). But do you—is that (inaudible at 13:47)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 13:47).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess there's a question here somewhere of, like, what kinds of things are you really telling me and what kinds of things aren't you? But I don't think that's really a fair question to ask you, so (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs). Well, it's not fair then I guess you can't ask. Or [even that you'd want to know] (ph) necessarily. </p>

<p>CLIENT: God, Dan (sp?) used to do this. He's like, "I'm not asking." And then he would be like, "But I imagine such and such." And be like, "You just asked. You can't say I'm not asking this, and then state what you want, and think that that's not a question." (laughs). [00:14:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 14:41).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hadn't thought to fit in those terms, but yes.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine (pause) part of this comes from a wish that this would work like school. [00:15:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah because then I'd know exactly what to do. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you'd know what to do and I think it would feel so much safer, so much more secure, so much more (inaudible at 15:55). Because you'd know what to do, because I would actually know the answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's not how I think about school, but yeah. You know more of the answers. (laughs). I mean, there's a reason my favorite subject was English, rather than math. Because I never felt (pause)—I never felt like my opinion wasn't as good as the teacher's. Just that, the teacher's a lot more experienced than I was, you know. All too often, I thought my opinion was better. Like, I hadn't really recanted my (inaudible at 16:46), so whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you are—I think there's something about—and maybe I'm wrong about this—about the way you look up to some of the teachers that you really liked, that have been very reassuring. To have people like that to look up to. [Fair or not] (ph) because they know all the answers, but for some reason anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not that they know all the answers, but they know more than I do and they know how to approach the topic. I mean, I think this is part of the reason why this thing with Dan (sp?) has been so hard for me (pause) you know. And that I thought that relationship was safe—and then it wasn't. [00:17:52]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>But it—I mean, just saying, like, I don't think they have all the answers isn't actually that I think (pause) kind of your main point, which is —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 18:20) that different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have a place where I'm going—it's a good place to be. (laughs). Well, usually.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I guess] (ph) as well, school is a lot about knowing things. [00:19:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 19:07). If you know all the answers, nobody yells at you. Did I tell you about fourth grade geography? Oh my god. I mean, I still am embarrassingly bad at geography. Like, I'm, like, truly embarrassed at how bad I am at it, but I just—I failed every single quiz in fourth grade geography. I would just get zero after zero after zero after zero, and the teacher was this, like, (laughs)—she was like, probably mid-forties at the time, like 5'10", very tall, very thin, kind of a (inaudible at 20:07). I think—I heard later that she, like, kind of got around. We lived in a town with, like—like, the town was, like, 3,000 people, so, like, getting around you don't have to go very far. And she was terrifying. They called her "Queen Beasley." And, you know, the kids (inaudible at 20:28) fourth grade and so, it was like, this, like, ritualized ordeal of you spend the year with Mrs. Beasley, and before that, like, it's like baby school, and after that, you're a real student. [00:20:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a rite of passage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which, in many ways, it was, because she was very, very good. Like, a very effective teacher. You learned a lot. But she wasn't the kind of teacher that was necessarily very good for me, because she was very degrading, and I was easily degraded. And I think it was this—I mean, when I think back about it, I think this is the strange situation where she could see that I was very, very smart, and I would failing everything. And she didn't understand why and the reason was very basic—I didn't know how to do homework, and nobody was making sure that I did it. [00:21:39]</p>

<p>So, like, one of the things that I learned over the course of that year, like, after—I guess—actually, (inaudible at 21:48) that was kind of an abuse of my time, when I had (inaudible at 21:49). I guess that was one of the years that (inaudible at 21:54) our nanny. She was (laughs) English, her father was the producer of the first James Bond film, so (laughs). And she ended up in, like, rural Texas as our nanny, after spending some time in the Amazon, on rainforest tours. (laughs). [00:22:27]</p>

<p>You know, I think she was this young woman that kind of decided, like, her parents were pretty, like, [toxic is the word] (ph), but that—it's used to the point where I don't like to use it anymore. But they were toxic (ph) and she was just like, "You're trying to control me with money, so I'm just not going to take your money anymore." And left. And so she ended up as our nanny for a year and a half, two years and is maybe one of the best people I've ever met. Like, in terms of, like, people that I think about as saints. Like, (inaudible at 23:08), I didn't have any exposure to it until I got to (inaudible at 23:11). Okay, now I kind of see where this coming from. Like, she's one of those people who's just, like, good. So, she taught me how to study. You know, flashcards and reviewing and, you know, prepping. And saying, "You just have to sit down, like, review it. You can't just look at it once and then hope that you remember it. That's not how learning works." And, like—[00:23:36.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 23:37) work more or less that way, (inaudible at 23:38).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, (laughs) more or less that way often. Sorry (ph), I'm still working on (inaudible at 23:46). But, like (pause) I actually forgot where I was telling the story. But it was awful. Like, I would just cry, and cry, and cry, and feel so stupid and so ashamed, and she would humiliate me in public, you know, in front of the other kids. And, you know, she was definitely a, like, you know—it was one of those hard-line, take-no-prisoners kind of high stakes approaches, and I think those are effective to some degree, but, like, they—you know, it was just really bad. (pause) And it's just that nobody noticed. So, I kind of continued in that vein (ph) until I hit high school, and then I learned that if you study, then people don't yell at you. Before that, I thought just people just yell at you. (inaudible at 24:56) yelled at me, and I couldn't quite figure out why's everybody yelling at me and not everybody else. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. When you say, "Continue in that vein through high school," you mean, like, you didn't study for a lot of your other classes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't really learn how to study consistently, you know, to get the grades, until I got to high school. It's just something clicked. I think it was a combination of having, like, a study hall, you know, I was at boarding school, so we had very, very structured time. And having friends, I think. Just, like, feeling like I was somebody who could do this. Or I don't know. Like, I —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What puzzles me is (pause) what made it so hard to learn to, or to actually study, when somebody had 25:57).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still didn't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't see the connection between the studying and people yelling at me. Like, (laughs), I don't know why but, like, I just didn't—it's like I didn't see a future in which I could get good grades. And so, I didn't see a future in which I could be valued for these things. I don't know why. But I just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 26:26) me in that. I thought that you did pretty well in school up until this class.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I, you know, I continued to do OK. Like, I got into St. Margaret's (sp?). I didn't get into St. Christopher's, which was the school where my sister went and where I really wanted to go. But, St. Margaret's (sp?) was probably better for me anyway. St. Christophers didn't really have any mechanism of dealing with kids who didn't—kids with any kind of—outside of the solemnly high-end of normal range. So, it was hard (inaudible at 27:11). It's just, like, severely ADHD and I just didn't know what to do with that. [00:27:18]</p>

<p>And—but, you know, like, I think I used to lie and say that I'd done my homework, and I really hadn't. And so, like, I was probably the only student that my English teacher in sixth grade and eighth grade—like—in sixth grade, we had to write these essays that were, like, 400 words And it was before typing so we had to write them out. And then he would mark every punctuation or grammatical mistake, and we had to correct them and so forth. It was a really good exercise that I think, really positive. I was the only student he ever had in, like, 25 years of his teaching that turned in a paper that had no grammatical mistakes on it—ever. And I think ten years later, somebody told me I'm still the only student who's ever done that. And I got Bs in English, because I knew I would have assignments to write poetry, and I just wouldn't do it. And because of—I mean, personally, like, this school is pretty fucked. Like, it's got some problems. [00:28:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This was in sixth grade, or eighth grade?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think both. It was the same teacher for sixth and eighth grade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there's something going on there. I don't know what, but that's not just about your sort of failing to kind of, like, cognitively (ph) learn a lesson about how doing homework actually helps you get better grades. You know what I mean? Like —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, why did that keep happening? Or, I was, like, hopelessly disorganized. Like, I still am—I'm hopefully disorganized now. (laughs). You know, you'll give me a piece of paper and it would be gone. It was never coming back. And the main way that they communicated with parents was they would give us, you know, give us things to take home to our parents. I never took that (inaudible at 29:13) there, and my father is hopelessly disorganized—he never thought to ask about it. And so there's just, as far I remember, there's, like, miles of miscommunication. But I don't know. [00:29:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how was it that your dad didn't get any of this in the many teacher—like, parent-teacher conferences?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he—I don't know. He would say, "Okay, we're working on organization, you know, we're all working on organization. Tanya (sp?), you need to work on organization." But then he'd be gone. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most parents of, like, you know, elementary schoolers (ph) whose teachers say, "Well, she never turned in any homework" say, "Okay, I'll make sure she does her homework. I'll sit down with her. I'll check it when she's done. I'll make sure, you know, make sure I get a hold of the assignment sheet." I mean, parents do that all the time. It's quite remarkable when they don't—especially at those ages—get involved in those ways. But it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: He never did that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...seems to not have registered at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he never did that. I think it didn't occur to him that that was something he should do. Like, I don't—I don't know why. [00:30:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, [best I can tell] (ph), parent-teacher conferences are pretty universal. They would've told him to do that. In other words, like, he wouldn't have had to figure that out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe he did and I just don't remember it. I mean, I think he would ask me whether I'd do my homework, or whether I had done my homework. And I would say, "Yes." And I wouldn't have. I think. Or I would say, "I'm doing it," while I was, like, sitting at the table, staring into space, and after a while I would put it down and go do something else. But I'd not have it done. [00:31:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I mean...</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is something I hadn't realized, but I kind of still, like—it's really hard. Like, it's hard for me to talk about. Also I just feel so ashamed and so upset with him. You know, why the fuck couldn't he do these things? Like, everybody does them, as you say. You know, I don't care that his job was hard. I don't care that he was working all the time. Like, I recognize that he was doing his best, but it wasn't good enough. But there's nothing I can do about that now. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 32:56) (laughs). (inaudible at 32:59) Thinking that I was, but —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, this is still, like, mystery in your mind about this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I mean —</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me, it seems, like, pretty straight forward. [00:33:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's that? (inaudible at 33:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 33:23), you know. I think he's severely, severely depressed and (pause), you know, I think I was just one of the things that slipped his mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really quite a remarkable thing to say. Like, I, his daughter, was just one of those things that slipped his mind. I mean, well, you left your car keys. Maybe the electric bill last month. Like, picking up your dry cleaning. Those are things that slip your mind. Somebody's birthday. But your education...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, also that was the way he was raised. I know I'm just coming up with excuses for him, but that is in fact true. (laughs) [00:34:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I believe you, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do think that (pause). That —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get that the other thing that's emerging is how reflectively you do make excuses that I think (pause)—at least in the context of me more or less waving my arms around [about this] (ph)—sound pretty bad (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 35:03).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, (inaudible at 35:06), or, like, excuses or rationalizations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've thought about it a lot. Took me a very, very long time to forgive him, you know. Well, know, like, maybe I should un-forgive him, because (inaudible at 35:25). (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you really haven't wanted to see some pretty (inaudible at 35:36), or see—really didn't want to see some, maybe just problems that were clearly his responsibility. I mean, you're in fourth grade, (inaudible at 35:57) said is like, "Hey, you know, Tanya's (sp?) not doing her homework. She hasn't passed in a single assignment all year." Your next move is, "OK, I'll sit with her and do it. I'll check every single assignment (inaudible at 36:12) the door, I'll make sure it's always in her backpack in the morning." Like, even if you're a really disorganized parent who, like, isn't planning things in advance and has [five million] (ph) going on, like, that's what you do. [00:36:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He didn't really check my backpack. Nobody ever checked my anything. And I didn't know parents did that—like, I actually didn't. (laughs) Good to know. Parenting tip. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 36:41). And it's, you know, it's not that I've never seen or heard of something like this, but it's quite striking. And it's (pause) it's not just disorganization. I understand that he's disorganized—I'm not doubting him, I'm just repeating it (ph). But this is more than just that. I mean, you know, if he was functional enough to, like, make sure there was some food in the house and clothing on your kids and some bills were getting paid, I mean, like —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Barely. (laughs). I mean, like, there was a lot of food in the house. There wasn't always food on our plates, unless we made it. We always had something to wear—we never had enough to wear. Like, you know, I wore pants that were, like, this short, because it didn't occur to me that I could ask for new clothes when I had outgrown the old ones. That kind of thing. But he was still doing better than his parents. [00:38:07]</p>

<p>But, yeah, like anything that I can think of to say is a rationalization. Or, like, trying to justify him in some way. So, I don't know. It—you know, I couldn't ask anything, because he was so angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (long pause) I imagine (pause) this is an interesting sort of stand on why you want this therapy to be like school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, fuck yeah. (laughs). Sorry. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...such (inaudible at 39:35) sort of leave schools, like, there are things I think you are so ashamed for me to see about what was going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't thinking in that way at all. I mean, I was thinking more of in the, you know, I constantly look for people—for teachers to be stable people in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I agree. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You got that. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got that, and I sort of thought maybe I was going a different direction than —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't—I don't think I was—I felt that I was trying to hide this. I guess, we had a conversation a while back about, like, you know, my dad yelling. I guess I tried to—I thought that all of this had kind of come across in that conversation. But apparently not. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I had some sense of it, but (inaudible at 40:26) —</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not embarrassed to talk about it at all. I don't feel like, you know, I don't know, (inaudible at 40:35).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said, like, two minutes ago, that this is so embarrassing and you felt so ashamed. And that you were...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Again, with the continuity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...making all these rationalizations, kind of—I said the word "reflectively."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That may be a convincing argument. But I know I tell people about it. I don't—I don't know. [00:41:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing I don't, like, (pause) the thing that puzzles me about your saying that is that it seemed pretty clear—both as I thought it and you were talking about it—you're still kind of half in the, "Well, you know, this is kind of how it was. He was pretty organized, and there was a lot going on. He had so much on his plate. And, you know, he certainly didn't have a model, like, for this kind of thing when he was growing up, and he certainly did better than his parents, and made more of an effort. And, like, that's just kind of how it was." Like, you're telling people that but it doesn't seem to mean, like, you're seeing the significance of what happened. I guess that's what we're talking about, is how—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really pushing not to, aren't I? Or something. (laughs) I don't know why. [00:42:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. Well, I think it could really affect some of your feelings about your father and some of the ways you see him. And maybe you're also worried—although I suspect you'll disagree with me here—about some of the ways I would see you, if I, like, gave you that, like, I saw you as so neglected. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am certainly not going to tell you about the (inaudible at 43:09). (laughs). I don't know. I mean, the puzzle for me has always been that, like, "Was this really bad, or wasn't it really bad? And do I count as somebody who was neglected, or who had a hard childhood? Like, do I count?" You know, the way that we think about it and talk about it, there's like—there's just two categories, and I don't feel like I'm really in either. And so far, I mean that I want to say, "Yes, this was really bad." I don't make it sound like justification for why things are really hard right now, but I don't... [00:44:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you did just tell me that this teacher, like, routinely humiliated you through the course of the year. That you didn't learn how to do anything homework and still had similar experiences in a bunch of other classes, until you got to high school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's a reason that I don't believe in public humiliation of children. I think that's the worst thing you can do to them. Well, not the worst thing, but it's pretty bad. Sorry, I interrupted you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. You're kind of making my point. (laughs). Not that you had a difficult childhood, or were badly treated. I mean, that—I don't think you want to see it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is weird, because I also really want to have been, like, I want it to be there. Because then I have something to hang on to. But, I don't know. It does feel like what's actually there, I'm really not happy about it. (laughs) [00:45:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [What this all that I taught you?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I don't want to [extend the tissue at you] (ph), but I did not. (laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome. [00:45:36]</p>

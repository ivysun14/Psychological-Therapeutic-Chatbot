<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, sniff, pause, deep exhale, pause) Well the first thing that's on my mind is that, uhm, because the parents' meeting is tonight I go to school right after here.  Uhm, I, I just have this feeling I don't want anything you know to upset me, I guess, or you know, I'm sort of feeling well, I'm uhm.  That's what's on my mind, I guess, is, is the way I'm thinking about it.  And uhm, I guess I was kind of remembering last year too and how the whole time I was here last year I kept fighting thinking about anything else.  And this year I was thinking well that's just a waste of time.  I should cancel coming if that's what I'm going to do.  Because I could have gone to school earlier and, and had a more relaxed time setting things up.  Uhm, but I didn't and there's no point in coming if tha—, if I'm going to do as I did last year.  But then on the other hand I have this feeling well, but that's what's on my mind and if I let anything else get on my mind I might really become distracted.  Uhm, you know I mean as usual I have a number of things that I want to do when I get to school and so I'll have to work pretty quickly.  Uhm, (exhale) and I really, and I know that it, it, I can still do that even if I think about other things when I'm here.  Except on the other hand I have this feeling well but I'm going to be, uhm, you know, sort of fighting getting involved in anything.</p>

<p>An—, well one thing I was thinking about uhm, was (sniff) I'm not sure how much I thought of this after I left here, you know, the, the things that uhm, came up yesterday.  Mainly about how I was uhm, feeling having FTM living at home and uhm, possible association with my experience in PEC and what I had thought was involved.  And, you know I, I know I left here having the feeling I don't fully understand, uhm, you know, just how I've come about to make that association really, because I, I don't know, it doesn't seem like I would make it in every case.  And uhm, and then I, I think I have the feeling well but I can think about that tomorrow or — (sniff, sniff, 11/2-minute silence, sniff)</p>

<p>I, I don't know and then I star—, just now I started thinking of, uhm, tonight and uhm, first of all that it's still on my mind the way a night like this well, it was last year and the way it probably always has been or, you know, similar things at LKC.  Uhm, but I have the feeling that up to now I was more selective than I have been before, but still, uhm, I feel very bothered that, you know, if I don't include everything, uhm, this year we're doing exhibits of different materials we use, and so it's impossible to show everything.  And uhm, I don't think I've been as selective as somebody who would feel more secure than I do, would.  But, you know, I keep wavering between thinking well I'm just going to be selective and uhm, you know what I do isn't going to make me or break me, but then on the other hand I begin to feel it is.  
And that I ha—, I'm going to be judged and that I have to please.  Uhm, (sniff) or even, I don't know, just it's sort of like it's kind of a hit or miss way of doing, pleasing too, because I can think well being good at selecting would be a way to please more than not selecting, except then I'm afraid well what if I select the wrong way.  And so then if I do everything, uhm, somehow I'll hit upon something that will please whoever I'm thinking I have to please.  I suppose in this case it's BBF and the parents.</p>

<p>And it's not really pleasing me and I don't know, I was just thinking of something too.  Uhm, this afternoon, the teacher who's new, took FHYZ's place, showed me a couple of things that she was going to have up.  And uhm, she's the one that, you know, when I first, when she first came I had this feeling was, you know, so innately confident or, I don't know if exactly innately.  But anyway, just seemed to be very confident, self-confident.  And uhm, one of the things she did was to find a quote, or maybe she had just come across it, she's taking a course and might have come across it for her course reading.  But, in any case she has a rather nice quote that uhm, you know, in a way tells the parents lay off the pressure, but nicely.  And it just, uhm, gives a nice, suggests something nice about childhood and learning, and experiences, and so forth.  And uhm, I don't know I was thinking about that because, on the one hand I was thinking, gee that was really nice.  If I were a parent and saw that in a room I'd feel better about the teacher.  Uhm, but it never occurred to me to do anything like that.  It only occurred to me to be selective hopefully and, in the things I was going to show, but still stick right to the line of showing all the things we do so it would satisfy these parents who want, you know, a lot of academic areas covered.  And uhm, I don't know, I, I guess I didn't even think well what would, make me feel best as a teacher and what I believe in.  (Clears throat, 11/2-minute silence, sniff, clears throat, silence, deep breath, 11/4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know I, I, just thinking some more about tonight and things I want to do and uhm, how much maybe I shouldn't do what I'm thinking I want to do because maybe I'm just not being selective and (sniff) and then I start thinking that what I'm doing the same thing as last year that I said I was anticipating possibly doing what seemed to me a waste of time to do.  You know, just sort of thinking about that and putting off anything else that would be important.</p>

<p>And uhm, no, but then, I don't know, I started thinking again about FTM and something that I know I still don't understand and probably will come up again although right now, uhm, uh, I can't remember now if anything more happened when I got home last night or I had anymore, you know, sort of different thoughts about it or anything except that I do know it's been on my mind as it has been at other times.  But I think again, last night you know, sort of don't, I, I've been sort of trying to relate too much to her I think, too fast or, uhm again, talking to cover up and, and I think it's been on my mind don't talk so much.  Uhm, because in a way I can get to know her better if I don't talk so much and let her talk.  So, uhm, and, and not to feel so driven to talk and in that way relate or, it, it's really sort of non-relating.  But uhm, I know, and in some way to slow down what I, what I was doing.  And uhm, not to cover up in any case.  Uhm, and I think I was aware of this last night, of feeling that way and there were a couple of times when we were talking about FSO and my inclination was to, to talk and talk and talk.  And I could see that, uhm, that's what I was doing.  And she might have given me some clues too, I don't, I.  I think in one case, she did.  Uhm, but anyway again, I, there were several occasions when it was very much on my mind, don't talk too much because uhm, well I just have these feelings somehow I'm covering up, and I'm not really relating then.  But, but because I've been trying not to talk too much, uhm, behave as I had been, then I feel as if well things are better.  And so then I don't feel the pressure that I did yesterday when I got here to think about it.  And uhm, well I always felt the things that happened yesterday at school were secondary.  But things were a lot better today, and again partly because I was aware and I was trying not to, uhm, you know, repeat what I had done yesterday.</p>

<p>And the, the other thing that I went through, I think I was part way thinking it here and then more a—, after I left here because FLMZ and the whole thing that had happened was still much on my mind.  And, oh, first of all I was very inclined to, say something to her of, uhm, that I'd (clears throat) gotten angry and it really didn't have anything to do with her and I hoped she'd understand or something.  And then I, in the end decided that would be, make things even worse, to say anything like that.  That if I can't act responsibly, then I shouldn't be asking her to, sort of overlook it when I do act in, I guess you could call it an irresponsible way as yesterday.  And uhm, (pause) I don't know, I, I guess I just feel as if well I've gotten everything pretty even for today at least, and the thing I'm feeling most tense about is tonight, uhm, even though I think I feel more than I ever have that uhm, tonight really isn't that important.  I mean BBF wants things to look good, but things could look good without my doing a lot of things that I'm inclined to do.  And maybe they would look even worse by doing them more cluttered and more, you know, confused.  And but still I, well I guess it's I'm still you know sort of holding on to the fact that this is a way that I can prove myself or be something or, uhm, be recognized and, and then that kind of recognition will make up for other things.  (Sniff, pause, gurgle, deep breath, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, uhm, quite why I was thinking this.  First I was thinking about, oh I know, I started thinking about FSO, I guess I was thinking about FSO's dream that she finally spoke of actually what she was dreaming all these times when she would wake up and cry.  Not, she did it this morning, not last night, but she woke up last night crying a couple of times.  And I guess I was thinking of it because of, you know, I'm putting, getting recognition at school over my relationship with MSCZ, and sort of keeping that hopefully sort of even and not getting better.  And then compensating, or feeling as if recognition at school would be better, more important than a good relationship.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then that made me think of FSO who dreamt about a bee stinging her last night, which reminded me of those dreams I used to have of a bee stinging me.  Uhm, and then she said and then she, she got rid of the bee, and then he came in and stung me, meaning you know, me.  Uhm, and I don't know, and then that reminded me of times when I was dreaming of things happening, doing things to my mother, literally I guess.  Uhm, and then I thought of uhm, I guess this is why, uh, music teacher has been, one of the songs she's been teaching different classes is about catching a bee and then the bee stinging, you know, one as you catch it.  And it's a cute song and, and today when I was hearing it I was thinking, gee, I wonder if she realizes the connotation it might have for some of the children.  Uhm, and then I was thinking well maybe FSO and I are unique in dreaming this dream of a bee stinging.  Uhm, or you know maybe I'm making too much of it.  But in thinking about the music teacher —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What, what are you making of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, of uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You didn't say.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  We—, thinking of uhm, a penis.  (Pause, sniff) Because for me I can think, well yeah, having that dream over and over is like that fantasy I had last week or the week before all those times when I'd come up the stairs on the subway and think of somebody behind me with a knife.  Uhm, and both have the connotation, or you know, suggest what I'm really wanting is to have a penis put in me, and recently yours with that fantasy coming here.  Uhm, but then I think with FSO, she's so little and young and, you know even though I was probably around that age, I don't know if I were that young when I had the dream but, uhm, I don't know, just seems like how could she be thinking although I know she's very aware of penises right now and MSCZ's in particular.  Uhm, (sniff, sniff, gurgle, sniff, 11/2-minute silence) —</p>

<p>No, then, then I was thinking about uhm, I, can't remember, I don't think she did it last night, but the last night, both the last night and the night before she woke up having, I guess, had a bad dream.  But uhm, thing was the night before that when she woke up she began, first she was comforted by my coming in, and then she began to throw herself around and get herself worked up so that I would have to be very firm with her, and uhm, you sort of reprimand her in a way and tell her she had to stop and get her to stop in that way.  And uhm, she really seemed to be asking to be spanked, not that, and both MSCZ and, and then later MSCZ was dealing with her because I took her into the bathroom, she had to go to the bathroom, and while she was urinating she was hitting herself.  Uhm, and again, I, I didn't think it, well I don't know if it had something to do with, you know, the fact she was urinating too, but I had, I thought of it more just simply she was spanking herself because she was still in a state.  And then she asks for MSCZ.  He was there and, and uhm, and then he too had to say that, say, he said something like the way you're behaving seems as if you're asking for a spanking.  And then he went on to say something to the effect of "if you've had a bad dream of bad things happening," you know "we won't let them happen" or "we won't let you do them" or something anyway that she listened to although she didn't completely calm down.  But uhm, you know I was thinking of that and then I was thinking of how she was calmer today and then didn't see much of me today because I was because I was late getting home.  And she had wanted me to take her to the park today and yesterday I thought I'd get home earlier, so I had said I would, and it turned out I couldn't.  And she accepted it pretty well and then I was thinking of FTM's uhm, way of dealing with her which is quite nice, and it, and then it got me back again to what I was talking about yesterday, this feeling I have uhm, which is just, uhm, increased I guess, or at least not affected because FTM is very good with FSO.  (Pause, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, well the thing that was just on my mind that at first I was trying to think well again it has nothing to do anything here, uhm but (chuckle) I, I'm sure it must.  Uhm, before I left home I was beginning to get nervous enough so that I had to keep going to the bathroom.  And uhm, sometimes when I get nervous, I hadn't reached this point, but sometimes when I get nervous enough I get almost, as—, as if I have diarrhea but not quite.  And uhm, I hadn't reached that point at home, but just now when I was quiet I had this feeling I'm about to have an attack of diarrhea.  And I might have to leave here and go to the bathroom.  And I suppose the way I'm thinking when I had to admit to myself it probably has something to do with here is, it's as if uhm, it's a fear of something's going to come out. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I mean I think well I thought of this, I had this feeling, I ha—, I didn't have it any other time until right after thinking about FTM and FSO and this feeling of, uhm, whatever it is I still can't quite handle, describe.  Handle enough to describe probably.  And uhm, and then I had this feeling.  (Pause) And I don—, I don't know uhm, because I, I was thinking again that when I thought of uh, FSO and, and how sh—, she accepted in the end my not being able to take her to the park today and how FTM was handling it, and then having a warm feeling toward her, in part, probably because she does handle FSO very well and I'm very happy about that because I wasn't happy about FDO.  But there was also this, the same, uhm, feeling that I was talking about, uhm, I guess mainly yesterday.  And then the first thing I think of is of a fear that it has suggestions or overtones of, you know, sort of a lesbian feeling.  And, and then I was just thinking about some things you pointed out yesterday in terms of my —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What is a lesbian feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know, as if I would want to love her.  Uhm, as if somehow she would excite me sexually, I guess.  And that being with her and, and then with that girl at camp.  Uhm, well, you know I don't know what lesbians do do together except that uhm, it seemed to me there were overtones of that in my relationship with the girl at camp, of uhm, really wanting to be physically close touching.  Although I don't think we ever did anything overtly, uhm, I don't know what you call it, sexual or whatever, but uhm, (pause, deep breath). The only other thing I can compare, I mean, I know I think of that, when I think of this feeling with FTM.  The only other thing I can think of, although I can't see how, I don't think it's this at all, it seems comparable somehow, is the feeling I had about FSO sometimes when I was nursing her.  Uhm, and it was a very physical feeling.  And sexual.  I mean somehow it was sexually satisfying or stimulating when I was nursing FSO and the whole feeling of our relationship and enjoying that physical closeness.  And uhm, I think, and I keep thinking well, I can't think about this feeling with FTM because I'm so afraid that that's what it might mean.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What's frightening?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  What's frightening?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, if it means that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not sure.  I was thinking about something to do with that, I guess.  Not maybe as specifically as right now.  But last night, MSCZ was reading the book uhm, I do—, I don't think I even know the title yet, because I didn't actually see it, but it's about uhm, uh, what's her name, Vita Sackford-West.  And her son has published what she wrote about her les—, one, I don't know whether she only had one or anyway, her first lesbian affair.  And uhm, and then I happened to be reading a book review of a biography on, uhm, Dorothy Richards, I think it is, somebody I had never really even heard about who was alive around the same time as Virginia Woolf.  And uhm, who wasn't really a lesbian but she was kind of in that group and just was living a very strange life, one that was not the accepted life for women at her time.  And I guess I was thinking how could she have been so daring and brave?  And it's sort of the same feeling I guess I get about FHYZ and what she's done right now, FHYZ BQC.  And uhm, maybe a similar feeling to thinking about a woman having a lesbian affair as did, uhm, is it, I'm never sure, I think it's Vita Sackford-West.  Uhm, and it was as if, I don't know how happy she was.  MSCZ kept saying he thought the whole thing was so sad.  But uhm, I think maybe what's frightening to me is just that it's breaking a certain accepted pattern and doing something that is not what people expect and uhm, you know, sort of what society says is okay.  Even though today there are so many people who are becoming more and more, well, frank isn't quite the word, but anyway, society seems to be accepting it more, but still, somehow to me it's, well I don't know, it's frightening more than that.  Uhm, I guess again it has, the other side of it is, if that is my feeling, then it must mean that I don't feel toward MSCZ anything that would mean we could continue our marriage.  And uhm, (pause, sniff, 21/2-minute silence, deep breath, pause).</p>

<p>Well, I feel as if I've backed off.  I started thinking again, well I, I think I literally started thinking uhm, if I get too much more into this then I won't be ready to go back to school and be ready for the parents.  And uhm, (pause) and I mean I know, literally that's not so.  Uh, so it seems like, well I just am using tonight.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Clears throat, coughs) Well, our time's up.</p>

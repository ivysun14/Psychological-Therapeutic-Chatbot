<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 0222-115. Interview number 10, February 18, 1971. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wondered where we were. This is only the 10th?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it seem longer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had no idea. I figured it was either 10 or considerably better. I didn't know what it was. Oh, damn it - my match is collapsing!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your match?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I bit it almost in two. Wow, not much has happened since I've been here last. I have been getting mail a lot. I have written 30 pages of letters in the last two days. I get up and about the time I am waking up at lunch time, I go out and get fairly crocked with some old man at work. I spend the rest of the day sobering up and I finally pass out when I get home and finish dinner. Not a whole lot happened. It seems to fit right in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure what you mean by "right in?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is just letting time pass and not getting involved in it too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it makes the days go by but that's about all at this point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is actually a hassle on me. I enjoy sitting there and drinking with the old man - he is a super-friend old dude - but I don't like alcohol! I don't like being drunk and I don't like drinking but I sure like being around him. He is a really good old dude. 0:02:12.4</p>

<p>I got a letter from Jessica's best friend - a good friend of mine. Her name is Cindy, who is a...her mother and possibly my younger brother-friend-type's mother...Stevie's mother that I used to date plus Carmen's mother, who is a good friend of Jessica and I are probably the only two parent type people that seem to be aware of what Jessica and I's positions are and approve them. I got a letter from Carmen the other day and it seems that her mother is willing to let her come up some time in April. She will be coming up to stay with either my brother or whomever - wherever we can find room - for about four days to go to a rock concert and just freak around for a while. She mentioned that she didn't know whether Jessica would get uptight about the situation or not and I talked to Jessica - I don't think she is uptight over that. But it did bring to mind - and I often wonder - whether Jessica really...I know her parents are - whenever the situation comes up - they are constantly trying to convince her I am, if not balling every chick that walks by, I am out trying to. It kind of came to mind: I don't really know how to answer that to myself. so I just wrote a letter to Jessica an asked her what she thought of the whole thing (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you just wonder how far that sinks into her and it suddenly occurs to you, "What does she think?" 0:06:01.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha, well I have thought it before. I don't know whether I was reading things into what Jessica said or whether she was actually saying it. If she was saying it, she was saying it in such a super subtle form that she wasn't very interested in being open about it at all. In other words, it is more than likely something I saw. When Carmen said it - who is Jessica's best friend - it kind of made me think I wonder if maybe there was something really behind all of that - after I had just passed off. I kind of had my doubts. Steve - the other person I just mentioned...Steve and Jessica have been best of friends for a long, long time now. Before I started going with Jessica and before Steve started going with the chick he is with now, we used to cry on each other's shoulder all of the time. We were both very morbid people for a while, I guess. After Steve started going with Julie, then I started going with Jessica. Julie is a super insecure person - very insecure. She was always upset that...she thought Steve and Jessica were having - as they jokingly referred to as - a suburban ethics affair behind her back. I often kid Jessica that she better not be doing that when I am back there because I haven't got enough time to waste with them all having their fun together. Of course, it is all a joke. That is the kind of thing that she kids me about with Carmen so I really don't think there is any trouble there. Like I said though, I do wonder what it all amounts to sometimes. I expect to find out. I really don't expect anything: I just wrote her the letter and I am anxious to see the reply. There are a lot of things in it that I am anxious to see the reply to. I am thinking of calling her tonight. It has been about a week since I have. I used to call her almost every night. Jesus Christ! That is going to be so strange getting a phone bill under $150 this month - I won't know what to do with it. I am still trying to figure out where to get the money to pay for the check I wrote for last month's phone bill. I won't miss paying for it! 0:09:00.8</p>

<p>It is looking like it will be quite a while before I get back to Boise again. After that...I don't know...four or five month stretch that ended when I went back in December and I went again, back towards the end of January. Both times I kind of figured that I wouldn't be very conscious to avoid spending three or four months away from Boise again but it looks like we are heading into another stretch like that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it make you feel apprehensive or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm, a little but in a completely different way. It is almost like we have learned how to handle that. It is just that we have gone through it twice now - long stretches - where in the middle of them you kind of lose sight of both ends and get lost and everything gets fogged out. We have also discussed that problem so now we are going into it knowing what we are headed for. It is kind of a situation that we are going to see if what we have learned is going to do us any good. If we can keep it together, it will be better this time and I think it will work a little easier. That we aren't quite as hassled; I have got a job now. I am not going to court or anything like that lately. I think she got a little bummed out: she doesn't think she did as good on her National Merit Scholarship Test as she was hoping to. She did awfully well in her ACTs, I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just kind of get the feeling that there is this low-level thing - you are not sure what it is - but that it is sort of bugging you. Does that at all match anything that has happening for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I was just thinking when I mentioned the ACTs...I hadn't felt necessarily bummed out before. In fact, I don't over this right now. Sometimes it gives me a twinge of, I don't know, jealousy or inferiority or something that Jessica has, quite obviously, posted considerably seriously better grades etc out of high school than I ever even dreamed of. I made it through high school and I managed to graduate and that is about the extent of it. Jessica is all (inaudible 12:15) to pull off a scholarship here. She looks like she may manage it. If, and when, she does, she will get out of school and start college and I will probably be all of three semesters ahead of her at the most and like as not, we will end up in few classes the same - purposely. Not that it couldn't be avoided but we will still be so close in our levels that that is where we will be at. It gives me a little bit of a feeling that I should be bummed out somewhere but it doesn't bear bothering too much about now - maybe later! 0:12:55.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't sure whether you meant you were worried about, like, maybe competitive type feelings, or whether the fact of you as being so close on a level just highlights for you how far you are behind where you would like to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, it's not just me. It is more of a competitive idea, although it is...It sounds awfully selfish but I would feel awfully bad if I couldn't feel I was at least on an equal position. If we were to go into school - I never having known how to study...I am not using it as an excuse, I don't think. It is just the truth; I have always been poor shit student. And go in and...it would end up a competition - that is what I am afraid of. It is not what I am looking forward - and what I am planning - on; it is just afraid of that's what would happen. I kind of had that happen once in high school. A girl and I were taking the same classes and although I managed to always pull a better grade in that class, it was always still a hassle - I didn't like it. In fact, I didn't like pulling a better grade; I just didn't like the comparison at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That just sounds like that whole situation of measuring yourselves in that kind of way and sometimes it just feels so meaningless. A grade? What's a grade? But you find you have feelings about it. It is almost like you would really like to avoid running into that. 0:15:00.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I really pretty much feel that Jessica...I feel (inaudible 15:13) saying this because I don't believe in such things but my IQ is probably...Jessica is supposed to be smarter than I am. She and I are both quite aware; she had a friend that was teaching - or was an assistant teacher at the high school she was at - and he checked into some records for her. He told me that although he couldn't get into most of them, she was in a special school for the first...God, I don't know, six or seven grades because she is supposed to be at the genius level. I don't doubt it - Jesus, I don't doubt her at all. I don't really know whether I don't want to compete with that or whether I just don't like competition. I know I don't like competition and maybe I am just a little insecure about trying to have to match up, or trying to have to be compared to her, or anything like that but the whole situation bothers me. Jessica: I don't think she has ever even considered that. That just isn't what she thinks about: she wants to get in school quite badly. </p>

<p>Awful bad new about Matt. Some of the guys in the frat - the last meeting - requested that Matt be thrown out of the house because he has been so anti-social and belligerent. He purposely bums people out because he just doesn't give a shit. I wasn't at the meeting or anything since I am not a fraternity member. It just seems that a friend of mine spoke up for him. I agree with him but it wasn't what I said, but what he said was to the effect that throwing Matt out would probably pretty much put him over the edge. He would either commit suicide or be committed himself. I don't know whether they have - or whether they are still going to - but they were supposed to...they decided to agree with this guy and they would go see student mental health first to see if they could find any help there. I don't know what the response was from that. I know Matt knows what is happening: they were quite frank with him. They don't deny that he has bummed and out - that is what he has been trying to do. 0:18:06.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Someone told him - they all told him - that you are going to get kicked out and he just said, "So what? Just kick me out. I don't care." I don't believe it. I don't think that Matt really feels that. I know that it will upset him. I don't know where it is heading. Matt comes from a...I don't know if I told you that...he comes from a Mormon family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I think I remember...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is just two completely different worlds to him: he came up here and the first time he ever did alcohol and dope - well, I suppose he had smoked marijuana - but he did some LSD or (inaudible 19:03) I don't know and that night got seduced by a girl whom (inaudible 19:06) at the same point. He seems to be in a position where he is living one life and feels connected still to another one and they just don't fit. It is really kind of messed up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is kind of like he's being torn apart by the difference between them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It struck me as strange that Matt and I seem to - in the same vein - feel a mistrust in our realizations of reality. I don't feel any conflict at all in the moods of my life in the last four or five years. They are different but they seem to have had a very steady line evolution to where I am now - it all makes sense to me. I can see how it all got here! But I can't really find a comparison in what it is that is upsetting us, unless it is merely in the drug experiences themselves. I have a little trouble believing that an emotional reaction that is so similar can be caused by a drug. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have no trouble?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a little trouble believing that. If our heads were in the same position and we were both subjected to the conditions that a drug puts you in, we might have had the same reaction but we don't seem to have been in the same position so I don't really see how we both ended up in the same place. And anyway, I do see a lot of resemblance in what is bothering us, although I think Matt is by far in a worse shape than I, whereas I occasionally get terrified and freaked out, he is quite convinced that what is around him isn't real. 0:21:12.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I could take that...obviously wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From where you are, it looks like horrible for what little snatches of it you have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It is kind of like when I get into it, it turns in on itself - it is kind of its own vicious circle. Eventually I get out of it somehow or another. I fall asleep; I get exhausted and worn out and just stop thinking altogether, or something like that. From what Matt has said - and from what I have seen - he is just there constantly. Every moment and every thought he has is wrapped up in that. He seems to have just accepted the confusion and terror that it brings to him is what reality is - or whatever it is around him.</p>

<p>Ross Zuckerman, the person I talked about before: he and I are becoming very good friends. The most promising thing that I have noticed about it is that he has refrained from making bitter or purposely biting comments about me. Usually his humor is not humor. If you can put somebody down in a supposedly humorous way, he will do it - no matter how mean it is. One night I was very bummed out and I was just sitting around the house. I don't talk to anybody: I don't make a point of crying on your shoulder but I usually just sit around and mope. Somebody came in and Ross happened to be downstairs. He said, "Is everybody up in John's room?" I was just around the corner, out of sight. He said, "Everybody except Con (sp?) and he is so bummed out he doesn't count." Or something like that. It didn't particularly upset me - I kidded him about it since - but it is kind of typical. He will do that with anyone. I think he has actually taken note that I have been more friendly towards him than most people would be. I don't know if it does any good but I enjoy the fact that at least he doesn't fell quite so uptight around me. 0:24:13.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still can't get to sleep. It seems like every night I come home and just about 10 o'clock - when I know I should be getting sleep - is about the time that I am as awake as ever. But I am still averaging about six hours instead of three so that is a big improvement. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering if...how should I put this...does the fact that Matt may leave have some effect on you? I know you feel sad about it for him but I am wondering if there is anything else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I empathize with him. I mean, I see a reflection of me in Matt. I think Matt is a pretty magnified example but it bothers me. I think it would upset me if Matt were to be committed, which he is awfully close to - I am sure he could be. Also, Matt scares me. I am willing to put up with it. I think I said before that Matt is just as capable as killing someone else as he is himself right now. That is no fantasy of mine at all - Matt has told me as much. I kind of feel that that is my responsibility; that somehow...I feel like Ashley. Ashley doesn't live there, so maybe I shouldn't include him in that, but he said that if we were to kick Matt out right now - just turn our backs on him - I think it would really do the trick for him. He would blow it. If he stays there, we are still in the position where we are susceptible to him as well as he himself. But at least he isn't quite as susceptible, or at least he has that chance; at least he has that opening - and that avenue - of escape from whatever it is that is bothering him. It doesn't bother me that much. I feel like it is my responsibility. If it is a wrong choice, then that is a real shame but it is not a wrong choice in technicality. It is only a wrong choice that the odds happen to turn out wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel like you owe it to him to bear that fear and whatever possible good effect comes from having other people around. You feel like you want to be doing that. 0:27:01.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I just...well, I can't say I can imagine but I know that Matt must be extremely terrified. Even if it has come to the point where he can take it calmly, he is still scared. He has not talked to me like that but he has talked to Jack Larkin about how terrified he is - constantly. It would almost be proving the non-connection of those things around him, to him, if we were to just throw him out an forget about him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would be just reinforcing his view of the world is. I guess I also...this is an inference I am making - I don't remember you saying this - but it sounds to me that there is something very horrible to you to think of a person alone with that terror all of the time. Like I said before, you don't know what effect it has - having him staying there - but somehow if it has any, it is worth doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, well that is from my point. Matt has been with this for many months now, since November, October...somewhere in there. Well, actually since October 17, according to what he said. Nobody else noticed it much until he got back from a camping trip in Seattle - the Olympic Mountains in Washington - sometime around the first of November. Regardless of that, he has told me...one time I was asking him...he made some kind of a witty statement one night in the kitchen - all of us talking. As we were leaving, he made a comment that, to me, I could see a connection in that comment to things we had been saying 30 minutes before that was very, very subtle and very revealing. I asked him about it; I didn't expect to ever find out for sure but he did answer me. He said, "No, no. It had no such subtle inference; I hardly even knew you were there for the main part of the time." Which means that maybe being alone wouldn't bother him but I doubt it. I mean, I doubt that it wouldn't bother him. I think it would. I know it bothers me and that is why I think that. If I really get uptight, down in my room by myself. Even if I don't talk to someone, I want to go up and be around them; and look at them; hear them. 0:30:10.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of know they are there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think if he were to be there by himself - which he is most of the time anyway - but at least when he moves in and out of the house he has to communicate with us. He is forced to realize that even if he doesn't believe in us, he has to cope with us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible 30:37) If those guys go over to student mental health, I am assuming student mental health will say, "Well, you should try to get him in for treatment." Would he go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am afraid not - that is what bothers me. I have been tempted to talk to him about it myself. I know that he holds everybody in a kind of a view of scorn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the word "contempt" came to my mind just before you said that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. We are all just ridiculous. If we are real at all, we are all just pitifully ridiculous figures to him. I don't know whether he would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like from where he is, he would probably, like, experience such an idea as kind of meaningless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. People around him aren't real. A therapist would be no realer to him, I am afraid - nor would the therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gee, that is really painful. Not that I am saying, "Oh, if he would only go to a therapist, he would get better." Who the hell knows? It is not like I think it is the ultimate good but it is very sobering to think of a person in such straits.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am sure Matt is still trying to get himself straightened out. Well, I wouldn't say that...as of a couple of weeks ago - and I have no reason to doubt that it has continued. I am sure that...the reason Jack Larkin is the one person that the talks to...Jack is gay and quite upset by it, or thinks he is - I don't know. He used to be...he was the kind of kid that had special interviews with Goldwater at one point about the communists that are taking over the country. He was a typical, super, ultra, right wing conservative kid that was growing up to be a Republican presidential candidate, or whatever. All of a sudden...he has been in Europe; he has traveled extensively; he came from a backwards family in Alabama and he finds that he is gay and it has just affected him all around. He has dropped out of politics altogether; he doesn't really think that dictatorships are any better than any other kind of policy now. He was a very devout Catholic and now he has even had to completely revise his ideas of what religion and God means to him. He is going through some awfully strong hassles himself but he is also extremely intelligent and very excellent. He has read extensively - both in religion and logics. And Matt seems to be in the same bag right now. I noticed him reading a lot of such things and those are what he talks about with Jack - those type of things - as if he were looking for an answer. 0:34:30.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder is it meaningful to talk to somebody who he knows has gone through some sort of hassle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if he knows about Jack.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Undoubtedly he realizes that Jack is educated and has read all of these things but I don't know whether he knows the hassles that Jack has gone through. It is very likely that I and maybe one other person...two, three other people in the house know about it. I keep almost figuring or expecting, or almost committing a future to the idea that sooner or later, Matt - if he can't at least confirm reality around him, he will just accept the idea that he has to cope with it some way or another, or at least lose some of the terror of it; he will just become kind of numb to it and go on through it. That is more than I usually see in Matt - that is what I see in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The question sounded very...or like, I was tempted to ask did that have anything in it of you? It sounded like that as well. 0:36:03.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is the thing that I grasp quite often; when I get wrapped up in that kind of a thing. If it isn't real, it is painful - whether it is real or not. You may as well respond to it in such a way that you are used to; as if it were real so that at least you can avoid the pain; at least go along with the joke, in other words. It is kind of a second grade wave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I wondered...this might sound like an odd question...is it something that sometimes you sort of expect is going to happen to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which? That I will end up in that position?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that you will have to grapple with what Matt is grappling with. I know from time to time it really grabs you and scares you but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know whether I expected. I think, more or less, I realized the possibility that I could be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope not but I realize that if things should happen wrong, I could very possibly be in that very same situation. I seem to be hyper-aware of any drug induced state. When I was drunk today - I haven't drunken alcohol in any excess in a long, long time - and I was, the entire time, comparing it to another drug. Or saying, "Well, that is really strange; that is a trippy thing to have happen; that is weird." Or something like that. I didn't enjoy it though. I still smoke occasionally and enjoy that but more than ever I enjoy just being normal. That sounds like some kind of a Life magazine, all-American kid quote. "Reality is the real trip." And this kind of shit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounded like that business about that alcohol...for once, you found yourself being very vigilant and very analytical of it, and really finding it actively unpleasant. 0:39:14.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, almost the very position of me being so introspective about it is a hassle but being in that position, the first reaction I have is to look to myself to see what I am doing about it. I'm used to having to be careful of myself in those kinds of positions. It was rather strange; it was unnecessary, possibly, but it was a hassle. I would just as well not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did that mean when you said a minute ago that you are used to the fact that you have to be careful of yourself in those positions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well...in those positions...in those positions. When I am in a state on non-normality - of any distance from that. Mostly, when I am in that kind of position I am using LSD and in those situations, inevitably, for maybe the last five or six times I have dropped - or maybe during the last six minutes, which is about the same thing - I always come to the point that I am quite aware that the questions that cause me to get extremely upset are right there. Then I kind of have to rub shoulders with them and look over the abyss and walk on, or I can get very uptight and get involved in it one way or the other but I can't seem to just avoid them altogether. That doesn't normally happen to me with marijuana because I don't get that stoned but being drunk is a completely unusual situation anyway - having no idea of just how flipped out I was. I was just looking at myself immediately to see where I was, although I wasn't uptight and the situation didn't pose itself to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But just that very process - getting into that process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just being abnormal, I was very aware of where I was and what was going through my mind. It is a depressant: I just don't like being bummed out (inaudible 41:50) any means but it feels like I am really trapped; just sit there and have my head go buzz for four hours - it doesn't me crank me over. Which strange: I had intended not to drink today but out with the old man...I don't know whether he is an alcoholic but he obviously makes it a virtually daily habit of going out and having his three steins of beer, chasing down three shot glasses of whiskey. Today, since I was there, we had to get into it a little heavier then. They don't mix to start with and I don't drink to start with, so I was really screwed up. He seems like a lonely old man and it was really nice to think that he was having a good time. I was: I really enjoyed talking to him. It is so interesting to see somebody that must have an entirely different perspective from me, and yet we get along so well. It kind of reconstitutes your feeling that people can get along if they just get off of their hang-ups. 0:43:19.0</p>

<p>I stopped writing letters last January after I got fed up with not getting letters from Jessica. I wrote maybe two or three letters - during that time that I wasn't writing to Jessica - to other people. After the last time that I was in Boise, I decided that I should possibly start writing again because I felt that it was selfish interest that I wasn't writing. I wrote maybe a half a page a couple of times and just thought, "God, that is pure bullshit," tore it up and threw it away. I was kind of wondering if - when Jessica finally did start writing and other people or whatever - whether I would still be in a position that I didn't want to write but it seems that the only prompting I needed was to get me a life - I have been writing like that! 0:45:01.0</p>

<p>I am hungover. It is kind of sad to come home from work hungover! One thing that...as of yet, it really doesn't really make much difference to me but it has come to mind, is that sooner or later I am going to have to start dealing with it again: the civil case on that car accident is finally starting to come around now. Sometime in the next month and a half to three months I am going to have to go to Boise and give a deposition to the other side's attorneys. I can't get too excited about that. The criminal case upset me very, very badly and, especially, being convicted - Jesus! I was just...it was never real to me. I mean, it just couldn't happen and when it did, it was so f****** poor. I was so mad I could have ripped off the entire God damn state and I was just so sick. I didn't even want to live to do it. I just didn't know what to do. It was completely wrong. I still think that it's wrong; I know it is wrong; by law it is wrong - I got bought. But the civil case, I have just given up on and the son of a bitch and mother f****** I just...I hate to use language like that, but I just hate them so bad right now. They were willing to stick me for the rest of my life with a felony manslaughter arrest record. All of the money that it cost me; all of everything else that it cost me just by doing it and having to go through with it for their pound of flesh of revenge. Plus now they can get to the money part and that is 50 per cent of it too - what they are after. I have almost conceded it - I really don't give a damn. The insurance company can take care of it. They are suing me for $36,000. I have insurance up to $25,000 and I don't think they can collect over $15,000 at the absolute most. 0:49:13.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is another case...by law, they can't collect a damn thing. In Idaho there is a thing called contributory neglect, I don't know if I mentioned it to you before. In an accident case, some states say in that in a contributory neglect, it is up to the court to decide how negligent the people were. If they were 10 per cent negligent in a case and you were 90 per cent, you have to pay 90 per cent of the claim that is up in court. In Idaho, if there is contributory neglect involved, the case is null and void. It can't be brought to court. Well, an 18-month-old child at night, a block from its parents' house by itself out on the busy street is just as much...you can't deny contributory neglect. So by law, it shouldn't even get to court but, then again, the guy is rich. He has got influence and he may buy this through - I don't know. I have just given up on any hope of real justice in the whole case. I think everybody is f*****. I wish they would just curl up and go all away. I can't even feel bad about it anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like they have turned it into something really sordid and dirty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I felt sorry for the whole thing. Now I feel sorry because I can't feel sorry for her. I think there was meaning. It was a bad accident. It was a hopeless case of everything happened wrong but, Jesus Christ, to add all of this on top of it is just blasphemy. 0:51:01.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like they have absolutely no feeling for, I don't know, for the things...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are turning it into a circus of advantage. It is like, I almost feel bad about...that isn't right...I feel bad for them and about them. They don't seem to have any regret for their own child being dead. God, I don't know. I feel sorry for them too, Jesus. The mother's father is the one that is instigating it all, I think. I am damn sure he is the one that got me arrested. He is the one that got the case rolling and all of that. I also heard from their lawyer that he is the one who instigated it and I also heard through my lawyer - I heard from their lawyer - the reason that they had gone ahead and agreed to do was because they felt guilty. They wanted to - at least in their own conscious - be relieved of the situation. If I was convicted, shit, it isn't their fault any more. I can almost accept that. I am almost willing to say it is my fault, although I don't believe it. At least they don't have to feel bad about it. I can not feel bad and publicly say it is my fault, go home and I know better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is like a perversion (inaudible 52:37).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, this is playing business with somebody else's life. This is sick - it is really poor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like shutting out a real portion of their own experience and also just very cold-heartedly being allowed to push somebody else around and really affect their life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't know where it will all end up. I explained to you why I had to plead nolo...well, not had to but why I did. To me, I had to plead nolo contendere to the original homicide. I would have been convicted of that in all likelihood anyway and have to serve jail if I went ahead with it in court. Also, at the time, I probably would want to go to law school and a felony would keep me out. I found in the meantime that even an arrest felony is very, very likely to keep me out of law school. Jesus Christ, if that comes off, I don't know. Right now I have the feeling - I wish they would just God damn stop but if that should happen, I would almost want revenge and that is something I have never believed in. It has always struck me as stupid and childish. Revenge and jealousy are two things that never made much sense to me. They are feelings that seem to come spontaneously to people. I feel like they should have been bred out; people should have evolved past that point at one time or another. It seems like we should be at a point where that isn't necessary any longer but I know they are in me - I have felt them before. Not in this case before but I feel that is a strong enough influence on me that I couldn't necessarily be objective to the point where I wouldn't feel those things. 0:54:45.7</p>

<p>I resent what they are doing - I never thought of it this way before but I like to look at myself from different angles. I resent what they are doing very much. I also resent what they are making me do with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say that being seized with feelings of revenge an that kind of thing is just another awful aspect of this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are forcing me to be something that I try not to be - that I don't want to be. I have had very bitter ideas about it. After the court scene last time, I saw the mother and father out in the hall and they were only partially successful in the extent of that court room scene. They got their pound of flesh - they knew I was really f***** up. I mean, they knew they had gotten an arrest record on me - they had gotten two arrest records. They had me convicted for just a major as misdemeanor as possible. There is only a hair's breadth of difference between negligent homicide and manslaughter. It is a nolo contendere so it means that it is not admissible - that court verdict isn't admissible - in a civil case. So they kind of came out half successful: they got their pound of flesh but the didn't get the weight to carry over in our next court room battle. I saw them in the hall afterwards. Everybody else was in another room but I just walked out. I didn't want to see anybody. I was crying - I just didn't want to be around anybody. I wanted to hit a wall or kick something - anything. I just damn near walked up and asked them if their dead baby felt a whole lot better after all of this and realized that they were probably quite hurt with the whole scene too. I am sure they didn't enjoy having to get on the stand and relive the whole scene. </p>

<p>The mother saw the accident, although she pissed me off more than the father. She was willing to get on the stand but she wasn't truthful. I hate saying this even now because it sounds like it is still my bag. I mean, she lied about me and all this shit - she did. she was obviously coached for nine or 10 God damn months on what to say. Minor things about how the kid wore a green suit. And she goes, "Yes, a bright green suit. The kid had on an OD - an (inaudible 57:58) drab, green jump suit. My car was a GTO, which isn't exactly the mildest car in the world but I drove it quite sanely. I was driving very calmly at the time. She explained how she heard the mufflers accelerate as I gunned it from the stoplight. They said, "Gunned it - you heard the accelerator." Of course, that was planned. She said, "Yes, a souped-up car like any kid would like." This kind of shit just really pissed me off. Did she have to be so brutal - did she even have to be liar? </p>

<p>Plus, all this didn't amount to shit until they supposedly got a new witness - that is what supposedly brought it to court. It turned out that their new witness was an ex-neighbor who was a prostitute from Australia. She taught her three daughters to be prostitutes. We finally moved away we couldn't stand them so bad. She used to brag to me about the money she made. She was an alcoholic. She got in court and explained how, 10 minutes before the accident happened, she saw me pull out to the intersection a few hundred feet from where it happened - from a different direction from where I came. She recognized it was me, although she hadn't seen me except for once in over...let me see...it would be over four years. The time that she seen me was the time before when I had short hair and I was clean shaven then. She recognized my car, although she had never seen it before. She recognized the dent in the left hand side of the car, although I was on the left hand side - there was no way that she could have seen the left hand side of my car. In other words, I am sure she was bought off. I haven't bothered to check into it but from what I have heard - from what I see - she got in trouble with the law; the bail bondsman got her off and she owed him a favor. I say that as just my ideas but if it is not right I am really going to be surprised, and if it is not right, I know it is something awfully close to that. She owed him a favor. I hold just as much against her as I do the mother. She had nothing to gain by that. 1:00:26.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is just like a locked-in mentality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There was no purpose to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess also it sounds like you had to watch all this unfolding and you were powerless to prove that it was a lie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it was so pitiful as I was sitting there listening to this bullshit going on on the stand and my lawyer is so God damned dumb he cannot talk. These people are coating through these scenes and I am sitting there, shaking my head, going, : " God, this is crazy." I am writing down what I want said and he is so f****** dumb. He can't realize what is going on. Even the lawyer from the insurance company - I told you about before - he is as bewildered as I am by the insanity my supposed lawyer is perpetrating. He can't talk; he can't ask questions; he is not making sense. It would be surprisingly easy to make it clear that these people are assholes. All he had to do was ask this one woman, "How did you see a dent on the left side of that car when it was on the left side of you and you were on the right side of the car you were in? And it was night - how did you recognize it? It has been four years..." He couldn't even figure that out. He let it go: he dropped - he closed the thing and came back and sat down. We could have closed that case right there - if not proved that she perjured herself. We could have at least proved that she was full of shit and what she was saying wasn't true. The case would have had to be closed right now because she was a subpoenaed witness. They had to admit that what she was saying was part of their case and if we can prove part of their case to be bullshit, they had to start all over, or most likely they would have had to drop the case. I could have won my case right there but I had to sit there and watch it happen. Right now, I sound awfully bitter - normally I don't feel it. I don't think about it. Like I said, I am just ready to concede it. It is a bunch of shit that (inaudible 1:02:58). 1:03:01.5</p>

<p>And here we are! It's strange: I come in here and I don't really know...a lot of times...like today, I was feeling hungover, like I said, and I didn't know that I would really have anything to say, yet I managed to make it through the hour talking about stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't tell whether that's...like, I see that that surprises you but I can't tell though, how you say that, whether you go away and think that, "Well, that was a..." I guess what is hitting me is that, "I managed to get through the hour." I am wondering is that a drudgery or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no - not in the least. It surprises me that...I don't know whether I have the vocabulary to explain it...It is like I am going to come in with a feeling that I am going to sit here and just stare out the window and not say anything like I have done a couple of times. I get done with the hour and I look back and I'm, "Where did I ever find all of those things to talk about?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You amaze yourself that you can just generate it all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without at least having it on my mind to start with. That, and I never know where I am going to end up. Like here we are on the court case and that was probably one of the farthest things from my mind, or I thought so, or I didn't think at all of it when I came in. If you would have mentioned it when I first came in, it would have been, seemingly, the farthest thing from my mind. Well, let's close down - I can get back in time for turkey dinner! 1:04:49.0</p>

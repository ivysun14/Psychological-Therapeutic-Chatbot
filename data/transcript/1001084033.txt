<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's been a very sad and stressful month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> August the 6th, my dear friend and neighbor, [NAME OTHER], passed away. And I didn't get to say goodbye to her. The last time I saw her was the day after I got home from California because they were watching [NAME OTHER]. [NAME OTHER] was staying with them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who's them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] and her daughter, [NAME OTHER]. [NAME OTHER] always takes care of my [NAME OTHER] when I'm away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, the day before, the 5th, [NAME OTHER] and I were out all day running around looking for a new refrigerator for myself. Went to 5 different places. We were out all day and [NAME OTHER] was watching [NAME OTHER] again. Well, [NAME OTHER] was failing quickly and [NAME OTHER] never did this before. She went right up the stairs to [NAME OTHER] bedroom and sat right next to [NAME OTHER]. So we thought that was a sign that somehow [NAME OTHER] knew that it was time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old was [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seventy five.  She was young, but she was very sick. I did get a hug from her when I picked up [NAME OTHER] we talked for about a half hour. And she said, oh, come on, give me a hug and I told her stay healthy. And that was the last time I saw her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they have a memorial service?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They only had a service at the side of the cemetery.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Graveside.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. She didn't want a wake. She didn't want a funeral. Uh, they really didn't have any particular religion but her sister is Lutheran and they had a Lutheran pastor. And he did something I've never seen before. He had ashes, and I don't know if they were from palm like the Catholics do, and he made the sign of the cross on her coffin. And, um, her coffin was beautiful. It was material. It was light blue with flowers and ivy and it was, and [NAME OTHER] went with me so that was a big support.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you were there, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's her daughter doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's doing good. I talked to her today. We talk just about every day. We're kind of buddies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. So and, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, when there's a loss like that I think the expression is you celebrate the life of.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the end of life is always.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wait 'til you hear this though. She's had signs from her mother. This is what we think anyway. Uh, [NAME OTHER], after her mom passed and was out of the house, uh, [NAME OTHER] started looking through paperwork, yknow, for financial whatever. There was a music box that played, oh what, Edelweiss. And it hadn't been wound, hadn't been used. It started to play. So we thought that's [NAME OTHER] telling her that she's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is she from Austria or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she just loved that song.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, then they saw, I was there when she saw it too, there was a particular butterfly that [NAME OTHER] always loved and it's not usual for it to be out now at this time of the season. Well, we saw the butterfly. Yeah. And then so after that Saturday the11th, I had a wonderful day at White Stars. There were people with horses. I made 100 dollars' worth of items. Somebody bought a 40 dollar book on people of the pinelands. And then there were ladies I shared the video to about White Stars. And it was a wonderful day. So then the next day, that day I talked to my mom I told her what a wonderful day I had. The next day I get a call from her, my dad was in the hospital. He had gotten sick in the church and he actually couldn't stand up. He has bilateral pneumonia in the base of his lungs. And he sounded really bad. I thought we were losing him. So now he's progressed. He's in the rehab unit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've been talking to him every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he sounds better and?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he does sound better, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does he feel better?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He says he does. My dad's not 1 to complain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, in the rehab unit and not in the intensive care unit then that's a good sign.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good. And pneumonia's very treatable too, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he's been on Levaquin. I've been having all these nightmares, um, first 1 I was in this huge room and there are hundreds and thousands of people. And you were there but you wouldn't talk to me and you wouldn't acknowledge me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In this room with a hundred thousand people?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And I found you in all those people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I had a dream that I was buried and they were putting the dirt over my face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was this after the, uh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> After the burial.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my dad, after my dad too. And then another weird 1. There was a man off in the distance and there was a nest, and this is almost where I'm looking at your elephants, he had an erection and it was the size of like either an elephant or a whale.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it was disproportionate.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And it didn't do anything to me. It was just off in the distance. So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. But those were all dreams at night while you were sleeping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No visions or intrusive thoughts or suicidal or anything during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had thoughts of suicide a little bit, yeah. No plans or anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any pattern or anything that triggered it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just the anxiety, losing my dad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, when your dad was sick, okay. So you were afraid, yknow. This was after the funeral too, your neighbor's funeral.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you probably were, you just had that experience with your neighbor and, but it sounds like she was sick for a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then your dad got sick. Yknow, he had a different kind of illness that was very treatable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old's your dad now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think he's 74.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So close in age, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it makes sense you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You hear about people dying from pneumonia, like [NAME OTHER] died from bronchial pneumonia. And in fact her anniversary of her death is next Sunday. I ordered a floral wreath with a banner with her name on it. And I'm going to take it to the grave. [NAME OTHER] going to go with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we're also going to Bridesburg to take pictures of [NAME OTHER] mural, yknow, [NAME OTHER] my friend. Well, there's a mural on their recreation center there. Well, that was his beat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, that's where he worked. Okay. Makes sense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He wasn't from Bridesburg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he was from Port Richmond a couple houses down from me. I grew up with him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then he had lived up in the farther northeast, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. No, he lives in Port Richmond.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, he still lives in Port Richmond?  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I had the impression that he moved further up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think he had a beat further off. And, um, good news, [NAME OTHER] a grandmother, my roommate. She's going to go out to London in September for 3 weeks to stay with the baby. Uh, then they're going to do the christening if it's too soon or not. I don't know. She's just 11 days old now. But she'll be a month when [NAME OTHER] goes out. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, [NAME OTHER] got a job, a wonderful job at the [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] a little town north of Napa. She's going to be coordinating, uh, activities and things like that and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> More of a 9 to 5 job.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, Monday through Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As opposed to that other job that she had?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, taking care of the lady they didn't get along.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it was like 24/7 it sounded like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Well, she's been doing 24/7 with my brother's girls and my mom told me today, I didn't know this, apparently they don't get along well at all. They're fighting all the time. And [NAME OTHER] like stop, just stop. Stressful for her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. So I sent off, I wrote a letter to her today wishing her well and she, um, needs another lawyer. She's having problems with the current one that she's got, so her mom asked if I would call my lawyer when I got divorced and see if he knows anybody in Alexander, Virginia, 'cause that's where she's getting a divorce from, so it's got to be somebody there. So that's the good news.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I got your little letter too since our last visit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, did you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Sounds like a good e-mail.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] from the priest.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now with my medicine I need a script for Restoril and the Klonopin I've been taking like 2 a day at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wrong number.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wrong number. But anyway I've been taking 2 of the Klonopin and if I keep doing that I'm going to run out in a week and a half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let's get your [INAUDIBLE] first. I'll just do that and we'll go to the others. Your blood test was good again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, good. [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Normal, 2.6.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's okay. So besides the dreams, hallucinations have been pretty stable? Haven't had any?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, [INAUDIBLE] voices now. I wanted to call you several times but I refrained. I didn't want to bother you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe that's what that dream was about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which 1?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The 1 where you saw me in a crowd, and something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh. I talked to [NAME OTHER]. He's doing really well with his business. He bought a house in Melbourne which is on the east coast. So he's on the west. But he bought it for work. Apparently he's going to be hiring people to man the east coast of Australia.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great. So his business is doing well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All my brothers are doing great with their finances.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So no other trips to Australia planned, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, because they're coming out in May I think, or June, I'm not sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To California?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not the east coast.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. Uh, more morbid stuff. Um, I, uh, went ahead and got my, uh, birth certificate from the city and I had 2 copies. I put one in my safe deposit box and I noticed my will hasn't been updated since before [NAME OTHER] died. So I've been working on that and, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that morbid?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, talking about death.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good thing. That takes care of, I mean, makes sure that what your wishes and wants are if anything were to happen are taking care of.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I already talked to [NAME OTHER]. Whatever pooch I have, she's going to be, she told me she's going to be godmother.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, uh, my mom is going to, we're going to talk about it when things cool down with my dad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About your will?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About my will because there's some things I'm not sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you need Restoril prescription?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Restoril and Klonopin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you've been taking 2 a day but you need more than 60 a month or have you had sometimes are you taking 3?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I take 2.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So 60 was, I guess the month is being longer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, my date when I got it filled was July the 19th.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And today is August the 21st.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So is there renewals on that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. That's why I'm telling you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. If I write it the same way that we've been writing it for 60 a month, that still lasts.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not like you're running out early; it's just that you need a new renewal, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll wait to fill that 'cause I still, and the insurance probably won't let me fill it yet anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Didn't we call in the Luvox at some point here in the last month or 2?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, Luvox is fine. In fact, last night I finished what I had and I have new scripts starting tonight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We have your next visit already set too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you mind going ahead and planning my visits 'til December?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure. Didn't we do that already?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think we went past September.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know it's going to be early because your dentist appointment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, January. Oh, you mean, the December 1 is the 11th.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, that's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it'd be, you'd go around the, it'd be like 3 weeks in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. That sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that how you usually go?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Probably going to do 2 weeks. I don't know if I can handle 3.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you've got a few weeks in there to play with.</p>

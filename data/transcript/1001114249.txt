<center><P><B>GESTALT THERAPY WITH CHILDREN</B></P></center>

<center><P><B>Introduction</B></P></center>

<P><B>Violet Oaklander, PhD</B> is internationally renowned for her unique approach, incorporating Gestalt Therapy and expressive techniques with children and adolescents. She has received several awards, and authored numerous articles, as well as two books: the classic <I>To Our Children: A Gestalt Therapy Approach to Children and Adolescents</I> and the recently released, <I>Hidden Treasure: A Map to the Child's Inner Self</I>.</P>

<P>Dr. Oaklander has a knack for getting her clients to speak honestly and reveal their difficult feelings. In this session, she meets with a boy who is angry with his father but unable to express it directly. Watch as she gauges the boy’s level of contact throughout the session, and masterfully provides openings for him to show cut-off parts of himself. She then collaborates to develop real-world strategies for ongoing expression of his difficult emotions.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Blake, hi. You know, I have this clay, and you can touch it. I mean, I….It’s kind of a hard, it’s kind of hard. That’s why I asked them to bring me some water in case you….And I have some paper towel in case you want to get, you know, if you need it.</P>

<P>And you know what I thought we would do with it. I like to do a little exercise, but before that I like to do something else that kind of shows all the different things you can do with clay.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: In the past, you’ve had, you’ve worked, what did you do with it? Do you remember?</P>

<P>Blake: I drew—not drew—made people.</P>

<P>Oaklander: People, yeah.</P>

<P>Blake: Trees.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Right. Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: All that…</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, this is kind of fun. So I’m going to tell you do a, different things. I’m going to do them and you’ll do them and I want to see…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …if you can, like, what you like doing and what you don’t like doing. Okay?</P>

<P>Blake: Okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. So first—and you might think of some things, too—first, we’re going to pinch the clay. Let’s just, you know, pinch it. You know, like if somebody comes up and pinches your cheek.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Like you’re pinching them back here. Pinch the clay. Okay. Now we’re going to…let’s see. We’re going to poke holes in the clay like this. Poke, poke the clay. Just poke the clay. Makes all these interesting marks. Okay. Now we’re going to tear the clay. Tear it apart. Just tear it apart. Just rip it apart. Big pieces and little pieces. Just rip it apart. Okay. Alright.</P>

<P>Now the thing that’s so great about clay is that you can rip it apart but you can also….</P>

<P>Blake: Put it back.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Right. Put it….Exactly. Put it back…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …together. Right. So, now we’re going to put it all together. Get yourself a big bunch of clay because you need a big bunch of clay because we’re going to kind of throw it down. See how I…. Throw it down. Throw it down. Just throw it. See how hard you can throw it. Throw it. Right. That’s right. Good. Now, the thing is when you throw the clay it makes a nice….See how flat? It makes a nice flat thing.</P>

<P>Blake: Very smooth.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So let’s smooth it. Let’s pat it. Let’s pat the clay and let’s pat it and kind of, you know, make a nice little groove and pat it. And maybe we could slap it a little. And we could slap it harder. We could do a drum, kind of a drumbeat. The clay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. Let’s see. What else can we do with the clay? We can lift it up, and we can squeeze it. We can squeeze it. And we can squeeze it. Alright. We can rip off a little piece—you’ve probably done this—and make a….</P>

<P>Blake: Ball.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, I’m making a snake.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: A snake. Yeah. But you could also make a ball, but you know, when you make a ball, you have to turn it this way. This way, yeah. That’s it. And then you can throw the ball, and it can throw down on the floor. There it is back there. Okay.</P>

<P>Now let’s see. Can you think of anything else we could do with the clay?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, no. You know, you could….Did you ever bore a hole in the clay?</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: All the way…. Let’s see if you could get kind of a thick piece, see if you could bore a…. See how I got my finger all the way through?</P>

<P>Blake: It’s going through.</P>

<P>Oaklander: It’s, it’s coming through. And then, if you look through that hole, you can just decide what you want to look at, you know. I see you. Okay. So now let’s just bunch it all up again. And if you want to, you can use more. I don’t, you know, know if you like the big piece or….</P>

<P>Blake: This is fine. Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, you know what we haven’t done? Okay. We can punch the clay. Punch the clay. Punch it with the side or your knuckles or your back of your hands. Do your other hand. Both hands.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Try both hands. See how it….</P>

<P>Okay, now let’s…Watch it. Before we go do this next thing I want to do, tell me what, which of those things did you like doing the best? Or…. You don’t have to say that. Which of those things did you like? You know, maybe you liked something today and tomorrow you like something different, but you know.</P>

<P>Blake: Right. I liked making the snake.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Did you really?</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah. I used to do that a lot in elementary school.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Make just a bunch of snakes?</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And scare people with them or no?</P>

<P>Blake: I don’t really like real snakes but I just made snakes. Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I liked…. I liked throwing it. I really like throwing it.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. Is there something we did that you didn’t like too much?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: No. You liked… I…. Yeah. I sometimes don’t like poking it because it gets on my nails….</P>

<P>Blake: I didn’t like driving it through. I guess. My finger’s weak or something. Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, I see. That was…. Well, you had a pretty thick piece. That’s why.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay now, I want you to just take your clay. How it…. Let me see how it feels. Oh, that’s…not bad. And I just want you to put both hands on it. And I want you to close your eyes and then take a deep breath. When you let the air out, imagine it’s going right down your arms into the clay. Try that again.</P>

<P>Now this clay, it sort of has a lot of your energy in it if you’ve been fooling with it. So what I want you to do is with your eyes closed…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …at first, start making something with the clay. It could be just a shape. Or it could, or you could imagine you’re making an animal or a person or a, you know, you might think you’re making something. It might not turn out to be that because your eyes are closed.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And it might just be a shape or it might be a thing. Whatever. Just let your fingers move the clay and sometimes the clay tells you where it wants to go and sometimes you just have to push so it will know where it wants to go. So just let yourself with your eyes closed make something. And you’ll be surprised because your eyes are closed.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And after awhile, when you want to, you can open your eyes and finish it off and turn it around. Look on the back and finish it. But don’t change it. Just kind of finish it like you want to. Okay.</P>

<P>Now since this was, since you, a lot of your energy is in this clay, it really is a part of you. So what I’d like you to do is to be this piece of clay and tell me about yourself.</P>

<P>Oaklander: "I’m this piece of clay." And you could just describe how you look or whatever. Just tell me about yourself as this piece of clay.</P>

<P>Blake: I don’t know how to really describe myself. Well, um, this is supposed to be a whale.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. "I’m a whale."</P>

<P>Blake: Whales swim.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, okay. Now here’s what I want you: you’re the clay. So you have to say, "I’m a whale. I swim." You know.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay. I’m a whale and I like to swim. I like to go underwater and go really deep. I like to eat fish. And that’s about it.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So do you get a lot of fish to eat?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah? And are you a young whale or an older whale?</P>

<P>Blake: An older whale.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. How do you know that? Is…. It seems…. Is that because you have a lot of cracks and things. You’re older. You’ve been around a long time.</P>

<P>Blake: Right. Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Hmm?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. Because it has, pretty disabled, you know.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Pretty what?</P>

<P>Blake: Disabled.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, it’s disabled. And like what, there are some things you can’t do anymore, whale?</P>

<P>Blake: Probably can’t swim that fast.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Has that become a problem for you?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Do you have anybody after you any time?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Are you pretty safe in the water?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. I feel comfortable.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You feel comfortable. Well, whale, are you by yourself or do you have a family?</P>

<P>Blake: I have a family.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Who’s in your family?</P>

<P>Blake: My mother, my playground mother and my sister.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You have a lot of family. Whale families.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: They swim with you or are you pretty independent? Or maybe they, maybe you’d like to be more independent? I don’t know.</P>

<P>Blake: They sort of swim with me.</P>

<P>Oaklander: They sort of swim with you.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Do they bother you?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: No. They let you kind of go off by yourself sometimes?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: They do? That’s good…good, whale. You’re a pretty neat whale.</P>

<P>Blake: Thank you.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. Yeah. I’m just wondering if there’s anything about your whale that’s for you, Blake, that you could say, "Yeah, I’m like that, too," or, "That’s like my life, too." Or….</P>

<P>Blake: During the summer, I basically live in the water.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Really?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: That’s one of your favorite things to do, swim?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. Swim. I’m very active. Whales are active. Yeah. That’s about it.</P>

<P>Oaklander: That’s about it. Well, that’s a lot, too. Yeah. Do you feel safe in your life? I mean, the whale feels safe in the water. Do you feel safe?</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah, very safe.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Very safe. And it sounds like the whale family…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …is a little bit like your family. I have a feeling…. I don’t know. You have a sister?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And a mother and a playground—What is that, a playground mother?</P>

<P>Blake: She’s not my real grandmother, but she acts like it. She—</P>

<P>Oaklander: I see. I see. I bet that’s nice, too.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And what about your father?</P>

<P>Blake: He lives in Indiana and I don’t see him much.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Your father…. Your parents divorced?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. You wish you could see him more or….</P>

<P>Blake: Sometimes, yes. In different situations.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Like what do you mean?</P>

<P>Blake: I like to play basketball a lot and I wish I could see him more to play basketball.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, that’s hard when your dad lives far away like that. Is that far away? I don’t know. I know I live far away.</P>

<P>Blake: Twenty minutes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Twenty minutes from….</P>

<P>Blake: Homewood. I live in Homewood. A drive.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, and he’s…. It’s a 20 minute drive. Oh, that’s not very far away.</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I get mixed up between the Midwestern states because I live in California.</P>

<P>Blake: Right. Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I’ve got to study my geography.</P>

<P>Well, that’s not very far away at all. So he doesn’t really spend much time with you, then.</P>

<P>Blake: No. It’s sometimes nice because when he does, we watch—I like basketball, yeah—we watch the NBA basketball games together. And yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, that’s nice.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, you know what I’d like you to do? You know you said that you…. You could put your whale over here. You know. We can put that over here.</P>

<P>You said you like, you make, you know how to make people. You know, and the thing that’s great about clay is that you can make this kind of very rough thing and it’s, you know, and there’s a person.</P>

<P>Oaklander: It’s very…. It doesn’t have to be like a perfect…. But I’d like you to make your family out of clay. Like people. Like maybe your mother and your sister and your grandmother and then your father, too, because that’s your, he’s part of your family.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. You want me to help you? I’d be glad to help you if you want me to.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. That’d be fine.</P>

<P>Oaklander: If I helped you?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So you…. Who would you like me to make?</P>

<P>Blake: My mother.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. So how…. I don’t know how big your people are going to be.</P>

<P>Blake: Well, my mother’s going to be short.</P>

<P>Oaklander: But in your…. If you make…. In your clay people, are they going to be about…. I don’t want to make them a different size, you know. If I make—Who are you making?</P>

<P>Blake: I’m going to make my dad and my sister.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. So is this about the size or is that too small?</P>

<P>Blake: That’s fine.</P>

<P>Blake: That’s my grandmother.</P>

<P>Oaklander: That’s good.</P>

<P>Blake: Thank you.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So is there somebody else you want me to make?</P>

<P>Blake: My sister.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Is she younger than you or older?</P>

<P>Blake: Older.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Older. Taller than you or….</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah, she’s two inches taller than me.</P>

<P>Oaklander: How old is she?</P>

<P>Blake: Thirty.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And you’re 12?</P>

<P>Blake: Thirteen.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Thirteen. You’re 13.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And she’s….</P>

<P>Blake: Thirty.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Thirty. Oh, much older.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh.</P>

<P>Blake: She’s my half sister.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I see. Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: Here’s my dad. He’s pretty tall.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Ah.</P>

<P>Blake: Might not stand up correctly.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You’re fairly tall. I guess you’re going to be tall like your dad.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You like to play basketball.</P>

<P>Okay. Okay. Does that…could that be your sister?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. That’s perfect.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, your people are really better than my people, but I’m not going to compare. That’s fine. They’re both good.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. So there they are. That’s your family, right.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Now how about you?</P>

<P>Blake: Ah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: I have long legs, so I’ll make my legs long.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay.</P>

<P>There you are. Alright. Now, there’s your, there are the family. So well, does your sister live with you?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: No. So your sister lives…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …over here somewhere.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And this is your mother. And this is your….</P>

<P>Blake: Grandmother.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Grandmother. They don’t live together. Do they live together?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So they all kind of live in separate spaces. But you live with your mother.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You live with your mother. And your dad’s over here someplace. Okay. Now I want you to imagine that you—there you are—you could talk to them and you could tell them one thing you like and one thing you don’t like about each one. Who do you want to go first? Who do you want to—I’ll move it for you.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright? Or do you want to move it?</P>

<P>Blake: No, you can move it.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. So we’re talking to your sister. What’s her name?</P>

<P>Blake: Ebony.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Ebilene?</P>

<P>Blake: Ebony.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Ebony.</P>

<P>Blake: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Ebony, one thing I like about you….Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: One thing I like about her is that…</P>

<P>Blake: …she spends time with me when I go over, over to her house.</P>

<P>Oaklander: "You spend time with me when I go over to your house." Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: And the thing I don’t like about her…. She sort of treats me more like I’m younger. And she does this weird thing when I have a birthday and says that I’m not 13; I’m 7 or…. And treats me like I’m younger sometimes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. Did you hear that? Because that’s a lot to repeat: "You treat me like I’m younger sometimes, and I don’t like that."</P>

<P>Okay. Who do you want to do next?</P>

<P>Blake: That’s my mother.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. "Mom." You just say, "One thing I like about you is…" as if you were talking for this.</P>

<P>Blake: Alright. One thing I like…</P>

<P>Blake: …about you is that you take me downtown and to lots of places, that you carry me around to basketball practice and swim practice and a lot of things.</P>

<P>And the thing I don’t like about you is that you sort of run things in the ground to me.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Say that again?</P>

<P>Blake: She runs things in the ground to me, and when I do bad on something, she’ll talk about it through the whole car ride or….</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh. "You talk, you talk, run things into the ground with me and talk about things like, and talk about them and talk about them."</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. Okay. Here’s your grandmother.</P>

<P>Blake: The thing I like about….</P>

<P>Oaklander: You.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, yeah. The thing I like about you is that you let me come over anytime I want to and the thing I don’t like about you—it’s not that good of a reason but—you won’t let me eat in the family room or any other room than the kitchen.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, that’s got value, something you don’t like, so that’s good. I mean, it’s…. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You don’t have to judge it, you know.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. Like some things are better not liking and other things. I think that’s a good one.</P>

<P>Blake: Alright.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. Your dad. Oh, we’re running this to the ground.</P>

<P>Blake: One thing I like about my dad—</P>

<P>Oaklander: You.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Talk to him. Yeah.</P>

<P>Blake: One thing I like about you is that when you do spend time with me, or when you do have time…</P>

<P>Blake: …to spend with me, you use it wisely. You use it wisely.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You use a…?</P>

<P>Blake: He uses it wisely.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Wisely?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh.</P>

<P>Blake: And the thing I don’t like about you is that you don’t use that time a lot.</P>

<P>Oaklander: There isn’t enough of that time.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. Not enough of that time.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. That was pretty good. Is there anything else you want to say to them or ask for something from them or—I mean, I don’t know. Is anything else….</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. Alright, let’s put this, let’s put this away. Sorry we have to…. But you know, there’s one more thing I wanted to do but we’ve got to put these away.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Is that okay if we just throw them in here?</P>

<P>Blake: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay.</P>

<P>Blake: There’s your….</P>

<P>Oaklander: The whale. The whale’s swimming right into….</P>

<P>Do you…. Do you ever…. How do you express…. When you’re, when you don’t like something, does it, do you feel mad or….</P>

<P>Blake: Frustrated.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Frustrated.</P>

<P>Blake: Frustrated.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. And what I’d like you to do is show me a little bit about how you feel frustrated. Let’s say you could hit this clay in a frustrated way. What is, what is that like for you to hit clay frustrated?</P>

<P>Blake: I don’t want to hit the table. I have bad aim.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, it’s a pretty sturdy table. I don’t think it will…. If you want, I’ll take these off, so I’ll put this over here. I’ll hold it.</P>

<P>Oaklander: We can add a little more clay.</P>

<P>Blake: Okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: That might help a bit. Could I add your what may be alleged whale?</P>

<P>Blake: Okay, yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Bye, whale. Okay, we could, because that might help you. Okay. Frustrated. Okay.</P>

<P>Now, do you ever get mad at anything?</P>

<P>Blake: What I could get mad about is when I really need to do something important and people don’t take me seriously or my mother doesn’t take me seriously.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Seriously, your mother doesn’t take you seriously. But that, that kind of thing makes you mad.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I want you to hit the clay like you’re mad now.</P>

<P>Blake: Alright.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay. Now, great. Keep hitting it because, you know, when you’re mad you have to hit it more than….</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay, now…. Great. Now maybe you could say, imagine your mother, like this is your mother, and while you’re hitting it you could say, "I want you to take me seriously."</P>

<P>Blake: Alright. I want you to take me seriously.</P>

<P>Oaklander: More. Again. A couple more times.</P>

<P>Blake: Alright.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. Is it hard for you to say when you’re mad to people or your mother or your father?</P>

<P>Blake: No.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You’re good at telling them when you don’t like something or when something makes you mad?</P>

<P>Blake: Well, my mother, I’m very good at telling her.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah?</P>

<P>Blake: Other family members that I stood up, I don’t see them as much as I do my mother.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, not really mad at them so much but, you know, most kids, if they’re mad, they’ll either, they’ll be mad at mother or father. You know, the close, those are the people…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …they get mad at.</P>

<P>Blake: I take things out on my mother sometimes, I believe.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Take it out on her, like where it belongs to something else and then….</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. When I come home from my father’s house and something didn’t go right, I can’t, I don’t take it out on my father. He doesn’t spend enough time with me anyway, so if I make it worse, so…. And I know my mother will always be there for me, so I just go after her.</P>

<P>Oaklander: That’s, okay. I want you to tell her…. Make believe this is your mother and you could tell her that, I think, I know I take things out on you.</P>

<P>Blake: I know I take things out on you, Mom.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And when they don’t, like….</P>

<P>Blake: And when they don’t go right at my dad’s house, I take things out on you.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You feel bad about that?</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. It’s pretty, I think I see that a lot with kids, other kids I’ve…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …worked with, they do…. Because you’re, just what you said, you know, your mother’s there for you so she, it’s safe to do that.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: What would happen if you did that with your dad, if you told him?</P>

<P>Blake: I do not think anything would happen. I think…. I don’t think that he wouldn’t spend time with me, but I want to be careful.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You want to make sure.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And be careful. Yeah. Yeah, I wonder if there’s some way that you could express feeling mad without taking it out on your mother. What does she do when, I mean, does she get mad back because you’re….</P>

<P>Blake: Most of the time, she’ll have a positive attitude, and then…and then you know, she’ll try to tickle me or something to get me happy. And then I stay mad and then when I do get happy, she’s in a bad mood. I try and get her happy…</P>

<P>Blake: …and it goes downhill.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, going round in circles like that.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Well, you know, sometimes I think it’s important to express your mad feeling when you’re mad but—and… I think there are ways of doing it for yourself where you won’t get into trouble or take it out on your mother there are, because it’s, you know, it’s sort of inside of you. You’ve got to get it out.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So there are ways of doing that. I’m wondering if you know what I mean. If you can think of any…. I can tell you some, but I’m wondering if you…. Like if you had clay in your house—which most people don’t—but you could just take the mallet and you could say, "I’m so made at what…." You know, and you could do that and then you’d probably feel better and then you’d go in the other room and, "Hi, Mom."</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So I’m wondering if you could think of something you could do…</P>

<P>Oaklander: …privately for yourself to get that mad feeling out. Let’s think of something. Maybe I could write, want me to write them down so….</P>

<P>Blake: Sure.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, I have a pad here, so if you, what is something, let’s see. I’ll put….</P>

<P>Blake: Playing, playing basketball could ease the anger.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Playing basketball. Now, okay. Now the thing that’s important in this is, is like when you’re playing it, you have to be in touch with that feeling. You know, you have to—It isn’t like you’re trying to play basketball so you’ll forget it. Because then you’re only pushing it down. You have to, "I’m so—" every time you throw the ball or smack the whatever, it’s like knowing you’re angry about something and pretty soon it, it sort of goes away because you’ve worked it through.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Blake: And I do, I do that when I’ve been mad at my mother. Going, going, driving to practice and then when I get at practice since you could use some physical contact, I use that contact and, or I score, be aggressive…. I’m aggressive when I’m angry. It makes me a better player, too.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So, so we have to, you know, when you’re going to play basketball, go visit your dad and then come back and play.</P>

<P>Blake: Right. That would be good.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. So play basketball. I’ve got to give this a heading: Getting Mad Feelings Out. Or something. You’ll know what that means, right?</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I don’t have very good handwriting but….</P>

<P>Blake: Don’t worry.</P>

<P>Oaklander: "Playing basketball when angry."</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay, can you think of some other? What if you weren’t going to play basketball and you were, you know….</P>

<P>Blake: The other sport is football. That’s the only other sport I can think of, yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: "Or other sports."</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Alright. You know, sometimes if there aren’t any sports, you could just even run around the block feeling that, you know, and with your anger or something like that. But I’ll put, I’ll just leave it like that.</P>

<P>Can you think of anything else? What if it’s like you don’t have a game and it’s raining out and you have to just be in the house. Can you think of….</P>

<P>Blake: Talking to a friend.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, that’s a good, that’s good, yeah.</P>

<P>Blake: I don’t take anything out on him, but he makes me laugh.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Oh, but you tell him that you’re mad?</P>

<P>Blake: No. Sometimes when it’s really bad, I would.</P>

<P>Blake: And then I just say that I’m mad, and then he’ll try to make me feel better and it usually works.</P>

<P>Oaklander: It’s good that you tell him. You don’t have to tell him why or what or anything, you know: "I’m really mad. Not at you, but I’m mad." And then you know, so "Talking to a friend."</P>

<P>How about….</P>

<P>Blake: Watching TV helps me.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Now see, the thing is to get your mad feeling out, watching TV doesn’t do it because it sort of pushes it back down.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: You have to try to, you want to forget it. It has to be something outward physical. For, here’s an example might be, even writing, like writing "I am so mad," you know, and then throwing the paper away is a good, is okay. So I’ll write that. I’ll put that down: "Writing."</P>

<P>Oaklander: Another good thing would be tearing old magazines, just ripping them and saying, "I’m so mad," and in two minutes you’d feel better. Because I’ve done that. I don’t know if you have any old magazines around.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes. I have a lot.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Tearing—And the reason I say magazines is because they’re harder to, you have to really work at it, you know.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And there’s…. You could hit a pillow or hit your bed.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah, I tend to…. This might not be good at all, but I probably throw pillows.</P>

<P>Oaklander: No, well, if it doesn’t hurt anybody or hurt anything, I think that’s good.</P>

<P>Blake: I throw them at the wall.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, I think that’s terrific. Yeah. "Throwing pillows against the wall." I think that’s very good, actually.</P>

<P>Oaklander: So you get the idea.</P>

<P>Blake: Another good one I have is beating up my teddy bear.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Beating up a teddy bear?</P>

<P>Blake: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay, that’s—Do you have a teddy bear?</P>

<P>Blake: I have a collection of stuffed animals from when I was younger.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Okay: "Beating up a teddy bear." That won’t hurt anybody.</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah, and it will make you feel better. Okay. I think you’ve got plenty of stuff here, but you could probably think of more stuff.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: I’m going to give you this.</P>

<P>Blake: Okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: And you could kind of put it somewhere where, when you get mad, you do any one of these things or more or other stuff so you won’t have to take it out on your mother.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Or whatever. You know, because I could imagine even beside your father you might get mad sometimes at, from what happens at school sometimes or a friend might make you mad or….</P>

<P>Blake: Right.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Somebody, you know, makes you…. You know what’s a, like if you ever feel hurt feelings, somebody says something and it hurts you, that’s really being mad but it’s pushing it down against yourself so you feel hurt. But if you, like if somebody, if you could be mad at that person who hurt your feelings in private, you feel better and then it’s over, you know. You know.</P>

<P>Blake: Yeah.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Yeah. So where do you have to go tonight?</P>

<P>Blake: Swimming practice.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Swimming. Yeah, because you’re the swimmer.</P>

<P>Blake: Yes.</P>

<P>Oaklander: Right. Yeah. Well, this is kind of a real pleasure to work with you.</P>

<P>Blake: Oh, thank you.</P>

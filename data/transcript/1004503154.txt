<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. I love that vest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, thanks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I went to the eye doctor, very exciting. I was thrilled–well, not thrilled because, you know, but...it is fun to see. It is very expensive. So Chris got a job. He just went out last week and–so relieved he is in, in Concord where I grew up. And yeah, he–we found out on Wednesday and have kind of been–his mom's in town, his sister had a baby.  <note ref=""><b>Jenny begins by saying that she purchased glasses. Psychoanalytic therapists pay attention to references about glasses because they're metaphoric for seeing. I always note when patients take off or put on glasses during the session. It can symbolize wanting or not wanting to see. Jenny also notes that the glasses were expensive. She may be referring to how "costly" or taxing it is to see what she didn't see before.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:01:03]</p>

<p>So, his mom took us out to a nice dinner and we've been having a great time celebrating, and been really in plan mode. And you know, it, he...it was a little... the salary was not what we wanted or we expected. So, he's pretty disappointed in that respect. He's excited for the work because he'll be able to take on a lot early in his career, so that's exciting. But it's not very much money, so he was pretty disappointed. <note ref=""><b>Jenny has already made two references to money–the glasses being expensive and her husband not making much money. I take note of this.</b></note></p>

<p>So, we had just been sitting down and working everything out, and what I'll do for work, trying to figure that–I mean, I can't figure that out exactly right now, but... So, it's just been a lot–it's been a lot of planning. </p>

<p>[00:01:58]</p>

<p>We got into kind of a fight because I, you know, like two days after–of course, my first thought as soon as we hear about the job, I just think like great. I can have a baby. But I wanted to not say that right away, I wanted to give him some–I wish I had waited longer than two days on this, like, but I just can't. In those situations, I–it comes right out of me. And then, he just wasn't–he didn't feel comfortable, he just–he said I'm going to be making you know, $52,000 a year, you're going to be working part-time, the two of those together logically don't really sound like good times to... <note ref=""><b>Psychoanalytic clinicians think about the multi-layered  meanings of patient's words.  Jenny's talk of babies is notable. Babies can represent to urge to create something or they can also represent hopeful. They can also represent wishes to be compensated for what one didn't have or wishes to receive love that people feel deprived of.</b></note></p>

<p>And so, that really hurt my feelings and...and it makes–it's completely logical to me. He wants to provide, he wants to feel secure and stable, and–and that's logical. And I love that about him, and I love that that is his instinct. </p>

<p>[00:03:11]</p>

<p>Because I don't [laughs] I'm much more like let's go. And so, I really appreciate that aspect of him, but it's still kind of [inaudible 0:03:24] pretty upset. <note ref=""><b>Jenny's husband represents something she feels she lacks–rational and controlled capacities. While she likes this about him, it also upsets her. Jenny struggles to create healthy limits for herself, a product of growing up in a family with no limits.</b></note>  And then, of course, it would come out in these other ways. And so, Friday night, I just got mad about something else that had nothing to do with it. And of course, he said you're just getting mad about everything. What is this about? We had been out with our friends having a celebratory drink, and so, it wasn't a good time to talk about it. A Friday night at midnight. So, we woke up on Saturday and sat down and wrote out a whole really detailed, really–like, pretty in my opinion, generous budget. </p>

<p>[00:04:16]</p>

<p>And based on money from my grandmother, a job that I'm going to be watching my baby brother, which is a whole other thing that I'm very interested. And that money, and then, the other part-time job. Chris said that he feels comfortable with us starting to try to have a baby in the fall, which of course, makes me really excited. And so, yeah. I didn't want him to say that he didn't think that, and if it was me badgering him until he said it, and I really don't feel like that's what it was, although now, when I sit here and I talk about it, it sounds like it. <note ref=""><b>Jenny causally mentions that she is taking a job watching her brother. This is not a minor decision given her complicated feelings about her family. As we can seen in previous transcripts, Jenny has the tendency to minimize emotionally charged topics.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:05:02]</p>

<p>But I really don't think that that–I don't think I bullied him into doing it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you pause about the badgering part? <note ref=""><b>This intervention does two things. It draws her attention to her comment about "badgering" her husband. Jenny has talked on multiple occasions that she treats people "badly" so I take this opportunity to explore this with her. This intervention also points out that she is reluctant to delve into this, by pointing out that she paused.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Because when I sit here and I say like he said he doesn't feel comfortable. And I got really upset and I cried. [Laughing]. And then, I got mad at him like the next day. And then, we sat down and we re-talked about it in an actual way, as opposed to this like well, I don't know, I don't think we could afford it. But I think we could afford it. And that was our initial conversation. The one that made me upset.</p>

<p>And then, the one on Saturday that was us sitting down and saying this is how much, you know, pulling up his–[inaudible 0:05:52] and so, he like finds this website and we could calculate your taxes and like what you take home. Like, this whole, really going through really thoroughly and writing everything down. It still sounds like me badgering him [chuckles] into like, even just having a conversation. <note ref=""><b>Jenny continues to talk about how her husband keeps her in check which she both likes and dislikes. One important developmental capacity is to self-regulate, which involves setting personal standards for what's too little and what's too much, e.g. food intake, expressing emotions, and other behaviors. People who grow up in abusive or neglectful environments do not learn this important life skill. They tend to both to restrict themselves too much and to let themselves get out of control. Jenny demonstrates many difficulties in self-control around alcohol, budgeting, her behavior (lashing out and being aggressive toward others), and looks to her husband to pull in the reigns. Yet at the same time, she can resent him for this.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:06:12]</p>

<p>I guess I also always have this dream that like my husband would be like let's have a baby. [Laughs]. To be like thrilled about it like I am. And really, like dreaming and like oh, just no worries and everything is delightful. And that's just not who my husband is. He's very practical and very logical, and very–he also grew up very differently than me. His parents were a doctor and a lawyer, and established in their careers. And he grew up very comfortably. And money was never a concern for them. <note ref=""><b>Patients who grow up in dysfunctional families can be angry at having to self-regulate. They tend to view it as depriving and they already feel deprived.</b></note></p>

<p>And he would really like the same thing for his family, and I appreciate that. And I really respect that. I grew up very differently, and we never had money until I was older. And even though that was really–like at times, you know, I think that was probably really scary for my parents, especially my mom.</p>

<p>[00:07:21]</p>

<p>Like I always have had this idea about having kids, but it's like who has money when they have kids? Who–and I know the logical responsible part of it should be like no, but lots of people are established homes and careers, and then, they start a family. For me, I just–that never was that important. Like, I never thought of it as that big of a deal to not have those things. <note ref=""><b>She continues to struggle about responsibility.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:07:55]</p>

<p>My fear with–when Chris says you know, I want to wait, and we'll wait a year or whatever. My–I initially think–well, I get mad because that's not what I want to do. And then, I start thinking well, okay, so we'll wait a year, I'll be 29 when we start trying, and then, what if something–what if I can't get pregnant? What if I start miscarrying? What if, you know, and then, I start thinking about all these things. And I think like, I'll have a hell of a time not resenting you if that happens. It would be really hard for me not to. </p>

<p>But I also do not want him to resent me if we kind of do it my way. If we start trying to have a baby this fall, then we–and we get pregnant, and I don't–even though we've sat down and he is onboard and Chris won't just agree to things willingly. <note ref=""><b>Here, she is worried about her husband coercing her or vice versa. For people struggling with guilt, as Jenny is, requesting something can feel like forcing someone to do something. This is because when people feel guilty, they feel bound by obligations rather than free to chose.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:09:04]</p>

<p>He'd rather fight with me than just give up his position. But I still, I guess, I just don't want either of us to feel like we [pause] I don't want either of us to resent each other. Especially about something that should be so exciting and so happy. And so, I'd really like to [pause], I feel like by sitting, and I'd really like us to both be on the same page, and both–both be [pause] feeling like, I guess, we are in the position that we want to be in. Equal–does that make sense what I'm saying? Like, I– </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sure how to handle that you want different. <note ref=""><b>Jenny thinks that conflict inevitability leads to a power struggles. My comment alludes to that but I could have said it more directly.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:10:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And even though I kind of like, you know, he's come around to my side of things. I still feel like kind of pulled him over there. <note ref=""><b>Again she is concerned with the issue of free will vs. coercion.</b></note> Which I did. He's known that about me–I mean, but the other part of it is the last four years, like, I was very upfront with Chris that kids are a huge thing to me, from early in our relationship. And when we got engaged, I wanted to know, so what's your plan here? Like, when we will start having kids? When will we do this? </p>

<p>And every time we had the conversation, it gets pushed back a little further. So, when we first had the conversation–and obviously, he can't predict the future. So, he can't know that he is going to have this job and is going to–but when we've had this conversation before, he'd say like I think it sounds reasonable that we could start trying for a baby. And then, have the baby around graduation, if I was set up in a good position and had a good job, and was, you know?</p>

<p>[00:11:13]</p>

<p>And so, that was the first one. And then, it was like well, maybe that's not the best idea. Maybe we should wait and start trying for a baby at the end of law school. And then, maybe you'll have a baby when, in the fall, after law school is over.</p>

<p>And then, it is pushed back–and then, I just kept feeling like alright. And I–the thing is, I know I sound like the person who's kind of being a lunatic because it's not that responsible financially to just have babies willy-nilly and just whenever you want them. But I just can't help how I feel about it. <note ref=""><b>Jenny's anxiety about being crazy comes up in every session.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:11:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, not being as financially secure when you have a baby is being a lunatic? <note ref=""><b>I want to note this continuing fear she has of being crazy.</b></note> </p>

<p>CLIENT: I [inaudible 0:12:05] but it's not exactly responsible. And it's not exactly, you know, it's I think that you're, you know, I think that I could potentially be putting additional stress on us, on our marriage, especially on Chris because I know it makes him feel really uncomfortable. And I just don't want to do that. I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. But I really want what I want. <note ref=""><b>Victims of child abuse have difficulty with delayed gratification and modifying the desires when circumstances call for it. They have felt deprived for so long that "they want what they want."</b></note></p>

<p>So, I mean that's where we are now and that's what we've agreed and decided is at the–in the fall, we start trying. And as long as he's still is comfortable with that and happy with that, then I guess it's good. I just don't–I just–I really hope that he doesn't [pause] that he still feels that way come the fall. <note ref=""><b>Jenny pushes away the knowledge that Chris isn't comfortable and happy with the decision.</b></note> </p>

<p>[00:13:08]</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's definitely going to take that job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He already took it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is extremely low for an attorney. <note ref=""><b>I was conflicted about whether to comment on this. On the one hand, this struck me as a very low salary. On the other hand, it's typically not the place for therapist's to comment on "reality" but rather to stay with the patient's inner reality. Psychoanalytic clinicians shy away from making statements about reality because we appreciate that reality is largely subjective and we don't want to communicate that we have a better understanding of reality than they do. There are important exceptions to this but I don't think this circumstance was one of them.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: It's incredibly low-paying. I mean, I know it's Concord, Massachusetts, but still...it's a very low-paying job. <note ref=""><b>It's unclear if she really agrees or she feels compelled to agree.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it with the state? Is it with [Interposing] </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's a–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Private [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's, you know, there's kind of two bigger firms in Concord, and it's one of the two. It was just like–you know, he'll get a substantial bonus every December, but–he said that'll bump it up by like, you know, I don't know how much exactly, but...</p>

<p>[00:14:03]</p>

<p>But yeah, it's pretty surprising. He was very disappointed. And then, I know it was definitely hard to stomach, I mean, we had these kind of grand plans, and these big, you know, you dream when you're in school and you see, you know, he was interviewing at much different firms in New York and California where the starting salary was in the 70s or 80s. And so, it was definitely kind of, I think a hit to his ego. And I'm not nearly as upset about it as he is, but it was definitely like oh. We were talking about, you know, I don't know. It was different. It was a different picture.</p>

<p>[00:14:53]</p>

<p>It doesn't really bother–it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers him. But then again, I didn't go through law school and work my butt off. So, I think it's probably much easier for me to stomach for that reason.</p>

<p>[Pause].</p>

<p>So yeah, when we go to Concord, I'm going to–my parents asked if I'd watch my brother, Jamie, was the eight-year-old for the summer so they didn't have to hire a nanny. And the state pays for his childcare, which makes me feel a little bit more comfortable, strangely. That my parents aren't paying me to watch my brother. So, I'm going to be doing that for the summer. <note ref=""><b>Patients who suffered from childhood abuse have much greater difficultly separating from their family than people who haven't. I have seen many people with traumatic childhoods go back to live with their families as adults. For Jenny, I wonder what fantasies are embedded in this decision, e.g. to undo the harm done to her in childhood, to get the love she never received.</b></note></p>

<p>And I'm really excited about it because I really, you know, there's a lot of things that, you know, boogie board to the–spending the time with my brother because he and I just don't spend a lot of time one-on-one together when we visit. And because I see a lot of [pause], you know, I really would like–there's certain things that I'd love to do with him that I feel like don't happen now. And I would love to have play-dates with other kids with developmental delays and have, you know, like a lot of things that I feel like I'm excited for, but I'm really nervous.</p>

<p>[00:16:26]</p>

<p>I feel like it could be family overload, and because we're going to stay there as well. At least for July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Just–so, what's going to happen–we're going to stay here in June, our lease is up June 1st, but the [inaudible 0:16:52] with me leaving June 1st because a lot of summer camps and things don't start until mid-June. So, I said I'll stay on through the month of June, and for us, it's great because it's a chance to make some more money. <note ref=""><b>As we have seen, Jenny tends to deny or suppress her emotions. At this moment, I don't take up with her how emotionally problematic this decision may be as I think it is too outside of her awareness.  Psychoanalytic therapists address thoughts and feelings that are unconscious. However, if these thoughts and feelings are too outside of the patient's awareness the patient can experience this type of intervention as jarring.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:17:07]</p>

<p>Our friends just got a new apartment with an extra bedroom, so we'll stay with them for June. We'll go up to Concord in July. And then, we'll–Chris will take the bar at the end of July. And he met with a partner who was a alum of his school they were down this week. And he was saying we really encourage all of our starting [pause] people [inaudible 0:17:34] to the bar to take as much time off as they want. Usually, four to six weeks because they're just not going to get that opportunity to do that again. </p>

<p>Obviously, I'm not going to be able to just go away for four to six weeks, but I think Chris will. And I think he'll go back to California for August. And I'll maybe go for a week, and then come back and stay with my parents for the rest of August, and then, we'll hopefully find an apartment for September 1st.</p>

<p>[00:18:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think it'll be like for you there? <note ref=""><b>I don't want to say that her decision is problematic as I think she will feel judged and then feel the need to defend herself. I chose a gentler approach to explore this topic.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm actually incredibly nervous about staying with them for the summer. I should be excited, and part of me is excited. It's very awkward to stay there because it's not my house [inaudible 0:18:31]. It's not my home. They just moved there a year ago, and they haven't lived in the house that I grew up in [pause] eight–seven years. And so, there's like a guest bedroom with an air mattress we're going to be staying in.</p>

<p>And I think we'll just have our own bed there, but it feels like I'm just–I feel like a guest in my parent's house, but I know–but that makes me feel kind of uncomfortable. This is my mom's house, I should feel more comfortable. But my stepdad makes it really clear that that's his home, and he built it, and they built the house. <note ref=""><b>My comment helped Jenny explore her feelings about this choice.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:19:14]</p>

<p>And so, it makes me feel a little uncomfortable sometimes. And I feel like I'm invading their space. And I'm a burden. And I know that my mom doesn't feel that way. But he, I don't know, he's interesting. Our relationship used to be really good, and it's just gotten harder over the last few years for no reason. It started to kind of see different parts of his personality that rub me the wrong way. And he's just kind of like, little things that he says and does just grate on [pause] and it's starting to drive Chris crazy, too.</p>

<p>[00:20:05]</p>

<p>And so, I feel like [pause] it will be a little bit trying. But they spend a lot of time on their boat in the summers, and my stepdad especially will sleep on the boat a lot, for whatever reason. And so, I don't think he'll be around as much. And it's just two months, so... But I'm nervous. I'm really nervous. </p>

<p>And I'm nervous about the dynamic between me–because the lines can get blurry with me, you know, with me watching Mark during the day. And then, they come home at night. And then, I do have a hard time turning that kind of mode off where, you know, I don't want to step on toes. So, I don't want to be in charge of Mark during the day, and then, my mom comes home and my mom just has [pause], my mom and Caleb...</p>

<p>[00:21:11]</p>

<p>...they don't have a lot of follow-through, I guess is what I'm thinking. And they don't have any rules or boundaries, and Mark acts out and has a lot of temper tantrums, and meltdowns. And there's a lot of warnings and a lot of big threats. Santa Claus isn't going to come. And then, it's like he knows that bullshit. He knows Santa Claus is going to come because Santa Claus comes every stinking year, and you say that 27 times from August to December, and Santa always comes.</p>

<p>[00:21:50]</p>

<p>So, there's a lot of those things. And that kind of–that kind of behavior with a kid bothers me, especially a kid with special needs who can't really comprehend. He needs consist–so, I get really thinking I know. And maybe I don't know. Maybe this is their child, this is their family, and they know better. But I am nervous about that dynamic. Where during the day, I'm in charge, and then at night, they're in charge and it's their child. And their...home and their family. <note ref=""><b>I think that Jenny identifies with her brother. She too had "special needs" that were neglected. Perhaps she wants to mother Mark the way she wished she was mothered. Often, patients with trauma histories have the fantasy that they can undo the trauma they suffered. I wonder if this is what is motivating Jenny to assume the care for her brother.</b></note></p>

<p>And so, I just–I know that I am going to have to be conscious of shutting that off. Or at least dimming it. I don't know. So, that's one thing that makes me nervous, I guess. [Sighs]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It upsets you when they let him get away with [inaudible 0:22:47]? <note ref=""><b>Jenny is beginning to express her feelings about her mother's parenting and I want to encourage this.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really upsets me. It really, I can tell that he want–you know, I think all kids want boundaries. It upsets me because I have felt like that as a kid. It upsets me because I see a lot of other things happening and I feel like oh, I know how frustrating that must feel for him.</p> 

<p><note ref=""><b>Throughout the first part of the session, Jenny speaks about how much difficulty she has setting limits and boundaries for herself. She is identifying with her brother as someone who needs limits.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:23:05]</p>

<p>Because I felt really frustrated by acting out and screaming like a lunatic. I mean, just screaming and acting like a mess of a kid. Just because you know you can, but it doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good to be an out-of-control kid. Because you want someone to tell you. I mean, you know? I think that all kids kind of need that. That structure and that need to feel safe that way, to feel like someone is controlling this situation. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <note ref=""><b>I should have said, "you need that."</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: And I hated–I didn't like that feeling. And so, yeah. It really frustrates me to watch, and it frustrates me because I feel like he has a lot of potential. And he's a really, you know, he's a smart guy. And I think that with some structure and some really positive reinforcement, that he could really do really great. He does really great. I think he could do better.</p>

<p>[00:24:07]</p>

<p>And it's hard, too, because my mom will come to me for advice, and come to me and ask questions. And it's hard to give advice without hurting feelings because by asking for advice, you are kind of opening up the door for some criticism, sometimes. And so, she'll say like he's just acting out and I don't know what to do. And sometimes, I have a hard time phrasing it in a way that's not critical to her. And I get really frustrated. My mom has gotten upset with me before on weekends that I've stayed there because I'll get frustrated with a situation involving Mark, and I'm usually mad at my stepdad because he doesn't do anything. He doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>[00:25:01]</p>

<p>And it drives me up a wall. And so, I get upset and it looks like I'm getting mad at Mark, but I'm at the situation involving Mark, and I'm usually mad at my stepdad. And so, my mom and I have had a discussion about it before, but...[pause]. I just feel like it could be an interesting summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds stressful. <note ref=""><b>I could have said, "it seems like you're trying to undo the damage of your childhood."</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It might be. I mean, it probably will be. [Sighs]. I... Yeah. I felt really tense yesterday and today, just kind of sitting down and planning everything, and looking at everything in such detail. Makes me feel really anxious and tense. We sat down and budgeted everything out, and for some reason it made me much more anxious of getting another job, but it made me really tense to sit down and do that. </p>

<p>[00:26:14]</p>

<p>And to break down all the, our...everything from some–that we're going to, all of our expenses for the summer, and then, all of our income from the summer. Just really stresses me out, make me feel really anxious. <note ref=""><b>She's connecting her brother's lack of boundaries with her own difficulties planning and limit setting.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, how so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I couldn't even put a, like, pinpoint it. I just–we were doing it, and it was just making me feel so tense. [Pause]. Just to, I guess I get really anxious, too, about the idea of running out of money. I like the idea of having just enough money, like, if–I don't like the idea, but I'm comfortable with that idea. </p>

<p>[00:27:08]</p>

<p>But the idea of being out of money scares the crap out of me. <note ref=""><b>Money often represents safety or needs so that running out of it means insecurity and deprivation.] And so, I'm much more [laughs] happy to kind of live in this oblivious little like oh, like everything's going to be fine. But when we sat down and we wrote out every single expense, and every single–it really made me tense. And really anxious. Because it was so, I guess, because it was so concrete and so visible, and so [pause</b></note> oh my god, we have so many expenses for the summer. </p>

<p>And it... I guess that–seeing that made me feel really tense. <note ref=""><b>Jenny is saying that she has more needs than resources to meet those needs. It's important not to make interpretations that as analytic clinicians refer to as "too deep", that is, too outside of the patients awareness. However, Jenny may have been able to hear this comment.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:28:01]</p>

<p>That's good. It's very–I felt it was very–it was–we're becoming much more and more in the last two years, we're trying to become more. I'd say that financially responsible, but it honestly just scares the crap, like, I get really tense. It's like this awareness of it makes, like, before when we just kind of like go out like we're living in our little fantasy world, it was easier. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fantasy world?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, just not even thinking about–like, we wouldn't think about money until we just ran out of it. And that's just kind of how I–that's how I always was. <note ref=""><b>We all struggle to deal with aspects of life we find unpleasant or anxiety provoking. Jenny deals with these aspects by "denying" them, or pretending they are not there. unhappy with. Denying reality comes with problematic consequences. Psychoanalysts have a saying, "reality wins in the end".</b></note></p>

<p>[00:28:59]</p>

<p>I wouldn't–I just wouldn't think about it. I would just do whatever I wanted, you know...and just not–and then, I'd overdraft, and then, I'd think about it. And then, I'd panic and eat only what was left in my kitchen until I got paid again. But now, we're trying to be much–so, we have an allotted amount of money that we spend each week, and I take out the cash on Fridays, and that's what he has to spend and that's what I have to spend. And then, I have X amount of grocery money, and it's all very responsible, and it's all very logical.</p>

But the confinement of it sometimes makes me feel kind of tense and anxious. I don't know...it makes me–yeah. I don't know why. Because sometimes I just want to go buy a new coat. And I can't because I know how stupid that would be. It's like this awareness of what I want–knowing that what I want to do would be a really bad idea. And that, I think, makes me tense.
<p><note ref=""><b>Jenny is again speaking to the issue of self-regulation, namely, managing her needs and resources in a responsible way. She struggles with this because it makes her feel deprived. When people feel deprived self-regulation is a challenge because they feel deprived when setting a limit.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:30:18]</p>

<p>I'd love a new pair of shoes, and I can't do it because it's really stupid. And that makes me feel tense. So, I guess that was kind of it. And I guess then, I'm just [inaudible 0:30:42] for the next few years if we just have a baby. My poor husband. I torture him. [Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean you torture him? <note ref=""><b>While I think this was an important question, it's interesting how she first talked about feeling deprived and then in the next sentence talked about wanting a baby. Does she feel that having a baby will undo her feelings of deprivation?</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I just–I'm not easy.</p>

<p>[00:31:02]</p>

<p>I'm not easy to live with. I feel like I have so many demands, and I'm so–I just feel so needy. Like, we're always–like, it's always something about me. Just feel like that poor guy. He must get so sick of me. But I just feel like–like, I couldn't even let him enjoy his week of getting his job. I had to immediately talk about babies. And it's about me. </p>

<p>I just couldn't even let him do it. [Pause]. And so, then I feel bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you've hurt him in some way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I feel like I just didn't let him [pause] enjoy that.</p>

<p>[00:32:10]</p>

<p>Because I immediately went to, like we couldn't just celebrate and enjoy the fact that he's been looking for a job for six months, and he finally got a job. And he should be so relieved. And he is, but two days later there I am, like, alright enough celebrating. Now, let's get down to business. And talk to me right now about when I can have a baby. And I just didn't even let him take 72 hours to feel the relief before I started in with some other pressure.</p>

And I feel bad about it. But I can't put it back–I can't take it back now. It's already up there. 
<p><note ref=""><b>I could have commented that she's feeling guilty.</b></note></p>

<p>[00:33:01]</p>

<p>I feel like it went from one pressure to another. It just–I just switched the label for him. [Pause]. Yeah. Not a good wife. Oh well. [Pause].</p>

<p>So, we're going to Georgia a week from Thursday to visit my grandmother. And my dad will be there. He got a new phone number sometime in November, and I spoke to him on Thanksgiving with my brothers, and then again on Christmas with my brothers. And I gave him my phone number two times, and it's like can you please call me so that I can have your new number? And he just hasn't called me since November. And of course, hurt my feelings. <note ref=""><b>Analytic therapists always have one ear toward transference: does what the patient saying about someone else also refer to the therapist? I thought of this here because she was talking about her father not contacting her. I wonder unconsciously if she was upset that I haven't spoken for a while in the session. It's as if she's saying, "why haven't you contacted me?"</b></note></p>

<p>[00:34:22]</p>

<p>And yeah, so I just spoke to my grandmother because I wanted to tell her about Chris's job before she heard about it from somebody else. And so, I called to tell her and she had already seen it on Facebook, so she was giving me an attitude about it. She like has to give you an attitude about four things. First, in your conversation and then, she'll start. Like, and then, as soon as you like kiss her ass enough, then she'll be nice to you. </p>

<p>So, as soon as I got through that with her, and she was happy with me, and said you know, can you please have my dad call me? If you speak to him, I'd like to tell him about Chris's job. And so, he called me yesterday and he was depressed sounding and lonely, and he's so sad.</p>

<p>[00:35:08]</p>

<p>And he said yeah, I haven't heard from you in a while. I said I know dad, I asked you on Thanksgiving and on Christmas to call me so I could have your new phone number. Well, just kind of grumbles. It's like the phone, first of all, works two ways. I'd like to point that out to you. The phone works two ways, and [pauses] like your end of the bargain was that I needed a phone number. </p>

<p>I mean, I could've asked my brothers, obviously, but that wasn't the point. Anyway, he had just, you know, it's like a guilt trip every time with one of them. And then, you just guess about all the things that you've done wrong before you even get into it. </p>

<p>[00:36:04]</p>

<p>And it's delightful. <note ref=""><b>This is one of the defenses Jenny's uses. She deals with distressing emotion by stating turning it into the opposite of what she's feeling.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like you've done something wrong? Or you just [inaudible 0:36:08]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that I've done something wrong in their mind. In my mind, I haven't. What did I do wrong? You know, it's like my grandma was mad because supposedly I booked our weekend to Georgia for the wrong weekend, but I know that I didn't. She's a drunk and she doesn't remember the conversation. I remember specifically because she said a particular weekend is my cousin's birthday, and that's why I remembered it. And so, when I booked it, she didn't respond to my call, my e-mail. I finally wrote her a message on Facebook because I'm desperate. And she wrote back something snappy, that was the wrong weekend. Like, going to have to change a bunch of stuff around.</p>

<p>[00:36:59]</p>

<p>And it's like listen, lady, I appreciate everything you're doing for me, but I know your schedule is not that busy and hectic and crazy, and it's not going to be that difficult. And also, like it wasn't the wrong week. It just wasn't. So, I know that in their mind I've done something wrong, but it's just–I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything to be intentionally hurtful, or damaging, the opposite, actually. I'm trying really hard to be nice. And to give my grandmother what she wants, which is supposedly time with her grandchild, which was really [inaudible 0:37:40]. <note ref=""><b>Something has allowed Jenny to be more expressive about her anger.</b></note></p>

<p>So, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. But they do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean supposedly? <note ref=""><b>I want to address Jenny's distrust of her grandmother's motivation.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's the whole thing. So my dad has to get other jabs, you know, it's all these subtle–not even subtle, just these jabs wherever you can get them.</p>

<p>[00:38:05]</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you're coming down to Georgia. Finally. It's been a long time, huh? (very sarcastic tone) Because everyone else in the family goes down a couple times a year. My brothers go down probably twice a winter, and everyone goes at least once or twice or three times a winter. And I haven't been like in seven years. Eight years. Because it's not a healthy situation for me. And I get treated badly, and so I don't put myself in that situation. </p>

<p>Except for now because I'm, I don't know why. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Why? Why now? <note ref=""><b>This is an important question. What has changed in Jenny's mind?</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because I am–I'm like an emotional cutter. What is this? It's like because I wanted to make her happy, and I was tired of being the bad guy. I was tired of being the outsider. And tired of being the one who [pauses] came to family functions and sat by herself and was usually made to cry. And I wanted to take control of that, I guess, and to...</p>

<p>[00:39:16]</p>

<p>And to do that, I feel like I have to give them a little something of they want to get what I want. So, I don't want them to be mean to me anymore. And I feel like in order to get–that's never going to change completely. But what can change–they feel rejected by me because I never come around and I never do the things that they want to do. Or that they always do. And so, by coming to family events and staying as opposed to making excuses and leaving early, by going to Georgia but bringing Chris, and staying in a separate condo.</p>

<p>[00:40:01]</p>

<p>And by doing these things in these ways that I feel like I can still protect myself, I'm giving them a part of what they want, and getting what I want because they are going to–I feel like they'll just start to be nicer to me and I'll feel more included. And it'll–I think it'll just be kind of a win-win all around. As long as I can keep this–keep myself protected and whatever. And depending on the situation. <note ref=""><b>When patients grow up in abusive or neglectful homes, they have a difficult time seeing relationships as mutual or reciprocal. Rather, they see them as a quid pro quo or transactional, which is what Jenny is describing.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will make them be nicer to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: By me giving them what they want. Coming around and being involved with the family. Because that's–it's always this–the like where have you been? What have you been–why aren't you here? Like, we're all doing these things together all the time, and you aren't involved, and you don't go see your grandmother, and you don't, you know?</p>

<p>[00:41:09]</p>

<p>Because my grandmother gives us all $500 every Christmas. Well, she gives my brothers $500 every Christmas to go to Georgia to visit her. And I use it to pay bills. And never–for the last seven years, I've never used it on a plane ticket. I've always used it to pay bills. <note ref=""><b>This is pretty hostile but I chose not to remark on it for now.</b></note> And so, my uncle, they get mad at me because I don't use that money to go to Georgia, and my dad gets mad at me. She gets mad at me. And everyone thinks that I'm a brat. </p>

<p>So, I'm hoping if by doing this and giving my grandmother what she wants, that it'll make her happy, and if it'll make her happy, then her kids will be happy with me. </p>

<p>[00:42:06]</p>

<p>Because that's, you know, like–I don't know. That's my hope. If it doesn't work, if I just keep getting treated like garbage, then I just have to–it's just an experiment. I'm going to try it. And see. And you know...[pause], the thing about this with my dad is that it's much easier to not talk to him. I'm much happier, I'm much more even-keeled. And the longer I go without talking to him, the tons of better I feel. But it's as soon as the–like, I have his phone number now, and he has my phone number. And I know that. But strangely, even though those two months he didn't call me, it hurt for the first couple weeks, and then, I just didn't think about it. And it didn't bother me.</p>

<p>[00:43:08]</p>

<p>And I felt good because I wasn't worried about why isn't he calling me? Why isn't he calling me back? I should call him. I should really see how he's doing. And now, I have his phone number, and then, there's that guilt again. And it's going to be like you know, you should call him and see how he's doing, he sounded really depressed. His [inaudible 0:43:33]. </p>

<p>But the further removed I am from him, the more space and distance I have I feel better. <note ref=""><b>Jenny also tries to deal with her emotions by getting distance from them.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I still feel guilty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish he would die, and then, I wouldn't have to feel guilty anymore. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that would solve things for you? <note ref=""><b>Jenny has the fantasy that if her father died, her feelings about him would be resolved.

<p>CLIENT: It would solve certain things, yeah. </p>

<p>[00:44:01]</p>

<p>It really would. And I don't feel bad about saying that anymore. That's probably a bad thing, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel guilty for that thought. We're going to stop. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm fine. Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Sorry about canceling on Friday. Thanks for rescheduling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So for today, then Friday? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So it was a nice weekend. The weather was really nice. We just hung out, got some stuff done in the house, went outside a little bit, walked around, had lunch. I was really happy to find out today—I came in and I brought one of the dental bills that you had. I didn't see the payment posted for June, and it usually posts on the 6th, and so I was going to call them just to say, "has the payment posted"—or whatever. Anyway I called them and I found out that the payment was posted but it was for only $65 because that was the balance, so that one of them is paid off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh great. [1:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is really awesome because I didn't think it was going to be paid until August. Then for the other one—basically if we pay a little bit more in August than we usually do then that will also be paid off. So by the end of August we'll have an extra $510 to put towards other stuff, which feels really good. So that's really exciting. </p>

<p>I was going to say something else—I thought of something else—I can't remember. So I think I had told you that I've been helping my friend with her wedding that's coming up, and I don't know if I mentioned, but, so I've been helping with a number of things. Her and her family have done a lot, but I'm helping them with stuff like scheduling of events and little details that are hard to think of if you're not used to planning a wedding. And asking for my help to find a videographer. So I've been doing quite a bit for her. [2:01] </p>

<p>So I wasn't invited to the rehearsal dinner which is like, you know, a grey area kind of because obviously it's usually not for in-town guests, but bridal party and special guests obviously are usually invited. I know that her bridesmaids, whatever, they're not like official—I don't know what's going on with them—but they're all wearing the same color dress. I guess, I don't know, whatever. So I kind of was like, ah, etiquette-wise I think that she should have invited me just because, even though I'm an in-town guest, I'm not part of the bridal party but I'm a huge part of this wedding. I mean, like, I'm helping with the day-of stuff, really helping, and I'm obviously not being paid; you know, this is not like she hired me. So etiquette-wise I think she should have invited me. Ok, fine, like whatever, I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to make her feel uncomfortable. Who knows if there's budget restrictions? Well I personally know there's not. But, ok. [3:00]</p>

<p>Then I met up with them about a week or two ago just to talk about a few things. We had dinner; me, herself and her fiancé. And she says to me—we were talking about something—I was saying when I could come over because I had a bunch of questions about scheduling the event stuff, little details that she should probably think about, and so we wanted to go over that, and whatever. And she was saying that she couldn't do it this weekend—this was not this weekend, but the weekend before—because she's going to a bachelorette party there. And by bachelorette party I mean pajama party at Simone's house. They just wanted to do something. Then she immediately started to back-pedal, I think. Like "well it's not really that, it's nothing, it's whatever." So, whatever, I didn't think anything of it because her friend Mindy lives there, who I know but we were never close. She lives there, our friend Simone lives there, and our friend Allison lives there but is just about to move back. So whatever. [4:03]</p>

<p>But then like lovely Facebook posts everything that happens in the world. So I see pictures up of getting crazy at Sandra's bachelorette party. They're curling her hair at Simone's apartment. But not only was it those girls that I mentioned, but there was this other girl that lives in Chicago also that apparently—that we went to high school and college with, me and Sandra—and she kind of stayed close with throughout college. I never liked this girl. We never got along. Our personalities don't mesh; I just don't like her. But she was there. Her sister was there; that came from here—Sandra's sister, the bride's sister. And this girl, Lucy, who—I don't know if you've heard me talk about before—is an old friend that is still friends with all the other girls that I know from elementary and high school but has totally blocked off any—like we've had some falling outs. We've been friends since we were four and she's totally blocked me out of her life. Which is whatever, you know. [5:02]</p>

<p>But then I saw that she was there, and I was like, "okay, wait so it's like a non-bachelorette party for only the people in Chicago, but your sister and Lucy came from here?" So then I got pissed and was like that's fucked up and I'm wondering did she not want me there? Did she just not want to make it uncomfortable with Lucy because Lucy kind of ends up being a little bit of a ringleader, kind of like a magnetic force around these girls, and nobody wants to confront her because she's so like "no, I don't want to be friends with Trina, whatever." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so maybe it was that she didn't want to bring it up because Lucy was going. But that's really shitty. Like, who cares? You know, it's whatever. I don't think she's doing anything here for a bachelorette so that made me feel even more left out—you know? </p>

<p>So but then—so that upset me a little bit. I've already had a number of conversations with these girls individually that have involved me saying, you know, that I felt left out at times and I'd really love for them to contact me if they're in town. I'd love to see them because it really always seems like I'm the one who's reaching out to them to try to make plans, and it's always—"like, oh well I'm going to this place with these people, so you should come meet me," or whatever. They don't ever really like make an effort. But I've tried to renew these friendships and keep them going, and especially this friend of ours, Allison, who I've known just as long as this other girl, Lucy. [6:23] </p>

<p>So anyway, but then—so I was not really sure what I was going to do about that yet. Then I see this weekend they've posted pictures of Lucy's bachelorette party. Lucy's getting married in August. I wouldn't expect to be invited to the wedding. Well, I would expect—I think that she is an asshole and I think that she probably should have invited me. We've been friends forever. I've tried to like—I sent her a message about a year and a half ago that was like "whatever the reasons or details were of our little falling-out, I'd love to renew our friendship." (ph) She never replied, or whatever. All the other girls said "well we just don't get it, like I don't know, it's so crazy, like I can't believe you're not going to her wedding, da da da.." Fine. But I didn't expect obviously if I wouldn't be invited there I wouldn't be invited to the bachelorette party. [7:06]</p>

<p>But then I see pictures posted of Lucy's bachelorette party. So first of all, Allison's there. Allison had told me she was coming back here but hadn't told me when and didn't bother to call me that she's now back. She's been back for a week now. Sandra was there. Simone was there; she came in from Chicago. Our friend, Rebecca, who I've actually tried to reach out to a couple of times and she hasn't responded to me via G-mail. She's just kind of flaky. But she's been living in Manchester so I haven't seen her in months. When she was here over Christmas she didn't try to get together with me and I told her that I would have loved to see her. So she's there from Manchester. And so I was like what the fuck? Like really? Like this is—you guys just don't care about being friends with me or seeing me or anything. So that made me upset. [7:51]</p>

<p>And I realize that I really should say something to Sandra about this bachelorette thing—like if not the rehearsal dinner—then at least let her know that I would have liked to be included and that it was hurtful when I saw that Lucy was there from here. It made me feel like I wasn't invited to something that was celebrating your getting married and I'm involved with your wedding—you know, whatever. And I was like toying with—first of all I talked to my Mom about it and she was really upset about it. My father, you know his reaction was "maybe talk to her, it seems like she's kind of using you for your help. And so you should talk to her and maybe you just don't go to the wedding. And you know say fuck it and that's that." [inaudible at 8:31] His opinion on it is that it's really messed up—what they've been doing—and all of that, and that either I have to confront them again about it and talk to them about it, or just like let it lay. Because otherwise like stewing in it is just going to make me bitter. He wants me to feel like I don't need them to like have friends if they're not going to act like friends to me. So Tracy, my step-mom, was like shocked. She can't believe I wasn't invited to, first of all the rehearsal dinner, and second the bachelorette party. She's like "what the hell?" [9:03]</p>

<p>I was like, "well I could bring it up but it's kind of a difficult thing to bring up. It's less than a month before somebody's wedding because they're thinking about all of these other things." Maybe she just has blinders on and maybe she's her own little version of a bridezilla in that sense and is not really thinking about things like that. I think that I am going to say something to her after the wedding, after she's back. Just talk to her; let her know that it was hurtful and I really loved being a part of her wedding and ask her if maybe the hesitation to include me in some things that Lucy's at involved them not wanting to confront Lucy. (ph) Kind of ask about that a little bit more. In the meantime, I mean Sandra like she really, I don't know, like she should thank me. Like—she should get me a gift. I don't even know what her bridesmaids are doing. What are they doing? I'm like doing all this stuff. And then they get to be the ones to like have their stupid little bachelorette party, go to the rehearsal dinner, get dressed and you know be in their little dresses together. [10:07] </p>

<p>Like I'm a part of it and whatever, but it does feel a little bit like she's using me kind of, you know. Like I know that we're friends but like—I don't know—it just feels strange to be a friend and be a guest at this wedding—and obviously I'm helping—but I'm kind of feeling like she is more interested in me for my opinions and my help on the wedding stuff and timeline and all that, than like having me be involved in other parts of the wedding that actually involve like her and her marriage (ph) and her life and stuff like that. So I've kind of been struggling with that a bit. I don't want to talk to my friends individually again about them leaving me out and not calling me or whatever because, honestly, I've done it before. I've told them how I feel about it, and if they can't keep that in mind, then like tough shit. I don't really know. I'm not going to chase people down to hang out with them if they're not interested. [11:00]</p>

<p>Um and I guess in terms of the wedding, like, (pause) I don't know, I'll just—I don't know like—I don't want to say anything before the wedding but at the same time, I'm hoping that it's not going to affect like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me a little bit about the conversation (ph) a few weeks ago? Where I guess I feel like you're sort of asking me what I think and maybe my opinion of what you should do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean like, yeah I think it would be nice to have your opinion and just like, kind of the situation in general? I mean, I think that what I do isn't going to be—is just going to be whatever I do. And this feels a little bit less sensitive than with (ph) .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously because it's like, whatever. But yeah, I've been getting different people's opinions I think, just to kind of (pause) I don't know, have a weigh-in because (pause) because I don't know where it really leaves me in terms of my actual friendships with these girls. And (pause) you know and how they are hard on my life, I guess. [12:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess again it seems to me that there's a parallel with how you're describing with Franklin (ph) I think that one of the things we came to was that you really, in that case, hadn't wanted to think about the possibility of breaking up with him. And so you were kind of not thinking about it, but kind of presenting things to other people, in part in a way—that's how they were responding: "wow, this is intolerable. You should not put up with this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: " Da da da." Because you didn't want to see it that way because that would have led to conflict. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seems like a similar thing is happening where other people's opinions sound pretty consistent, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're more hawk-ish, and you're more dove-ish. [13:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) so I wonder if it's something similar where you don't (pause) ah (pause) you know, arrange things so that like there's that sort of split where you're on the dove-ish side and the people you talk to are on the hawk-ish side and then you don't have to own that quite as much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you can kind of keep those friendships going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably a little bit. I mean, I think that—I don't know—I guess there's always been a part of me that's kind of like oh screw it, like if they don't want to make an effort to be my friend in a real way then I don't really care. But obviously I do care cause like I've still been, you know, keeping up with them, or keeping track of you know what's going on or whatever. [14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me put it another way. I guess I imagine that maybe you're seeking other people's opinions including mine (pause) more so that, like, ah, we can take a particular side of things so you won't have to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well then what side would you take then? (laughing) I get it. I don't know if that's really what it is, I don't know. (pause) I guess it just makes me feel frustrated because —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [14:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I think again, yeah, it is similar in a sense that, you know, it feels like something that I've addressed and tried to kind of assert myself about but that has not changed. So you know similar to the Franklin (ph) stuff previously in that sense (pause)—I don't know, I mean (pause) I even knew, you know, telling my mom and my dad about it that, you know, I knew that their reaction would be "yeah, that's horrible. Sandra but you know, especially with Allison, you should really—I think that you should try to talk to her more and you know, blah, blah, blah," which is always their opinion because they don't want me to give up these friendships. And I don't either, but I think that I'm just feeling more and more pushed away by these girls because they're all, like, going to a million weddings and going to each other's weddings and all in each other's weddings and you know, like I don't have that. I mean, maybe it's a little bit of envy to that as well, which you know, I can admit and it's fine because I would like to have friends that are like that, and have people ask me to be in their bridal party and whatever. And I don't. [16:08]</p>

<p>And I think it just (pause) I guess (pause) amplifies this, or like, makes the separation that has formed between me and these other friendships that is much bigger. But I think it also makes me feel that much more resentful because I honestly think that a lot of these issues have to do with Lucy, this fucking chick that's just literally in everybody else's crap, and nobody wants to stand up to her about me. And so I've kind of been pushed to the side, and I'm a sideline friend, while they're all this fucking group of close friends that hang out and meet up when everybody's in town and do all this bullshit. And, you know, I just think it's really immature. I mean, like we're going to be 30 soon, and really, we're scared to invite an old friend because of this other old friend's, like, grudge? [17:08]</p>

<p>You know, I mean it's just kind of—and so it's—yeah, I guess in that sense I am kind of looking for an answer from other people like either to tell me, like, "oh no, just keep trying to hang out with them, and tell them how you feel every time that they hurt you, and keep doing that", or like, "No. Just don't bother calling them anymore and whatever happens, happens. If they invite you to a party or to go out, you can choose to go or not. " So yeah, I think that I kind of am not ready or sure of how to make that decision for myself or maybe not even sure if I need to make that decision, like or any decision. I think this is a situation where I like, I don't (pause) know if I should act on it, or just, or not. You know, is it—and I think that what Franklin (ph) said is true which that if you're going to be talking about it this much it obviously affects you. And it affected him too. He was really pissed when he saw the pictures, and he saw that Becca and Simone were in town and they didn't, you know, reach out to me and was like "what the hell?" You know what I mean. "I saw the pictures from the bachelorette party and was like, really?" Like cause he's seen how much time I'm putting into helping her and all that, and how much enthusiasm and joy I've had for it, you know. [18:27]</p>

<p>But I think he's right in a sense, you know, in the sense of, for personally if it's going to cause me, it's going to affect me, I need to decide if I'm going to let it affect me to the point that I'm going to say something, or if I'm going to stop letting it affect me, which I have to actually then do. I actually have to like put it out of my mind and decide that this is something that I'm not going to let affect me, which is hard to do. And I think that's maybe why I can't figure out what to do. (laughs) I don't know (pause) if that would even be possible. [19:06]</p>

<p>(pause) Just like, what do you say to people who are, like 28 years old and are still acting like cliquey. Cliquey. You know, like what do you say? "Oh, grow up, (ph) you know." Like, you know, I don't really want to do that anymore; why should I be complaining about being left out? Like really? Like (pause) and I think it's also the fact that you know I've addressed this with them before. Like literally specifically this issue and even the part surrounding Lucy and her adversity to, you know, being near me. And I think the other thing that makes me think of is, you know, at the wedding itself is that how it's also going to be? Where Lucy, you know where they're all hanging together now in their similar color fucking dresses and I'm kind of like kicked to the side, making sure the caterer's on time bringing the fucking cake out, you know? Like if that's going to be the case, I'm not too thrilled about the idea of going to this wedding. [20:18] </p>

<p>I mean I'm happy to help if I'm actually going to be like able to be a part and, you know, of course I'm also wondering about where she's going to seat me, like, because every time I've seen Lucy, if I've seen her anywhere, she's just been very, like (pause) stuck-up, like just," "Oh my God, so good to see you, oh my God, yeah let's have lunch, totally. Like yeah, um," but then just kind of like trying to be like all over the place kind of so that I'm—I don't know—so that people know that "I'm not your friend. Like you're my friend." Or something—it's hard to explain—she's (pause) I don't know. I was friends with her for so many years but I just think that we clash. I'm not really sure what the issue is but at this point I can't fucking stand her, and I hope that she fucking falls in the ocean on her wedding day. [21:19]</p>

<p>Honestly, that's how I feel about this girl because she's treated me so badly. But yeah, so there's that other fear of you know kind of being at the—the whole cliquey—the whole thing. It's very uncomfortable and absurd. I mean, I mean is it not? I mean doesn't it seem kind of childish? (pause) I mean, honestly, like in your opinion, does it seem childish?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or is it what people do? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why [pause from 21:52 to 22:26] what I'm wondering about is, um, why you doubt yourself? Like why, around this kind of thing, you (pause) sort of look for backup on what you think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. (pause) [23:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway I think that the doubting myself certainly has to do with just the (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel like you're where you were in that you're being—I don't know—too emotional, too reactive, like you're throwing a tantrum over it and you're looking for other people to kind of reality check that with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's definitely a bit of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, ah, I think that maybe you worry that you're making a much bigger deal out of things than you need to, like this is more about your throwing a fit again, being emotionally reactive and so you can't really trust your own reactions. [24:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and so you have to kind of get some reassurance in part from other people to let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I just—I don't know how to not do that, I guess. I don't know how to like—because yeah, I do feel like well what if I bring this up and you know, I don't know, Sandra tells me that, for instance with this bachelorette party, that "I didn't know Lucy was coming. She happened to be in Chicago." Or what if it's like, "why didn't you call me and tell me you were in town," and you know they're like, "oh, well I just had some family things and so I didn't have time," or, you know and then I end up feeling like, oh well I am attacking her for no reason. [25:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. And I mean there's just another, I think, another side of me that just really doesn't like confrontation. Still kind of am like trying to see if I can find a way out of it. Like (laughs) hmm, how can I be satisfied with not dealing with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you just threw a fit then, you're sort of being unreasonable about this then, you know, it sucks in a way. But in another way it gets you out of having to confront them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. I just like, kind of like, ah I'm not going to call them or text them anymore or e-mail them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See what happens (laughs). Just for lack of like, well, not wanting to have to deal with it really. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [pause from 25:53 to 26:27] Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [pause from 26:28 to 26:43] Well obviously, I mean, this also plays on my self-esteem in a sense of ending up kind of feeling like well, why don't they want to hang out with me? What's wrong with me as a friend? You know, why am I not somebody that, you know, gets a call or an e-mail when somebody's coming into town. You know, I'm still kind of—then starts kind of—self-doubt kind of comes in and then I, you know, can kind of spiral out of control if I start thinking too much about that in terms of well, it must be I'm just not likeable and no wonder I don't have any close friends that are around here that I hang out with all the time in a close group of friends like that, you know. Which is unfair to myself because I do have friends that I hang out with and you know, friendships that I'm working on and nourishing and things like that. [27:34]</p>

<p>But it definitely makes me think that, you know, well, question what's wrong with me or why they don't want to hang out with me. And my usual answer is that it's because Lucy's a bitch and they're all cowards and don't want to confront her. Which I honestly think has something to do with it because this girl is very influential for some reason on the other girls and just in terms of—I think she throws fits and so I think that, rather than them dealing with that, then dealing with "well, I don't want to do that. I don't know. I mean I wanted to go to my house first but it's weird if Trina comes," and you know not wanting to deal with that, so just kind of not even bringing it up. Um, because I do know that Lucy is a spoiled, spoiled brat, and gets her way, all the time. Um (long pause) yeah, I don't know. I just don't know how to approach the situation in general, I think. [pause from 28:54 to 29:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah, I mean there are other things that you're (pause) um (pause) there also seem to be ways that, like, a little more deeply into what's going on with you worries you like whether it's for that you will (pause) get on too much of a jag about like not having enough friends and you kind of give yourself a hard time about that. [30:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or feeling like you lashed out for no reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to—at the very least from your perspective—having a bunch of things that line up to make you feel quite left out and taken advantage of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know that even if it turns out it's all just sort of coincidences of one sort or another that don't line up the way you feel, that if you speak to that, you're wrong. And so you're bad because you're getting angry for no reason. [31:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yeah, it's like you have this real distrust I think of your emotional reactions, either they will get you into trouble with somebody else or they'll sort of get you into trouble in leading you to a sort of, sort of spiraling bad out of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're going to get it one way or the other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right and if you worry about it, or if you sort of state how you feel about things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah. (pause) I'm not saying it's bad to take other people's advice, but if it's partly because you're worried about how it's going to blow up in your face if you sort of follow how you feel, or think more about how you feel—that's, that's a problem, I think. [32:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think that my gut —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: like reaction —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: aside from not liking confrontation and not wanting to deal with it, blah, blah, blah, is kind of to just like, whatever, sit back and not deal with it. I mean, honestly if Sandra honestly like can't recognize that like having a non-bachelorette party that has seven girls and you know she still didn't invite me or whatever, or not doing something for other people (ph)—I don't know, like if she can't really see why that would, that that would have been something appropriate to invite me to, I don't really feel like I really want to tell her and I just kind of want to, like if that's, I don't know. [33:15]</p>

<p>I guess I, my gut reaction is to just like say fuck it, and like not say anything to anybody and help her with her wedding and like just let it be, and look at it as a good experience for me for getting back into supervising. And in terms of the friendships, like if, you know, we can make some time work to—like my friend Simone, like, whatever, I call her whenever I go to Chicago see if we can hang out and, you know, Allison's here for the summer so if we can make plans, fine. But then kind of just not put more stress on like wanting to be invited to more group things or be involved in more stuff then because, the fact of the matter is, I'm certainly not trying to rekindle anything and kiss Lucy's ass. [34:00]</p>

<p>And if they are gonna—when they all hang out together, they all hang out with her then like, they just, that's their little group and just, enjoy. I mean, I can find other people to hang out with and all that. And I mean, in terms of the feelings of, I guess feeling like envious of that kind of a situation, you know like I said, everybody being in everybody's wedding or whatever, I mean I think that it's just something that I (pause) want to (pause) I guess kind of talk—I don't know. I try to just, just try not to let it bother me, because I don't think that it's something that—I don't think it's something that should like realistically—like it's not one of the things that, of the many things that I worry about, that I need to be adding another worry to my life with that, you know. If they want to hang out, then they can call me. [35:02]</p>

<p>And I have a lot of other stuff that I think (pause) deserves my more immediate attention, um, (pause) basically—I mean, it's definitely also making me feel like I really, at this point, want to keep my circle smaller in terms of people that I'm like really close with and involving in you know details of my life because I'd rather do that with people that are investing time and effort into my friendship with them as opposed to just kind of, just letting it ride. So, you know, the friends that are actually going to be following up on a conversation we might have had, or you know like saying "I had so much fun last night. When can we hang out again?" or you know wanting to just hang out but not make it like "well I'm going to this place with these people. You should meet me there," you know, all the time. [35:59]</p>

<p>I mean it's definitely making me think that when I have my own wedding that I just don't really care to involve a lot of people because it's just (pause) a lot of pressure and a lot of kind of (pause)—again, I think that you know if I were to try to involve you know all these girls in like a wedding stuff or you know invite them and be really excited about having this big wedding with all these kinds of friends or whatever, I would end up feeling possibly resentful if I didn't get invited to some of theirs, or you know, whatever. And so I've kind of been like, nah, I'd rather just make time for the people that are making time for me and (pause) maybe it'll pan out different than what I thought from you know when I was in elementary school and middle school and stuff when I would talk to these girls and we'd all talk about how we're going to be each other's bridesmaids and all that stuff. And just kind of let that go because they're choosing to you know hang out in the way that they want to hang out and not choosing to include me. [37:06] </p>

<p>And um, if I was (ph) a little bit more cut and dry about these things in terms of old friendships—that if it's over, it's over. Why are you going to, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: force it? Um, I think it took me a little bit more time to come to my own version of that kind of conclusion about old friendships, um, because I did feel like it deserved a little bit more effort and you know (pause) and, you know, attention. So I think that's what's going to end up happening. I—I'm happy for Sandra and you know glad to be helping her with her wedding. I'll be glad to be there. (pause) I'm not sure like if I would—I don't know. [38:00] </p>

<p>I keep thinking—I mean the other thing that I think is like about this is that I keep ending up bringing it back to what I would do when I get married, and who would I—you know maybe I won't invite these people and you know, invite a really small group of people, and it's interesting I think that I keep bringing it back there rather than just (pause) looking at it in the more immediate future. You know, just in terms of everyday life; how I want to have a relationship with these girls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound pretty hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I am. I am. Like it's really hurtful. I mean the whole thing is hurtful. I think that the most hurtful though—I think it was that Lucy not, you know, just being a crazy person. But now it's turned into the—it's most hurtful because of their decision to make her the more important friend out of the two of us and kind of choose her, is what it kind of feels like. You know they've chosen her as the person to maintain that close relationship with and not me. [39:05]</p>

<p>And so, yeah, it is extremely hurtful, you know. (pause) But at the same time I've felt this same kind of hurt feelings from them so many times that at this point, especially just with the wedding stuff going on and whatever, and you know Lucy getting married and me not being there and all these other people being there that we went to school with, whatever, has really made me kind of (pause) be a little bit more firm in my not wanting to deal with it anymore. (pause) At all. Um (pause) because I think that there are other people that are worth my time? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 39:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and who seem to want to hang out with me more or equally as much as I want to hang out with them, as opposed to it seeming like I'm the one trying to you know, " Oh I really want to hang out with you." " Oh well, I don't know. When can I make time for you?" </p>

<p>I think that a friendship should be reciprocal. [40:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sounds like a crazy idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. It's not, right? So, yeah, I mean I'm looking for outside opinions and I think that you know maybe it's in hopes that somebody can make it easier for me to make a decision to just kind of wash my hands of it. But in reality I think that that's just—it's got to be my decision. I mean I've got to (pause) I'll maintain contact with them I'm just not going to be like getting upset if I don't hear from somebody that they come to town, or—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seeing pictures on Facebook and being like "What the fuck? Why wasn't I invited?" (pause) And concentrating on the people that are inviting me places, even if they're not like super good friends. I mean like this old friend that I used to work—whatever, former co-worker, we weren't even that close—she recently moved back and she's been absolutely like sending messages trying to like make a plan with me and another former co-worker, who I've been hanging out with more. And I posted on my Facebook wall this morning like "it's Monday, and before you know everyone gets plans, I wanted to make sure and see if we could make a plan for Friday." [41:35]</p>

<p>You know, things that obviously these other girls are doing; I'm just not being included in it and so I'd really like to concentrate on the people that are wanting to hang out with me and include me in things, more than anything else. And I mean in terms of the wedding, I'm just going to put all of it aside and you know help her out, let her enjoy—stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible at 41:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, yeah. And, yeah, and just help her and take it as an experience to get a, you know, a testimonial from a bride and groom who I helped and hopefully, you know, add this to developing my idea that I've had forever. And that's it. I (pause) anything else I just, I'm kind of going to work hard to put to the side and concentrate on things that are better and more positive, you know. Um, like I said, I mean as you know I have so many things that I'm worried about in terms of me, in terms of my house, in terms of ideas, in terms of relationships, that I don't really want to—I think I would like to have more friendships that don't involve worry and involve just relieving worry—or not relieving worry but kind of you know replacing it with fun stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CIENT: So I guess that's what this conversation has brought me. (laughs) Brought me to. This is it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. I know that you wanted an opinion from me. I guess my hesitation as I said is because, I do—you know—it's not that I think there's a problem with asking other people for their opinions or advice or whatever, but I think there are times including this one where the story about you doing that involves, um, being, ah, like worried about where your own feelings will lead —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [43:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and I'm kind of wary of taking part in that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, again, not that it's bad to get advice from people—that's not what I'm saying. It just seems to me that there's often sort of a particular piece of it that I suspect, that involves for you, in this case and some others, that are important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I think that that you're right. It has to do—it's a kind of a smaller piece of the bigger issue of me (pause) not knowing how to sort out my thoughts and feelings, and you know which often leads me to these temper tantrums or getting overly upset or whatever, and so I think that you know my asking for advice is kind of a (pause)—exactly like kind of to—so that I feel like, you know, like that I'm not overreacting. [44:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that, you know, makes me feel like I have more control over my own emotions because somebody else agrees with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something along those lines, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I guess until Friday. Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Very good. See you on Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. You too. [44:44]</p>

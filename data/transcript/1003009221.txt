<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I started working on it probably, um, just disabilities, contacting those people and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you contacting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I haven't contacted anyone with the disabilities department yet but I've contacted some advisors.  The, somebody to transition between my major and who actually made the transition so [INAUDIBLE] quite good management tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I got, um, I went  online of information for, um, disability stuff.  I thought I already had it printed off and it doesn't have everything I ever wanted.  It had all the, uh, the tests.  There, the comprehensive tests that they need for, um, disability and it said on their site, the test that says you have ADHD and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That other test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  They'll have some psych testing probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so I'm going to get down there tomorrow and find out exactly what I need and, uh, so other than that one of the, my house in [DEIDENTIFIED] with my mom and, uh, open it up last Tuesday and got it, got it all organized.  So that when I go back it'll be a little easier.  I left my dog at home which is really difficult but they made me leave him there so he may possibly stay there for more than a couple of weeks but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why did you leave him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well they wanted to try to cut out every distraction and there was being a little bit of a distraction last semester, not much but just a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how did things turn out with academics?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, right now it's not too good.  Huh, I, I, right now it's a 1.1 but that's because I have an incomplete in my history class.  I missed a day to my final exam -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was on Thursday and then on Tuesday so you got to, you just, marked as an incomplete.  He was going to let me take the exam when we get back so it will go up probably.  I don't know, I, I'd say it should be a little higher after that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's a doable, bringing it up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many hours do you have now, credit hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All together?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, all together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, somewhere like 85.  Like uh, those 3 points.  Um, it's more like 37.  I don't think they [INAUDIBLE] or anything.  Yeah, they have business 30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thirty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty-seven right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So your cumulative is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A 2.3 right now.  The rest of the [INAUDIBLE] so go up maybe 2.4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what are you taking next term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, this semester?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had 15 hours and then they, they sent me home.  A notice saying that one class is out.  To sign up for it has a  prereq course, so.  I had dropped it and, uh, so now it's 12.  But when I get there I meet my thousand mark maybe we can work something out that I can get 15 and, um, so I'm going to try to get back on track.  But it ought to be pretty easy this semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what are the classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're, uh, uh, math.  So last business calculus I take as far as math goes and, uh, so survey and art and architecture are only requirements and, uh, uh, so like com, - communications class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a management class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That should be a good for your new major.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'm doing management now.  These are all requirements.  The, some of these, 2 of them  are require, um, classes that I have to have to have to, it's prerequisite for the business program.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That you do in your freshman year.  That I never completed.  So, that's what we're doing now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you go anywhere over your break?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I, I stayed in town.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It was pretty fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you do much or work or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I worked a little a bit.  Um, but it wasn't bad, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, every thing's good with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does she feel like you're doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she, she [INAUDIBLE].  She don't have a problem with it.  She slacked off this semester too.  [INAUDIBLE] her grade.  She [INAUDIBLE], I think it's because she got into [DEIDENTIFIED] and she hadn't been away before.  She was at home, going to school there for a year and she did fine over, she had to study and she didn't study that much this semester but she will this semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just like me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got a schedule you're going to kind of look at in terms of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got a book my mom gave it to me for a Christmas present.  It was a nice gift but her gift was always a planner that has 3 separate categories.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, like your appointments and, um, the other one has your studying and then like another one is like the rest of your life.  So I started writing in that a lot and really got things down.  She, um, told me that I could, the only thing I could do is leave a notebook on the night stand because she says at night like she'll think of stuff and if she can't get to sleep because you are worrying about forgetting about it, just write it down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Write it down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's probably good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's good advice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you look at the, uh, your organizer yet and started to use it by chance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been using it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put things in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've put all my, I've about put it all in there, my important academic calendar days in there.  Uh, everything else I already know I have to do so far but as soon as I get syllabuses.  Classes start Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but, I need the syllabus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take the syllabus and put that information in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The medication's working well, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long does it last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm guessing probably like just 6 hours.  Like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take 2 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, take 1 in the morning and 1 around 2:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any side effects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't seen anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Better than it was with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you've been depressed or down in the dumps much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not really.  I was real, yesterday was a really bad day.  It was all raining and, uh, it was dark I guess in the house and I was, I just sat around for most of the day and watched TV and played the XBOX.  But it wasn't really depressing.  It was just kind of like I didn't feel like getting up and doing it.  But I was able to snap out of it when I wanted to.  I was like oh I need to go and get it.  From before I wouldn't.  I don't think I would have done that.  I think I would have just sat there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The dark comes kind of early in the day than that day, and toward the end of the day the sun came out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And looked nicer.  That uh, that help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah.  A lot of times, I guess early, it's in early parts of the day and then like 4:00 or something I'll get up and, you know, do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that how you're ordinarily are anyway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm, I wake up early.  Uh, especially if I go hunting in the morning, then I'm charged for the rest of the day and I'll be fine for the rest of the day and I'll be on [INAUDIBLE].  But for some reason if I wake, if I sleep in I'm waking up when I, early when I want to wake up, I probably just sleep in and wake up when I feel like it.  I think I'm just lazy for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it, it's a lot better when I wake up at a certain time and have everything set.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you'll find your mood will be better that way if you just have that regular schedule.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but it's hard to do, to discipline yourself can be difficult when you don't have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your first class of the day?  What time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably now it's like 10:00 but oh, turkey season comes in up there and do a lot of stuff so we're able to go hunting before classes and do a lot of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And still duck season's still in so end of January and so we're able to go and do that.  So there's probably reasons to get up early enough and I don't have a problem getting up early, though.  I think working out too.  I quit working out after I got out of high school, after I quit playing sports and I think that had a little bit to do with it.  It might have a lot to do with it and I just, that's one reason I probably got so lazy and just didn't, didn't feel like doing anything.  So I think, I mean I'm going to start doing that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Start running in the morning.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you put that in your, uh, agenda also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's just one of the things you note to do.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got somebody you can run with at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my roommate actually is a marathon runner and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I don't know about that, running with him [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I want to run [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It might be discouraging [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would run with him for about 5 minutes and then I'll say all right I'll see you at the house and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then let him finish.  He'll come back in like 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah you might want someone on your own level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he, he blasts away.  He'll come back in like an hour.  We're like how far did you go?  About 10 miles.  It's, like, really?  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's good to have somebody to do it with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my other roommate's pretty active.  He plays, like, racquetball.  But part of that, see one reason I don't think I would go to, um, probably some campus, general campus -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You have to be a full-time student.  Because I wasn't a full-time student I didn't have access to it.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dog, the dog was taking up a good bit of my time.  I couldn't exactly leave him at the house because he would bark, and would dig, but we fixed that problem with the house so we bring.  We wired an electric fence around the bottom to keep him from digging and it's set him, set him straight so that's one of the best ways to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So where's the dog going to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's going to be outside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, at your place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, eventually he'll be at my place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not for right away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not for right away.  Not till I see a drastic improvement, which is fine.  I mean I'm upset about it but it really needs to be done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what mom said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well granddad, mom and pretty much everybody says that.  So, it'll be okay for while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They'll take your girlfriend from you next huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], they'll try.  I don't really let, she's more upset about the dog than I am.  She was calling me when she left the house.  She saw it was there before she left, bawling [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, that was the dog that, that distracts itself with the hunting that you would do with the dog.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, we, we don't really hunt much up there, um, with him and season's not in and it's really not a, uh, well the hunting's not that great up there.  So we don't do that much unless we do like turkey season that come in April or the beginning of April.  So there's really, hunting is not like a big distraction.  It's just more, just one thing we do up there but, I'm not going stay at my schedule like, 9 to 5 where there's have good days and I'll have my weekends so like I'm going to have a good start.  There's no reason not to get started after all of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean all this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> After all this help and preparation for the semester and trying to get it fixed [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fixed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fixed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know about fixed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm getting there though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Make sure you get help if you needed it though.  It's tough for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm definitely going, um, talk to them as soon as I can.  [INAUDIBLE] all the resources I can get too especially in math.  Because math class is probably going get a little crazy so in tears but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You print your schedule there and your agenda.  Make sure you got drop days and keep up with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  They have the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you know what you got, uh, available.  No worries huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little worried about school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Say what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you little worried about school when you go back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're feeling more confident.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, I mean I know I can do it.  I just have to stay on top of it from the beginning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that was the problem I had before.  Because I never stayed on top of it and so I'll just get further behind and get further behind and so I'd lie down because it would bring me down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how are you going to do that different and not get behind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stay on top of it from the beginning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], you need, to, to kind of check and balance though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what your agenda, your, your DayTimer can come in handy if you've got it written, all written out in there.  It's kind of what I was getting at about your schedule.  You say you do better if you get up early in the morning and get off to a good start.  You can study then I guess.  How much medicine you take, you take it in the morning.  It seems to last pretty good.  You say your mood's better and how to teach more positive.  Your self esteem okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not getting down on yourself too much then lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Self doubts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.  Well I still have that little, I still have that, uh, the uncertainty of what  I'm going to be after college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I know that I'll probably figure it out in the next couple of years to get an idea and college is probably one of the best places to figure it out now.  So, I mean I'm not, it's not I'm going to hate school now.  I think, uh, if I quit hating school.  If I choose to have a better outlook on it, I think I can have a better outlook on it.  So, I'll say it, I, I can try to control my mood more of instead of saying oh I don't want to do this, I can say I really do want to do this and make the world a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So who knows?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So kind of positive mantra huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can do this.  I can do this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, kind of more concern than optimistic outlook on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your appetite and sleep pattern has been okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, once, once every couple of weeks I'll have just like an insomnia night where I'll just stay up till 3:00 or so, 4:00.  I mean other than that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is the latest in the day you're taking medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably 3:00, 3:00 or 4:00, just right before I go to work.  I was only working 3:00 to 9:00 shift so.  Once every couple of days so I'll take it.  I took it once at like 3:00 or 4:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Shouldn't be a problem.  So you kind of looking forward to getting back to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got all your classes, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], so you got all your classes and stick to your schedule and make it, uh, 8 to 5.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that you'd be able to do fine.  Get the help you need.  What's your girlfriend good at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, babbling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That doesn't help you much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she, she's a marketing major so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you get through this the next fall will be better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Probably stay up there some of the summer and do the summer school probably.  Try to be coming back up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You keep saying that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm still far behind with -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Behind what?  You caught up to what though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, my credits.  Like I'm not really on the right track with the now credits.  I took 9 hours out of I passed.  I actually passed 7 hours this semester.  Not too good so I'll take 1 or 2 courses and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know and Maymester if you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Summer school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Summer school, Maymester will, if I can get in Maymester it'd be better because I still have the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Other concerns that your mom has or anybody else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think she has any, she hasn't really had anything else besides any other concerns.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  So what did you get for Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I got a shotgun from my granddad, which was pretty nice and like print, [INAUDIBLE] print and, uh, some clothes.  So that's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of [INAUDIBLE] print.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a lot of print so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it was pretty good, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Remember to get your mom something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I still get everybody something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you need more meds?  I'll get those for you today.  Are you pretty happy with it overall though?  Fill like the dose is good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I feel all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Call me if it's not and we'll get different doses.  It's just on the low end.  So you can go up if you need to.  Especially if you're dopey or tired or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I haven't really noticed getting tired from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your health okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, I haven't had anyone else had anything that said it wasn't.  I had, uh, I think I had like tonsillitis when I first got back.  Um, but other than that it was, everything's been fine.  That's one reason I need to work out though.  My heart's probably in terrible condition.  Well not terrible but I'm on track, though at it being terrible.  I'm on track, though, of a heart attack something when I'm like 40 or younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I keep it up.  So, I had, I get really winded especially last night when me and my brothers were rough housing, wrestling around and I was laid out after that.  I was just dead, [LAUGHING], after about 5 minutes and I was like well, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often do you get checkups for your health?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE].  I want to say I have a physical every year when I was playing football but since then I haven't.  The only thing I've had was, I had one physical but, um, when I have to go to the doctor probably twice a year it's only for Strep throat but I haven't had a checkup in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The testing is the only thing it requires.  Trying to think where you get that done.  Did you mom look into that at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As far as their requirements?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she might have just not told me that she did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she's really just leaving it up to me, which is kind of good.  Responsibilities and all those good things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is, [LAUGHING], why is that good?  [LAUGHING], because that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Taking privileges I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you just do [INAUDIBLE].  You can do, they can give you the responsibility.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you want to see more responsibility, [LAUGHING],  I can give you some.  How long have you and your girlfriend been together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, 3 years this March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty awesome.  I guess she's the one.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's been a couple years, huh?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess so.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I feel like I've seen you because of your wife. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right, which I don't know is a good thing or not. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm not allowed to say. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll hear your side of the story. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Let's get to business. I saw you [DATE], so we're, are you still taking my meds or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, of course.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Um, okay. All right [DATE] Prozac 80, you were doing well with your OCD and your mood. The spring of '05 [INAUDIBLE] you stopped the Prozac for three months.  One month later you were very irritable, impatient, mood was not good, your appetite and sleep were fine, not suicidal, not helpless or hopeless, much more OCD in checking for about two weeks. Uh, three or four times checking subsequently was erratic.  [INAUDIBLE] concentration was okay [INAUDIBLE]. So we decided at that point, November of oh five to restart the Prozac and we pushed you then to 20 mg, what dose are you at now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 20.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just 20. That's a depression dose, it's not much of an OCD dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Which is lacking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So your OCD is out of control?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not out of control, but it's definitely, there's definitely some checking, day in and day out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's go through things in general. In general, first of all, what has happened in your life over the last year and a half?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Working in [DEIDENTIFIED], I'm still with the same firm, but as of May, yknow, late May, finally back in our house and, yknow, life has just become more difficult with my wife. Just pleasing her basically. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's high maintenance? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And to the point where it's not so much, uh, yknow, physically, sexually how I mean, it's not that monetarily she's high maintenance. It's more that emotionally she's high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Needy?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. She feels like I'm not there at all. And for me I see her as automatically a person that makes a mountain out of a mole hill.  She's too much drama.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hysteria?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Over everything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not everything, but [INAUDIBLE] crap that gets a life of its own and the only reason it does is because she wants to get some sort of reaction out of me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah. So she provokes you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, on purpose to get, yknow, a reaction.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me some more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, we go down to the beach recently, her parent's beach house, and she for some reason, yknow, her family can be difficult. Her brother has been an outcast for like the last two years. He was just a major dick. He was kind of shunned by the family. He blew up at Easter and threw a freaking plate of food across the back yard, yknow, cursed at his mom, almost cursed at his dad who he works for. I mean, the kid's out of control. He's [AGE], he acts like about [AGE]. I mean, just a fucking dick, okay? So I mean he's got in shoving matches with a couple of his other brother in laws. In an airport, yknow, he's married to an Indian woman, in the airport security give him a little bit of a hard time, they want to check her bags, and not, yknow, anymore than they would me or you. He takes his shirt off and starts ranting and raving. So here's a little background on who he is. He finally calls the one sister a C U N T, okay, uh, so he's out for two years. The other sister, the older sister, is at a beach house, it's like a community, some kind of beach house, but it's an open door policy, big place down on [DEIDENTIFIED]. So we're there and I've spoken to the brother once in the last two years. He was basically on an AA, alcoholic, AA, I'm sorry tour.  We spoke for about an hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For something, making amends?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it felt like that. Did it with a couple of people. So we're down there and he never had a real problem with the older sister. She is just kind of like a bull in a china shop. She's loud as can be always, controlling pain. She invites him over to the beach house because he is now staying like seven blocks away at a friend's place that he, and she invites him over. Her kids' parents aren't there. And it's kind of like this is, why would you do that? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were down there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We were down there. Okay?  Other cousin stops by who [NAME OTHER] invited and her parents had to leave for a funeral also and that was after that, and then her brother came over that afternoon and her cousin was coming in.  So [NAME OTHER] and I ended up basically hosting. Her brother ends up leaving but, yknow, he's kind of around for two or three hours. [NAME OTHER] now starts to feel stressed over all of this entertaining and just, yknow, brother coming over, the whole thing, and that night kind of flips out a little bit. Next day she calms down, flips out a little bit, oh my God, I can't believe this, what's going on, why did we come here, it was that night. Go to bed, next day wake up, she goes out and runs, the other sister kind of announces to her four kids that they're going down to the water park and my son wakes up and wants to go immediately.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old's your son now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's [AGE], just turned [AGE]. So [NAME OTHER] now feels like we've been painted in a corner by her one sister announcing to all the kids that we're going to the water park and that one of us is going to have to go. [NAME OTHER] can't go on these things for the most part because of the RA, so that kind of kicks in, can't do it, and then she feels bad because I was sleeping in Sunday. Oh shit, I had to get up, [PATIENT NAME] going to have to go, I'm gonna feel pressured to make him go and that's going to become a shit show.  So I wake up I said, no, sure, I'll go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's feeling guilty about you going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah. Well, it annoyed her sister and so many cross currents going.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how does the theme of this thing move to you getting along?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she all of a sudden, I go no, I'll go, no big deal. And gets really annoyed at that.  And kind of walks off.  Go to the water park, come back, her brother's there again.  And she comes into the bedroom and she's like what the fuck, yknow, you're, yknow, just taking this roles or whatever attitude bullshit, please everybody, never rock the boat, what the hell is this, my brother is here, oh my god, you're not there for me emotionally, you're never there, you've never been there, and just out of control.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh man, really busting you're balls.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Out of control, yeah. So I go okay, so we end up leaving, abruptly leaving, packing up the car, leaving. So for two and a half hours north, shit show. You're never there for me, maybe we should get separated, maybe we should get divorced, this is out of control.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You weren't there for her in what way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Basically me too, emotionally not there to basically talk her off the ledge.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To buffer her with her family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I feel like [NAME OTHER] runs at a level here, and, yknow, I'm maybe here and she wants me above her basically. Just support wise and drama wise. I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. And it's not cute anymore.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no. I mean, and, yknow, she -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was sort of cute when you married her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All the drama.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was easier to deal with. And, yknow, at that point what's the worst case scenario you just walk away. I mean, okay, shit, people change not a big deal, yknow, you walk away. Uh, yknow, [NAME OTHER] struggles, yknow, with RA, yknow, physically it's a lot of fucking demand, up and down stairs, yknow, running after errands, groceries, all that kind of shit, and there's like no brownie points for any of that.  And I've said this to her. Yknow, it's like shut your mouth before you break my balls about, yknow, not doing something or, yknow, not being there in one area when I'm here so much in another.  Kind of pulling a couple of those cards.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cut you some slack.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And it's not there.  We had a major blowup around, uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever been in couples therapy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we were there for a while.  I want to say a year, and it worked because there was a referee.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your perspective is kind of correct. So any neutral observer is going to be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's what, yknow, [NAME OTHER], we went to one woman and the woman wanted, she was just almost like a social worker, it was like, nah, this woman's not going to be good. Okay, fine. We did that for like six visits.  Went to a doctor then.  Okay, that was working.  That was satiating enough to, yknow, she knew one I had no interest so she's like, well, [PATIENT NAME] going to this he really does care about me, and also [PATIENT NAME] spending the money on this he really cares about me.  Which was fine for me because -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long did you go for?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think a year to a year and a half. What it did was it got rid of a lot of bullshit because [NAME OTHER] would throw it out there or I'd throw it out there and this woman would be like [NAME OTHER], I was winning a lot of battles, and that eventually pissed [NAME OTHER] off enough that we stopped going.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she stopped it and it was her idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, within a year and a half things were a lot better, and it was also, yknow, I don't think she's that good, it was [NAME OTHER] suggestion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I got the issue. Let's put this on the side for a moment. Let me ask you a little bit how you're head's working. How's your mood most of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mood's okay, so most of the time you're not sad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not anxious?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not irritable??</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your appetite's fine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Appetite's fine.  Irritable probably yes, I would say, go back to that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With one person or with in general?  Your fuse is short? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but more with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's a specific.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think you're irritable 'cause you're angry.  I think you're angry at one person.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's more like a pervasive short fuse with everyone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're mad at your wife.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, which I used to be angry with everybody when I first came here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  And when you weren't taking the Prozac.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That turns the volume down on anger.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, so you're irritable, it's really anger, and that's related to the marriage.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you angry at anyone else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You get along okay with her family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do they take her side usually?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, they have this one major blowup even before the, uh, beach thing, we were, she was, yknow, she slapped me and a glass full of Gatorade went all over the house.  Uh, we're getting a divorce, screaming at the top of her lungs, out of control, like really out of control, and, uh, my son was there, he was crying, it was because we went to get, uh, his shots and a physical for him, and he had missed, we had been breaking the MMR because of autism, and they didn't break it up the second, uh, immunization and [NAME OTHER] had come home and [NAME OTHER] and I want to say MMR but I absolutely should know, not right, and she goes, what?  Off the handle.  Her dad has to come over.  She's got me basically moving out of the house, selling the house, we're done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you got the kid the second vaccination.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And she was supposed to go down that morning but couldn't, so I'd stayed home because she was sick to go, was supposed to go off to work after I brought him.  Got home and it was just, shit show. I mean, her level of anger was out of control, like nothing I've ever seen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. So, uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which gets me into an area where I do a lot of white lies just to kind of make my life easier.  Occasionally you get tripped up if she finds out and then I'm a compulsive liar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of white lies?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, uh, uh, silly shit, hey, how many beers did you have tonight?  I probably had three or four beers, maybe I had six to eight.  Yknow, but wasn't driving, yknow, because that's a big thing in her family.  Wasn't driving, yknow, but all of a sudden next day when my buddy goes, geez, I can't believe we each knocked off about eight of those Belgian things, yknow, like, and I can't believe I'm about to kick you in the, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Um, how's your self esteem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's work going for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Work is well.  Frustrating, but, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why frustrating?  You still selling stuff?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you selling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Yeah. Oh, out the roof.  And not to toot my own horn, I mean, blowing the doors off the place, but not to toot my own horn.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why not? Don't you get a piece of it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a big, ah, no.  It's salary and bonus.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The world we're in is restricted and continuous, too, and it's gone from percentages to salary and bonus.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So the bonus is based on what you sell, but not nearly as.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To some degree.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a big bag, and they want to keep a lot of it.  But the other side of this, yknow, coin is there's no place to go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's no place to go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Job is dried up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I mean, there's some there, but it's risky when you have a wife and kid and you grew up with nothing, you're going to make a fair amount of money, you say, well, I guess suck it up and do this. Yeah.  So that gets frustrating.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, presumably, bonus time is good, right?  Bonus time is good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Must be nice for you if you're doing well.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Yeah, it's good. I mean, but, yknow -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ever think of going out on your own?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, I mean, you'd have to open up an entire shop.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You couldn't do it. It's not like a retail thing where you can do one guy and a small branch. I mean, you'd have to get licenses. It would take a million dollars to start.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have your resume out looking for jobs?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's not really the game.  I had a couple guys after me, but they can't hand out enough money up front to make it worth my while.  So it's tough.  I mean, honestly it's a good problem.  I mean, I can sleep at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, no suicidal thinking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You able to concentrate okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You able to [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of OCD behaviors do you have?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just checking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Only checking, nothing else. How about contamination fears?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I've always had that, public bathrooms and stuff.  I mean, always use a tissue after I wipe and then put it on the door to get out.  I know people that don't have OCD that do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. So what do you check?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, shit around the house, like my wallet, uh, just what's in there all the time, the credit cards, all that kind of crap.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much time do you think you waste on that?  If you were to add it up.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it hours?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, maybe minutes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Minutes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Minutes a day. I mean, thirty minutes a day max.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can live with that, that's not that bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your family knows that you're?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she doesn't know that I'm checking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're kind of on your own with this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which is better because you don't want anybody to know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly because it gets played, my OCD gets played as a card.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, kinda like her RA?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, exactly. Exactly. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I guess you don't bust her or you don't give her a hard time about OCD?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unless you waste her time, do you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I'm very conscious of that, like.  I used to, we're running out I used to be checking where pillows and shit was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And that's how I finally got caught up and then all of a sudden I'm well aware of that and I'm able to let it go.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever been to cognitive behavioral therapy for your OCD?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ever tried bibliotherapy, ever read a book?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I read that one book you gave me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did that help?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It did for a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. Yeah. I got.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It gave you like these techniques for, uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Almost to break the loop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I probably should read it again to be honest with you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's almost like a drug. But it, I think the key insight there, one is just recognizing when you're in a loop, yknow, just acknowledge it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you can move forward to the thinking your way out of it. One way to think about it is the OCD comes from a very primitive part of the brain like a very animalistic deep sensors of the brain.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you think of it, a lot of OCDers do primitive grooming rituals, right they pick out hairs, very primitive checking and, uh, grooming.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when the cognitive stuff does it, it defused the later part at least until the later part of the brain, your cortex, your thinking part to control the juices coming from the primitive part.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so with willpower you use this very sophisticated later part of the brain to think through and push down those primitive things. It seems to work. I mean, like it goes head to head against, um, medication, behavior therapy is far better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.  Long term.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it seems to me your OCD is not terribly out of control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it could be better, but not so much that we should schlog you with a high dose SSRI and make it impossible for you to ejaculate and all those side effects.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any side effects?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're going to continue to stay on the Prozac all this time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any interest in switching over to something different?  I mean, we've been.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. The only reason I would say yes is just because if it could get rid of, if I could get a quick fix and get rid of that little thirty minutes a day, or ten minutes a day, whatever it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can reduce it.  Yknow, go from thirty to twenty.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But we probably could do that on a higher dose of Prozac.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm on 20. Is it 20s I'm taking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're on 20s.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, that's what I have from a couple years ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's what it is, that's what it is because you just said 30s for a second, but I see what you're saying. Yeah, no, it's 20s. One pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if we could, uh, yeah we could raise the dose or we could, uh, try something different. I've never used anything but Prozac with you, correct?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Correct.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know to be honest, I've known you for a long time, but I've only seen you four times.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't show up very much. June oh three, August oh three, October oh three, January oh four, then November oh five.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The last two times I came to see you, honestly, it's because of my wife.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She push you to come?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, who writes your prescription?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You guys.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We still give you prescriptions two, three years later?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I go to the pharmacy, they say okay we'll call the doctor or whatever and I go down that night and pick it up, no problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a business here, I gotta make money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The last time I had taken myself off just after that crazy knee surgery.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember that. Well, listen, I think we should keep an eye on it somewhere.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were on 40 mg at one point.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. I've been up to 80, right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. The last time was 20. You stayed on 20. If I were you and I had, I mean you have significant depression and OCD.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've only tried one medicine. Prozac's a great drug, but let's try something else. You're stable now. You're not going to float off the deep end.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it can only be this good and better. It's not going to get worse. So and we can always go back to Prozac.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, that's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So now the question is do we keep in the Prozac family of SSRIs or do we expand a little bit. There are two kind of Prozac with a kick, Cymbalta and Effexor. They increase both serotonin and norepinephrine. So your mood is fine, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I say stick with the SSRIs.  Ever hear of Lexapro?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lexapro's pretty smooth.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  What are the main side effects people have?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's all the same, delayed ejaculation.  How's your ejaculation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean she chases me around more than I want, but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you're mad at her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, just, yknow, freaking tired.  Wake up at five o'clock every morning, work twelve and a half hour days, I'm not looking to play grab ass at eleven, twelve o'clock at night. I'm looking to fall asleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At least not with your wife.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah. No, I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. Five minute relationship is like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the way people are, women too. I mean, people worry about that. I think women less. All right, so we're going to switch to, let me think if there's anything that's better, sometimes I push Zoloft, you've heard of Zoloft?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Zoloft, sexual dysfunction's a problem and you can pull that back easier, but Lexapro's fine.  Paxil I don't like so much, um, you get some weight gain with that.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that I don't need.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's try Lexapro.  What you can do is try all of them eventually.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get it right, it's like trying different brands of aspirin or something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, you keep doing 'til you get it right 'cause, yknow, you're kinda suffering from this.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not suffering a lot, but you're suffering more than you should be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, yknow, if this doesn't work well, we'll just switch you to something else.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Come back in six months or you can come back whenever you want. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whenever you want to make a change. The dosing, again, we've had you on from 10 to 80 mg of Prozac. I'll push you up to 20 of Lexapro which will be about equivalent to 40 of Prozac so a little higher level of serotonin, but not up at OCD levels. If you really want to push your OCD you take 40 of Lexapro.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But for now we'll just settle for round one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And any major side effects?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing, nothing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No weight gain, nothing?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nope.  Nothing.  Yknow, anything can do anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But generally -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I was just asking for basics. I know, I mean, everybody's different.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you had weight gain from Prozac ever?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so. I've been running an awful lot though. I also run kind of like a medication for me.  It burns that extra edge if it's there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have samples.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you know of any good, yknow, marriage counselors in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. Have you seen him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER], I think [NAME OTHER] been there with her, uh, mom, her dad and her sister before so I don't know if that's a good idea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, he wouldn't, that means she trusts him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if he comes down on your side, then it's.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, then I get a lawyer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, all right. He's really good. I mean, he's the best of the best.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, yknow, but he may not want to do a couples therapy for you guys.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He can give you a referral.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He knows all the players. He spends a lot of time with his [DEIDENTIFIED].  All you have to do is show him that I know some of the players too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I talk to him every now and then so I'll mention.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. I'll call and all as soon as I get back to work.  But I just need for her to get to a place, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Prozac you can just stop.  The half life of Prozac is so long that it tapers down automatically. You stop it today it'll still be in your system for a month.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's as if you're slowly decreasing. And you actually don't even need the samples because it's easy enough. The first week you'll take half of.  I'll try to get some samples.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Prescription will be just one a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> First week you're on 10 mg and after that it's just one a day of the 20s.  So I'll give you, uh. I gave you the first couple of weeks just to make sure it agrees with you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So week one is this, 10 mg.  Week two is two of them, 20 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Prescription, don't forget it's for 20 so just one a day, not two. Whereas with the 10 you take two. Basic math, I think you can handle that. Not all my patients can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Why do you have to do 10 for a week? What is that, just?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to wrap it up, just to wrap it up. You probably wouldn't need to because you have the Prozac in your system and so this is just replacing it. Yknow, what you'll find is, on the first week because the Prozac is still there and this is, you'll have the second week higher dose of serotonin, so you'll do better for that week. And if you find it's dramatic you can say, if it's dramatic, then you can call me and we can talk about ramping up your dose a little bit because I think your brain would probably run better. This is the lube, yknow, oil in the machinery. Your brain would probably run better on a touch of a higher dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because when someone has these OCD behaviors and checking, it's usually, um, the anxiety juice is being generated.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  For some reason. OCD is just a way the brain mops up anxiety. You've got anxiety juice being generated. Something's wrong and it will be nice for that to now to be off.   You can manage. You can't manage with a bad depression. With this you can manage.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You need any prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And yknow you can tell your wife you're on this. Maybe it'll, uh, make her feel better that you're trying and you're not [INAUDIBLE].  With someone like that, you can't win.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, I agree. Her knowing I'm proactive I mean she'll probably have a seven course meal on the table. Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> See you in a few months.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Good, I appreciate it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye.</p>

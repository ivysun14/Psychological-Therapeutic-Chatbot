<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now we're, now we just proceed like normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you asked me what's going on with everything.  The nothing part which I'm concerned about is the consulting work, has kind of like, of that, no other work.  I have been fully paid for what I've done but, basically, the concern, what I do is they give, you know, there are jobs that people call me for and I go take care of it and they pay me money.  That's basically it.  It is very specific things that I work on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if there are no more, it's over.  So, you know, it's I expect them to call again.  There's absolutely no problem why they shouldn't but, like all industries, this, this is slow right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a slow down, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is a slow time and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And is it exclusively, you know, with restaurants?  Are there other companies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.  I'm actually working for others.  I'm working for a kidney dialysis chain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm doing some work for an office, uh, an office building.  In fact, the re, I haven't done any work for restaurants in over a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I had to depend on the restaurants, I'd have no money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, last year I had made a lot of money just, not a lot, but I made money on other than restaurants.  The restaurants know me but no restaurants are building.  So it's kind of like, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how do these other people hear you, these other companies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's the other thing.  I don't really promote myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I basically, it's word of mouth.  People know what I do.  I have done work for them and they come back and they say, you know, but right now it's slow and I really need to make a, an effort to market myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Could you do mailings or something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now just, why not put all your effort into that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's more than mailings, I, I could do a lot of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because there are a lot of people I know.  I could make a phone call and e-mail people I know in the industry who network and, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hate that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know what it's a funny thing.  I mean, I feel similarly.  I felt like if I knew what I was doing, you know, people would come to me and that was that.  But, particularly with the economic situation, I think, you know, you, I guess you have to be a little hungry.  So I just met, uh, this afternoon with a group of psychologists in the next town, that, uh, I knew one of them, and their a nice group, and I wanted them to kind of know that I was around and so I did a little in-service teaching thing for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and they dug it.  And, you know, so it's, it's a similar thing if you could get your foot in the door and let people know what you do, you know?  It would be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, you're right, and I, I don't really have to do a lot of cold calling -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is very interesting.  There's enough people that I know networking after 30 years in this that I can call, "And by the way I haven't spoke to you in a while.  How this, good."  And he, they may not have but they may know somebody who is doing something else, so, and that's how I've gotten work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The problem is is that I haven't really gotten, I guess, kind of like very like, I really enjoy work.  It's not even a matter of like I'm going to lose my house if I don't get work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean we're fine.  What's going to happen if I can't additional work, we're not going to be able to go on our vacations.  We're not going to be able to do anything extracurricular.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean because that's really what pays for anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No cruises.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No cruises.  We are taking a cruise actually in, uh, will be the first time in over two years.  So we're going in March, Ma, March.  So it's something that, um, I kind of like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Procrastinate and then I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have, you have to push yourself to do that.  It's not what you'd like to do naturally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But maybe you could figure out a way that makes it more pleasant, you know?  I mean, if you know these people for a long time, maybe there's some way that's kind of natural and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And the, and the other thing is I, and I know what the deal is because I don't need to have 10 people work for.  I just need one or two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just one or two projects every so often and this is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is really what I'm doing.  I'm not intending to make, to work 40 hours or 50 hours a week doing what I'm doing.  It's just a matter of consulting on particular things where they're having a problem securing permits or approvals or doing something like that.  And I, I'm in contact with them but I've just got to be a little more assertive.  I say it to you because I know it's what I have to do, but I haven't been doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've let a lot of stuff go.  And we've had a lot of recent things going on in the household, uh, um, I am now officially, and I told you, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my oldest daughter had twins, a boy and a girl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's where [NAME OTHER] is right now.  She's living in, um, she living.  We both went down for the birth and then she stayed a month.  I went back after a couple of days.  And then I came down and picked her up and we came back, and she came back here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now she just went down again for about another three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where are they living?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I get the chance to see the, the babies and I take her back.  I go -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's just beyond [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's near [DEIDENTIFIED].  I guess it's beyond [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hey, that's nice.  That -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's a beautiful area.  Well, she's actually not in [DEIDENTIFIED].  She's in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No one ever really heard of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it, it's a, it's a nice area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a, it's a beautiful area.  She's got a nice house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, they're all well.  Everybody is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody, everybody's also.  I'm really pleased with that.  Um, that, that's okay.  That's not, that's very good.  I, it's a very positive thing.  It, uh, had a little, I had some little stress, stressors related with, with my daughter because she's a very controlling person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I may have told this to you.  Every time I go down there, she's like, you know, well you really can't eat on the couch.  Everybody else can eat on the couch but you can't because you're a slob.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't say, she doesn't say it that way and it, and it's probably true.  But, you know, she's very controlling.  So I have to really kind of like watch words.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I kind of like get offended by it.  But I did have a chat with her about it my next time down because there was something else that came up and I got very, very disturbed.  Well, it, it goes on and on and on and on.  But what, whatever it is, it's resolved.  Everything is okay with her and, you know, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This must be a big stress for her with the children because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's unbelievable because it's two and they get up at different times and everything else and it's the first time and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And everything's messy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's what, that's why [NAME OTHER] is there and [NAME OTHER] is trying and she's really helping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my middle daughter, the one I've always complained about that I have a, you know, like she's just like me, you know, we're kind of like butting heads a lot.  She just broke up with her boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're two nurses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't believe that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My ma, yeah.  Yeah.  She told me it was going on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They lived in your house for a couple of years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's exactly right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  And they moved and then they broke up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They moved out.  They moved to [DEIDENTIFIED] and she told me at that the time when they moved to [DEIDENTIFIED] there was a problem.  Okay, so if there's a problem, then resolve it.  But what they did was they worked in [DEIDENTIFIED] for about six months and then decided they were going to move back to New Jersey and work at [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which they have been doing for over a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now they've decided it's not working out.  So she says he's clinic, whatever it is, depressed -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really upset.  Not because she's leaving, just because he's dumped.  He's not happy with himself.  He's an only child.  He only has his mother.  I think I mentioned to you.  He's has a very unusual family.  I mean, he had told her that the reason that he's upset about leaving, about breaking up, not so much because of her because he's no longer in the [NAME OTHER] family.  Because we have so many kids and so many people -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, you know, it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what he told her, "I'm not going to miss you.  I'm going to miss your family."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, he didn't say that way, but he says he's really going to, but the problem is there wasn't a fight.  It's just that it seemed that she had to control everything.  He didn't take any initiative in doing things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He was too passive with her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very passive.  He wasn't as emo, recently he became less loving and less caring.  Uh, they were always good friends and stuff but he wasn't, it wasn't what she wanted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, but I would have thought that it would have came, it would came to be like the smart move right after they graduated from nursing school, then to make a decision on what they want to do.  That would have been a lot or even, even if they went to [DEIDENTIFIED] after that.  Don't take another move and keep on doing, they kept on prolonging and prolonging and prolonging.  So that's a little bit of a, a stress on my, uh, because what's happening is that I want to tell her that she's making so many mistakes.  And she thinks she's so smart and she's knows everything and it just hurts.  And [NAME OTHER] did the same thing.  I mean, she took an apart, she didn't have to take an apartment to move out.  She could have moved in with us -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And lived in there because right now she doesn't know what she wants to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All she knows is that she wants to move out of his place.  Well, that's fine.  She can move out, stay with us for a little bit of time, and then while you're with us you can look.  There, there's no pressure to move out.  You know, you, you, instead she took a little shack, oh God, corner on [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's in the mid, on [DEIDENTIFIED] side of [DEIDENTIFIED].  A small split level house was converted to three apartments.  The house must be about 60 or 70 years old, really dilapidated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she took one and the layout is nice but it's in such need of repair.  There are so many openings and holes and it's old and it's, she's paying a lot of rent for it.  And she, now she's trying to fix that.  She went from a gorgeous place in [DEIDENTIFIED].  She had one of those nice three-story apartments.  There she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was beautiful.  Two bedrooms, two baths, beautiful place.  And now to take, um, I can't, I couldn't say a word.  [NAME OTHER] was there once before me just to look at it and then she didn't say anything to me and then I saw it the other day when I had to help her with something.  And I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me?"  Let her make her own thing.  I'm not going to tell her because what she does to me, she says, "Look you can come and see the apartment, but you can't say anything bad."  I know I have, I know what I have to do.  I was talking to [NAME OTHER] about it.  It just bothers me because I know she could be in such a better place.  She doesn't deserve -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's [AGE].  She's been through college.  She's been through a nursing degree.  She's a professional.  She doesn't need to, to downsize to keep, I, uh, I think she has a problem with self worth.  I know she does.  She has a lot of, and I, I just wish.  She said she went to a, uh, therapist with him.  It didn't work.  But I would like to let her go to a therapist.  I don't know.  I, I don't know if it's going to help her.  She, I guess she needs to grow up or do something.  I'm just, now that's a kid, you want to take care of her and or at least I do.  So I, I feel that, that's just bothering me, um, a, a little because I just, I can't do things for her or she won't let me do it or I can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Control it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well, listen.  You would like to see her in nicer place, but she's not in any peril there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, she's not that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no danger in the area there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I keep saying that to myself by the way.  That she's not in any peril there.  It's not a bad, I mean, it's not a clean place, not a nice place.  It's like, I, I envision as her being like in the Army or something, like you know.  But to pay $1000.00, I'm sure she's paying a $1000.00 a month.  You can't get an apartment for less than $1000.00 a month anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the whole reason to take that was because she wanted room for the three cats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she has three cats.  Now she doesn't think the apartments good for the cats because there's so many openings and so many and it, too many bugs there and it's not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  It's good for the cats.  She can catch all the mice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, those mice things.  Oh, um, uh, before I forget.  There's some other, uh, well that, that was bothering me and in the middle of this whole thing, um, I think I told you I had prostate surgery in July.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, believe it or not, uh, I had a problem again going to the bathroom and I went to see the urologist.  And I had the exact same surgery again to correct scar tissue that grew in that thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had that about three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm on some Cardura now.  Now you can put down another drug that I'm on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were off it and now, now back on it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm on only, only, only Cardura.  But I'm going to be off it in about a week or so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh well, that's fine.  And Tricor still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everything else is still the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Zetia, Tricor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everything else is still the same but, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's, that's only other thing and that's okay.  That's not, I think that, I, I just would, I, I feel that at this stage of life I would love the kids to be like, I'm very happy with [NAME OTHER] because [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], they got their kids.  They got this.  They don't need me anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] just got a beautiful apartment.  That's the one that's a chemistry professor -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Near [DEIDENTIFIED].  She got an apartment in, um, [DEIDENTIFIED].  Really nice place and she's fine.  She has a boy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She is teaching at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's teaching chemistry at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I mean, they're off and that's what I'm really looking for, forward to.  You know, and it's just, I, I don't know.  It's and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have to update this.  So [NAME OTHER] is now how old?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] will be [AGE], [DATE].  She's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And so [NAME OTHER]'s [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE]?  [NAME OTHER] is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And [NAME OTHER] is [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so she finished her PhD and a Post Doc too or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she didn't do a Post Doc.  She just went right into, right into teaching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She just went right in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Her boyfriend did a two year Post Doc.  He's living in [DEIDENTIFIED].  He's trying to move, find a job in Jersey, but he can't seem to find one.  Everybody is all set and [NAME OTHER] is doing fine.  We're all, you know, I really, uh, there's no medical things going on.  I mean, this was a horrible thing with the surgery I had so, but I don't know.  It's part of the game.  I guess I could -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she's working at [DEIDENTIFIED], uh, [NAME OTHER].  What, uh, what department?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Med surg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  She's a  regular floor nurse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's a regular floor nurse and she doesn't know what she wants to do.  Right now she's thinking about whether she should go to travel nursing, whether she should do this, whether she should do that.  She's thinking about all these things and I, I just thought of there would have been, uh, I mentioned, I just, come home for a little bit and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Save the money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, she doesn't want to be home.  She's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's [AGE].  She wants to be on her own.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How do you get someone to see a therapist?  See a good therapist?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, you wouldn't be the person to tell her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she knows I see you.  And she knows I see, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would she be more receptive from, from your wife though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I think she would be more receptive from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From the, yeah, she really likes him and she sees him a lot.  He actually had given her something at one time, but I, I really wish he wouldn't just, he just, I don't know about that.  Now she wants to be taken care of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But she's, she's coping well with the breakup.  She's not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, she's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depressed.  Why, why can't she meet someone else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, she's doing fine.  And you're not going to believe what I'm doing on Saturday night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having dinner with [NAME OTHER], the boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I asked him to have dinner with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think it's the right thing to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did nothing bad to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did as best he could.  He is extremely depressed.  His mother is having a lot of pr, uh, he's not getting along with his mother, and I just want him to know, I don't want, I want him to know that I'm not angry at him for the breakup.  I'm disappointed that things didn't work out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm not really angry.  I'm, I think -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does, does [NAME OTHER] know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does [NAME OTHER], oh yeah, [NAME OTHER] knows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] knows?  Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She said it was okay to, I wouldn't.  [LAUGHING].  I'm not going there.  I'm not going there.  I can't do any, I, I mean, uh, even when she knows, and I do something, I say, "You know, you told me to do it."  "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  That's okay.  I guess you could do it."  She gets, I, I got to walk very delicately, very delicately -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With [NAME OTHER].  But I just, my only concern is not to bring him back, not to say anything, just to say, "Hey, I still, you know, I'm still a friend."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "And I, uh, I'm really concerned, you know, I'm concerned about your well-being.  Um, but I just wanted you to be aware that there's, that [NAME OTHER] or I just, you know are not angry or mad at you or your family."  We really aren't.  We're just disappointed that the relationship didn't work out and we're very, and we feel very ha, and I, we do.  We feel very happy that they both, they both achieved their nursing degree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't mean that, it, it has to be my kid.  I mean, it's, he did something good for himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he going to continue to work at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a big question.  [NAME OTHER] says he's not sure, he's not sure if, believe it or not, she's the one, he's the one, four years ago, that said, "How about going for nursing?"  And now, she doesn't think he's very happy with the vocation that he chose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know.  I, I'm not, I'm not planning to be friends in, in a relationship.  I just, I just want to make sure that he understands that I'm not, I think it's too late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  It's, I guess there's no definite wrong or right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess it, it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had a relationship with him.  You want to let him know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He lived in our home for two, over two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was with our daughter for over five years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Their breakup wasn't because one did something bad to the other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It wasn't like he hit, or he did, he took good care of her.  They, they, they loved each other.  He, they protected each other.  It's just that it ran, he no longer loves her in the same, in other words, like you know, what, what's, what's he's going to do?  She wants someone to just, you know, to do everything.  Bring her flowers, bring her this, bring her that.  He was like that in the very beginning.  But he's not like that now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think he's changed because he's unhappy.  And he, it's not he's unhappy because of [NAME OTHER].  He's just, there are outside things that are creating some problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  She, she wasn't, you know, she, that, she wasn't happy with the way the relationship was when they're [AGE].  She thought of, you know, why, why continue.  Why get married -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And stay with someone if they're not what you want it to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She kept on pushing it.  You know, she knew that there was a problem a year and a half ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she kept on delaying the breakup, delaying, delaying it, and delaying it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until now she can't deal with it anymore.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she, she will bounce back.  And, uh, it's just that I, it's just that I hate to see it take such a, you know, you want to see kids keep on improving themselves, not all of a sudden they move into this beautiful home and have everything nice.  And now, she moves out and comes into this, this rat infested piece of shit.  And I just want to help out and in fact, she just moved by the way just two weeks ago -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I can't even help physically because I'm not allowed to lift things because of the surgery I had.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is hard to find a nice place around here, in a nice safe area that's cheap.  But that's, that's a hard thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to compromise in way or another.  You know, like, I'm guessing the [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] for example, might be $1400.00 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For a two.  I don't know if they have a single bedroom place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They could get a, she could get a [DEIDENTIFIED] for $1100.00 or, or $1150.00, a $1000.00.  But a lot of them will have restrictions against cats or pets.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See, that's, uh, that's the thing.  Once you want no restrictions, then, you know, you got to kind like change your motif to different type of thing and but, what, what bothers me is that she doesn't, she's not thinking straight.  She's not thinking logically.  Everything was the cats and now she's not sure if she even wants the cats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, so, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whose cats were they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not, not, shared or the boyfriends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  She loves the cats.  The cats are everything to her.  That's why she wanted them.  And the boyfriend loves the cats.  They both wanted the cats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she's thinking she maybe she'll have to be doing something else and she doesn't know if the cat.  And then she doesn't like the place that she's in because there's all kind of poisons around there too.  It's not, it's not a nice place.  I guess.  I can't do nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  That's a bummer.  Well, hopefully she won't be there too long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope she won't but as I said, it's, other than, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any issues with the Concerta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  The only issue with the Concerta is actually, I haven't really be taking the ones in the afternoon.  Not that I forget, that, the bell goes off.  But I'll be, I figured I'd save it in case I do not, because I'm doing nothing in the afternoons.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm very, the last couple of weeks, this is really just over the last couple of weeks, because I can't lift anything.  I can't do anything.  I can't ride.  And, and I'm, I'm restricted -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does this -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On my activity.  So I, I, all I do is I watch television or I something easy.  And then I figured what do I have to, what do I have to be alert for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can stick with the 1 until you, you're more busy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, if I'm doing something, I, you know, like if, like if, um, I, I whatever, like if, if I know I'm doing something.  I have a plan that I work or going somewhere that I have to be or so.  I don't know.  It's, uh, maybe it's the wrong thing to do.  I don't know.  I was going to ask you about that today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I think taking the 1, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always take 1 every morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, for example, I've had, had people who take 2 a day but just take 1 on weekends because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They know they're doing less.  They're not needing to focus and concentrate as much.  They're not working or not working in that kind of capacity, uh, or if they go to school and they're not really doing a lot of homework.  So I think that's fine to compromise in just taking the 1.  Then if you were busier, then you can back to the 2.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was, that was the only thing that I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think it's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was the only, that was, that was it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  You know it's a good compromise.  The lowest dose that, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I don't like to take a lot of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you're going to build up a surplus, I guess?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm building a surplus for the times I, uh, what you call it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's times you take more than 2?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But at times that, what you call it, that I forget to renew.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had a problem with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  Now, so let me, I'm going to shut this part off.</p>

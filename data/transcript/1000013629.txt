<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:01)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think I like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 0:20) about some mathematicians who were having lunch at the club and like one guy came in and wanted to sit down beside the table because he always liked it. And the guy who was sitting said oh, no, he couldn't do that because it faced the window. Even though the window was facing north, he said it was too bright outside-to much for him. I really thought that was bad. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something so much (inaudible 0:52).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When people think it's unpleasant when it's strong. You know, that's an indication of how far away from the real-the real way human beings think. The natural state of human beings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Other than that, I have nothing to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing bothering you? Same old thing about not being able to find (inaudible 1:39) getting into?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I could say maybe nothing is bothering me at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, terribly bothering me. That doesn't seem quite right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what would it be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I have nothing to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have nothing to talk about in a way unless you have-how come-that's what the results that can come out of all different kinds of talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't think you can attribute it to any one problem. Like, I don't know, nothing may be bothering me (inaudible 2:33) may have something on my mind that I could talk about. And then could resolve and something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could have something bothering me but it might not be worthwhile to discuss it here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I might have already reached some confirmed conclusion about it (inaudible 2:57) and be satisfied with my conclusion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So being bothered might not be a reason for you not having something to talk about here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 3:11) Yeah, all I'm really trying to do is give you something to (inaudible 3:17) and try to differentiate how it's not that or what it is. Or you just sort of opine that this condition of you not having anything to talk about is in conjunction with a lot of causes that you don't really know what any of them are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm...that says it. That you don't even know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a kind of restful weekend and I'm feeling all right. I don't know. I haven't heard from my parents in long time. They're not making any great demands on me or at least no new ones. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: None that I haven't thought about a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. (inaudible 04:11)</p>

<p>PATIENT: They must have got pretty much (inaudible 04:11) all the-all the past troubles are sort of waiting-waiting to be brought up again. But I've sort of prepared for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they haven't hit me with anything new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't been struck with any new situations at school. You know, one course is winding up and I think it's going to be the first course in four years that I haven't missed a class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I talked to the teacher about the Army and (inaudible .4:56) and (fence ph 5:04) I'm still not doing work but it's not really bothering me because I haven't been and I've sort of been putting it off (inaudible 05:13). I'm sort of prepared for any outcome. If I flunk the course, then I'll think it was one of two, one of three (inaudible 5:24)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't matter to you very much this time around. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, (inaudible 05:36) twelve. And I feel confident that once I get started, you know, studying for the finals it will help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's more just not wanting to start working on it yet than...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel I should have-I should have started that a long time ago, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Should have started, but you didn't want to then and you don't particularly want to now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I do it the next day and the next day I said I'd do it the next day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't particularly want to now because there's so much work to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I start to sit down and fool with-it's so much. Why bother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. [06:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then, I found that they're going to offer a relevant course next quarter. One (inaudible 06:35). They're doing it sort of the same way they did it last year. Last year I didn't know about it until half way through the Spring quarter when they only offer it once a year. They didn't list it in the pre-registration schedules and they didn't list in the Spring quarter kind of schedules. But I at least happened to be walking past the right door and noticed some piece of paper up there that said they were going to do reports on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's something to encourage me. (inaudible 07:10). Spring, you know. Lots of things are making me feel nice today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Lots of times I find changes to really (inaudible 07:25)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: For?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 07:28) plus the weather.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Not that this whole thing didn't bother (inaudible 7:39) but just that it hasn't gotten any worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not for a long time now (inaudible 07:44) back and forth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Kind of stabilizing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. A comment was made that it's still so cold out even though it is (inaudible 8:05). Don't know (inaudible 08:16) a failure. I think I got like a sixty (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. There's things still wrong with school. You know, combined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That makes me feel all right for them. It's nothing I feel particularly secure about-I don't feel-feel like I can kind of relax or anything like that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but just feels good to know. It happens a couple days a week, really. Thursdays and Fridays, I generally always feel good. (inaudible 09:17) let go and not even be two or three more days I won't have to go to work and I won't have to go to class. No (inaudible 09:26) feelings. It's just going to be a very stable, calm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know maybe it (inaudible 09:42) for me to feel better on Monday than I do on Sunday or Saturday. By then I still have the whole week ahead of me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, you know, immediately in front of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still not (inaudible 09:56).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not enough to cancel out those other things that are making you feel good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you come in here and nothing in particular is bothering you-like no bad things happened tomorr-today but you're feeling a little glum, does it then seem to you like there's nothing to discuss-no reason to bother, no way to get hold of anything we should talk about either way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think when I feel very nice I don't want to talk about how important the negative things are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They bring you down too much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also harder to get ahold of. And I'd have to sort of go down to get ahold of it, you know. Not in order to bring me down to talk about them, just to struggle to get hold of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to think yourself into something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I still have to put myself in the situation where I would be feeling those things anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I want to talk about depression I'd sort of have to play like-in my mind-play like I'm depressed (inaudible 11:38). You have to put yourself in the situation of it. Because that's the only way I know how I am when I'm depressed. I can't sort of-I can't get happy and analyze how I am when I'm depressed because the only way I know myself when I'm depressed is (inaudible 11:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There must be something to talk about, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's talk an issue. I'm just trying to think whether I think there is another way or a viable thing because it doesn't-and I mean and that probably would be good-it doesn't seem right to me. I've often thought it's a contradiction in therapy that it should be so difficult if a person is feeling good, to know what to do. Like, I don't like the idea that (inaudible 12:34) then it's okay and I can go somewhere. </p>

<p> But now I'm was just trying to figure out whether I thought there was an alternative to getting into the correct thing with that and talking about it. Like I think that's a more-very important way people do get somewhere in therapy.</p>

<p> There's something else. I mean, the-the-that might work. I don't know that it makes any sense for you, which is just some people would kind of have concepts of what some of their problems were that they can get to whether they're feeling bad or not. You can get them when...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible .13:35)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, kind of, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 13:41) what you mean by that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I think I have trouble with my schoolwork because of-being afraid of being judged. That's like a concept of a (inaudible 14:10).</p>

<p> You know when I think about these things every time (inaudible .14:17). I don't know, just something like that. I find it a little hard to generate. And sometimes it gets somewhere and sometimes it doesn't. I don't know. What do you think? [14:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. It's-I'm just trying to encompass (inaudible 15:11).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well, in a way, then it doesn't make sense. Because that really-that's almost (inaudible 15:14). Like it may not be that hard-that you make your problem such a concept like that. And that may be one thing that some people have and other people don't and the idea of having to generate something like that so we can talk about it like that doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I haven't really (inaudible 15:47) to talk about. I don't even know if it's a concept or a problem, but I think a lot of my own problems or unhappiness or (inaudible 16:05) stem from not having (inaudible 16:15) father. Does that mean like I have two kinds of feelings? Or divided feelings?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it mean that there are some things that you like about him and other things that you do or don't? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, sometimes I like him and sometimes I don't. (inaudible 16:33).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're getting at he's kind of miffed if he spends time to phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It changes from time to time, but it's miffed. And giving time (inaudible 16:48) changes and sometimes he'll say (inaudible 16:53). But, I don't know, that sort of makes it sound too-just superficial. It makes it sound like if he won't let me go outside and play I get mad at him and I don't like him. You know, it's a difference in (inaudible 17:19).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now is it more-it's more like sometimes in some ways that he may really get to you and other times those same ways may not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible 17:32).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes they-like they're always there and kind of put you off and sometimes that the only thing (inaudible 17:43) really put off by him. And then other times you have other feelings toward him that add up to the ones that you (inaudible 17:48) put off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, is it like having those kind of changing feelings you don't know-you can't pretend on how you're going to be reacting him? What's (inaudible 18:06)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tend to feel that-that either you like someone or you don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And until now, just right now-the last thing you said-I was never really aware that maybe your feelings toward a person could just sort of pop around like back and forth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it would be okay if they did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might be. But then there's the problem of, I think, people are expected to have special feelings for their parents. I might then feel bad if I don't have these feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People expected by (inaudible 19:08)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pardon?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By whom?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People are expected to have special feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just everybody. Like it's.... Well it's just a normal thing, you know, children to be attached to their parents and parents to be attached to their children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Attached you mean in a positive kind of way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just positive?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether it's just positive. I mean, children are supposed to love their parents and I just feel bad if there is a-as far as my father goes, I wish he's just sort of leave me alone and stay back (inaudible 20:24).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And don't write me any letters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And take his hands off of you and keep (inaudible 20:31).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Completely leave me alone and I'll stay here. Maybe every once in awhile exchange a few words. Pretty much just stay out of my life. I mean, that's what it boils down to and I feel very uneasy with that because that's not the way a son should be. A son is supposed to love his father. They might have disagreements which, you know, that's supposed to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. It's hard to keep on thinking you aren't supposed to just want him to disappear. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that a sense that you want-you should or that people would be shocked if they knew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People know it. They seem to know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about you in relation to that statement about him? [21:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a little bit guilty about it. You know, he's paid so much money to send me to school and he gave me a room of my own-I finally, you know, had a room of my own, toys and, you know, crap was given to me so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.. So in a way you say that you feel you ought to be more grateful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if he didn't give me anything, still that's my father, you know? I'm supposed to have (inaudible 21:59) from that that go beyond the toys and the bicycles, things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yet you keep on coming back to, in a way, he doesn't really matter to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he really doesn't matter?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, is that on the other side.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 22:30) It-it's (inaudible 22:45) he does matter to me, but I really want to be left alone and I don't want to be expected to help him with his problems and I don't want him to tell me what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. You don't want to go (inaudible 23:12). And you don't want to have to respond to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Um Hm. Even though when I'm visiting that-or like during the summer I might stay there and he makes demands on me which I don't know why-when I started to say that, it's the amount of (inaudible 23:45). I don't know, when I was a kid it used to bother me. I had to keep my room neat. I didn't want to do it. As I grew older I just (inaudible 24:10) it. (inaudible 24:15) excessively. He demanded that the house be kept exceptionally clean and, I don't know, it came down to whenever he tried to get me to do any work towards keeping it clean, I always told him how much I didn't want to because it was clean enough already.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, I just sort of decided he was being really unreasonable in demanding that I do these things. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that seem right to you? Does that seem okay to decide that? Or does that also not fit with your idea of how a son should feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't fit with my idea of how a son should feel, but I think that it's an acceptable response to the way he behaved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that his son doesn't feel the way he should about his father because of the way his father behaved. I don't know, there are a lot of times when I've really just thought that he was really stupid and hard-headed and others I have no problem with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm just afraid that some day I may be called out to take care of my father, being his son. I assume that I would arise into (inaudible 26:48) make a steady income and buy a house somewhere and he keeps getting very old and can't take care of himself or something like that. I may be expected-or he might expect me-to take him into my house or do something-take care of him and I may really not want to. And I'll feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see yourself really not wanting to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and if it-if it-if I had to make a decision like that, I would say to myself "I really don't want to" and then I would say to myself "You really ought to."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They took care of you, you should take care of them, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You owe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 27:51) to. But if I didn't, it would make me feel very bad because I'd say "You always were an ungrateful bastard."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All those feelings about how bad you were you had when you were in college are true. You are very bad-I mean, casting out your father like that and telling him to take care of himself when he can't. But...I don't know, that might be-sometimes this might be fanciful construction because it's-I don't know if my father will ever-I know things will be out of his control but-I just don't see him ever not being in any kind of -and feeling kind of-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 28:54) construction part might be this situation is never going to arise. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think-yeah-it's never going to arise, but I feel ticked about it so I can worry about it later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That situation-is that a situation where you don't see any good alternative for yourself. Like your (inaudible 29:18), you don't really want to have him in your house. You don't want to have anything to do with him. Go away. That you couldn't-can't do that-or couldn't do that ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then where would he be, so (inaudible 29:35).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 29:37) maybe feel responsible no matter what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Like being a really unpleasant duty. Really unpleasant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. (inaudible 30:04)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also you mentioned that he would just push you out in a way. There wouldn't be room for you to do what you want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that-that's really true to me. I don't know. I don't think he's ever been very-I don't know-understanding of me and I can just sort of return, I guess, by not being understanding of him. I don't know (inaudible 31:25) incoherent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it not-is it uncoherent because it isn't-it doesn't mean anything particular to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Partially? What is the part?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I might have to (inaudible 31:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well that kind of thing I meant was more like (inaudible 32:02). It's like, okay, there's nothing to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I think that-I don't know if there's anything to talk about it, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what? You don't know if you can talk about it well?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if-see this could sort of be a failure of your-your talking about the problem concept or whatever it was (inaudible 32:33). You sort of said awhile ago your problems are caused by your feelings with your father. I'm not there teaching him about (inaudible 32:43) about my feelings towards my father and I'm finding it very hard to discuss it conceptually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you kind of don't-you have-is that like saying you do have notions about it but you just can't put them into words and lay them out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're not set notions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. But you feel like-almost-more like well as you talk you feel like you're missing something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or just saying something that's really not just something you want to get to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then again, I don't know what the essential thing is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of a problem because it's more of just feeling like you keep on going past it and never thinking you're really grasping.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just keep on looking at...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's also to say that there is something important there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. (inaudible 33:52)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 33:52)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I can make a general statement that's accurate, but I can, like, tell you specific things that bother me. Like when my father tells me to do something I can really question his judgment because of things he's done. Like how can I believe him when he tells me to do something, like keeping your house cleaner than I thought it needed to be?</p>

<p> I guess he still does this. He used to spend-still does-practically all his free time out in the yard picking weeds and it's-well, my whole childhood I always treated that-he did that when we lived in Oklahoma for eight years, he's done it for eight years in Virginia. He spends all of this time working in the yard, most of it spent picking weeds out of the ground. And I used to, when I was a kid, look at that as a job-well, we're going to get all the weeds picked out of the yard and then you're going to stop. They're going to be all gone. But it never seemed to get done and he just kept doing it and doing it. And I'm just thinking that's a horrible waste of time. And then he's trying to get me to do it and I thought that was ridiculous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't get me-trying to rope me into that pointless task, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want any part of it because it's pointless. How could he tell me what to do with my time when he could go out and spend all his free time pulling weeds from the grass. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would say to him "You're wasting your life. Don't talk about what I should do with mine."?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps. Something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that also put a little stronger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just wonder, like, how good his vision is of my problems and my world or even his world if he can't see that if he thinks what he is doing is really worth his time...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And after he got through his weeds, I guess the weeds got all done, he used go around with a weed picker and-wherever there's a brow spot in the lawn, he said that means there's a rock underneath. So he'd go around digging up big rocks from underneath the grass which I thought was even sillier than him picking weeds. So he spent a lot of time doing that. Oh, and then...[38:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so you him doing that and what is it that you think? How did you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I probably just thought that it was dumb or something. We lived in Oklahoma when he did the weeds. He'd just put on a pair of shorts and no shirt. None of the men in Oklahoma-I mean, at this time I was a lot younger-but no one-no man wore shorts-just little boys and girls and women wore shorts. Men always wore long pants. But my father would go out there and pick his weeds wearing a pair of shorts with no t-shirt and he was barefoot pulling weeds.(chuckles) He really stood out in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. (inaudible 38:56) but you didn't like that it felt very embarrassing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It embarrassed me when I was younger. Once I grew older, I thought that was kind of nice because he picked up a lot of sun and had a good tan. Even now I sort of think that when he gets really involved-terribly involved with picking weeds or picking rocks-his whole body gets that attention. And in a way, this has, I think, kept him going. It keeps him in physical condition. Like I think he's in pretty good condition for a man his age. You know, so, in a way, what is kind of screwed up and not in a valued way or a mental way, something like that, has at least kept him kind of vital. [40:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I mean, he's an active person. He doesn't just sit in a chair in front of the T.V. or with the newspapers and stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, he does that in the evening after it's too dark to pull weeds or anything, he just comes in and plops down in front of the T.V. (inaudible 40:20) until he goes to bed and I think that's silly. I really do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, because, you're also saying though-there are some ways in which you say kind of "Look at what he does" and say okay, well you can tolerate it and, in fact, it's kind of a-it has good things about it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just don't impose it on me. Just don't impose what you want on me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if you want to do it, that's fine. That's sort of a-that's a later development. At first, I thought everything he did was really stupid (inaudible 40:57). But later on, I decided if that's what he's into to, it's all right with me if it keeps him going. Don't make me that way, please.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Yeah, and really being kind of afraid that he's going to make you that way. Or he's going to try to make you that way, make you into the kind of person he is. (inaudible 41:20)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, trying to get me to do what he does. I don't know if he's trying to make me into his kind of person or (inaudible 41:25). Just trying to get me to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One thing that does bother me now, though, is he is becoming more and more concerned with neatness. And (inaudible 41:39)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're starting to worry whether or not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, I've picked it up from him when I was younger. I think I may be one of those people and I seem to get neater and neater as time goes on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what worries you about (inaudible 42:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm being irrational to expect everybody to be so neat because I-if I go in the kitchen and see something dirty-an ashtray or something like that-I'll say to myself, well, you're being irrational. You're being anal like your father and then I'll stop and I'll say, no I'm not. It's dirty. It's in the kitchen. I cook my food in there-it's very reasonable to want it to be very clean, like almost-so right there I start to tell myself that I'm not being irrational in much the same way that my father is absolutely convinced that his cleanliness is perfectly rational. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're worried whether you're just trying to convince yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not trying-whether I am doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether I am convinced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whether you are convinced and the assumption is that you shouldn't be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like having an argument with yourself is that whether you should-whether these are unfair demands or not you're making on the people, the environment, whatever it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, not really. It's just sort of, you know, when I immediately accept that it's not an unreasonable demand, I put myself in the position of my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kind of digging in your heels on that one thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I say that I don't think they're unreasonable, evidently the other people do. But, I don't know, it feels like I'm sure I'm right and I want it cleaner. I see myself coming from the image of my father that I always disliked and I can sort of see myself following in his footsteps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sure...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All the time I was a little kid, I thought my father was too harsh on me-like, I think he spanked me more than I needed to be spanked and was too strict on me and I said I was never going to be that way with my kids. I always promised myself I'm never going to be like my father and now I see myself becoming like my father against my will. It-it-I'm afraid of the future, that I may become more and more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's just encroaching on you-you're starting to live out those patterns whether you want to or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are you feeling like, in a way, they're taking you over. (inaudible 45:08)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say against your will, do you mean like when there's an argument-when you have an argument with yourself about whether the kitchen should be as clean as you want it, that the one side always wins? That you can't put up a fight against that-that you get convinced that it should be as clean as it is-as you want it to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm convinced. Especially in the kitchen-I'm feeling the strongest-I'm convinced more strongly-as I say, you know, if I make my food there... I'm concerned a lot about my health and everything. I think, you know, where you fix your food has a lot to do with it-(inaudible 46:05) your health.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if it's good for you, it's good for germs, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it's good for you-the food, that it's good for germs. You know, if you don't keep the place clean, it's probably picking up a lot of germs and crap like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that to say the, in the realm of the kitchen, you don't really feel like anything's happening against your will-(inaudible 46:41) not changing against your will or do you see something that you're experiencing in that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's sort of against my will-it's a just a little bit too automatic of a.-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit too automatic? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think what's going on is okay, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. The conclusion you've drawn, you don't mind having drawn. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think it's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that I felt I didn't come to that conclusion through experience, it sort of came automatically from within me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's part of me. [47:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. All of a sudden it just snapped up. All of a sudden that's how you felt. All of a sudden that's what should be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. Without having had any real experience, you know, like if I'd been living with a dirty kitchen and all of a sudden everyone in the apartment came out with some disease and it was due to eating off dirty dishes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something like that. Then I would, I suppose, have good reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You call that-you call it good reason when it's not an immediate causal chain or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if you've learned from the experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a very direct-I mean for a very direct...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You pretty much have to be very direct so you know all the (inaudible 48:39). Yeah, so it would have to be direct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas with me, I've never had any-as yet, I haven't, to my knowledge, had any ill effects from eating out of dirty dishes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you think what the hell is this starting to bothering me-to bother me for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't know. I think why it's bothering me is I come from clean people. It's just automatic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just a person who gets bothered by a dirty kitchen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. Yeah. Or dirt and that seems true (inaudible 49:33).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like-that's just saying also it's not a matter of whatever reasons you give. The reasons are very much after the fact as far as you can tell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're almost made-up reasons. What you have to begin with is kind of the reaction. I wan this kitchen really clean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. It bothers-they're not really made up reactions to it. The whole apartment is dirty, but what bothers me most is the kitchen and I just don't spend much time in the other rooms, except my room-which I keep clean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can sort of get around it everywhere else. Just in the kitchen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe you're saying in the kitchen it's not exactly irrational after all. The kitchen is the place where dirt is imposed on me. I can't always do anything about that-I can clean it up after someone has done it, but you can't keep it the way you want it and have a feeling of where you want to set the terms of the cleanness of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That's all true. I don't know how this fits in but, although I want it clean, I just accept it the way it is. I don't make it any more dirty but I don't make a big fuss at my roommates who don't clean up. That's sort of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's sort of a contradiction. [51:26]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Um Hm. That's how I deal with my entire relationship with them-or anybody. You just don't say anything as long as you can. If you-as soon as something bothers you, you don't start bitching about it. You just try to get used to their ways, roll with it, which is actually pretty (inaudible 52:00) to keep-to never speak up and (inaudible 52:07) what you think and just sort of do your thing around it and accept it grudgingly and you (inaudible 52:16).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shooting to them or to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's shooting for me. Maybe to them (inaudible 52:38) but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. How is the idea of not doing that directly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid. I'm afraid to. I'm afraid for them to think I'm unreasonable, wanting to be unreasonably clean. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If they thought that, then how would you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, afraid they'd think I'm stupid they way I think my father's stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if they don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would just be afraid of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like they kind of shrug it off like oh, him, he must be (inaudible 53:22)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. I'm afraid of alienating them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alienating them from you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not very close anyhow, so I'm afraid once we get rid of that, I'd feel very alienated from them due to the fact they seem to pay no attention at all to what I seem to like. I think they are aware that I like the place clean and it doesn't seem to bother them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of feel like they never even-they don't bother-probably to notice what you and certainly not to do anything about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't go out of their way to (inaudible 54:14).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Sometimes I don't feel like talking about the kitchen and how they might (inaudible 54:45)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm starting to feel very resentful to my roommates at this point</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I want to go back there and give them all sorts of hell. I mean, I really want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. And now just wanting to go and do that, or being worried that you (inaudible 55:16).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to go do that and I want to tell them off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm starting to feel really angry and then... There was something else in my mind that's just sort of gone. Oh, I was thinking how strange talking about the concept of my problem, my feelings about my father. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like the end result of that discussion is me wanting to go give my roommates hell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, wait. What is it that you find funny about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm just-I didn't straighten out any of my understanding about my father so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't change anything real. But I feel serious action on something-you're talking about your father. Why all of a sudden you're going to-your father's over here. He's with your parents and your family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't think there was a link. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Your roommates are over here and they are entirely different worlds, sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's how you think of it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You just don't mix your roommates and your parents. And I would think that this could fit-a lot of our problems with both relate to the way I feel about my father. Just like this problem I have with my roommates.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really not separate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It relates to the problems I have with my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the only thing funny to me. The two are related. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a surprise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They must be because there's this sort of move from one to the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you never.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never would have acknowledged that they were really related. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it kind of interesting to know that? Or disconcerting or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's interesting (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like finding something out. That kind of fun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 57:58)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel uncomfortable now because I'm really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really edging to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, but I'm understanding that I really want to go give my roommates hell, I mean. I'm feeling very bitter about them right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's such a strong kind of reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's another thing that's funny, too. I've got to think on that, learn. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That steered me toward taking on (inaudible 58:41). A strong action.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I probably won't and I'll just be (inaudible 58:46) and feel more pent-up. That's what's probably going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that because you don't like this reaction that you're having?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially because I don't like it, partially because I'm afraid of it. I don't know how to control it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 59:02) this anger has gotten so big.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much. Even a little anger, see, I don't know exactly how to control it and how to stop it and when to stop it. You know, or like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like you have to manage it and you don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'll probably just keep it all under, under the lid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like it because I'm going to resent it more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Resent it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 59:41)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, like do you see any way out of it? You say, well I feel this and then. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really want to move.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, you really want to move but with this thing with your roommates now, it's like you've got to say "I really want to get angry with them. I really want to do it. Well, I don't know what's going to happen." Is there any way you can imagine that that link could get broken?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I could do like I did a couple weeks ago and start jumping up and down and making faces and screaming as loud as I was screaming. But that was just kind of fun playing kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That wasn't really anger out of a reaction to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That wouldn't be appropriate now because I'm feeling a little big more serious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. You care about this more. Not care-but it's a different way of relating to the issue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just in light of the past experience, it's a little different this time around. That time it was more like a specific instance of their abusing my wishes or my rights. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now it's sort of a general thing-all these times they've done it. And I want to go let them have it for all of (inaudible 61:05).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how I go about doing it and keeping it under control so I'll probably just push it away, file it away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you don't know how, what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how to start it. I'm not going to run in there and start screaming at the top of my lungs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you can't see any other way of bringing up the thing than just to burst into the middle of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 61:48) it's the only way I bring up things when I'm like this. Discussion (inaudible 61:58). The only way to start talking about something is to launch right in. And even then if they don't want to talk about it, at every point in the conversation, they'll keep pulling off other things and start talking about some past experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does it seem to you, then, that they completely set the terms? Or if you don't want them to, you have to just take enormous steps?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jump in the middle and keep on pulling the conversations out? And taking those enormous steps is something you don't want to do? That you aren't willing to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just-I can't control taking them that big-you don't have much control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Control over what aspect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what you say. You just want to shout and scream and cuss them and make accusations and call them names and stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to do that because that places the entire future in jeopardy. As long as I have to live with them (inaudible 63:21) because I can't (inaudible 63:21). I'd like to remain pleasant or I'd like to at least have a possibility of being pleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interpersonally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I go and call them a bunch of names and they just sort of might (inaudible 63:42).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They might resent that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Call them names and they might decide that I'm a childish (inaudible 63:50) man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't see how it's-I'm just not that sure what to do and I probably won't do anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're kind of disappointed in your choice to back down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could have done something to make me feel more wronged.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I suffered more, it's going to make me even more angry the next time. I guess those feelings (inaudible 64:35)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I particularly can't cope with it because there are two of them and one of me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, one roommate and his girlfriend. (inaudible 54:57).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just outnumbererd, just all outnumbered. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would it be easier if there was just one of them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In regard to what (inaudible 65:14) issue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Words. One of them can argue with you and the other one can sit over on the side and point out the inconsistencies in your argument. [65:31 </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. There we go. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don’t remember if I mentioned this last week, but I failed my state inspection for my car. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no. I didn’t know that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a pain in the butt, because they are making me – I don’t know if I’m going to go back to the same place, because they talked about oh, the tints are too dark in the back, which is not something I got last year. And the car came like that from Alabama, but whatever. Maybe the standards in Alabama are different than here. And they’re like, and the two front tires need replacing. Well actually, all of them need replacing, but the two front ones really need it. And because they need it and because your light and your wiper blades need it that we’re going to have to put down the - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did tell me this. Yeah. Yeah. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So now I’m just a little bit stressed because tires – Well, I found a cheap deal like alignment and two tires. Like, okay I can afford it, but I’ll have to wait until my next paycheck. [00:01:03] I’m just sick of living this tight. You know? Like, also I have to pay for the malpractice insurance. I’ve been putting that off, because if I want to do any kind of independent work, I need to do that. Just like, everything costs money. And I’m so tight, and I hate it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get your – You’re insured is through GWU (ph). Is that how it works?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But everyone keeps telling me it’s good to have extra. And then if I want to do anything else, you know, like private patients I’m obviously going to need it. So it’s just a pain. And that – I’m driving over here and I’m thinking I feel bad that I’m behind on my payment. Like, that’s always – I think it’s always on the back of my mind here. And like, it’s coming to the end of the year at my work. Well, we do a lot of terminations. Like, it’s just a whole different system. [00:02:03] You know, it’s short-term. Get in, get out. And I feel like I’m – I know that this is a different setting and we could do long-term work. But sometimes I start questioning like, well where can I cut corners? What can I do? Do I really need therapy? </p>

<p>I guess I don’t really need therapy, but I feel like I’ve grown so much just as a person and people even tell me this. Like, Brian tells me. My friends tell me. I get positive feedback from supervisors just about my own self-awareness. And I feel like part of that has been because of the work I’ve done in here. And I feel like I’d be able to survive, but it keeps me sane. It just – and there’s been really bad times that, thank God I have this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you’re sort of like, maybe one - the idea about cutting back might come from a lot of places, but I wonder if it comes in one respect from some feeling that comes up around not being behind or not paying in full or something like that.[00:03:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Again, it’s that feeling of like, well I’m sure he has a lot of other clients who have no problem paying on time. And it’s like, oh, here comes Melanie (sp) again who’s really behind. I think it’s just on my mind, because I’m going to have a lunch meeting with a friend tomorrow, a colleague. And I’m going to ask her about private practice since she just started having a few people. And I’m going to ask questions like, well, what you do if someone can’t pay. And then I start thinking about myself. You know? And obviously, you have a different situation, because I think you do this mostly. Like, you probably do the supervision, too. But like, you don’t do what I would do, like I’m your only patient.[00:04:08] That’s not the case. That’s very different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I’m exclusively in private practice or anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So it’s I guess one patient out of the bunch wouldn’t be so much of a burden. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel bad. I feel bad that I can’t – that every time I give you a check it’s a measly $50 check. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you notice? What’s the bad feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t notice anything from you. It’s all coming from me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No. Yeah. What are you see in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like a burden. ‘Cause it’s not like you’re my friend or you like hearing me talk necessarily, you know. It’s like this is your job. So if I’m not giving you something in return, I wonder if sometimes it might feel like a burden. [00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Well, you know, I guess one thing that I’m thinking about is think one thing I feel is that you don’t feel right now, with me at least that you’re doing the thing that you do with so many other people in your life. You know, like you’re the one making sure that you’re on top of things, responsible in that way. And when you’re not, some sort of something else enters in. This other side, you know, almost like it’s the way in which some way you can start to feel a little bit of something in some way that you’re not doing what I’m expecting or something like that. And that’s how you – [00:06:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. You’re so right. ‘Cause I’m just thinking about work. And I am a step ahead of my boss. Today he came in and he’s like, oh Melanie I was just wondering – ‘cause one of my clients got hospitalized over the weekend. I had already called the hospital. I had already talked to the person that did the hospitalization this weekend. So when he came into my office, I already knew what to tell him. And before I left, a social worker called me and said, oh by the way, they found a bed in this hospital. That’s where he is. Quickly sent an e-mail. Boss, just an update. You know I’m on top of it. And you’re right. And I’m on top of everything else. But, you know, I’m not behind on my bills except for this. And I get so much from this and it just feels like you’re giving me a break and it doesn’t feel fair in a way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, is there anything that doesn’t feel fair about it? [00:07:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, nobody else will work with you like this. Look at my situation with Sallie Mae. You know, if I don’t have $700 in my account on the 30th when they take it out –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they did work with you, though. I mean, what’s funny is they did. Yeah. At the end there’s something that feels different about it. </p>

<p>CLEINT: Yeah. I mean, they worked with me but they were so cold and rigid. And it’s a different experience with you and that feels different. That it doesn’t feel that awkward when you have to talk about payment. That’s a new experience. (pause) I’m not complaining. It just feels new. [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You’re wondering, too how you would do it with your patients. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I’m starting to think about that, too. But I don’t know. Maybe there’s a fear also that one day you’re going to tell me that, I think you’re good. You know, I had a client today just at 3:00 and we found our piece of work and there was nothing left to talk about. And she was like, well do you think I need to continue. And I was like, of course. Everyone could benefit, but as far as our piece of work goes, you’ve reached your goal. You’re good to go. But it’s a different system. We do short-term work and that’s it. You’re done. This just happened on the way here driving over here. And I was like, am I done? Am I taking too much, or is this how it works? I mean, of course this is how it works. I have friends who have been in therapy for years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, but tell me more about the feeling of what’s being done to you? What do you notice? I mean, in other words maybe you’re sort of saying it’s not necessarily just kind of like something that you start to think, because of the kind of the – maybe the anxiety about having a balance or something. You’re sort of saying this is a way to justify, hey, I don’t need it. I can cut back now. But you’re saying maybe it’s something more to that? [00:09:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I think it is? And this is just a theory, but I’m putting it out there. I think I needed you the most I’ve ever needed you a month ago when I called you. And I’m feeling guilt or something about okay, now I’m doing better. Look, I’m calm. I’ve taken too much. I’ve put him out. Maybe it has something to do with that. That just came to me. ‘Cause that was only a month ago. Like, I did feel like, wow. Thank God I have a therapist. I really needed him. He was there for me. That helped. That got me through that difficult time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It’s interesting though that it’s not just that, you know, you could see it in two ways. You could see it yeah, as a response to some of the anxiety you might feel about having gone there with me, you know. And that maybe in some way it shuts that down. Okay. I’m okay. I’m okay, don’t worry. But in a way it’s interesting too, to think about it in terms of something that you did do when you called me. Something that was a piece of work that we were working on together. And as much as you felt like okay, hey, I’m going to show you something of what I’m really struggling with. I’m going to let you know. I’m not going to – you know, you calling me when I was on vacation, right? And feeling okay, well I need to do that. It’s not that it can’t wait. I need to be able to – I’m not going to just be the good patient. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) If I’m doing that it’s unconscious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, not to say that that was like a motivation as much as maybe that’s all the meaning it’s held for you. And well, I don’t know, I mean that’s the way I kind of think about it. In one way I’m thinking about how it is like, that was – there’s something noteworthy about you, you know, being comfortable enough to get uncomfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for a few days. Remember, James and my friend Carly kept telling me you should call, you should call. And I held off for a few days. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But you wonder if that’s something to do with it. This whole – that whole – yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a really, really good weekend. I spent some time with friends on Friday and I had my first beer with my burger, and it went well and I felt fine about it. And we went to a bar afterwards. And my friend Patrice doesn’t even drink, because she’s on all these medications and she just had vocal cord surgery. So she just doesn’t drink alcohol. So it feels normal to be in there with water, so I didn’t even think twice about it and just had water and hung out with them and laughed a lot, and made a lot of plans for the summer which got me just excited about life and feeling connected to people. Like, we already planned a little day trip. My friend Emma, who’s a lawyer, she has a condo with a pool, so we were like, we’re hitting that spot this summer. </p>

<p>And on Saturday I went for a little jog and I ran into – I don’t know if you know Tracy Hopper (sp). So we’ve been talking, just consulting about a client, and next thing you know we kind of – she came in once for training about how to do private practice. And then, when we consulted over the phone we kind of hit it off more socially. And she’s like, we should just go get coffee. Yeah, we should go get a coffee. And then suddenly we ran into each other and she was with her baby and her dog. And it was so nice. We walked for a good 20 minutes together and ended up finding out that we’re neighbors and we’re going to go on a coffee date. </p>

<p>So it’s just like, I love all these connections I’m making with people up here. I think about how my life used to be in Alabama, and yeah, I had some friends, but I don’t know. The relationships I’ve made up here feel a lot deeper and meaningful. I don’t know if it’s just that I’m in a different place in my life or what. So that was nice, and I was in a good mood all weekend. Brian’s been good. I feel it’s like we’re more connected than ever. It’s been really sweet and nice. I found out something that again, should have upset me, but I think I’m still kind of processing it, but at the same time compartmentalizing it and putting it on another side of my head. So remember how I wrote this girl on Facebook. I created a fake account. She wrote back. [00:14:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She did, yeah. Last time, last week she hadn’t yet. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It took her a while. And she wrote back and she said I’m so sorry. It seems like since you’re not my friend on Facebook it went to a different mailbox. Oh, but yes, I do remember that guy and this was almost exactly a year ago that this happened and I have not been in touch with him. And I started doing the math in my head and I’m like, okay. She responded on Monday, I think. So I was thinking okay, Monday last year what was going on. I know that my little sister, Sasha visited us in April or May. He took us out to dinner. I’m like, were we fighting back then? Was I dating someone else? I wasn’t. And the first thought is like, what a bastard. Like, we were getting along. I don’t think at that point I had started dating anyone else. So he was already sleeping with someone else. But then I started thinking back. When was that drunken incident when I was sitting on his doorstep? [00:16:01] And he mentioned once that it was in October. And I’m trying to think back. Was it this October or was it last October? Do you remember?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, my own – when I was thinking about it I thought it was sometime summer of ‘13. But I don’t remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was I in post doc?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. I thought it was the summer, though. Anyway. I mean the summer of last year, so I think it was like within – yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was trying to make sense of it in my head. Like, could that drunken incident have happened and then he cheated and that’s why he cheated? But I didn’t dig too deep trying to find out when did this happen, when did I mess up. I was trying to find blame for myself, you know. Did I do something to cause this? But that didn’t last too long. And then what she said was a little disturbing, but I think I’m disturbed that I’m not that disturbed about it.[00:17:09] So she had nothing but really negative things to say about him. She said, I agreed to play with him once and he was a real asshole. He shamed me for using my safe word. He’s not involved in the kink community, because no one would ever put up with his garbage. No one would, because someone would call him out on the way he pushes boundaries. And she said he’s not a dom, I guess that’s what they call when you’re like the, like in S&M when you’re the one –the sadistic one or whatever. And she said he’s a misogynist and he said that he likes to get little young college girls and do these things to them and get them to like him and want to continue to be with him and then just blow them off. Did you have a negative experience like I did with him? Please let me know if you want to talk. And like, right away I felt oh, my God. Did she have a really terrible experience like she felt violated? I work with girls who go through this stuff. [00:18:40] And I wrote her back saying, I’m so sorry. It sounds like you had a really negative experience. I’m sorry that you got hurt like that. No, I’m fine. Nothing like that has happened. Where did you guys meet? Was this in a hotel room? Was it just once? And she said yeah, we met online. It was just once in a hotel room. And the last time I spoke to him I told him what a shitty person he is. </p>

<p>And then, I don’t know whether I’m trying to justify this or what, but if I were to say this to Brian, I know that he would say that’s total bullshit. First of all, the thing he told me about this girl was that she claimed to be in the kink community and that she was a total – I don’t even – I’m blanking out on the terms and I don’t know if this is telling that I’m blanking out - Submissive.[00:19:36] He said she was so full of it. She thought I was gentle with her, much gentler than I am with you. And she was totally over it. She didn’t want to do it and we only hooked up once. So he was telling the truth about that. And I know that he made her write the letter, the thing she wrote before and then after. And after, when I read the note again it said like, even though I screamed and I protested I loved every minute of it, because I’m a fucking whore. And I know that if I confronted him about it, he would be like, Melanie, she was coming her brains out. Like, there’s no way she didn’t enjoy that, even if afterwards – He used to tell me that like, a lot of girls sometimes would kind of stop calling him or stop hooking up after two or three episodes of encounters, because he said it would be too much for them.[00:20:38] Like, either they were really good girls who suddenly started talking dirty and confessing their fantasies and doing all these dirty things, and then felt so much shame that they never wanted to talk to him again, or, it was too much for them. And having been with him, I’d get that. Like, that’s totally possible. But I don’t know why on this one I feel like my reaction should be wow, what a bastard. He practically raped this girl or something and I shouldn’t have anything to do with him. But that’s not my reaction at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you noticed? What has it been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I forgive him. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: When you say forgive him, what do you forgive him for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For cheating. And if it was anything really serious, this girl would have pressed charges. She would have made a big deal about it. [00:21:51] But that didn’t happen. I also tried to inquire – I was acting all naïve, ‘cause I’m acting like this young girl on Facebook. And I said, oh, I don’t know whether I should trust him. He’s always really vague about his life and he’s always busy. Do you think he’s married or do you think he’s dating someone else? And she’s like, I have no idea that he’s married or if he’s dating someone else, but I wouldn’t doubt it. So that was another confirmation of oh, he doesn’t tell everyone he sleeps with that he’s married and about his life. That’s all she knew about him. He was an emergency room nurse from Connectict. [00:22:27] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did that mean to you that he didn’t tell her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I’m different. Because I think that that’s always on my mind. And like, have there been others like me? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Is that right? You mean, that it had gone on before? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That far. And he claims, he just told me – I think I told you this recently, that in April, I think it was a year and a half and he was like, besides my marriage, this is the longest relationship I’ve had. And I know he’s slept with a lot of women and I know that he cheated on his wife a lot. And I really want to know that I’m different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I see it. I see it. That does seem like an important aspect to it. Some of the appeal of it is that in addition to the kind of experiences themselves you go into with him, and the opportunity – the continued opportunity to do it, it’s something about him sticking with you. Is it that he - that you’re one of the few people that he would do that with or you’re the only one he would do that with? You know, what is the (inaudible at 00:23:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like kind of telling me a side of himself that he doesn’t share with other people. And after finding this out, I didn’t confront him with it, ‘cause I didn’t think it would be a productive conversation and I feel like I had already decided how I’m going to feel about it. And I tried to inquire about other relationships. I said something like none of the people you’ve just randomly slept with, you’re not Facebook friends with them, right? You don’t still have their phone numbers, right? I’m different that way. And what did he say? He said, you don’t realize how much of myself I share with you that I don’t share with other people. I mean, I hope that’s true. I’m still bothered, though. How am I not upset that he cheated on me a year ago? I think I keep holding onto the hope that now everything’s all out in the open. We’re being really honest with each other and things will be different now. [00:24:56] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I think maybe there’s an element of it that is kind of like, well, as you say compartmentalized or something, maybe. But I also hear that there’s something that was preserved was your sense of being special. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, it didn’t threaten that part of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you would have felt different if it would have been that he had been carrying on things like this a while and he had several people. There’s something to you about the fact that he feels very – that you’re in this kind of other category that’s really important to you about it all from what I’m gathering. [00:25:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s so unhealthy, though. This is – we’re talking about a married man here. Let’s not forget that point. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who’s forgetting that? (inaudible at 00:26:01) you are. What made you say it’s unhealthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that’s all true and that makes sense, but I feel like none of it is valid or important, because it’s not even a real relationship. I’m frickin’ having an affair with a married man. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’s not real about it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That if I’m special or if I’m not special, that it’s important to me. I feel like the rational side of me is coming out and pointing a finger and saying, wake up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you know, I actually think that – I mean, I can see the point in terms of hey, yeah, are you neglecting a side of the “reality” of it? But, you know, in another way you’re trying to really – I mean, just when I was talking for instance, about the specialness of it is a reality. I mean, it’s a reality. You feel that. [00:27:07] it’s as real as anything else. And I think – I mean, maybe I’m wrong, but do you end up feeling like you – How much do you block it out that he’s married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t sense that you do. I don’t sense that you do. I don’t sense that – I instead think that there’s some meaning of all this to you that’s, you know, that’s a complex one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s just so frustrating, too. When was it, last Monday when I wasn’t expecting to cry in here and I cried, and then I went to dinner with my friends. They told me oh, you look so serious. And it was because I was still thinking, Melanie, why are you drawn to the dysfunction? You know, same thing I’m thinking right now in this moment. Is that the best you can do? Why do you have to fall in love with a married man? Why can’t you just be normal? [00:28:13] (pause) I feel like I had normal and I screwed it up. But I didn’t even really want it. I was kind of like, eh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know, among other things there’s something about it didn’t quite capture, I don’t think – Come to think of it I don’t think you felt like that kind of special kind of way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was even questioning it James. Remember how I told you I once looked through his dissertation. [00:28:47] It said to very best friend and love, his ex-girlfriend. And then I was like, is every girlfriend your best friend? Like, he’s just this guy that always wants to be in love and wants to be married so much. It’s almost like it could be interchangeable, like whoever he ends up with. And so I didn’t like that part. I felt like I’m just the next one that he falls in love with. (pause). </p>

<p>Brian has been talking to me a lot about his family lately. I remember one day, and this was more than a month ago already. I remember I jokingly said to him, I haven’t heard from you in a long time. What are you doing, visiting Kensington? Because he used to joke that he had a lot girls in Kensington. And I get back a picture of him on the couch with like, his son on his lap, watching cartoons. And in the distant background a chair, like a loveseat over there, I see her foot. Like, she’s sitting in the chair over there and here he is with his son on his lap, watching cartoons. Like, I got an inside view of what his life is like. It’s just so strange to me that he has me and he has this life, and then on Saturday morning, this Saturday, he called me and I was like, what are you doing.[00:30:11] Oh, I’m on my way to Logan’s swimming lesson. They’re in the car behind me following me. So like, the son and wife are in the car behind him, he’s on his way to a swimming lesson. I’ll call you afterwards and tell you about it. </p>

<p>I don’t even know why they’re still together. I think I have a big fear that he’s not telling me what’s really going on, and maybe it is more like a marriage than what he says. So (inaudible at 00:30:44) you think about it like, he hasn’t really lied. Like, everything he told me – like he said I think it was over a year ago with this girl, and it was and it was once, and it was. And you’re different and I don’t tell other people about my life and you’re the longest one I’ve had. We were – he came over – I don’t remember, just the other day and we ordered food and we sat at my little kitchen table across from each other and like, my kitchen’s tiny, and the table’s tiny, so it’s like, very intimate. And he started talking about – I don’t know how we got on the topic, of his dad abusing him and how he feels like he’s dealt with that over the years. And how it’s very hurtful that, you know, that innocence that he saw in himself he sees in his son now, and how that can be just ripped away.[00:31:43] And how he kind of mourns who he could have been if that hadn’t happened. Like, it was a really intimate, deep conversation. And then later on that night when we were saying goodnight he said something like you know, we do all these things like, in bed and we have this amazing sex life, and we really open to each other. But sitting at the kitchen table with you to day like, talking about that stuff, that seems a lot more intimate. You know, so that stuff makes me feel special. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you notice about what you felt when he told you that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like validated. Like, that’s what I feel. I feel like that’s really intimate and special. And like, wow, he agrees and he recognizes that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you too, felt special, him sharing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Still, reality is hard. This weekend I have a friend’s birthday. He’s probably not going to come. I mean, he hasn’t come to anything else. And everyone’s going to ask me, where is he? Have you met his son yet? And that’s when reality kind of hits me. Like, what are you doing? [00:32:57] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it about when they ask you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like they’re going to judge. You know, like either this guy’s hiding something or he doesn’t feel that serious about you if he hasn’t introduced you to his kid yet?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s almost – is it along the lines of you’re not that special?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If you were that special, of course he would. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see. Yeah. I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he has no answer any time I say – like, he’s well aware that I want to meet him. And he just stays quiet. Like, all he can say is, I know. I’m sorry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you want to meet his son?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) He’s very careful not to talk about future stuff. You know, like what’s going to happen after he finishes his program. [00:33:57] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, where does he go? What have you got in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I hope that – Well, we were fighting, like after the James thing he was telling me, you don’t know what I’ve been doing. You don’t know what I’ve been looking into. And I think he mentioned I’ve been looking into condos. And I told her – we’ve talked about how this isn’t going to work for me and this is not fixable. I wish I could hear an audio tape of that. So I just need to like – okay, you should keep holding on. There’s some hope here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah. When you don’t hear much in the way of that kind of talking to you, you start to – You wonder how real is special.[00:35:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember it really hurt me and I started crying recently when he mentioned a friend and he said oh, the friend got married recently. And then I asked, oh did you go to the wedding? He’s like, yeah we did. And then that’s when I thought, oh, on one of those Saturday nights when he tells me he’s working, he’s probably at a wedding. And then I think of him all dressed up and I think of her all dressed up. And I’m like, they went on a date together as a couple to a wedding. I mean that hurts, but of course, I mean, that’s his wife. (pause) And he told me all about Easter. Like, going to his uncles and the family members and all the drama going on. And sometimes I try to picture what will that look like? They took two cars so that she could stay longer with the son, with the family. So I’m getting the impression oh, she must be close to them. She must get along with them. Like, what is going to be the reaction when suddenly he’s like, surprised, I’m divorced and he’s my mistress? That’s why sometimes I feel that’s never going to happen. He’s not the type of person to rock the boat that much, you know? [00:36:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I keep thinking it’s kind of like the question for you is, all right, I feel special, but just how special? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How far does that go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. And I feel like I’m not allowed to ask, or that would be a lot to ask, especially since I messed up a month ago. Like, I feel I just have to keep working to earn it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you working on? What does it feel you’re working on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, so he’ll leave her and he’ll start a life with me. Either move in with me or introduce me to his son. [00:37:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would do it? What is it in you that would do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To earn that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would that look like to earn –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you need to do to earn that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to keep being exactly like how I’ve been acting for the past month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Healthy and stable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Healthy and stable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We were having a conversation last night on the phone through texts. Like, I was telling him what a good weekend I had and how calm I feel, and I’m in bed reading and I’m going to volunteer for this thing at work tomorrow and he’s like, I like this new, healthy Melanie. And I was like, I do, too. But then again, it’s that fear like I told you about last week of when am I going to mess up again. [00:38:10] Like just under control. That’s what that means. Like, I won’t suddenly – he jokes with me and actually would be offended that I’m not. Because it’s like a cartoon character of me. He makes me sound like I’m this like, loud Latin woman. He jokes and says you’re going to start banging your pots and pans, ‘cause that’s what people in Jamaica do. And you’re going to start getting angry about whatever. So once in a while I would get upset about like, what am I to you? Where is this heading? When am I going to meet your son? That’s under the category of not healthy. That I need to just remain calm and patient. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to the Jamaica – the fiery Latina woman. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The fiery Latin girlfriend. That’s what he’d try. Yeah. And I need to not get drunk and out-of-control. And I need to not be interested in other men and stay loyal. And just like, healthy stuff. Like, even though I can’t see him on weekends like, meet with friends on weekends and exercise and go to sleep at a decent hour. Like an adult. [00:39:29] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That gets you the good stuff. The special. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like behave. That behave. But in a way like, it doesn’t feel like I want that. Like, it actually feels containing in a way for me. Like, I want that and I want to make him proud and earn him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like I should be kicking and screaming like, who are you to tell me, you know, how to act. I can be however I want. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it seems like sometimes you do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I even get a little anxious anticipating, oh my God, when am I going to have had enough again and kind of blow up on him and be like, you know, what’s going to happen with us, or what’s the deal here? So far it’s very at bay. [00:40:33] It’s not brewing. Like, I keep hoping he’ll end his program and then I can ask again and we can make a decision. ‘Cause by October/November it’ll be two years and I can’t be with him for longer than that if this isn’t going in some direction. I’m not getting any younger. I want to have a life. I want to have a family. So I feel like, calm down, you know? Like, I have an image of him with a dog on a leash just petting. Calm. Stay calm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And don’t bite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don’t bite. Wait for your treat. (pause) But like I said, that doesn’t feel like – this doesn’t make me angry or sad or mad. [00:41:32] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It feels like a version of love. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean the way you describe it. That’s a fair – I mean, it’s kind of that (inaudible at 000:41:52) They way that the owners kind of take care of you for rewards. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the image is not like of a – Like normally you call someone a dog and it’s not a very good compliment, you know, but the image I have in my head is more like a pristine looking dog. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what? What kind of dog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I just picture like, Lady and the Tramp or something. Like, one of these cartoonish dogs with long, white straight hair that the fancy people would have. I used to have a dog in Chile, my first dog. My parents named him Anubis or something like that. He was an Afghan Hound. And I’ve heard that they don’t do well with children. And my mom was always scared that he would bite me. So I wasn’t too close to him. But I remember him kind of being a serious kind of elegant dog. You know, kind of like arrogant in a way. And he had long, straight hair like that. And the gardener poisoned him and he died. [00:43:09] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But for some reason – I mean, I don’t even like those kinds of dogs. But for some reason when I picture that image of him holding the collar and a leash, I picture a dog like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does the dog’s name mean? What’s that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anubis. I was like three. I barely remember anything about the dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your gardener poisoned him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I’m just – I always thought of myself as stronger than that, like a strong, independent woman who’s not going to let a man take care of her or control her or tell her what to do. But maybe I’m into that. ‘Cause a dog is submissive, you know. Loyal. Maybe I’m – that’s why it feels like such a fit. Like I’m so drawn to Brian, ‘cause it just – and it’s not like he’s dominating over me in a way that’s unhealthy or cruel or unfair. [00:34:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s a lot of different owner/dog relationships. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I never thought I would see myself as a dog. But it’s more like a pet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A pet, yeah. No, it’s a very – It’s a really important image that you say. It’s a lot of meaning. This dog that has this – how did you describe it? It’s got a certain amount of arrogance, and –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. With its nose up in the air.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nose up in the air.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like sitting just very straight and tall. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s really something. It reminds me in some way – just one association I have to it is it’s sort of like the image that your mom wants to portray in some way. Proud. Nose up in the air. [00:45:29] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But inside it’s just so broken. And I wonder with me is it broken inside, too. Or is it really through-and-through is it proud?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or does it feel like it needs a leash?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I need a leash. I mean, you know how in here I keep saying I’m scared. When am I going to mess up again. I think that’s why it feels containing to me. But like that’s so sad. Like, I thought I was stronger than that. Or maybe one day I will be. But at this point in my life, I feel like I need a leash. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What doesn’t feel about it? What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I should be able to have self-control. I’m not a fifteen year-old girl. [00:46:25] I’m not the binge-drinking college student anymore. You’re an adult. You’re a professional. You should be able to control yourself and not need someone to control you or put you on a leash. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know it’s funny though. I hear it slightly differently, and I don’t know if this is right or not, but I think – I hear it as you’re putting yourself – like, that’s the self-control. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. ‘Cause I’m willingly on the leash.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like in some way it has importance. It’s not that you like it in the sense that I like being –</p>

<p>CLIENT: In fact, this has been a joke since the beginning, ‘cause he calls me pet. And I keep joking with him like, one day I really want a collar. Like, I really want a collar. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I love that. I love that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that makes sense, that I’m like willingly putting it on. [00:47:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It’s not – you’re not being forced. Not at all. I mean, you know, if there is an example of it, boy is it really in what happened with James and you and Brian. You know, there’s almost like you went back to the collar. The leash.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think of that scene. It’s almost like a movie playing in my head. Like James telling me, you can’t do that. You can’t act like that, because I’m in love with you. It’s like he was trying to put the leash on me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like change this about yourself. You can’t be that anymore. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s a different leash or something, different leash than Brian’s?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it was a leash. There’s a leash. Not one you wanted though. [00:48:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s the difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s the difference. You didn’t want that leash.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT. Next week as normal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week as normal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That will be in May?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We will. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. </p>

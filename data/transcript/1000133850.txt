<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 6. Interview 6</p>

<p>CLIENT:IENT: Yeah it's kind of bad on Fridays' all over. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know why. Fridays should be good days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the end of the week. [He's had it] (ph) (chuckles) Nothing but (inaudible). Sorry I'm late. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I went home and I lied down, fell asleep for about ten minutes and that was it. So, I haven't seen....well, I saw you Wednesday. (inaudible) I got a haircut. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I noticed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he cut it too short, but at least I won't have to go back for another three months. (chuckles) The kids didn't like it though....at school, you know. Yeah they like the...they liked it longer better, you know. It's...it's, you know, the girls like the...they're always, you know, they touch your hair. The black children, you know. Different texture, you know, and they like to touch the hair. So I kind of disappointed. (inaudible) I was kind of disappointed with myself. Well, after I was downtown, you know, and...and then I, you know, I went into a bar and the bar is kind of gay....that, well, I guess that it's supposed to be, you know. But, you know, like nothing happened. I'm pissed I disappointed myself afterwards. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For going in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for going in. You know, just for going in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you kind of go in on some kind of (overlapping voices) 00:01:53</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, I thought well, you know, I need some release about now. But, you know, like, nothing happened but you know, I didn't meet anybody or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really kind of felt bad (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, afterwards, you know. Yeah going in...yeah, (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just for going in like...? Why? You felt a lot (inaudible) to walk past it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. (laughs) but I didn't resist the temptation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was there and I walked in. But....what else happened? That's about all. I didn't resist temptation. (chuckles) I don't know what else to talk about. Oh, I was thinking about, you know, psychiatry in general and I thought, you know, like, I couldn't even tell my parents that or you know, anybody in my family that (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I was seeing a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not a psychiatrist. I'm a psychologist. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, a psychologist (inaudible) whatever it is, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Psychiatrists are people with medical degrees.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Psychologists are, you know, psychology. Don't have a, you know, medical..... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) raised (ph) under therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not the point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The point.....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Under therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the point (inaudible) you just couldn't even tell them that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, like I, you know I could...it shouldn't really be anything I should be embarrassed about, you know, but I just thought...you know I don't know if they'd understand. You know, of course....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if they'd be as open minded about (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they'd hit me with all sorts of questions right point blank. Well, what's the story...why? You know, why? (chuckles) And I couldn't just say well, you know, I just felt I needed to go and they can....no, they would never accept that. You know, they'd have to...you know, they'd really....you know, and then they'd end up, I think, feeling guilty about the whole thing. You know, where did I go wrong? You know, why should my son have to go seek help, you know, and all this stuff and so I said, you know, I really.... I was tempted to tell my younger sister though. She was in...she just got out of psych. Well, she's getting out this weekend. Anyway and I was tempted to tell her, you know. Because she'd be...she'd be interested. And I don't think she'd really care, you know, that much if....you know, why I was going or anything else. She'd probably just want to know what's it like. That's the only thing she'd probably be interested in. but, yeah, I did think about that. They...no, Tanya...you know, I've told Tanya. Sara knows too. This is about the only two people that know, I think. Unless they've told somebody. I don't know (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's some people you can (inaudible) your family (inaudible) you feel like you're just really (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right. (00:04:59)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ask a whole lot of questions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does this really mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. But I feel like, you know, as if I'm keeping something from them, you know. And....(inaudible) guilt things about telling....oh, one time....oh, you know, like I was supposed to be over there, you know, and I had to come here and, you know, like trying to make up some lie where I was going to be. The reason why I couldn't come. Making up some lie about where I...where I was supposed to be and I'm not a good liar at all. I can't lie. I mean I can but, you know, it doesn't go across very often. Most times people don't believe me. So......I can't tell a lie very often. But.....it would be interesting to see their reaction just for the hell of it...I, you know....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you'd rather....it kind of is a curiosity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. That's the only way I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me...let me go back to this...this thing that (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you felt this....really kind of disappointing to someone, can you say more about it? Because I sense as you were telling me about it (inaudible) like you felt uncomfortable (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was, you know. I was....you know, like I was ashamed of myself and all that stuff. But then, well, it felt kind of good. I was happy that I wasn't approached or anything, you know, because then, you know, afterwards it was kind of like, well, nothing happened anyway so what. You know, I should really have nothing to be guilty about. You know, but then, to think back, you know, the intentions were there so, you know, I should have.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) similar to the way that the other thing.... (00:06:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. The intentions were there....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The intentions were there but it didn't get acted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, nothing, you know, really happened, so you know, like I should...I shouldn't feel guilty about it but....I should....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like (inaudible) feel guilty about your intentions. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just wish that you didn't have those intentions and act on them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's it. Right. So that's why, you know, I felt guilty in that sense. You know, but maybe...well, I don't know. Maybe I would have felt guiltier if the intention...I mean, you know, like if something did happen. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) probably would feel guilty but it's...kind of...because then you can feel guilty about (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. Oh, at any rate, yeah, I did feel, you know, guilty about the whole thing. And so..... But I would....I...it, you know, like...it like now, it's getting....it's...it's more difficult to get over my guilt since I'm seeing you, you know, and....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more difficult to, you know, forget about these things, you know. Because then, you know, and like...then I think, well...and I'm telling you all these things and I wouldn't/t not tell. I'd tell you. But then I feel....you know, I feel guilty because I'd have to tell you. As if I'm disappointing you. It's, you know.... That's...yeah, that's another reason why, you know, I feel guilty about it or more guilty or the guilt doesn't....doesn't... (00:08:16) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you have to own up to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. I'd have to own up to it. Right. And, you know, like that's why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow you feel like you'd be different. You could handle it inside yourself. It's kind of like some kind of conscience for yourself (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. But you know, like the guilty feelings, you know, they're...they don't go away as easily. You know, I couldn't block them out, you know, because coming here and everything. It just...you know, they're there, so...that's...that's you know, another thing. Which is good in a way, you know, at least I'm more aware of it. Yeah, well... I don't know, it's..... I...as far as guilty feelings are concerned, you know, I could...I....I've always had them, you know, and I really....there's no way I could block them out. They'd always be there, you know, no matter what. So.... That's it. (long silence from 09:26 to 09:40) It's funny how the conscience probes at one's mind, you know, about guilt and all that stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're really kind of a....feel very....you really have a strong sense of conscience about your...about homosexuality. Kind of just....even (inaudible) intention (inaudible) (00:10:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Really, really. It's weird. It's weird. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say it's weird...I guess it's more than just weird. Kind of really (inaudible) kind of a lot of...kind of psychological tearing (ph) inside yourself. (inaudible) causes your anguish and suffering. (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But even, you know, like sitting at this.....you know, like I wouldn't even be like I would...like I felt, like I wouldn't even say anything to anybody, you know. What I do is like, you know, that would be a...something to be guilty about, you know. Even saying anything to anyone, you know, as far as, you know, maybe them being homosexual or something....even saying anything. I just, you know, couldn't even do that. So......At any rate it was...the intentions were there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Intentions for (inaudible) really come through (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) pretty lonesome (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of wish you didn't have (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Really. But that's you know, I guess, you know, I thought the only way to...to you know, rid of these intentions...the only way that I can see ridding of these intentions is to pursue a heterosexual life, you know. That's the only way that I could possibly, you know, get rid of them. Well, that's...it may...that....of course, that may not work either but, you know, that's the only way I can see right now. So, that's what....you know, if I.... (00:12:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like...yeah, it's kind of like it's not he kind of thing where the way to get rid of your tensions is just to shut them off. It's kind of replace them with others. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it. Right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But yet you know, you can kind of say like you can really see yourself doing (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See because I don't understand. It's kind of like you can see yourself doing it but yet you get pulled back the other way. And I'm wondering kind of...isn't that going to make it...make it kind of.....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worse. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. That like then, you know, like it would just be prolonging.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Kind of maybe more the thing to do is kind of, you know, this is what I want to do, and do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right, it would be more or less, you know...it would be prolonging. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're causing yourself more anguish and you felt enough of it and it's kept you enough away from (inaudible) Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like....like let's say you had a (inaudible) like you think you would if (inaudible) most likely the person who (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. Probably, yeah. Yeah, I probably would. I thought about that too. That's, you know, like I've been...even that in itself.... And there's a thing that's, you know, built up the feeling of guilt, you know about the whole thing too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you know like the thing that I, you know, with Tanya, you know, like I should be with her, you know, and that's another thing. (00:13:54)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of you should be with her to keep from going out (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just probably feel more guilty and probably (inaudible) more with Tanya.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Really. That's the truth. That's the truth. But it's easier for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because it's something you know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) something you know (inaudible) it makes you feel lousy too. You know, relieved physically (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But guilty afterwards, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of knowing well, that I'm just thinking that you could really try and look I'm (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I understand, right. Why, you know, pursue the other. I mean why pursue that when I can pursue the other (inaudible) maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know (inaudible) it could certain (inaudible) even having good (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're probably making it harder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course it (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But everybody...I mean just like you take the easiest road, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know but it's...but it the easiest (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: The easiest road isn't the right road. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, well the point is if the easiest road were right for you, like if you felt like, you know, when you told me that there's homosexuals (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you know that would be fine. But that's not the way you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, no, it isn't. No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What...the right road for you is, you know, what you feel is right. It's kind of like it's a harder road, you know, have sex with (inaudible) but it sounds like the road, the other road makes you feel lousy but by god, for myself, I should just struggle...struggle with the hard (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: The hardest stuff, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good things don't come easy, as the saying goes. (00:15:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The truth. Right. Make me feel guilt (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm making you feel guilty? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no you're not. You're just bringing it out into the open, you know, where is should be. Really. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like, you know, it's kind of like you can pretend not to know anything about him just (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know, you have feelings about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it does affect the way you live your life. (inaudible) possibility, you know, to have sexual relationships. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Really. Well, I do have to admit that I've been trying to avoid it. I mean I....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) Homosexual?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Homosexual. Yeah, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of really been a struggle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you haven't quite done it. (inaudible) because you know (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The opportunity maybe wasn't there but....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it also may be because you haven't quite...quite done it and....I've lost what I was going to say but the problem maybe in, you know, because you don't kind of feel as well along on (inaudible) heterosexual as you might be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing there (inaudible) is kind of to work in that area. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's it. (long quiet from 00:17:29 to 00:18:05) it's funny how you can occupy your mind, you know, I...trying to forget about sex and just occupy your mind with so many other things but you never can stifle it at all, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that maybe you become more frustrated than anything else, you know. (long quiet to 00:18:55) I don't know what else...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fine. Fine. Fine. (long quiet to 00:19:37) Say you were taking a pity on myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) kind of feel the same. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) No time to feel sorry for oneself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you kind of feeling....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why me? You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling sorry that yourself.... kind of like why do I have this problem? (00:19:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know, right. Why me? You know, there are so many people in the world....well, at least they appear to be so normal and everything else, you know. Why should that (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know you're also in a position to do something about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, really. Stop feeling sorry for oneself and do something about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, if you really don't want to go to a bar (inaudible) homosexual issues, you're in a position as you said you really believe strongly (inaudible) doing pretty....pretty good. If you really want heterosexual relationships....that's harder (inaudible) just you have to try it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I.....(long quiet from 00:20:37 to 00:21:14) Too bad there wasn't just a pill somewhere I could take. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of seems like just such a whole lot of work and such a struggle you just wish you could (overlapping voices) a switch and (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Flip the switch and all the problems would be solved. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good things (inaudible) 00:21:33</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) (long quiet to end 00:22:56</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. (long quiet 00:23:00 to 00:2344) You know, like, where do we go from here. I'm the one that has to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) what do you...how do you feel about it all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you know, I...it's like either now or never is how I feel about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. (inaudible) right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, and I guess you (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I think the thing to do is just (inaudible) resist temptation (inaudible) Know it (inaudible) you don't know how it's going to come out and maybe you don't exactly know what you want to do (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Try in a way. 00:24:39 (quiet until 00:24:52) So I'm off (inaudible) this weekend. </p>

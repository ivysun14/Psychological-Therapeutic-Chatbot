<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>ANALYST: I want to mention, next Tuesday the UXQZ will be closed, so —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>ANALYST: We're not having an hour.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just thinking when I was out there that, again there were a lot of people, just sort of socializing and there was a lot of laughing and I had a totally different reaction to it today.  And I don't know whether it's because there are a few people now that I see enough so in a sense, from my observations I have some kind of a concept what they're like.  And again by listening today I was, was uhm, well, not really participating, but feeling as if I kind of knew what was happening; or, or whether I just felt more relaxed or what but I didn't feel locked out or, or nervous about it or any of the feelings that I had other times.  Of course I couldn't, the people weren't right there.  Perhaps if they had been right there and I had been just waiting I would have felt differently.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Something that keeps coming back to my mind since yesterday and I suppose the reason is because I felt very awkward.  When I was leaving and I had my suit jacket on, I was very aware at the time even that I was debating whether or not to button it in here and then pick up my things or to just get out because I always have this feeling, I think I mentioned, to leave quickly and the whole time I was doing it I was kind of starting to do it and then stopping, because I felt ridiculous making you just wait there.  And I suppose I felt even more awkward because in a normal situation this is the time you kind of make small talk with someone and it just made me feel very awkward just for you to be standing there and no conversation and for me to be doing that.  But I had gotten to the point where I'd started to do it and then I just made myself stay here and do it.  Even though it made me feel very uncomfortable.  And then I began to think that this thing of making myself go through with something like that and this is true of so many things, was equally ridiculous.  Then I'm inclined to thin, well the thing, the only thing that was good about it was the fact that I had that control and I could make myself do it.  But then I began to think if I felt that uncomfortable then I should have just stopped and gone out and —.  I think what stopped me was the fact that you would know I had started to and then you might again think something about me if I didn't finish something I started.  That I would reveal myself too much if I just suddenly decided well, I'm not going to stay and finish and left.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You'd reveal yourself as someone who doesn't finish what she starts, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, in that particular case I think I was thinking more —.  Well, I guess that's basically it, but also what it would reveal about me that I didn't finish it and that —.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And what would it reveal do you fear?</p>

<p> PATIENT:  Uhm, that I was so embarrassed or uncomfortable.  That I couldn't even stay here and finish doing up my jacket.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's not entirely clear what was embarrassing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think just having you wait.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Aha.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And, and the fact that uhm, you know, the time is over and therefore the kind of relationship we have was over and so then it was, how do I function after that?  The same type of thing that I was talking about if I met you out in the street or rode down the elevator with you or something, that sometimes I've been worried about, because again, what would I do with myself?  (Pause) But getting back to what you said about the thing that I would reveal would be something to do with the fact that I, didn't finish something I started.  This is an element of many things that I do do and that once I start it's a matter of just finishing it no matter what.  And I've sometimes wondered what it is that makes me do that.  And it doesn't, I suppose in a way it's a fear of saying to myself, well, you've failed that time.  But I don't know, I've never been sure if that's really it or if there's something else to it too.  For instance, when I was in PEC and, and things got very uncomfortable at one point with the family and enough so that I considered leaving, but I didn't.  And I told myself when I decided not to, that the reason was the girl I was tutoring would need me and it wouldn't be fair to her to just leave like that.  But I think that I was afraid of going and afraid of committing myself in that way.  And I couldn't tell exactly why because in a way I had really admitted to myself that I'd failed and this is why I always feel very uncomfortable about thinking about the year in PEC, because I can't pretend to myself that in some ways I didn't fail.  And so I thought, well there must be something else too, that made me feel I had to stay.  I can see that if I ever would use the argument of sort of duty, or responsibility, that I'm just rationalizing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, what you said before uh, about that situation in PEC was that uhm, sort of the point at which you felt you failed apparently was after the family learned about your fear about the man, that you were in a quandary about.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't, well of course, I just assume that's what they were told.  I don't —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, anyway it was your idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What it makes me think of is the situation here again, when you were wondering whether to finish buttoning your coat or not.  You recall you had mentioned earlier about how you felt in taking your coat off.  And you thought of the situation here when I was standing and you were standing as though it were the same kind of a situation where we would meet outside of here, social situation or something of the sort.  And it was literally as though your dilemma was, should you be covered or not?  Should you button up tightly or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Or even further, I suppose what it was in buttoning myself up is dressing again and, and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: In front of me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  (Silence) I can almost feel my mind resisting doing anything more with that thought.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm, why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you want to follow the —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm trying and it —</p>

<p>ANALYST: — trend?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Just doesn't seem to —.  The thing that came to my mind instead is something else that I noticed today, I'm aware of, but happened again today.  And this is my reaction to hands and how I feel about them.  And as a child I used to feel very strongly about girl's hands.  And then once I began to start dating and so forth, I began noticing hands of men.  And I have a very definite reaction to a certain type of hands, have certain shape, long fingers and uhm, the sort of slender but, but still masculine looking and almost more than anything else, I find that very attractive about a man.  And this was something about MSCZ that I found I had to keep finding a way to get around, because his hands aren't at all, in fact they're the exact opposite of the kind of hands I like and it was very hard for me to overcome this.  That I could still marry him when he didn't have the kind of hands that I wanted my husband to have.</p>

<p>And I don't know quite why I feel this way, except that my, both, both my parents have long fingers and my father's hands aren't attractive, but uhm, but his hand, fingers are long, and my mother's hands are very attractive and either she or somebody had, made comments about it I guess, so that I began concentrating on that.  And then we all have big feet and this was the other thing about MSCZ.  He has small feet for his height.  And this bothers me too, because I suppose having big feet and my whole family having big feet, I decided that that was a good thing and that I liked it and I thought little feet looked ridiculous.  And the same thing about feet too if they're short and broad, I didn't like them.  And I always was glad that mine weren't.  But the main thing I, well, no I guess I react to feet about as much, but hands even more.  And I still do in women, but it's a stronger reaction when I see a pair of hands I like in a man.  And I'm immediately receptive to liking a man who has hands I like and I, the opposite if a man has hands I don't like.</p>

<p>And it is sort of an element of something that I've begun to notice my father does.  When there's a quality that we have as a family or that he has and thinks we have as a family, or that he likes and therefore like to think we all have even if we don't.  It becomes the virtue and the hands, the feeling about hands and feet are the only thing I can think of now.  Though I know other times other things have stuck me too that he's making the thing to broad a quality, that it just happens that we're that way but that there's nothing so wonderful about it.  But he in his thinking it it's the way to be.  And he does always have to think that what he has is the best and where he went to school was the best.  He's terrible about, he went to HT and especially with people who went to KQ, he's just awful, always saying little things, trying to build up HT and make it seem better than it is or better than KQ and — just this fall I've noticed something he does every fall and that's talk about the football teams and making it sound like because KQ's bigger it has better material, but of course HT does much more with theirs and he just, it's compulsive about always building up anything that is connected with himself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's almost like, I was just thinking, some reason, his reaction to the yd's, some of whom he knew personally and, not to well, but he did know them personally and ever since I can remember he and my mother have had this almost hatred of them and it just seemed to me that the yd family stands for everything to him that is not what he is and what he wants or he's made them become this, so that then he could concentrate all his ill feelings on them.  Because I can remember it was a shock to me when I was at college and was beginning to meet people who thought the yd's were pretty good.  And I was naive enough to think, really be afraid that the country was going to fall apart when John Kennedy was president.  And I remember once I asked my father something about this and I was quite surprised when he didn't seem to be, he wasn't happy about it, but he wasn't that terribly disturbed, and he made some comment that he thought things would be alright after Kennedy finished.  Wouldn't be that bad, and I, I just couldn't believe it because of the way he used to talk about him.  And my mother even when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, said something indirectly that meant it served him right.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or I was thinking too of their feeling right now about Nixon and or just any candidate they're in favor of, but Nixon this time, and how two people could be doing the same type of things but if they're for one of them, then they just can't see it at all, and they're, they're very critical of the same thing in somebody else.  And if you bring it to their attention in any kind of a subtle way they sluff it off or have excuses or somehow anyway avoid really coming to face it as being exactly the same type of thing.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was trying to think again more about the fact that I reacted the way I did yesterday and, and also in PEC and it must have something, I suppose, to do with the kind of relationship I had with my father and, and how it was in a way a very narrow type of relationship and I was also thinking of the very strong feelings I had towards some of his friends and how the ones I really liked and got along well with, were the sort of benevolent fatherly types who would also treat me as, always there was this feeling that there was this age difference but yet they felt some kind of respect for me as a person, so that they would joke with me on a level that they could enjoy and not just sort of be looking down on me.  And so in a way I was flirting with them, I suppose.  And any other kind of a man I really couldn't handle or relate to.  And it was probably true in a way with my own age group that well, in high school, I was just thinking of the boys I was friendly with.  And it was always the ones who were kind of platonic friendships that I could get along with.  And any boy that showed any interest in me simply because we were going to be dating, I couldn't handle.  Or as soon as he seemed, if we started dating and he showed any interest in me as a girl and was more than just being kind of friendly, then I would immediately withdraw.</p>

<p>And the boys I could, the only boys I could really just talk with comfortably and enjoy were all boys who were just kind of good friends like a brother might be.  And if I ever went out with them it would be because a whole group was doing something.  And it wasn't ever really a dating type of thing.  And it was true too in college, that except for maybe a few boys, that I particularly was interested in, most of the people I dated, if they showed any strong interest in me at all, I immediately had to cut it off and find reasons not to go out with them again.  And even with the boys, especially in my freshman year, that I wanted to date and, and that I liked, there was always an intensity on my part or I never could understand exactly what I did, but I knew I was spoiling the relationship almost right away.  I'd take things too seriously or be too intense about how I felt about them and what I wanted in return.  And this is really kind of the relationship that I want from MSCZ and, in a, in a sense, although I know I'm not happy with it too.  But I can see I often set up things so that we're, we're just companions or good friends or something rather than really a husband and a wife.  In fact, I have always found it very hard to speak of MSCZ as my husband or to think of myself as his wife.  I can't really, I, if I say it I feel sort of ridiculous saying it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And somewhere I've gotten the reaction that having a person interested in another person actually is, is just sort of an animal passion and doesn't have anything to do with the person themselves.  And so if MSCZ wants to have any kind of intimate relationship with me I always get very upset because it, or I used to especially, because it seemed like he wasn't concerned about me or caring about me, it was just this thing that, I could be anybody, I used to think.  It didn't have to be me and he could feel the same way.  (Pause) And the thing I can't understand too is the way my reaction to him will go in cycles.  That sometimes I just feel as if I don't want any physical contact with him at all and for a long time and then I'll become quite affectionate and I can even enjoy intercourse and I don't know, this whole feeling of concern for him and I suppose that at those, those times I feel most like a wife, and his wife, but then that will, and then I'll think oh, maybe things are changing and I'll be different now but then suddenly it'll stop again.  And I can't understand what makes me change and be that way and then what happens that I suddenly will stop being that way.  Although it must, well, I'm not sure it always has, coincides, but it often coincides with, with times when I don't have that much else to do.  That there are a lot of situations that would make me feel uncomfortable or unhappy and I knew what they were and I could avoid as many of them as possible and the other ones I knew about, so I'd be prepared</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which does?</p>

<p>PATIENT:      My feeling at all intimate about how I want to relate MSCZ having intercourse or anything, or being affectionate even.  Or just even thinking about him and his comfort; making him happy.  Any of these things.  When I'm busy I can see I really do just think about myself and the things I think about for him are really very superficial like if he's going to be coming home and I have to make a meal for him or he needs clean clothes or something, but not really thinking about him.  Because it's more I have to do these things and I'll squeeze in doing this for MSCZ too.  But I don't know whether it's because of the fact that I'm busy or whether because I'm busy I use it as an excuse.  And when I don't have an excuse, then I handle it differently.  Because the other thing is that you hear from various sources and MSCZ says this, that if I got to the point where I enjoyed intercourse really, that I wouldn't believe how happy it made me feel.  And I suppose basically I really don't believe that, or believe that I could feel it.  So sometimes I suppose I think to myself, well, what's the point of trying, because it really won't be true anyway.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I have a definite feeling about, when I think it must be near the end of the time, not wanting to get into something and then I'll feel I stop right in the middle.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you feel that, or do you feel that I've interrupted.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  When the time is over?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when you actually say that the time is up, I feel you've interrupted I suppose.  But before, if I'm thinking about something that I could see would go on, then I'm thinking in terms of the time might be up and I'll have to stop right in the middle.  And it makes me feel I don't know exactly how it makes me feel if, if I feel I want to wrap things up or I've just, in my emotionally I'm so involved in it that I can't suddenly cut off, or what it is, but —.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Unless there's something in particular now that you don't want to get into?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Right now (chuckle) I might be using it as an excuse for not saying it.  Because I was thinking of the fact that feeling that it wouldn't be worth trying.  At the end of this summer I was able twice to have an orgasm when we were having intercourse and I think I'm afraid to ever really have intercourse with MSCZ again because I'm afraid that I'll just be disappointed and it'll never happen again.  And so I, that was kind of the point at which at this time I returned to being very distant and very busy and using that excuse always, that I was so busy or it was too late and I was tired and it's just very unpleasant to both of us for me to fluctuate like this.  And it always makes me wonder if I really care about MSCZ anyway when I get like this, that maybe if I really cared about him then I wouldn't.  And then of course, that leads to thinking that well, if I really don't care about him then we shouldn't be married or living together and then I stop thinking about it because I can't go beyond that.</p>

<p>And in a way that, the thought occurred to him first, because to me, I always thought well we could, if he would only accept a more platonic relationship that everything would be fine.  And after he'd been going to analysis for a while he said that things were to a point for him that either I had to change and work this out or else we'd have to have a divorce.  And I suppose that in a way it was almost like a threat, not that he meant it to be a threat, but I took it as a threat and in a way it made me face the fact that I did have some kind of a problem or that I should be doing something to work it out.  Because the times when I personally myself wanted to work it out, kept being, well it was the same thing again, I'd, I'd go in cycles there would be times when I would really care about it and then there'd be other times when I kept thinking well, things are fine as they are if MSCZ just would be different.  And I think I accepted too that there are a lot of situations that would make me feel uncomfortable or unhappy and I knew what they were and I could avoid as many of them as possible and the other ones I knew about so I'd be prepared ahead to find them unpleasant and then when they were unpleasant, I wouldn't it wouldn't be a shock to me and I could handle it.</p>

<p>But I think the thing that made me personally want to have analysis was after talking to MSCZ a lot, a sense of the fact that I didn't have to be quite so unhappy all the time and that maybe there was a way I could feel happier.  And then that made me more and more aware of times when I did feel unhappy and I would just have the wish that I could somehow handle it differently so I didn't feel so unhappy.  And that makes me think of a boy in my room whose expression his father and mother are separated and his expression is almost always so sad and I was thinking too, I'm very sympathetic toward him because I, well, I guess I feel an empathy for somebody who feels quite unhappy.  And I keep thinking of the fact that my mother used to always say to me, why do you have to look so gloomy and have such a gloomy look on your face?  And in a way it was just letting on my face how I felt completely inside, just the way this poor boy does.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And for some reason my mind jumped right away to the boy who is seeing a doctor and uhm I hadn't been told before the mother spoke of it yesterday and one of the things that she told me yesterday was my headmaster's reaction when he hear this.  And, and his judgment of what the problem was, was that knowing the boy's father because the boy's father had also been at LKC, he felt that this boy whom he didn't know at all was over-directed.  And it just for some reason, has made me very angry that the headmaster would make a statement like that, and make a judgment like that, I think out of the top of his head, I don't see how he can though.  And besides, it just seems to me too simplistic and just makes me very angry that he did that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

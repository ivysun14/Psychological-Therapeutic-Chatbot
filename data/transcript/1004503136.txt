<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, gosh, um—this is really actually, sounds weird to say this, but it's very hard for me to come in and do this and not—and not able to usually just talk about things that I feel that are negative on a regular basis. And so, it's—sometimes it's almost like exhausting about—thinking about what to talk about, that kind of thing. And sometimes it's not, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a sense, that it really goes against the grain of how you usually [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—[pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine it's hard to talk about painful, sucky stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. True. [Pause]. It's—one of the big things that I am very insecure about that I sort of feel bad about even talking about it. But I feel like I'm very immature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>[00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't really know why. But I—I guess because the fact I've been talking about things that I don't usually share with other people about my life, that are more youthful, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pause] it's something that I—there's certain people that I feel comfortable around doing it, but for the most part, I don't actually like to let people know that because I'm afraid that they're going to judge me for that, for being, you know [pause] not acting my age.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—[pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that you also judge yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I feel like this is just who I am. I don't necessarily know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that [pause] I think that I'm really pushing that boundary of the point in which people are going to start to think it's a little weird for me to be like—[pause] be this way, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you immature?</p>

<p>[00:02:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually I will tell you a story. I decided to—after we were—after we had our meeting last—a couple days ago. I went across the street to that comic book store just for kicks. And just haven't been there at all, and asked them where their Monga section is, and they said they don't really have one because they don't have a whole lot of 13-year-old girls that are allowed to come into this end of town.</p>

<p>They said it, not like in a mean way, but like as in an honest way. And I was like okay. So, now mind you, there is almost like a—I mean, there really—the fact that—that there is actually a stereotype about people who work at comic book stores as being kind of actually extremely mean and not necessarily knowing that they are is somewhat—like, if the stereotype is true, but he didn't seem like he was trying to mean, he was just like you know, we don't—like we're—but the part of [inaudible 00:03:21] parents don't allow their 13-year-old girls to come in here, so we have no need for Monga.</p>

<p>[00:03:26]</p>

<p>I was like okay. It's not like I'm looking for Sailor Moon or anything like that, I'm actually looking for something that's, you know, fairly—you know, I read things that are pretty gritty, so I can't imagine this as being appealing to that, but between that and just, you know, when I was talking about my love of dinosaurs and other things like that, I just feel like maybe I am sort of perpetually like infantile, I guess.</p>

<p>[00:04:01]</p>

<p>But it's who I am. You know? [Pause]. It's sort of a—it goes back to that whole thing of feeling like people want me to be who I am, but I am being who I am. Kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, [sighs] I don't know. I just—[pause]. The biggest thing, I guess, is the fact that I feel like [pause] the hobbies that I like, I can't stand the people who do them. Not because—and part of it is stereotyping, but most of it's the fact that I just can't stand them as human beings. Which sounds awful. And the people that don't tend to stereotype that particular type of thing because of the fact that [Interposing] those people.</p>

<p>[00:04:58]</p>

<p>So, like I can't imagine wanting to go to like conferences and things like that because I wouldn't want to be around most of those people. You know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? What are they like? I mean, who are you—?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Your average like IMA—at least female, and is sort of over-the-top in terms of like they want to dress like their favorite characters, and they are extremely emotive in ways that are, to me, borderline obnoxious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like sort of dramatic—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More like along the lines of like very loud. Very annoying. When we first moved here, um, just before we moved, the hotel that the university put us up in was—the same one was having a convention. I forget, I think I may have mentioned this or not. And they're loud and running and back and forth. And this and that, and catti (ph) are wearing leather pant—dancing stuff. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:06:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I find that to be kind of—I mean, it's fine, but can't they just—I'm also one of those—as much as I say that I'm afraid I'm immature, I've always been one of these get off of my lawn kind of people, too. This cranky old—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A curmudgeon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Goddamn it, what the hell are you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You darn kids, get out of the hallway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And so, it's—it's weird because I find that to be really hard because the fact is that people who have the same interests I find to be generally, but entirely true, but most of the people to be extremely obnoxious. And society tends to like [pause] profile those people as obnoxious, therefore, I don't necessarily want to let normal people know that is a hobby of mine either. If you know what I mean.</p>

<p>[00:07:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And it sounds like your lack—your disinterest to being part of that crowd—</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not because I feel like I want to and I'm embarrassed, it's I don't want to be around that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds to me like it's two things, but I want to make sure --. The first one is like that's just not you, [Interposing]. In other words, like running around the hotel hallways screaming and—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pink hair and—yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] pink hair, like not you so much. That's part one. Part two is it does sound like you get cranky of those people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? Or is it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I believe that there's—fun has a time and a place, and that 3:00 a.m. is not one of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially on a weeknight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three a.m. in front of your hotel room is not the time and place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Especially when my husband is interviewing for postdoc in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>[00:08:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I was this close to taking—because I [inaudible 00:08:16] back then, coming out there and literally shaking my cane at them. [Laughs].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so, it's not like—if they want to go be that way where it's not disturbing anybody—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay? It's not a criticism of that—[Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I find it to be kind of weird, but sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright. So, it's more like the way they're imposing on you—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have more important things in my life to actually, than to self-analyze people who for some reason need—feel the need to dress up like their favorite characters. You know, that—honestly, I think it's a little strange, but you know what? I live in a very glass house, so I'm not going to throw any stones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:09:10]</p>

<p>[inaudible 00:09:10] in your way—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:09:13], of course, your husband had an interview the next morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I got things I have to be doing, too, you know? And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, well yeah, I can see how that leaves you in kind of a pickle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like, even just going to, like, I feel like I—[pause] you know, if I were to purchase anything, I'd have to go through the Internet so that I don't have to apparently get potentially shamed by the person at the comic book store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? [Pause]. One would think that they would like to make money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Laughs].</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Laughs] it sounds stupid but it's true, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't sound stupid, it's so true.</p>

<p>[00:10:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing is, is that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] a little strange because like—I would say that there are like hoards of 13-year-olds running around [inaudible 00:10:11] Square.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he was just being like [pause] I don't know. I really don't get it so much. And the funny thing is, is that, I mean, yes, there is like a whole genre of that, but this is not the kind of—when the person who goes out their way to actually pronounce their vowels correctly in Japanese, um, should indicate that they actually are probably looking for a more high-brow piece of literature than like, you know, Sailor Moon or something like—or something with Hello Kitty on it or something, you know?</p>

<p>Something that actually is read backwards like it's supposed to, like there's a whole—it was just now after this experience, I'm starting to find out that there is actually like a huge amount of like, um, compet—I don't know the word, competition? Ire (ph) between the two genres. In terms of like apparently people who like Monga versus who like American comics.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>[00:11:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't actually read them anymore, not that I ever really did because I'm so used to when you read Monga, you read it backwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it's in English, it's read backwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: The panels go from the right to—they start on the other side of the book, you flip the other—you would read a book backwards, and the panels go from—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go from right to left. Because that's how it was written. And so, it's very difficult for me to process any information that involves pictures and bubbles, like in anything, the other direction, actually. Amongst other things. But it's just kind of a weird thing, but I guess now—I just now found out that I guess there's some sort of—I don't really understand it, and to be honest, I don't really want to give them to understand like what exactly, why it is that they're upset about that or something. But apparently, there is a place around here that just went under, and from what I understand, the Internet and there's going to be a place in the same place that's going to reopen, it didn't go under because of the economy, more about the ineptitude of the person that owned it.</p>

<p>[00:12:23]</p>

<p>It's a place, I guess, called Mongo Reader around here that used to be all Monga and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah. That's two blocks—[Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that place, it just closed—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that was the place you had just gone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. This was like—that comic book store is like right like near the IHOP.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you had to go down into this weird dungeon looking—not like a dungeon, but it's a basement level area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—[pause], I guess I don't have a real deep interest in collecting like figurines, or like the normal stuff that the culture has, you know? I never really had Barbies, so I would want like plastic figures and characters and, you know, I don't have the need or desire to play with them, you know?</p>

<p>[00:13:12]</p>

<p>And I may have a plastic dinosaur, but that—I don't have one right now, but I could potentially have one that might be for a different reason though. So, just to make sure that I fully show myself for the hypocrite that I am. But I have such a small apartment, I don't have anything that's really collectible per se have to be significantly meaningful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's [Interposing] yeah. And dusting. I don't like to have dust. So, I don't know. [Sighs], I'm just [pause]. I guess the big thing is, is that I [pause] I strongly feel like I cannot be the person that I am. And people constantly think that I am someone—that I am someone different than I am. And it gets me very frustrated. Mind you, I am complicated, yet, very simplistic in that—you know, I'm complicated in that I like things that are useful, but damn it, don't like be too loud kind of person.</p>

<p>[00:14:26]</p>

<p>But I don't know, I just—[pause] I am [pause] embarrassed that like for example, the biggest—when I first moved here, I found out that I didn't know that the—the author of one of my favorite children's books of all time, which again, please don't laugh, the Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle; I love that book. I've loved it since I was a little kid, right?</p>

<p>[00:14:56]</p>

<p>And when I found out that there's actually a whole museum around here for that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's actually a few hours from here, but—[Interposing] supposed to be a wonderful museum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I would like to go there, but I'm like I need to borrow someone's kid so that it doesn't seem to creepy that I'm an adult without like kids at this kid's museum. [Pause] you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:15:30].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have found the fact that he—the way he—[sighs] with very, very few words, expresses a lot of emotion. It's very serendipitous. There's something very classic about it, you know, in general. I just, I think his illustrations are great.</p>

<p>[00:16:00]</p>

<p>And I'm about to intellectualize this to the moment, but the way that he does the paint, he does the medium of that watercolor over paper, and then cuts it out into a collage. I really like that enough that even when I was really little—back in Cincinnati, they have a whole lot of Matisse. [inaudible 00:16:20] Matisse who actually for—most people know him for like a lot of his dance drawings, but there's a lot of stuff that he has other than that that actually were done in collage.</p>

<p>And I remember being pretty little with my dad and mom, and being—there was one that's a couple hundred feet long that's out there. It's, um, at the time, I didn't really understand what it was. Now, I know that it's actually a depiction of the [inaudible 00:16:47] I think is how you say the name. The 1001 Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:16:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can never pronounce that right. How to say that—basically of that story. And other things like that.</p>

<p>[00:16:59]</p>

<p>And again, that was something in which it totally captured my imagination because at the time, he did a very similar type of thing where it was some sort of medium, where it was painted, then cut out, then reassembled to make this beautiful—you know, it's very complicated, it's very beautiful, it's very whimsical kind of thing. And so, and that's one of the things I really love about Eric Carle's stuff as well.</p>

<p>As a little kid, you know, I found it to be very approachable, like the concepts of things, you know? A lot of his books were just fantastic. I mean, that's the [inaudible 00:17:38] I mentioned because everyone knows that one. But he wrote a couple other ones about other types of animals, too, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Slowly, Slowly, Slowly [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that. I wasn't so much into that one, I like the—there was a firefly one that it was a very shy firefly. A lonely cricket, you know, all kinds of cute ones. But normally, books that are gimmicky that have holes in them and things like that aren't really done well. He's really well thought through.</p>

<p>[00:18:11]</p>

<p>And so, I even have it on my computer, he did a video of himself reading the book. I thought that was really cool because then I could sort of see—I like in general, whenever I get audio books, like even like grown-up audio books. When the author reads it because it gives a certain tone that you wouldn't necessarily see. And I just found it really fascinating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, the way you're talking about this doesn't sound particularly childish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. That's because I'm an intellectual, so I can feel like I—that's like more interesting. I don't know. But yes, I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, [pause]</p>

<p>[00:19:02]</p>

<p>Intellectualizing is getting away from something one feels.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm justifying it intellectually by saying that I like [inaudible 00:19:16] and I find it very illustrative and [Interposing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] [inaudible 00:19:22] justification—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —for how much you really like these books.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could actually do the same thing with the TV show Gossip Girl, too. Oh yes. I can bring it back to Edith Werton [ph] that way I cannot feel ashamed about the fact that I watch that show. It actually is very strongly, like, very much like age of innocence and it's very Victorian. And slightly Shakespearian. But yes. I intellectualize all of my low-brow habits so that I can—I can talk about like [inaudible 00:19:51] and Monga from the level of Japanese wood cuts [ph], and I can talk about how this is an expression that came out of pre-World War II.</p>

<p>[00:20:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] your—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to make sure that I don't ever get like, thought of as being shallow in my own head. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again though, I guess the [pause]—the way you put it, kind of suggests that there's some other more—low-brow probably isn't the right word, but like simplistic or infantile attraction to the kind of stuff you're talking about that you are pretty ashamed of and have to kind of cover over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really know if it's true or not, but I feel like maybe there is.</p>

<p>[00:21:00]</p>

<p>You know? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it must—[inaudible 00:21:18] hasn't started out as fairly infantile with Eric Carle and the dinosaurs because—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —because you started out with them when you were little.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It's a very weird thing. I don't know if I got it from my parents, they certainly don't judge my tastes for the most part. They have their moments where they grimace and say okay, well that must be something that you like. But I was taught very, very early on to very—[pause] that it's almost like you need to be [pause] how do I explain this?</p>

<p>[00:21:59]</p>

<p>Anything that you sort of take into your life that you should—it should have a meaning, whether or not the meaning is, you know, [sighs] [pause]. Whether or not, you know, it's of great importance or not, it's something where you shouldn't just passively just sit there and be entertained, you know? Even if you were watching something that was completely ridiculous, you should be able to think about the fact that okay, this is [pause], you know, that you actually are realizing that this is something where this is a comedy and the absurdity or this is this, or this is that.</p>

<p>Even if it is something that in theory has no merit to it, that—that you do understand that. You know—I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:22:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like there's some kind of tactic framing of what you're appreciating and—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —why and how that fits in with culture more broadly or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Aesthetics, in general, um, you know in terms of music or in terms of movies, or in terms of anything, really. Like, I remember I really, um, [pause] I had this conversation with my dad, god, like 15 years ago or so about techno. And how he's like yeah, don't like it, but I think Bach would be fascinated with it. And we had this discussion about how like because the fact that he was one of those people that was constantly re—like trying to reinvent different types of the same information. And [inaudible 00:23:44] absolutely find it fascinating.</p>

<p>He's like yeah, I can't stand it, it drives me up the wall. But I can see it being mathematically fascinating. And it is something that I do like to listen to. And so, it wasn't even like a shame on you for liking this kind of thing.</p>

<p>[00:24:01]</p>

<p>You know? That kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, just things like that, you know? [Pause]. There's something to understand about, you know, there's some sort of meaning and something to be understood just about everything. And then, when you stop looking at things differently is when, I don't know, you become dumb, I guess. And this is just like things just sort of being a path of entertainment, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound pretty diligent about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's almost like there's sort of—[Interposing] of esthetics or something [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like very, very—this is very [inaudible 00:24:49].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, there is. The thing is if we're going to turn things around, you know, I was educated in the Greek aspects the fact that, you know, of [inaudible 00:25:05] and how that is okay, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't sound very okay from how you're talking about it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. I'm talking about intellectually where the [Interposing] where the word pandemonium comes from, and you know, yeah, that kind of stuff. Yeah. It's intellectually fascinating.</p>

<p>[00:25:20]</p>

<p>But no. No. No. You don't go out and do things like that now. I don't really know where it comes from. I mean, I got an idea probably from mom and dad, but they're just like—but it was never directly like that. Definitely more by example. [Pause]. And it's definitely you shouldn't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they have things like that they just like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or that are just kind of silly, but they do—or that they're into—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm certain that there's got to be something. [Pause]</p>

<p>[00:26:00]</p>

<p>Well, my dad reads legal briefs to the pets. [Pause] I don't know. I mean, not really. Sometimes, but not really. You know, everything has a utility of some sort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, as you kind of said before, it has this kind of like justification for fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not even just that, but being [Interposing] not just redeeming, but like it is that you should understand why you want to do something. Like, when I wanted to get my ears pierced, although it took them a while for them to want them to let me get it done, and I'm actually—long story short, it actually probably was better that way. The [pause] we went on this giant, you know, like I kid you not, like myself and another neighbor kid and the other neighbor parents, [inaudible 00:27:03] and my parents, did this whole like national geographic style like, you know, education about the body modification and—</p>

<p>[00:27:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:27:12] after you got your ears pierced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Basically, yeah. About how this is something that you think you're being original, but this is something that's been going on since pre-homosapien yeah. Yeah. Not to shame you for wanting to get your pierced, as much as like that, um, that it is something that, you know, it's something—it became an educational experience.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It reminds me of like—you know, some parents—this is not like your parents, but just to make an analogy. Some parents are like you want a new bike, like you got to mow the lawn and sell lemonade and do whatever, earn the money to do it. Like, there's the sense that like you got to be able to put some work in it and pay for it.</p>

<p>[00:28:05]</p>

<p>It's almost a little like that. I've got money, but—[Interposing] like I don't know, intellectual understanding or a framing of what you want and what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess you're telling me that which—you're dumb. Or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. Not even childish as much as I know you can do this, and I think that this is something that you ought to know. At no point would they ever tell me that it was dumb. Ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. I didn't mean that. You were the one who said that if you don't do this—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like that. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPSIT: Yeah. No, I wasn't—it didn't—I don't have the impression at all that your parents would do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I picked up some of these ideas on my own, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems that way. Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:29:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of them I picked up on my own. But yes, it just brought it to another level of, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. My hunch is that for you there's more of a should aspect to this. Than there is for them. Like, if they get curious or interested, and they like doing it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: For them, it's more funny than anything. [Interposing] like, I remember at one point in the late 80s, early 90s when really, really bright makeup was up, like, my mom and my dad laughing uproariously because of the fact that they felt like it was exactly like the same thing as like other types of colorful birds and animal's mating behavior. I remember them talking about this, and [inaudible 00:29:48] and things like that. And I remember just to them that that was the most hilarious thing in the world.</p>

<p>And it wasn't like they were necessarily saying that that because of that that they were like animals. But just that whole thing of funny how life [Interposing] the world kind of thing, you know? And so, I think I sort of adopted it on my own level, you know, to another level. And I think that they encourage it. Like, they're proud of it.</p>

<p>[00:30:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like there's something really the matter with you if you don't do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Maybe not. I think it's deeper than that, I don't think it's possible for me not to do it. I don't even think that I've gotten to the point where I'm not doing it, and therefore, I think there's something wrong with me. Does that make sense? I haven't even got to the failed situation where I get to get the self-criticism because I'm already doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, [inaudible 00:30:39] you were telling me before that you feel like you're—I mean, you told me a minute ago you were intellectually justifying—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —liking Eric Carle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's [inaudible 00:30:56] said it that were you not—[Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was partially making—I was partially joking, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But partially not. It's true.</p>

<p>[00:31:07]</p>

<p>I can't imagine somebody who liked it without thinking about it, being dumb, I just think that they haven't necessarily analyzed why it is they like it. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I can't—it's not [pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it would seem to me like you are sort of working pretty hard to both be able to like these things, and feel okay about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I try not to judge other people, I was raised never to judge anybody else because of that. It's not like anybody else has the same type of like level of what is and isn't, you know, they should be doing usually, not entirely true. But I feel like, at least with me, I feel like I have a much higher level for that. And that's partially because of the fact that I was never given any negative feedback saying that, but I definitely got so much positive when I came up, and I did something that not necessarily the right thing, but something in which I was stretching my boundaries. Because there was never really a right answer to most things, but like I remember asking questions about [inaudible 00:32:19] paradox, I didn't actually know what that phrase meant.</p>

<p>[00:32:21]</p>

<p>But I'm like okay, so if we keep cutting things in half, where does this happen? And they were just delighted that I asked these questions. Or like on car trips, I'm like it's kind of weird how it seems like I'm sitting still and the things are coming at me, you know, saying that as a little kid, they were just thrilled. So, there never was a right answer, but as long as I kept up with this—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This really tickled them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But as long as I kept being my own person and kept thinking, you know, which I really feel like—it wasn't really possible, but I was taken out of the Montessori system because there really wasn't a whole lot of support for it post-six or seven in the Cincinnati area. But I really feel like that profoundly affected the way that I—my curiosity, the way that I look at the world, and I probably would've thrived better in that—if there was something like that for me as I got older.</p>

<p>[00:33:23]</p>

<p>I probably will—probably will search out options like that for our kids. Because I think that's really cool. You know. But it's just sort of how I was raised to be, and so—but I've sort of taken it to a different level in terms of expectations for myself. And it's like it is because I got a lot of positive reinforcement from that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For coming up with these—these ideas. You know, if I at the age of ten told my dad, I'm looking to write a book, and I need to figure out what I need to do to publish it, he would be thrilled. You know? Whether or not it was about—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] was very fun for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was great—it was a good life. It was a really good life. You know? And I think the problem is, is that, you know, me being just—maybe I'm not really addicted to the praise, but I'm not getting that kind of reinforcement.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, of course you miss—you ought to miss it, like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, even in school, I got a lot of it. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Sure.</p>

<p>[00:34:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine, many teachers tend to like that sort of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know? And also, just like hey, I have this project, I want to do this, I think this is really big. I need to figure out what I need to do to make this happen, you know? Above and beyond for a class or for a degree, this is something that I want to research. You know? Most people are thrilled for that kind of stuff, you know? But I just don't get that kind of—I mean, I get a little bit with Microsoft, but not that much. I mean, as much they can. The problem is, is that I, I guess maybe they just account when they're happy with me as much. They feel like they get happy too easily about things, you know?</p>

<p>What they consider to be really cool and innovative, and they think this fantastic and I'm like, yeah, that's just normally me breathing kind of thing. So, but I just feel like I don't get enough of that—am I going to need that for the rest of my life? What am I going to be 80 years old hoping that someone's going to tell me how awesome I am? Come on. That's kind of a sucky way to live.</p>

<p>[00:35:41]</p>

<p>What am I going to do when my children outgrow me and they think that—how painfully embarrassing it is that their mom still really likes to do these kind of things, and they're like well past that point. I mean, what am I going to do? I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:36:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:36:10] you don't have [inaudible 00:36:17] your life that I imagine you [inaudible 00:36:23] have like [pause] I mean, [inaudible 00:36:29] you're not at a job that, you know, where people are sort of expecting you to do a double twisting back flip [ph]. And like, you know, saying wow, that's amazing. [inaudible 00:36:43] you know what I mean? Like, [inaudible 00:36:50] from what I understand you saying, the bar is much lower.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying you don't sometimes do that kind of a fancy trick, but it's not [inaudible 00:36:59] impress people, which I'm sure is—in a way kind of disappointing not get a sort of respond that way [ph] equally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that most people are—you're mentioning like—you know, the thing with most people are—I think that most people don't actually have that. I think that I have too high of an expectation to—to need that kind of, um, fulfillment out of a job. I don't think most people really get that kind of life [ph] from their jobs. At least, I mean—</p>

<p>[00:37:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that it—[inaudible 00:37:46] more about for some reason just needing it more than—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I have higher expectations of what I get out of a career than your average person. Or out of anything, you know?</p>

<p>[00:38:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd say like it matters to you to be able to do it in a way that is like very impressive in the way that gets you lots of congratulation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least I can feel like I did something. Even if I don't get it from somebody else, I know that I did it well. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, even if—I've done things where like, I volunteered at a small bookstore or whatever in the past, and I never got any praise out of it at all, but I knew that I did the job far better than most people who were being paid to work at a bookstore. That kind of thing, you know?</p>

<p>And I only did it like a couple—like two hours a week every other week, or something like that. But the point that—even when I'm not necessarily getting it from somebody, I know that I'm doing this, and I'm happy enough from that, per se, it's just that right now, I'm just not finding as many opportunities to push myself.</p>

<p>[00:39:20]</p>

<p>So, I mean, it is great to get that kind of kudos from my boss, but to be honest, if it didn't, it wouldn't be the end of the world. I would be the person that knew I did a good job, so this is like well, there's only so many times that I can teach somebody how to do something, and not really push—and pushing the envelope on that. You know? Though I try very hard to find different ways to do it.</p>

<p>So, I don't know. [Pause]. We, at work, had a exercise where we were all given a piece of paper so that we could anonymously write comments to each other—positive comments only—about things. And I haven't had a chance to go over and see what has been written on mine yet, but I'm fascinated to find out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[00:40:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What my—what my direct colleagues, not like my boss or other people that I teach, but people that I literally are the same level think about it. So, but I don't really—I don't know. I haven't made it a big priority to go over and look at it yet. Not because I'm embarrassed insomuch as that—I don't know. Not really sure. Because it's kind of a pain in the neck to go all the way out to Salem to find out, I guess.</p>

<p>So—[pause] [sighs] I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:41:04]</p>

<p>I guess I'm afraid of being too simple. But at the same time, I don't want to necessarily be too complicated either, you know? [Pause] but—[chuckles] [inaudible 00:41:49].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:41:49]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. But [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday. Want me to press pause for you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Thanks.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 1923-018, 1923-018, session number nine February 25, 1971, session number nine February 25th. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never seen that black tape before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the reel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No the tape.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I think that's just our (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well usually it's the light brownish or the brownish one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah yeah true maybe it is a little darker.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I supposed it doesn't make, I supposed it doesn't make any difference what color it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never seen any besides brown though. I was in a fantastic, we should have talked like this morning instead of this afternoon the mood I was in. That's the mood I'd like to be in a lot. And I, went to we had that meeting last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I was going, I was just going to sit there quietly and keep my mouth shut but we were arguing over a policy of the club and I figured this is a good time to try. First of all I just couldn't keep my mouth shut I had some important, I had some opinions about on it that it wasn't a time to practice keeping my mouth shut.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I got a little obnoxious though, because I had, we have there was this one girl who went on a ski trip who was 18 and I told you who was our, she she was she taught us how to ski but she was a good she was a good instructor. But, she was rough on those people. And, then they most of them I never said I needed to be to have Evan yell at them and stuff like that for them to learn to ski. If you don't learn to ski, you're going to kill yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean the chances are about 100 percent if you go out if you go out skiing without never taking a lesson you're going to kill yourself. And it was just one lesson that reduces by 50 percent. But she's a good teacher and these kids they want, they're not kids, they act like kids but they're not kids they want things added to them on a silver platter. And they just, and and here they are they have free instruction we take our own instructor with us. An instructor but they went up and wanted to take lessons it costs them 10 dollars for an hour, they got a free one. Do they listen to her? No they stand there and they chatted between themselves and everything and, she was just she was getting frustrated about it. And she, I don't know they didn't like the fact that first of all she was 18 and they all knew it and most of them are 22 or 23 year old or and so they're not we're not going to take her with us again. And I think it's too bad because the person that they want to take to with them I don't learn anything from when I'm trying to ski. But from her I learn. And then I didn't learn a thing. Didn't learn a thing I didn't already know. 0:03:05.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you mad to see her treated that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, oh yeah I was so mad. I'd been drinking anyway while our meeting was going on I was drinking Canadian Club which is a lot milder I usually drink bourbon, and I was drinking Canadian Club. And I wasn't mixing the drinks and the person who was mixing the drinks was mixing them rather strong and I didn't realize they were being mixed strongly because if it was a bourbon I can tell when it's strong or weak. But with Canadian Club, it could be strong, but to me it tastes like a weak bourbon, but yet it's a strong Canadian Club. And, I was getting kind of (inaudible at 0:03:46.8) I was mad. I was mad at Jesse and Jack because they, they were just being so stubborn about having her go with. I just thought it was ridiculous. But, we went to the three afterwards, so we go and I talk to Jesse remember I told you I was going to ask him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I did ask him. I, I practiced the speech and oddly enough usually if I decided what I want to say I mean I didn't practice a speech but I had an idea of what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. And usually when I start to talk those things go out the window but I was, I was clutching onto something and I figured I thought about it and this is the best way to say it. So I got halfway through my speech practically before I had to, before I just, felt stupid about it. Without asking him in the first place but I, asked him anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of pleased with yourself for going through with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I am. I really am. I was, I I wish I had been in more sane and sober state when I did it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't the number of drinks, it was combination of I think, well I had dinner so I can't (inaudible) dinner but it was, I don't know why I think it was combination of drinking those strong drinks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I only had five drinks all night and usually I can, put away five drinks before I even feel anything. But, that's regular drinks at a bar, when you get half a shot and a lot of water and a lot of ice. I wished I had been in a in a better shape to do it but I didn't know when I'd have another opportunity to talk to him. Because we're not having we're having our next meeting it's Monday next Tuesday. But I won't see him between now and then so. So I talked to him and he answered me and he answered me. He's the first guy I ever got a straight I've wanted to ask that question to a lot of guys I've gone with before and I, I have to a couple of them and never got a straight answer. But Jesse I got an honest straight answer. I really I mean he was really straight with me which is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You appreciate it. 0:06:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well definitely appreciate it. I may have pushed it too far, but I appreciated it. And he still insists that he's changed. And I said, "Now that we're not going out anymore" and he said, "Who - I never said we were never going out anymore." He said he said he said, "First of all your only one of four girls that I go out with." He says, "And second of all I have I haven't even, I have had so little money that I haven't gone with anybody since, as a matter of fact you're the last person I ever went out with, on a on a legal date." So I just, "Oh, really." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were pleased?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I didn't I didn't I don't know how I reacted but I was pretty - anyway I got kind of lit last night, I wasn't drunk but I was, I was tired. And I this morning I woke up, and I was in the, this all boils down to why we should have talked this morning - I was in a mood that I wish that I could be in more often. It's a bad attitude to have while you're at work. But, any other time it's a good attitude to have. I was I was being silly, and really enjoying it. I wasn't, I wasn't acting silly I was being silly. And I didn't realize I was doing it until all of the sudden it was about half - about [2:30 11:00 o'clock] (ph at 0:07:25.3) I all of sudden realize, it was probably because I was a little hung over. I, I, I like what happened was someplace last night through the evening I lost my mind somewhere and it took until this afternoon to find it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just, just include morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I was just, I was just, green is my favorite color and I've always wished that my car was green. But I've never seen but I like my make and model of car and I have the only car that I've ever seen, I've only seen one car, that's in the proper color green and it's a Chevy of some kind and I don't I don't I don't like Chevy. And I've never seen I have a Barracuda and I've never seen a green Barracuda. And I was walking down the street when I saw a green Barracuda. It wasn't the right shade of green but I'm standing there kind of staring at it talking to myself. If anybody had walked by, "Oh gee a green Barracuda. Wow I have never seen one of those before." Like I was talking to somebody else. So then I walked over and I looked in the windows, kind of walked away with a stupid grin on my face. All of this I realized later to me was just, (inaudible at 0:08:29.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Other times it seemed perfectly natural.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Walking down the street saying, talking to myself, "Gee I've never seen a green Barracuda before that's really nice looking." I was, I was just kind of, just, it's sort of a don't give (inaudible) attitude. If you want to do it, it feels good do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to walk up and look at that car go ahead and look at the car. Doing things at the spur of the moment just, I'm letting go. 0:09:02.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was really, I really enjoyed it. I was just kind of wandering around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't even occur to you not to let go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah I was just kind of wandering around, kind of like I was stoned or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, it was it was it was just like great I really enjoyed it. And I thought this is a bad way to be at work, because you're kind of just wandering around and, like my mind was somewhere when my body wasn't. But, when you're in situations like that your boss tends to think you've lost interest and, you don't really care. And I didn't really care this morning. But, it was bad to do that at work. But it was just such a great feeling. I just this is the way I wish I could be most of the time. Not, not responsible but just, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So loose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah loose and, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not having to have things be a certain way, right? You're not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right just, "So what. So no big deal. If this happens fine. If it doesn't happen fine." No big thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah not all torn up about it or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right you know it's no big thing. Just relax and get, but I can't do things like that, ordinarily. I don't even do that very often. It was just the greatest feeling. I'm trying to quit smoking. I have decided that, I tried to quit smoking just quitting smoking. And, and I can't just stop completely but I was probably two packs a day. And so I decided I'd drop down to ten cigarettes a day. And I started yesterday and yesterday I smoked 12. Which is just two over too. And this will be my sixth cigarette.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's really good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think if I can get it to ten, and stay there for a while and then start cutting down. It's [the ending] (ph) if I just say I stop and I can't have a cigarette, well then I'm going to get nervous. But this way I can say, "Well why don't you wait awhile. You can have ten cigarettes today, but you want to smoke them all now you can just wait awhile." And that way I know I can have it, just have to wait a little while for it. And I won't get as nervous. 0:11:55.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The reason I'm doing this is because I do enjoy smoking, but I do a lot of unconscious smoking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah where you're having no (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is where I smoke the most of my cigarettes. If I'm doing something in the evening like when I was like out last night I sitting there thinking constantly, "Don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke." I didn't even have any cigarettes with me. I purposely left them in the car when I went into the lounge. Because I knew if I was sitting in the lounge with my cigarettes I'd just forget and start and smoking. I'll sit in the lounge and I'll be smoking, I'll sit in my apartment and be doing something, and usually people when you're sewing or something like that you don't smoke because you got your hands busy. Not the kid, she lights up a cigarette sits down and continues to sew and takes one puff off of it. Watching television that's when it's really bad. You're just sitting there, propped up watching television and I'll go through five or six cigarettes in an hour just, unconsciously doesn't realize I'm smoking them. And, so that's the kind of smoking I've got to get away from because that's what really racks up your lungs. Any smoking at all is going to bad, but, so I now I just I just have to think about it and think, to wait. I'm quit proud of myself. I think at first I'm going to like, like yesterday I set a limit of ten but I smoked 12. And, like I'm going to be it's kind of like setting down rules for myself, but I can abide by them. Like if my mother was setting the rules down for me or something I'm going to, I'm going to like be a little flexible at first. If I really want one more cigarette before I go to bed, okay I'll have one more, make it 12, 11 or 12 cigarettes or 13 cigarettes. And after I've been on this maybe for about a week then I'll say, "Okay just ten, no more than ten." Because then I'll have an idea of about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About how many...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...how to space them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:14:03.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I end up with a cigarette when I want one the most in situations. On days when I'm really busy at work it's better than when days when I'm not busy. If I've got something to do if I'm just sitting around like today the only time I thought about a cigarette was when I when I all of the sudden I was through with something and I was sitting there. Waiting for something else or waiting to talk to (inaudible) or something and then all of the sudden I think, "Gee a cigarette." And, and I had to think, "No don't, don't, don't need it." It's partly for lent too. But, I tried to decide what to give up for lent. I haven't given up anything I haven't done anything for lent or given up anything for lent for years. And so I thought that it's about time I did something. And so I thought, "Well, do you want to do something or do you want to give up something?" And the first thing you think of - are you Catholic? You never were Catholic? Okay well, when you're a little kid as a Catholic you're taught you've got to give up something for lent. And you give up candy, we used to give up things we didn't like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like licorice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I loved licorice though. I used to give up chocolate because I was never a big chocolate fiend. Not like this you know we used to give up instead of giving up candy we'd give up, "Okay I'll give up chocolate candy," or "I'll give up licorice." Or getting very specific, "Okay I won't eat any Milk duds." (inaudible at 0:15:41.2). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really getting around it. Really suffering because you can't have Milk duds. But, I decided it's, I couldn't decide whether to do something, extra like, like go to church three times a week, make morning mass a couple of times a week or something like that. And I decided that this would be a good time to quit smoking try to quit smoking. And, I don't (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little something for God and a little something for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, yeah. But, I was thinking about giving up alcohol but I thought, "No, I'd rather give up the cigarettes." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, I'm not, not having cigarettes doesn't make me want to drink. But not being able to have a drink if I want one I'll smoke more cigarettes and I'd just make myself worse. This way I'm hurting myself physically less by quitting smoking then I would by quitting drinking. Even if I drink more which I doubt I will. But, I still feel kind of silly. 0:17:05.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like being a kid again or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah when I was a kid. I think it's just a great luck, I don't know if I ever went through that phase but you know how like, little kids are? The oooos and ahhhs and just walk up and pick something up and look at it, no inhibitions whatsoever at all. I think they're that way until they're about eight years old or something like that when they start loosing them. But that would be really great, to be like that. And that was sort of the way I was. Just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I, I cared about what I was doing but, I didn't okay I spilled a beaker of potassium hydroxide, not potassium hydroxide. And I'm still not sure how I did it because I was being careful, but I kind of looked at it and ordinarily I'd had gotten all upset but I kind of, "(inaudible at 0:18:04.9). Went about cleaning it up. Thinking to myself, "Gee now I wonder how I did that, silly, stupid, whatever." I was saying, "Well that was a cool move." But I wasn't really mad at myself again and all that stuff. I think I would have been more upset if Dr. Heitz was a bit upset but he didn't get upset. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I didn't get, and I and I wouldn't have probably had noticed it, it was just the reaction. My reaction is completely different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was driving to work today - another reaction - if somebody does something dumb in front of me I immediately, "MMMM". And this guy pulls out in front of me when he shouldn't have, and almost hit me. So I step on my breaks, "That wasn't very smart." And totally unscathed by all this, which is great because I get mad at myself when I do things like this. Somebody will somebody will do something a little bit, a little bit foolish but not that bad or they'll drive a little bit slow when I'm driving somebody could be going 20 plus but I want to go 25 plus...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're starting to get so furious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...yeah I'm sitting there, "Alright, come on, move it move it move it." This morning I wouldn't have. This morning I, "Okay so we'll go 20. He wants to go 20 it's alright with me. I don't really care. Just going to work, no hurry." It was great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:19:37.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just took things as they came.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not get mad at yourself or mad at other people or upset or things didn't have you didn't have to get to work right on time, didn't have to go 25 miles an hour.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It was just the greatest feeling I get mad at myself for doing things like that. For like getting mad at somebody for driving and doing something dumb. Because that's ridiculous, I mean I'm not I never say anything to other drivers I sit there and mumble, talk to myself out loud in the car, "You stupid." And it's (inaudible) me also it's not going to bother anybody else. I'm trying I'm on a self improvement program on that too, I, because the minute I do it, I realize I've done something stupid. And so I figure if I just, think about it and keep thinking, "It's stupid to get upset it's stupid to get upset." That maybe before I, if I keep saying, "It's stupid to get upset," when it happens then maybe I'll start thinking, as I'm as I'm before, before I actually say something as I'm getting upset, "It's stupid to get upset," and just psych myself out of being upset by things like that. You just slowly, like reprimanding myself then when after I'm already upset and working it back so that I can catch it as I'm getting upset and then work it back to catch it before I get upset and maybe I'll not get upset. I didn't use to be that way, I really didn't. When I was driving somebody would do something really stupid I'd, "Where did you get your driver's license out of Cracker Jack box or something." I never yelled opened the window and yelled I always just yell with all the windows up, "You stupid." But that good in a way because, yelling like that my mom gets all frustrated and nervous and everything and she wants to yell and I told her I said, "Well if there's nobody home, and you feel like yelling, yell. It's great. It gets you all adrenaline going and everything." And, she read this article about this woman who when she's really upset with her family and kids would go out and drive her car out in the middle of, drive her car down the street or something or get out in the car and close all the windows and scream. Then roll the windows back down get out and go back in the house. But it's good. But, and so like when I'm yelling at somebody else for doing something stupid it's a release and I don't stay angry. But I shouldn't be as touchy as I am. I'm very touchy I didn't used to be that touchy. I've noticed it more recently I'm becoming a lot more touchy about things like that, more easily riled. Also I'm, I'm also, more easily hurt my little things. 0:22:34.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not sure why I've changed like that. I used to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of more vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But I didn't use to be, little bit well like it used to it used to kind of hurt me, which is it's ridiculous, but Chrissie would come home from work and she'd be really upset. Now Chrissie derives great pleasure out of crying, and she can cry at the drop of a hat. And this is her release. And, she'll come home and really be, she'd seem alright to me. And we'll talk and if she has some gripes she'll tell me about them and everything and she'd call up her mother and five minutes later she's crying, on the phone to her mother. And then she comes back in and she's alright. And I kind of feel hurt that if she's got something she wants to talk about here I am, and I'm more than willing to listen to her problems and everything, but she calls her mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like to tell her serious things too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it kind of hurt me and then I realize that she can't really she can't really break down and cry in front of me but she can cry to her mother. It's a great release for her and it's a great help. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of hurts that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but it did and I realize this. But, but it just kind of hurt. I don't know maybe Chrissie and I didn't live together that long and we didn't know each other that long. She really I mean this, she'd gripe about some things but as far as a confidant knows we really didn't know each other long enough or have that kind of relationship. And, and I realized it but, and I, I realize that I shouldn't be upset but I wasn't upset and I wasn't really hurt bad or anything. But things like this sort of bother me where they wouldn't have bothered me before. Also well I used to have all kinds of like I say I used to be the, I used to have people come to me with their problems all the time which I don't have anymore. And, I used to I used to enjoy solving other people's problems or helping them. I used to enjoy people asking me for help. And, so I kind of thought, "Well gee whiz she's got all this talent she's wasting I'm sitting here she can tell me her problems." Things like that I get hurt more easily which is, I don't understand why I should wear my I think it's called wear your heart on your sleeve or something like that. A lot touchier, I'm faster to get angry about stupid things. Not big things but little things little things aggravate irritate me. And, it never happened before. And I don't think [it's me] (ph at 0:25:21.6) getting old, I feel like I'm getting old though. Because that's the kind of things that, I attribute to old people, being real picky and sort of childish about things like that. And like getting upset over, I really feel myself a flash of a flash of "ummmt". You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sort of like you're loosing your youthful flexibility. 0:25:52.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And just, it just in a situation where it really doesn't matter that much. That I don't really need to get upset. Driving can cause a beautiful example of this. But, it's kind of new and I don't understand, and I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's um, I don't know kind of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of like I'm loosing my sense of humor. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, yeah. Like you haven't got any perspective anymore or something. You don't stand back you're just in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I'm in, it's like it's like maybe the problem with this other thing is to I'm too much, I'm too much worrying about me all the time. I should just, and have lost perspective. And, should just, if I could the ideal thing would be just to quit worrying about it. Just you know forget it, don't worry about it anymore. Things are going to work out fine. But it's kind of hard to do. Yeah because in like in situations where I feel with my peers in situations like this. I mean I'm never I'm never plagued by problems by the, you know like, "How am I coming across?" What kind of impression I'm making. These things that do bother me, not being able to talk, these don't happen I mean with older people or younger people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just with people your own age.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do worry about making an impression on someone like Dr. Arrews' students or something like that. But I mean little kids and other people. I worry more, I do again I find that I worry more now than I used to. I am more uptight now than I used to be. It's like getting worse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The whole thing is like slowly getting worse. As I look, as I look back. And, it's stupid. It really is it's just stupid I don't know. I get it I don't know how to over come it I don't know how to stop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you're just sort of slipping and you can't help it. 0:28:33.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just have to catch myself when I'm doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, it's so funny it's like a vicious circle like, a perfect example of is, is when I walk into the three, and, okay I'm I don't I'm not bothered or upset when I'm going there. I mean once I get in there if Alicia is there I feel very secure for a while and then I start to worry if I don't have anything to if I'm not talking to anybody I worry, if I'm talking to somebody I worry because I don't have anything to say. I really don't I mean I really don't know what to say to these people. Well alright last there was this guy talking to Alicia and some other guy went up and asked her to dance and I was standing there so this guy started talking to me. And he's a cameraman on a film that's being made here in New York, a regular you know regular film like that you used to go to the Motion Pictures and pay an arm and a leg to see. And, and so that was kind of interesting and he was saying and I felt so, you know when he was talking about when he was talking about how it they're under they're really understaffed they've got two cameraman doing the job of five and he's working all this overtime and everything. And I'm I just think, "Gee you know that that sounds rough." Well why don't they get you know I was asking well I asked a couple questions that, "Why don't they get some more cameramen?" Because they got a tight budget. And I thought wouldn't it be cheaper to pay four cameramen or five cameramen regular salary than to pay two cameramen time and a half or double time overtime. I would think it'd be cheaper. But that's just my thoughts or something and he said he didn't know why they weren't doing it they were just on a tight budget and he was complaining about like the director and a couple you know the director was a real hard guy to work with. And, the art director was a hard guy to work with and stuff like this. And I could just sit there, I couldn't think of anything to say. I could I could to carry to further the conversation. And what usually happens is I just shut-up and so, if I'm talking to somebody I'll just not feel I have anything to say and so I won't say anything because I can't think of anything to say. And he won't say anything or she won't say anything and we just kind of sit there in total silence, fidgeting. 0:31:18.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of like, it's like every time I get in an elevator and I'm on the elevator with somebody else I want to say something to them. I think there's nothing more stupid than two people or three people riding all the way up to like the top of the Prudential Building in an elevator and nobody saying a word. And the only thing I can ever think to say about, I mean granted you're not going to get any big conversation going between the first floor and third floor of Adam (ph at 0:31:48.8), but something "Hi," "How are ya?". But you really to say "Hi, how are you?" to a perfect stranger you know the "Hi" is alright but I always feel funny just asking somebody the state of their health if I don't even know them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing I can ever think of to say is, "Isn't this beautiful weather we're having?" "Look at all this crummy weather we're having." But so if you meet that person once on the elevator the first time you meet them that's fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be quite well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be quite well between the first and third floor, you know like today I did that to somebody I'd never seen before on the elevator, "Geez this beautiful weather we're having maybe Spring is coming early, but I really doubt it." I was on the third floor, "Well bye," get off the elevator. But what do I do if I met her on the same elevator an hour and a half later, I can't say, "Nice weather we're having, isn't it?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like people your sort of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or somebody that every other day you see them on the elevator you don't really know who they are, but if I see them that often I'll say, "How are you? How are things going?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you're with people it's like all the time you're sort of waiting for the moment to come when there's that lull in the conversation and you can't think of anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right that I'm not going to have anything to say when it comes right. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:33:15.4) it's going to come sooner or later. You know "Is this it?" "No not it yet. Here it comes."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it kind of hangs over you. 0:33:27.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's what I get see it's just like I wish that I could I wish that I could just be like I was this morning. And just relax and calm and if I can't think of anything to say, fine I can't think of anything to say. If you can't think of anything to say don't say anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah wouldn't it be nice to, if you could feel like when you dropped the beaker just like, "Well, couldn't think of anything to say to that guy. Well, son of a gun."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. (inaudible due to cross talk at 0:33:57.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Maybe inspiration will hit the next one."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah not get uptight about it. I feel like I'm letting somebody down if I can't think of a conversation. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're letting them down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right, they're talking to me I should be able to think of something to say to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be able to do your part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah. And, it's all so weird but it's a vicious circle. I think if I could just relax and be kind of like I was today and just enjoy. I felt first of all I felt stupid sitting there, "Oh gee that's too bad. Oh wow gee that really that really..." you know that sounds like a dumb-dumb. But what else could you say? You're listening to someone tell a story you can't say, you're going to sit there and nod your head and act like you know listen and acknowledge the fact that you're listening and, and say, "Why don't you go home and go to bed you look tired." At which point he did. But he was really tired he was just kind of hanging over the railing kind of "ouch" he just gotten off at work and he started at 7:00 in the morning and it was like midnight. It was (inaudible at 0:35:07.7) yeah that's what's that, that's um 15 hours. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a lot of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah he did he put in about 14 hours that day. And um, I didn't bring in 14 hours in two days. What was I - oh yeah - if I could just relax. But if could if I could be like that you know I'd be relaxed. But if I could relax then I wouldn't have to, I mean I thought I was going to say a few minutes ago I sounded a lot more intelligent. If I could just, relax with those people, and not really, go in there with the attitude, "Well, gee if you like me I'll just be happy about it and if you don't like me, that's too bad." Not a cocky attitude, not a cocky attitude, "If you like me fine if you don't like me fine." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not cocky but just so, and not it's not a cocky attitude and it's not a, it's not a cocky, "I don't care," and it's not an, "I don't care, I really don't care whether you like me or not," it's just a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have to have you like me. 0:36:31.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Just casual you know just a casual. And relax and not worry about it and just take things as they come if things get dull they get dull. So go someplace else and find something else to do. If things are dull there leave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah so things are dull sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I could just relax and just have that kind attitude...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you actually...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in my heart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If you could just slip into it the way you slipped into it this morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think I think things would be 100 percent better. It just, I don't know part of it could, part of the reason I get so uptight fast is it can be my nerves because slowly as I'm coming older getting more nervous. But it's not all nerves. This fidgety and jumpiness is nerves. And which put me on edge more which makes me like, "I'm on edge" and so then I'll get more upset with little things like with driving. I don't think nerves had anything to do with like being hurt like with Chrissie or something like that. Little things like that. I mean these are all insignificant little things that that, that I notice, that I think about. That a couple of years ago would have "fffttt" you know gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gone over your head yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either just gone over my head or past me or something and I would never notice them and they would never bother me, I never would have thought of them. But, if I could just quit worrying about myself and get out of myself and in to something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah where you didn't have to be so fussy about things too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That quit worrying about me. and other people, and how I relate to other people. Because I've known this a long time this is what I do I just quit this is how. If I could like take the affectation in my mind of this attitude, I'm putting something on - but we were I was talking about before like putting something on like an act is no good - but I'm wondering if maybe trying to assume this mental attitude would help. Trying to assume the mental attitude that that, "Well it doesn't really matter". And then I'll start telling myself well I don't have a boyfriend and it does really matter and I am going to (inaudible at 0:39:14.3) and I don't want to me and it is going to matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that's serious. 0:39:18.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, it's just if I don't know if that would work or not. It's not, it's, effecting you know taking on a mental attitude which is not the same as, like pretending. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know if it would work or not, but it's worth a try. Just keep telling myself, "It doesn't really matter." It's like, on the Andy William's (ph) Show they had they were doing this one thing, "In 100 years in 100 years what difference will it make?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't really matter. What does it really matter what does...maybe if I just keep telling myself that like, "Don't get mad, what does it really matter? How important is it?" Like I say I'm going I'm going to have a battle with myself saying, "Well it's very important." Or "What am I going to do about it? How am I going to change it?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, and I don't I don't want to also take the attitude, which is something else I know that I'm like something to with is effective taking on this attitude is going to make everything right. And once I have this relaxed attitude men are just going to flock to my arms, right? Which is not going to happen either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's not going to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm not so uptight and a little more relaxed I, if I can, if nothing else if I can gradually make myself more relaxed I may be able to see something I can't see now. But, because I'm going no where. You know I'm just running around in little circles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of running in circles yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worrying about getting any more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah I mean and not really there's nothing really that you know, unless I went and got myself hypnotized or something I really think there's nothing that can be done. I mean you can't you can't say, "Well listen to this and this and this and your problems are over." Or even, "Think about this and this and this and see what" you know there's really nothing that can be done. Positive mental attitude. I mean I got to read that book The Power of Positive Thinking. My mother has that book I've never read it. You ever read it? 0:41:56.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Norman Vincent Peale I think it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah The Power of Positive Thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know what it was about. About positive thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I went (ph). Affect my mind. Well I'm going to try it out tomorrow night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying getting yourself into a relaxed...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to try it out tonight. No I'm going to try I'm going to start I'm going to try it out tonight, "It doesn't really matter." Just trying to, I don't know just telling myself it doesn't ever actually work but the idea to feel it, "Does it really matter? It's not that important."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah the feeling of sort of seeing it more in perspective and calmly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like your fate isn't going to be decided tonight or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah. That uh, I see. I really want a cigarette bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of the sudden I really need one. It's like it like, well today the attitude that I had, was you know "No problems. No problems." If I wanted to do it I did it and if I didn't want to do it I didn't do it unless I had to. Just kind of like well totally it's almost total obviation of anything. Like just walking up to the car and looking at it I wouldn't have never I probably would have never done it before because I would have thought I would have stood on the sidewalk. I wouldn't have walked over and looked in the windows and everything because I would be afraid some cop is going to come along and tap me on shoulder and say, "What are you trying to do steal that car?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, because that was like a kid going over and picking something up almost just doing the natural thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah just, you feel like doing it do it don't worry about anything else. And, I don't get I, - ana adab aba daba I have a speech impediment - I'm trying to I don't want to just say to myself it doesn't really matter. I'm trying to organize in my mind a better way of looking at it than just saying, "It doesn't really matter." Because it might matter I don't want to, I really don't want to be a person who, if it works I don't want to be a person who goes around in my life thinking nothing really matters. 0:44:50.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, that's not exactly what I'm thinking but that's what I'm saying and I could get confused. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you're looking to find something to say that better captures what you're thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something for a calming influence on myself to make myself stop and think right then. And something sort and sweet that I could I don't have to really stop and think about but I'll just associate and have a feeling for and I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing is definite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't like that either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like, "Well it's okay I can mess this one up."</p>

<p>PATIENT: "100 years from now who will know." No it's like, if you have never suppressed a nerve, you want to do it, look assuming it's not illegal or anything like that, if you feel like doing it do it. If you want to do it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's certainly okay to do what you feel like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, "If you want to do it do it. If you don't want to do it don't do it." Like a lot of times if I don't want to do something I won't do it but if I want to do it I might not. But, nobody ever made me do anything I didn't want to do. I've got that one down. Not since I've been bigger anyway. When I was little I had to submit a couple of times. But...just "If you want to do it do it. If you don't want to do it don't do it." And don't look on anything as being anything everything is sort of transy nothing is really permanent. And, I don't know it's just not that important. Not that important as in as in to get uptight about. It's not important enough to get uptight about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 0:47:23.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: That in itself may be important enough but what difference is it going to make whether you get uptight or not. Be totally selfish about it. Now whose also that we're worry about mine or his or hers right? It's not important enough to sacrifice your physical health for. It's going to be hard to do though. But I just keep thinking I keep thinking because my doubts in my mind when I'm talking about this go back to a social situation, like in, so what good's it going to do? I keep myself this as I'm saying these things. "So what good's it going to do if I do this? Is it going to do any good at all?" No it won't do any good at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you don't have any faith that like you'll...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'll have to wait and see right? Right. So we'll see it's not that I'm, yeah it's no faith. But, it's just you know I just, what good's it going to do? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it can't do any harm. It certainly reduce my blood pressure. So it can't do any harm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's worth a try.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah at least it's not negative. It may not be positive but it's not negative. So, I am too socially minded anyway. Probably I think more socially minded because of the fact that I'm not that socially adept and have not been exposed to social situations that much that I would be if I had. I mean like been around men, dated since I, dated in high school a lot and went to proms and stuff like this, and was used to getting along with men. I would not be as worried about it. It would be not so much of a problem. But I'm more worried about social situations because I place a high priority on them. I place a higher priority because they were denied to me earlier when everybody else was getting them so now that I can just go seek my social enjoyments wherever I want to I, I get uptight about it. And it's also - I just have to think of something I was talking before about this feeling we discussed way long ago the fact that that one of the reasons I've always felt on the outside is because I kind of feel like I'm different because I'm adopted. 0:49:51.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was wondering as I was thinking I was still wondering what all this has got to do if the two are enjoined at all. Because I can not I've always felt special because I was adopted or I've always told myself I felt special because I was adopted. Now I now I have to say I've always said, because I've never really felt one way or other. I mean actually feeling it. I've never really felt really special. Well I never really felt un-special or ordinary but you know. But, I don't have the feeling like I don't have the feeling that that was like my feeling of loneliness. I remember like I have vivid pictures of sitting in the cafeteria downstairs and in the Catholic school where I was in first in first grade by myself eating lunch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and all by yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right with all these other kids around and I had to sit by myself and eat because I didn't know anybody. I remember just like being on the outside looking in every since then and I don't think that had anything to do with the fact that, that I was adopted. Little kids like that adopted, if I even knew it or I said it to somebody else it didn't make any difference. And, I really don't understand if that has anything to do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it isn't that you were adopted but then it makes you hard to understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I can, well I don't really understand if it's because I'm adopted unless that's why I feel strange subconsciously I really feel strange about it. And it does maybe subconsciously it does bother me, a little bit. And anything that amplifies this feeling of being on the outside. But like this feeling that I got it's not just I mean it's not, I have never had the feeling that I, that I've guaranteed that it's not just a figment of my imagination. It really isn't. It really exists. 0:52:24.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feeling is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The feeling of being on the outside most of the time looking in and not really being in on things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This attitude that people have towards me, "She's a nice kid" "The world would get along fine with her and fine without her." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like that's the way it is that's the way people feel about you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right this is the way people basically feel about me. Like I said before I don't I don't, pull out of anybody any really very few people, I've got some people who really like me but I mean most people I meet on average, now I suppose that everybody now I meet people everyday who I like as a person and that's it. Fine they didn't offend me they didn't really surprise me. There are few very people that I really really like. And I could be wanting more than I'm getting. I mean more than I should get more than that's my right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying out the idea now that like maybe that's the way it is, maybe nobody is special to more than a few people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I guess it's, there's just these few people that everybody really likes that may be me. But majority of the people aren't that way. And I'm a normal people, sort of. And I don't know why, it bugs me when people just like me. I don't know why. I should be happy that they like me. But I have this feeling down deep in my heart that I am Susan Miller therefore I am special and an individual and everybody should just be crazy about me and nobody is and what's the matter?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's not okay to be one of the normal people. Like you want to be one of the special people that everyone says, "Oh yes Susan Miller come on."</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and it's ridiculous. It's just it's just not everybody is not made that way. There's chiefs and there's Indians and I'm an Indian. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow an Indian who'd kind of like to be a chief.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah kind of like to be special. Kind of like to be, you know, I don't know reinforced. I just want people to like me and I want people to like me a lot and I want I want to be loved by everybody. And I need a reinforcing feeling. This is there is also an enforcing feeling that, that I do exist and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like it would be really different to walk around feeling like, like the whole bunch of people around you really sort of actively like you as opposed to tolerated you. 0:55:12.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Well I don't have a feeling they tolerate me I have a feeling they like me they just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah they like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they just like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm trying to psych myself into the fact that, "Well, look, just be nice to everybody and everybody will like you. And that's all you really want. You don't want everybody to love you. You just don't you don't want nobody to hate, you want to be hated by no one." And it's, I think it's commendable that I don't really clash personalities with anybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm um hmm. That part of you really like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm telling myself that right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, it's like yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I'd say I would be happy if somebody just didn't like me. Just so I knew that somebody had, I could evoke a strong feeling but it, but I'm changing my feeling. See I'm psyching myself. Trying to anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're telling yourself you like it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Well looking at it from a different angle that that, that there are very few people who walk around and who do not, they get along with everybody. And I get along with everybody. And there's very few people who can get along with everybody. So, I can get along with everybody, see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't sound like you quite believe that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm working on it. At least I've thought of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I have to write all these things down that I say so I can be (inaudible at 0:56:51.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they just come to me and they leave. I think I can remember most of this stuff. Remember my attitude.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right your morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your morning...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think if I remember if I just remember...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being very (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...this morning it will help. And I'll just walk around remembering this morning. And remembering the way I felt. And if I can just like kind of affect this, take this mind you know. And this kind of this kind of a feeling you just can't play act you got to really do. I can play act it but it wouldn't be, now I can play act some things but, if I wanted to different affectations but this one is not going to be fun unless I really do it. It's not going to be fun for me unless I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it has to be a real mental attitude.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and that's the only way it is going to be fun, because I was having fun. I told you the difference between having a good time and having fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh right, oh yeah. And that's was having fun. 0:57:58.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was having fun. I really was. I was just, I was being silly I was telling jokes. They were bad jokes, nobody laughed but I thought it was funny. I do that a lot I try to be funny. Sometimes I am sometimes I'm not. Again I'm a lot funnier around older people than I am, just normally. I can sit there and not tell jokes like regular jokes, like monologues and stuff like that. Just the things I say and the way I tell my stories or something, do a lot better with older people. I crack my parents up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're a lot looser around them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really do. I really crack them up. Plus they're biased. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They'd probably laugh before anybody else would. I've got one friend I never tell jokes to, because she's always heard them. Either that or she figures out the figures out the punch line she doesn't laugh she just kind of sits there. I never tell her a joke because that's very depressing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 9:00 o'clock on Tuesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh is it that time already?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Son of a gun. Fine, 9:00 o'clock on Tuesday. Dr. Arrews is going out of town Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Dr. Arrews is going out of town Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [So I'm going to have fun] (ph at 0:59:19.1) more free times, here's one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whoops, this doesn't march.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I got a meeting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A ski club meeting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. We had a, there was a we had an officer meeting last night where I was arguing with everybody in the house. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really it was really funny I don't usually argue with people but I was, I had I had argued with Liv.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a bunch of things coming up in the same week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Oh boy, I only have an hour to explain this to you. Sunday—Sunday I was on a bus in which it appeared that there was a person with gun. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And having looked over—I didn't know he didn't not have a gun. Having looked over the police report online now, the BB gun that he had is extremely, extremely realistic looking. I didn't know that they made them that looked realistic anymore, but apparently they do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He had been arrested for a couple of other things too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was extremely stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This guy was on the bus. It was like a moderately full bus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He just started going randomly through all of his stuff. He had the most bizarre things. And then he pulled out what looked like a handgun and started playing with the safety. So I was behind him and sort of diagonal. And I was really very panicked, because it just seemed—I mean he was exhibiting a lot of other very, very bizarre behavior. </p>

<p>[0:01:09.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I sitting there using my iPad, so I discreetly took a picture of it. I got to the front part of the bus and said, "Bus driver, I need to get off. And by the way there's a guy back there. I think he has a gun," very quietly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people apparently had also noticed that. So when the bus stopped everybody got off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Long story short, he's been arrested. Et cetera, et cetera. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Outstanding warrants, whatever. I didn't know anything about this stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not appreciate that the newspaper printed that I hid in the bushes. Because—it is true I hid in the bushes, because he got off the bus too. But I don't know—it's like that, that, that part of my dignity was not something I really wanted...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like with your name?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But fact of the matter is that it was not a high point of my dignity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you were afraid of getting shot by a guy who was acting bizarrely with a gun. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:01:58.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course, like after that point, I'm stranded in the middle of town. I have no idea where I am, blah, blah, blah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. There's just been shootings in the news. [inaudible [00:02:07].9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And another bus also had somebody who had a real gun. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently. So, whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was Sunday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was Sunday. Yeah. Monday I ended up at the hospital with my husband. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He'd been complaining about his back problems, this and that. By 10 pm I had to go across the street to get the neighbor to help pick him up so we could drive him to the hospital. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. How did you get him there? Cab?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. The neighbor drove him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah we've got this really sweet Welsh couple—she's just very big—very wily (ph? [0:02:48.9) and very strong to be able to pick him up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Got him in the car and took him over to the hospital. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of lots of reasons they originally thought it might have been that he had a herniated disc. So it took them a while to get to the kidney thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's got several kidney stones. Soon as they figured that part out, they actually put him on morphine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This and that—that kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I mean. I know that kidney stones are, can be, incredibly painful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess they can dangerously block things up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if they've found them then you're probably pretty safe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're treatable. </p>

<p>[0:03:31.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's passed one now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But they're probably going to have to do some ultrasound to break them up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But they need the thingy (ph? [0:03:40.7) to have one of them because there are different types of them and some of them indicate other things that are important to know. Especially because one of the medications he's taking potentially causes kidney stones. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But we don't think it's that one. But [inaudible [00:03:56].4] week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:03:56].4]...that's the case. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But they needed to do it. It's very disturbing looking. It looks like something out of a medieval torture—seriously like spiky and everything, the stone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Disturbing. Really disturbing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought you said they were tiny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one was four millimeters. But it's spiky. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I thought something [inaudible [00:04:17].5] in your kidneys. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Four millimeters is pretty big to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's got other ones, so they'll have to probably break them up. We'll see. But the big thing that was very stressful about the whole things was—is that (pause) them not really understanding what was going...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:04:40].7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So—and because of that there could be infections, which the antibiotic can cause damage. </p>

<p>[0:04:49.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, all that. So they've got him extremely doped up right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he—how long did he stay in the hospital?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Twelve hours. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so he's home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's home. (pause) And hopefully soon he'll be back to work because he—this has kind of screwed up a big week for him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But so—yeah. That was Tuesday. I slept through most of Tuesday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday I went to the, what's it called, rheumatologist who wants to get me back on some seriously hardcore—well hardcore for RA, chemotherapy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They use very low-dose chemotherapy for RA along with other types, because of the fact that I'm presenting with other types of autoimmune symptoms. She doesn't want to play the game of, "Well, this is the drug for lupus, and this is the drug for RA"—the Methotrexate in higher doses can handle both for all these other things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have lupus?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have lupus-like symptoms. </p>

<p>[0:06:00.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've had organ (pause) problems that are similar to lupus. I've had nerve problems that are similar to MS. So it's like—it's really—I do have several autoimmune diseases already. Even though they're little ones, like I have Hashimoto's, which is autoimmune of the thyroid. I have Sjogren's, which is autoimmune, certain types of tear and salivary gland. I have a bunch of little ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So once you start having like more than two or three, you can cross over a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And you'll have like bouts of psoriasis or bouts of whatever. And so she just wants to start back up on that. And I really don't like the stuff. I mean, you don't lose a whole lot of hair, but it isn't pleasant. I'm very sensitive to it, and it makes me [inaudible [00:06:56].4] sweat, shake the days that I get it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to go on it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not a bit. There's a lot of lifestyle changes I have to make in my life to be able to go back on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I can have no alcohol, whatsoever. Because it's not going to get you drunk faster, it's that it makes you a candidate for a liver transplant. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this stuff is poison. It's an anti-metabolite. It keeps your cells from being able to divide properly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's extremely hard on your liver. And even in small doses it's hard on your liver. And so you can't drink at all, which no big—I mean yes and no, but then you have to start playing the game of getting cough syrup that doesn't have alcohol in it. And you have to go get mouthwash that doesn't have alcohol in it. And you have to start being really careful because you get sores in your mouth when you do it. So often when you get it, you eat popsicles for that day. It's—it's a lifestyle change. </p>

<p>[0:08:08.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's going to be a higher dose than I've had in the past at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are going to agree to do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's—things are getting out of control again. I don't want another joint replacement. I don't want another something happening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so that's—this is, in your terms, the hopeful benefit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is to prevent it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, something. I mean, my immune system is very high. I have a lot of aches and pains and a lot of other things. They do not know where it's presenting itself right now. But if we can calm it down before it becomes obvious enough to really figure it out. I just feel miserable, but they haven't exactly figured out what's being attacked yet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I—in this way that I feel kind of bad about being like this, I kind of want to wait until September first to start. So I could be able to do some of the fun things I've wanted to do, like going to a wine tasting, or this or that. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>[0:09:16.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like things that kind of—having a life. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I can just plan to do that for a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, being able to—I already burn really fast. The big problem with this though, especially when you take these combination of drugs together, is it quells you body's ability to see cancer. Because that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a whole bunch of different pieces of—I'm talking about mostly the Methotrexate. But the other part of it, the Enbrel, what it does is it calms your body's ability to see things that don't look right and kill them. So it's not a matter of if you will get cancer, but when. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And so the reunion (ph? Inaudible [0:10:02.4) that is to stop your immune system attacking your own cells, but that also makes them less able to attack things like precancerous cells. </p>

<p>[0:10:14.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So like you can't be in the sun very much at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It becomes, you know—I own a convertible. I already now use 50 sun block, that kind of thing. I don't want to have to really worry about this kind of stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I already get multiple shots per week. Really don't want any more injections. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the kind of thing you do in the hospital and sit there for hours?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank God, no. Actually there is an injectable version that you can get. Unfortunately at the moment there is actually a shortage in it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So getting the injectable version is very hard to get your hands on right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you want it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean, yes, maybe. The only reason why is because it won't make me so sick to my stomach </p>

<p>[0:11:08.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But knowing that the—because it's the first-line drug for childhood leukemia. I'd rather have kids that have leukemia get it first just so they can not feel so queasy. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I understand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially when there's a shortage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So does this mean you have to get regular CAT scans as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You get regular—there's actually blood markers often when this happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So you get a lot of blood tests. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Occasionally—I mean I do get regular x-rays in general to see if the joints are doing okay. Especially these two, because there's a chance of the artificial parts setting off the immune system as well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>[0:11:51.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even normal people have that problem with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a rejection. </p>

<p>CLIENT: A rejection and it happens all the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But having to take a day in which I am completely and totally miserable once per week, I remember this, and it was—it was a lot. You know? It was a lot to deal with. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also imagine this (pause) kills the prospect of working more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm going to still work more. I'm just going to schedule this for Wednesdays. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm working longer days right now on Sundays and Mondays. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday is a half day right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I schedule it for Wednesday, I think it will be okay. That way I'll have the rest of the week to get back up quasi to normal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—(pause) you lose a little bit of hair. I've got a lot of hair. So it's not really a big deal. I've had this happen before. That kind of stuff. But there's just like all of these little things that make it very unpleasant. </p>

<p>Once you start having Methotrexate, there's a lot of things that become a lot more complicated. It's also fascinatingly enough used in many countries around the world for abortions, as a chemical abortion method. So of course they want you to be very much on birth control and all this other stuff</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's extremely bad to have in your system. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I just (pause) I know it's the right thing to do. She's going to see me in just a couple of weeks and see what's going on with it. It just—now it's just one more thing I have to deal with though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's not just one more thing you have to deal with. It's a whole bunch more things. </p>

<p>[0:13:57.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it a whole bunch more. It makes everything slightly more complicated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are multiple drugs that you take to be able to make sure that this drug works properly. Like for example, then I end up taking Zofran, which is used for chemotherapy for anti-nausea. And then, because of the fact that it screws with the way that you metabolize B2, I think, I end up taking very high dose of B2. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just becomes like a, you know—(exhale)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You play with this avalanche of having to take all these things to make sure that the other thing is okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's not something I'm really looking forward to. But I guess, you know. The worst part is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It takes away time. Adds a lot of pain and discomfort and also adds restrictions. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It also tends to have a lot of brain fog. Everyone says, "Look, it's poison."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes it so the cells can't divide. So (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How foggy are you likely to get?</p>

<p>[0:15:13.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I've already been pretty foggy over the past—today has been not so bad, but yesterday was terrible. It depends. Usually, in the past—apparently they don't do this anymore—in the past, I had a doctor who would actually give me sleeping pills so I'd sleep through it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you mean, day of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I would be foggy anyways because I'd just been given whatever it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They apparently don't do that anymore. For lots of reasons, one of which is, I guess that you're sleeping through side effects that are dangerous. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know how foggy it's going to be, but we'll see. (pause) And this is not—unfortunately it's not like with cancer where you can say, "Okay this is going to be a 12 week round."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just wondering, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are people doing it for the rest of their lives like this. I don't want to be like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. And I mean you're able to take medication holidays. Like if I was going to Italy, I could go off of it for a while. Sort of. But (pause/sigh) it kind of gets the spontaneity out of one's life. You know? Dawn (ph?[0:16:33.7)</p>

<p>[0:16:33.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I imagine it makes it harder to travel, you know [inaudible [00:16:39].3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It'll depend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I'm going to [inaudible [00:16:44].8] they won't do it. I will travel with the Enbrel though, because even—which I've been taking the whole time anyways. I've sort of gotten down the ability—I've sort of gotten the whole rhythm down of being able to take needles through the airport.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's not so big of a deal. That used to be hard. If I get them daily, they have like four different formulations. If I get the prefilled syringes that are wrapped, they actually don't have a problem. But if I have a bottle with a bunch of syringes, they don't like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[0:17:15.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just all the time get the prefilled ones so I don't have to worry about it. Because if it's part of—if it's engraved on the side of the syringe then they don't—they usually let it through. (pause) It's just—it's just a lot to have to deal with, you know? (sigh) But, if it's been independently very stressful, Sunday night was extremely stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's been sort of in the back of my head for a while now. Just because of being slightly fearful that I may get harassed by this person in the future. I don't necessarily know if he knows who I am or anything like that. (pause) But at the same time I really (pause) you know...</p>

<p>[0:18:18.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a way he could know who you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He—possibly (pause) In the paper, which I doubt he reads, it said that there was a woman who took a picture of him, you know, using an iPad. But the article also says a lot of things that are incorrect in it too. (pause) </p>

<p>So it's possible. (pause) I just would rather not—I would rather not have to worry about the fear of it for a little bit. I know that he's going to be at least in jail for a little bit because he had a couple of bench warrants already out from when—he did actually have real ammunition too or something too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[0:19:09.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He'll be in there for a little bit. I just don't need (pause). It is a legitimate fear, you know? I find it creepy that there is a person who was doing—it was obvious that—no one pulls out even a like a BB pistol and starts playing around with it without trying to intimidate people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So at that point you sort of have to wonder how much rational thought is going to get you in terms of that kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Have you had any nightmares?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I fortunately—all of my nightmares—all of dreams unfortunately have about a five-year lag. So I haven't even gotten here in my dreams yet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:19:58.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not really sure why, but everything seems to be like five years behind. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I haven't gotten that far yet. I have had a lot of being too nervous to sleep. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have taken a different bus entirely a couple of times. Which isn't always possible, but you know. (pause) But it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you hyper-vigilant? Are you kind of looking around a lot more carefully now? Are you startled more easily?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just more anxious. I was definitely not being—I've been that way for certain things before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But not this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Which is good. Just not being able to calm down enough. I have a lot of adrenaline going on in my body some times that I can't calm down enough to be able to sleep or to even sit still especially well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Dave has been very good about this, even though he has been not feeling well. He's like, "Do you know what you need? You need to belittle somebody. Let's throw in 'Breaking Bad' and let you make fun of the chemistry." I'm like, "Okay, sure." Which, by the way, everything about it is so, so wrong. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I know a lot about meth, but I do know a lot about chemistry and procedures and stuff like that. And they're not doing it very well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Sure. They screw it up. </p>

<p>[0:21:36.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They screw it up, badly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, it was actually very helpful because playing "pick out the person who is making thermite (ph?[0:21:49.6) wrong" (pause) it got me distracted enough to laugh about it. (pause) It's one of the things I just adore about him...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:...is that he usually picks up on this kind of stuff, and if he's sober, he is so good at that. The whole thing of, "Let's find something to distract you with that's going to make you laugh and also just switch the way you're thinking,"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just love that a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's definitely helpful. (pause) But it's been really, really, really stressful lately, especially because I already started my longer hours too on top of all this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're doing longer hours Sunday, Monday and then half-day Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it, 20 or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something like that. </p>

<p>[0:22:56.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been sort of odd because one of the Sundays already we had like a 12 hour day. Because it was like a long day and then we had a meeting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But this Sunday it's going to be even weirder because it's tax free. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm going to be working until at least 8 p.m.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. How have you been holding up with the longer day? This week's obviously pretty exceptional. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been harder. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just keep trying to focus on making the money and trying to get things done, sort of what's in front of me. And just keep going, you know? There's only so much you can do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a little bit easier in the past because I am sitting for a good bit of it. Not all of it, but a good bit of it. (pause) Like I said, I guess I'll just see how Sunday happens. I'm just surprised I'm not assigned to working Saturday. </p>

<p>One of my bosses who is very much in terms—is very pro work-life balance is not—is the person who is involved with things related to schedules. She's been really trying to push toward getting people to get their vacation time, or whatever. She's trying to get almost all of us, if we're not ready to get vacation because you want to save your vacation, to take a couple of four day weeks, instead of five day for full time. </p>

<p>So I think that's part of the reason why there's not going to be the insane scheduling for tax free this week. I think it may be a problem though because we might be short staffed which might make it even more stressful. I don't know. (pause) But that's kind of what I've been up to lately. </p>

<p>[0:25:11.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are the other—I mean (pause) clearly some of the way that this week has affected you from Sunday are the difficulty sleeping, feeling more anxious, especially more anxious on the bus. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sleeping. On the bus I haven't been because the bus I've been taking lately is primarily commuter. It is [inaudible [00:25:44].3] It only runs a couple of times a day. That's what I've been taking instead. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that. I don't' have to worry about being hyper-vigilant because it's all people who work in the computer industry.  [0:26:00.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aside from like pulling out an old copy of Windows or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's even—they're actually more hip than that even. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they have like a strange behavior too. They've informally decided that the back of the bus is the quiet area. They'll let you know. [inaudible [00:26:18].1] It's really weird, but kind of cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They've sort of built their own little government—society of thing there. That one isn't so bad. It's most that I'm sleeping too much or feeling jittery. Not so much hyper-vigilant as I've been hyper-vigilant taking care of everything else around me. This is more of I am still in crisis mode, and I don't know what to do with this energy and can't make it stop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>[0:26:50.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And that's from everything this week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) tell me about that kind of crisis mode. What does that involve?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:27:09].2] Oh gosh. I don't know. Usually it is—it involves behaving like I'm acting very calmly, on the outside but on the inside having to manage all the things that I might need to do or might be happening around me. (pause) </p>

<p>When there's no danger, it doesn't make any sense. It's really frustrating because it's not like it's anything—all I do is just sit around feeling jittery like I've had way too much caffeine or something like that. You know? </p>

<p>And when there's a crisis I usually try to spend the time thinking of lists of things I need to ask, things I need to do, basically things I need to be able to handle situations. Like when Dave was in the hospital, all the things I needed to be able to talk to the doctor about, that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that, though it's not what you were feeling at the time, you were really scared for him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:28:21.9]</p>

<p>I was scared for him. And so being able to just stay calm enough to go and get a neighbor to help get him off the floor. That's something where everyone's like "Wow that's such a great idea." I'm like, "What else would I do?" Doing that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>[0:28:41.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like you can think pretty clearly during the crisis. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what you described with handling the situation on the bus. You really were able to intercede. I guess the fall out seems to [inaudible [00:29:04].8] be more that there's a like staying very activated and not being able to just settle down. [inaudible [00:29:14].2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When there isn't something to do, it takes a long time for me to get out of that. Not- if there's one crisis, usually it's a few hours [inaudible [00:29:26].7]. But the fact that it's been like every time I've relaxed it's gotten a little bit worse, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes it harder. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I feel like a bunch of other things that were slightly more (sigh) as if we hadn't had a bad week, it probably would have made it to the top five, but they really didn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah </p>

<p>[0:29:55.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:29:58].7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deciding that—like trying to figure out for a movie. [inaudible [00:30:08].9] Going to a website that says like "The Top 5 Classic Movies" and finding out that one of them actually is about being chronically depressed, is extremely depressing. Not [inaudible [00:30:22].8] at all but very depressing. That kind of thing it's like—yep. At the point, which—we cut it off in the middle because it was just like, "You know what? No more of this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. That's what you were watching. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What movie was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Last Tango in Paris"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The old one or the new one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The old one. There's a new one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought so. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, It could be. </p>

<p>[0:30:43.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's the Marlon Brando one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The Marlon Brando one, it's supposed to be a classic date movie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's really depressing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Extremely depressing. Yeah. Marlon Brando's wife kills herself, and this girl who was like depressed about her life and was molested by her father, the two of them get together in this apartment. </p>

<p>While they're in the apartment they wind up being [inaudible [00:31:04].4] but they never talk about their names or anything. Like this was not romantic in any way to me. But I didn't know what it was about because it was before I was born. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a classic movie. And it's in French so it's also—like with subtitles. So at first you're like, "Well, maybe this is, weird dark French cinema," No, no, no this is not romantic at all </p>

<p>[0:31:23.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This is creepy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Things like that. That puts you in a weird mood for quite a long time after watching this extremely dark film about that. (pause) Just things like that going on all week. Nothing big, just (pause) you know problems. </p>

<p>My dog has kennel cough. She shouldn't have kennel cough because she's been vaccinated for it, but then we find out that they vaccinated for the virus of it and she just has the bacteria of it. Just stuff like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There would be a lot more worrisome except for the fact that there have been a lot more pressing matters. But they still are there. Therefore you have to kind of deal with it. You know? (pause) </p>

<p>I just feel like I really need to find a way to just completely turn myself off for a little bit and just reboot. I don't' really—I've never really had a good way of doing that, and I especially don't know how to do it now. Everything I've done is really not been all that successful (pause).</p>

<p>[0:32:37.9]</p>

<p>I just want to be able to turn everything off, be able to go out for some light pleasant conversation, you know? I want—(pause)—I want to have some fun. I don't want to think about this stuff for a while, you know? Which is why when picking classic movie for date night was originally planned on that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I think that much like—there's a lot of movies that that people think are really great. But if you're already kind of depressed, they're kind of bad. Because I seem to remember "The Graduate" was like that too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Isn't that that classic movie where like somebody's depressed and therefore they do really screw up things? And if you're not depressed, outside of it, it's an interesting, fascinating look on the world of people. But if you're already kind of depressed, it is not in any way good for that, you know? So. I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:33:49.7]</p>

<p>I just—I just needed to have a period of time where I can sort of leave my troubles behind a little bit. You know? (pause) That's why I've actually—even in the middle of all this I'm still trying to go to Australia. I have—my friend who lives in Australia is going to be there between now and the end of the year. (pause) And he's put up in the Four Seasons, so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so he's totally okay with me coming and visiting. Dave can come too. I talked to Dave about this and he's—he's jealous, but not like—jealous in a way that like is completely normal. Like, "Oh I really would like to go too, but maybe I just need some time on my own to do it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:34:39.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has no concern for lots of reasons including the fact that Kevin (ph? [0:34:48.3) is gay. No concern about me running off with anybody like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not only is Kevin gay, but we both went to his wedding. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We've known each other for—he knows him well, that kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like obviously if somebody in your life is going and you had the opportunity to go, you'd be a little bit jealous. I'm trying to figure out a way to make that work. I'm trying to combine a bunch of different frequent flyer miles and see if I can do it. Because I just feel like I need some time away. And I've never been very good at that. As long as I am close by—I need to force myself to not be able to deal with the problems at hand. </p>

<p>[0:35:29.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. Yeah you tend to feel very responsible for (pause) lots of things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like if I were to do something like go up to Canada, I probably would be trying to still balance my checkbook, and you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I just need to get away for a bit. And I think that my ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: December, if I can get the time off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's significantly cheaper in the number of frequently flyer miles. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have a feeling that he is going to be more lonely because he's going to be away from his partner and the United States and everything like that on the holidays. It would be a comfort to him. For me it would be fun. You know? We'll see. I don't know, maybe closer to New Years. We'll see. </p>

<p>[0:36:23.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But in the meantime, I've got to find something before that to do it. Because I can't just say, "Okay in six months I'm going to be able to calm down." </p>

<p>I used to be like that. I used to be like, "Okay, I've scheduled between seven and eight on the 31st of October to relax." But I can't do that right now. I just (pause).</p>

<p>It is destroying, not just my psyche, but my physical body and the relationships that I have around people, because I'm not as good at hiding it when I'm stressed out anymore. I'm not as good at communicating. I just have to break at some you know? Just (pause) I've got to figure to something. We'll see what I can do. </p>

<p>[0:37:13.3]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I just need to have a little bit of fun. (pause) That's pretty much, yeah, my screwed up week (snort laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (pause). Yeah. (pause) It's not that it's hard to talk about, as much as the fact that I still haven't really processed most of the information such that I actually have anything...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to talk about yet. I sort of have a very delayed action on this kind of stuff. </p>

<p>(pause) </p>

<p>[0:38:29.3]</p>

<p>I expect that I'll be more distraught next week about the—now I'm just talking to you about concerns about being able to have fun and that kind of thing in a very obscure way. By next week I'll probably be more upset about the whole thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) So. And—I'm just hoping to forget about most of this stuff because I just (pause) it's just more than I can really handle, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:39:13.2]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, you certainly sound to be overwhelmed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Yeah I—I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. (pause).</p>

<p>I think this is about the time I normally leave isn't it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I ran a couple of minutes late. (pause) [inaudible [00:40:24].0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's talk schedule. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I can definitely make it Tuesday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay good do you want me [inaudible [00:40:30].3]</p>

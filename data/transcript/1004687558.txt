<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Pretty well, thanks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Mm. [You changed] (ph) the position of the chair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did? Oh, somebody may have just thought it was skootched it a little differently than...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Skootch or move it if you like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. [Sighs] I hate this [whispers] commute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It [whispers] sucks. [Exhales] And 3:30 is really early to leave work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't suppose you have a — a 5:15 appointment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right. Um... [clucks]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know how late you work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I work, uh, generally, 'til about six.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, let me look. My schedule's likely changing a bit over the next few weeks, and if I can...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, with the academic year is cycling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually, even before that — just, um — uh, we're leaving — possibly leaving town. Um, [pauses] if I can arrange 5:15, that's better? [00:01:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, let me look into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so there's — that request is open whenever [chuckles] a problem comes up. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. OK, all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A standing request. .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, no problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this week at work has sucked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The project my group has been working on got canceled on Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it turns out our manager's manager knew two weeks ago and sat on it for two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And <i>his</i> boss knew for, like, four months and didn't tell him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so we're — I was just [makes sound] <i>pffffftt.</i> Everyone is pissed off. Like, there was someone this morning — I don't know who it was, but I heard this voice drifting over the cubicle wall, saying, "You know, fuck it. I don't see why I should do anything today except reading all day." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it is just [sighs] everyone is depressed and miserable at work. And it is kind of like I'm not invested in this project, where I've been on it for like four weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [pauses] um, our project people in my group are — [confidential information].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we [pauses] — we send our chip. We don't — we have nothing to do with the consumer product that it is going to go into. And we have internal customers...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The whole-chip groups. [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the group...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You put together your stuff, and the other stuff is put on the chip. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, um, [taps something] technically, I'm not supposed to be talking about this with anyone because it could affect Garyet and business, and crap if it gets out, but, like, I assume confidentiality protects us...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And you're not going to be talking to anyone anyway. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [confidential information].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So that's like June or something, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are three big [pauses] — in consumer electronics, there are three big windows you want to hit for your products to get to Garyet. You want products to get to Garyet right before graduation and Father's Day, right before back-to-school, and then right before winter holidays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if you're not going to make it, there's just no point because no one's going to buy an older product. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, no one's going to buy a product that was released in October, for Christmas. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, they want the thing that was released December 4.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, Sunday (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I think the Garyet is crazy, but that's what the Garyet has consumed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — [confidential information].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're missing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not going to meet it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're that far behind. So the powers that be decided, [confidential information].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But — I don't know — if they're not going to be ready to do the whole chip...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, why not take [confidential information] which is plenty of time if the — the full system is going to go out for Christmas next year? [00:05:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so, yeah. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But Number Four...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm a little confused. When you "Core Four" instead of Core Three — doesn't the fourth go on a chip?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, that's the fourth iteration of this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like, the first one — so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you said the names. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was like when you said...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You're on the — what'd you call it? They're not in a package, but like they're in a, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Core.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but, before, you called it, like, the third — not release, but something else. Anyway...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The third revision. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that. OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, so [pauses] — so "a version" is probably a good way to look at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, [pauses] — so all of this is pipelined. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you don't start working on the second-generation — you don't wait until the first generation is done before you start on the second generation; you kick off work on the second generation about nine months after you kick off work on the first generation so that you can just [snaps fingers] — stuff comes out. [00:06:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I was working on — my group was working on the third generation of this chip; fourth generation was in progress; third generation was wrapping up; fourth generation was about in the middle of their design cycle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible] is starting their design cycle right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my group of 30 people — 20 [breathlessly spoken] of them got reassigned to the fourth gen for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...To help them make their targets 'cause they're — they're in trouble.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They haven't missed any deadlines yet, but they need...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...More brains. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now there's just — and then four people got reassigned to, like, random other crap, so there're just six of us left in my group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and we're being reassigned — all of us — to the fifth-generation chip. [00:07:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, so far, the fifth-generation chip — we're calling it [confidential information].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Heh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, anyway, I'm working on the fifth now, and, eventually, fifth is going to ramp up to have, like, 90 people who have my job description working on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, right now, there's just six of us. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so you're the entire...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Group working on the fifth-generation chip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, we're the entire physical design group. They've probably got, like, [pauses] 20 architects and [exhales] I don't know how many macro people they have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those are all the bigger-picture [pauses] people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, different levels of the — different — different types of work, different job functions. Um, so what this means, essentially, is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh? [00:08:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That I thought I would have, like, the next four months to learn the architecture and design of the chip by doing polishing work on something that was pretty much finished, and that I didn't look at what other people had designed. And, you know, my job would be tweaking, modifying, making incremental improvements...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And learning how the pieces fit together by actually getting my hands dirty in the — in the design. But now, all of the sudden, I'm supposed to be going to meetings with the high-level architects, and saying — and have them throw these very high-level design ideas at me, like, "I want to double the size of the cache," or, "I want to move the cache from the left-hand side of the chip to the right-hand side," or, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."I want to change those five ways to set-associative buffer to an eight-way set-associative buffer," and for me to then say, "Can I implement this or can I not?" "What's the implication for...?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."For power consumption and area?" And I don't fucking know how to do that. Like, [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is [sighs loudly in exasperation] — if I had a... [00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you thought like it is for writing a paper. You've gone from, like, the sort of final edits and copy edits to the brainstorming the thesis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [Clucks] And it is just — I had a two-hour meeting today with the guy from Architecture, who is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Absolutely brilliant. He talks a mile a minute, and I think, if I had more knowledge, I would really enjoy working with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was just — I was lost. I had no idea what half the words he was saying, what they even meant. Like, "You're using words I have never even heard of before in my life..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."Much less know how this applies to the..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was [sighs heavily] — I'm very stressed. [Sighs breathlessly]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it doesn't help that, like, so many of my coworkers are just, like, "Fuck it. I'm not doing anything because I'm pissed off and angry." Because, like, of course, all six of us are supposed to be doing these meetings and doing these things, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, there were five guys — they've been on this project for two years, and they're <i>furious</i> that... [00:10:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The plug got pulled on them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] [Struggles to find words, stutters a moment] Just <i>furious.</i> I — I — [chuckles] there's no possible way for me to overstate how unhappy my coworkers are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, like, I - I asked our mentor for help [slaps surface], and he was just like, "I don't know. I haven't thought about it. I'm taking tomorrow off. I'm actually going to leave early today."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Maybe I'll talk to you Monday." I'm, like — I'm trying really hard not to take it personally because I know it has nothing to do with me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But it is still kind of [pauses for seven seconds] [slaps surface] - it is hard getting blown off. Like, I had to go take some time out [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Find a room with a door, and take a couple deep breaths and count to ten multiple times. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, uh, [pauses] what was the reaction you were managing? [00:11:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Well, the initial reaction was, "Oh, my God. I've screwed up. I've pissed Brian off. Sorry." My mentor's name is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Say it] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Confusing. Those common names. Um, and, like, I was really starting to panic because, "Oh, my God. I've pissed off my mentor, and now he hates me," and I had to just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... [Slaps surface] Talk myself out of that and into some semblance of reality where, "Brian isn't mad at me; he's mad at our bosses," and, "He doesn't hate me; he's just demoralized and frustrated." Not that I want to speak for him or make assumptions about his mental state, but [pauses] I think these are fairly reasonable [chuckles] assumptions to make.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I — I was wondering what was wrong making assumptions about it, but yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like [pauses] — a lot of the time, if I try to [pauses] — it is very easy to fool yourself, making assumptions about how other people are feeling. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is very easy to be wrong, so I try not to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I think, in this case, it is pretty clear. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the problem here is not with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [inaudible] was onsite today. He usually works out of the other office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was onsite all day, doing roundtables with pseudo-randomly selected employees. He's — has — he gave a talk at lunch, and he was just like — [pauses] [sighs] — the whole reason that company is in this situation is because a bunch of upper- and mid-level managers lied to their directors and VPs about whether their teams could meet their deadlines or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they lied about problems, like just balls-out, "Oh, no, we're totally on schedule. Everything is fine," when, like... [00:13:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...There were bugs, and bug fixes were slow, and it was just [shifts in seat] — so [sighs] the executives are all pissed at the mid-level managers who were lying to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [chuckles] — so our CEO gave a — a talk at lunch, and, um, [pauses] he was pissed and made no bones about it, that, like, "This is completely unacceptable. If you see your managers lying to their directors, you need to go over your managers' heads because this is not OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, everybody there was [chuckles] [pauses] — I think half the people who worked in my corner of the building — I mean, not necessarily my team, but the people I can see from — like, half of them just left after lunch and were like, "I'm done. <i>Pffffttt.</i>" [Chuckles in exasperation]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was pretty bad. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would think. How typical is it for the frustration and morale to get this low?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] [Faintly] I have no idea. [Pauses] I don't. You know, my first week on the job, I was chatting with people in fun ways you do, and people seemed pretty happy with their jobs...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So I would assume this is unusual, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Good to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, of course, there's a new VP of Technology, who reports to the CTO, who has only been on the job for six months, and happens to be a woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The CEO was also new. He's been at the Company for a year, but he [grew out] (ph) as the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...The VP?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, the VP.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he just put her right in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, they had worked together at previous companies, and she has a really impressive resume. I don't know anything else about her. [00:15:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, all of the — the managers have been making fun of her, like, "You know, I was in this meeting with Alice and Gary, and Karl to talk about the problems with covariance and why [pauses] that was fucked up, and, you know, Alice was just <i>hysterical</i> and spitting nails. She was just really shrill." And I'm like, [intonates] "Her managers have been lying to her since her first day on the job! We are going to miss two major product cycles! This is going to seriously affect the bottom line, and you're going to use this coded, gendered language to describe her?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [shouts] [intonates] it is not like upper management executives aren't just as angry! Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] No one's describing the CEO as being shrill or hysterical. They're like [slaps surface], "He's disappointed."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They saw how disappointed, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Like, you know, when people talk about Jeff (ph) is the CEO, and Gary is another VP. Karl is my, um — the Divisions Director. [00:16:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When they say, "Oh, Gary is pissed off at people who were lying to him," or, "Jeff is really disappointed and wants better," or, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."Karl is looking for heads to roll." But Alice is being "shrill" and "hysterical." [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Expresses frustration] Ughhh!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is <i>so</i> frustrating! Like, I just want to [pauses] punch some of these people [faintly] in the face. [Pauses for 14 seconds] [whispers] You know? I also ran into it totally, inadvertently out in [males being poly to] (ph) [inaudible at 16:50] in a meeting this morning, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How were you about that? [00:17:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] I want out! [Chuckles in exasperation] Not on purpose, but — so what happened was there was this group meeting this morning...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I usually sit next to my mentor, um, and he usually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how did it — like, how are you in terms of, like, [pauses] uh, what was your reaction? I mean, tell me what happened, but — yeah....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So Brian usually keeps up a running...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, under his reps (ph) now, he commentaries about everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] And, um, he made some snarky mention about Tuesday nights at the coffee shop, which is — if you don't <i>know</i>, the coffee shop is in the Square, on Tuesday night that's bringing up for a bunch of poly people in the area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so he mentioned this, and I just kind of sniggered at it, you know, making it obvious that I knew what he was talking about, which I didn't do intentionally. But it was a really funny comment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like — and so, after the meeting, he was like, "So you laughed at my comment about the Coffee shop," and I was, like, "[Pauses] Yeah." He's like, "Do you go?" I was like, "<i>No</i>." He was like, "Yeah, I've found a lot of that crowd is just really emotionally unhealthy. Don't you think?" And he kept prodding at it, like very clearly trying to figure out whether I just knew about it through [slaps surface]... [00:18:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Having friends. So I don't know if he actually outed me or not, or what, 'cause I'd never confirmed that [slaps surface] — but, [sighs]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was probing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he was probing me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that probably was unfair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was fishing for information, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was just [sighs] [pauses] — I don't know. Being closeted is a lot of work. It is why I'm completely out about being bi, because it is just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is way, way [slaps surface] too much work to pretend not to, like there's just, um — but I do feel like — I mean, I will admit I'm very, very lucky that I'm not worried about facing discrimination for being queer on the job, that I can, like, have my pride stickers and not worry about that, and that is — you know, I am remarkably privileged in that regard. But I do feel like there's much more judgment for poly people than there is for LGBT people, in my workplace, at least. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, no, I don't know what [it is about this] (ph) workplace that — in the area, we'll say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. I'm kind of worried about what the whole lot of this will be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And whether this will start gossip about me at work and, like — and I'm kicking myself for not having my reactions more under control. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you say it is a lot of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Inhales]</p>

<p>[Silence for 14 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] So I don't know. I tried to put some thought into whether I care about being out or not, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Silence for nine seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I hate that this is even a concern. Like, my life would be so much easier if I were just like a straight, boring dude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [Pauses] Tuesday afternoon, I went to pick up a new spinning wheel that I'd ordered. [Shifts in seat] Um, and the manufacturer is right.., which is right next to where I work, so instead of having them ship it to me and spend money on shipping a fragile piece of machinery, I went and picked it up, and [claps hand], you know, we were chatting. I know these vendors; I've known — I've been their customer for, like, five years now. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>Um, 'cause — so they were asking me, "How's grad school going?" "Now, that I've graduated, I've got this new job. It is right next door to where your workshop is," chat, chat, chat. And the guys — it is a couple who run their own business, was, like, "So, are you going to be CEO in a month?" [chuckles] So I said, "I've been on the job a month. It is a great job."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he said, "So, in a month, are you going to be CEO?" I was like, "<i>Pfffftt</i>. [Chuckles] I don't want to be CEO" He's like, "Well, you'd have to get pregnant first, wouldn't you?" I was like, "What?" He was like, "Yeah, you know, women are just like — they want to be CEOs while they're pregnant. I don't know what the world is coming to." I just — like — "Why?!" [Slaps surface] Why are people so horrible and hostile to the idea of women being in the workplace? Or just like [pauses] — it is just... [00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially in a position of power?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] It is just <i>sooo</i> frustrating and [pauses] — I mean, it is not something that — I know that, for a lot of women, for a lot of queer people, it is something that is just in your face all day, every day. But because I'm not terribly feminine, um, in my presentation or in my mannerisms, there's [sighs] — well, I know coworkers tend to treat me like one of the guys, and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That just isn't as in my face all the time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, as it is for a lot of my female colleagues, so — so when I <i>do</i> notice stuff that's just outrageous like this, it is just <i>sooo</i> — it is <i>so</i> upsetting, and — I don't know. I don't know where I'm going with this. Maybe I just need to vent, to get it off my chest. [Pauses] [Sighs] [00:23:05]</p>

<p>[Silence for 20 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about — let me try to posit. You're saying that because your coworkers treat you as - now that you're going somewhat different, as kind of more like one of the guys...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That you see less of this? I thought that you were going to say that you see more because they're less censored...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But you're saying that you see less because they don't treat you that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like, [sighs] [pauses] — like I had a coworker at Celluon, who was very pretty, very fem, um, would wear these beautiful dresses and high heels... [00:24:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, like, people would <i>comment</i> about her, like all the time, to her face, like, "Great legs. Looking good today, sweetheart." Like, that was just like <i>all the time</i>, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that's not something I get because I wear, like, baggy jeans and button-up shirts, and if my workplace were more formal, I'd wear a tie, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd get my hot Dave (ph) when we first come to work in torn band tee-shirts. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah, you've got to wear a tie.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like no one is going to comment about how I look in a dress because I don't wear dresses to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and not because I feel like I can't or — it is just [shifts in seat]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, [so they] (ph) [inaudible at 24:54].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So — yeah, so in some ways, I'm insulated from that. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, for the most part at this job, I'm lucky that my male coworkers are not pigs like my...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The job I had in South Carolina — the guys would say all kinds of horrible things when women weren't around. Overheard <i>terrible</i>, terrible things, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The men thought there were no women who could hear them. Um, and that hasn't been the case so far here. I very, very grateful for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, they're mostly good people. [Pauses for five seconds] But, yeah, I kind of [chuckles] live in something of a bubble, where a lot of the stuff doesn't [pauses] — doesn't interfere with my day-to-day working of my job, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I see. Not that you'd be desensitized to it if it did, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It would be at least more predictable. [00:26:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Door slams in the distance]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now you just get hit sort of more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Randomly than it — more randomly than before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. [Pauses for nine seconds] I think it is more that I don't — I don't have my shields up, so to speak.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] I'm not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Not already in a defensive posture, mentally...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So it is more of a blow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, keeping up that defensive posture is fucking exhausting, uh, and not worth the energy if it is not needed on a regular basis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, at the same time, it is just — [sighs] I don't know. I wish the world were better. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is kind of a pointless thing to want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had — it seemed like you are, but asking because of what you said previously a few weeks ago — are you nervous at all talking about this with me? Like — I mean, you had mentioned before being worried about bringing up stuff about, like, [faintly] [your sexual narcissism, what you mean] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] A little bit worried, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is better to talk about it and see what happens than...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Pretend that it is not something I want to talk about. [00:27:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Like, I'm asking, in part, because — in part, you mentioned animus (ph) — is also kind of a name for it because it seems the bunch of it that you're talking about has to do with kind of ways you're feeling vulnerable at work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, even starting with, um, the low morale and kind of the crummy treatment by your, uh, mentor...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And the way that working out sort of puts you in that horrible position of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, all of it. Sorry, I didn't know if any of that translated to in here or — um, [I'm offering as that's all I was asking] (ph).</p>

<p>[Silence for 20 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:29:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it is more like [chuckles] a funny thought or a kind of thought that was — I mean, [I don't want to tell you it through with them] (ph). I was sort of joking (ph) myself like, "Yeah, I would imagine morale seems low."</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Laughs loudly]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I thought, "You know, that was the way that did with Blue Cross, and that didn't affect my morale."</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Continues laughing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You know, talking with people at all...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But it did affect my morale with Blue Cross, and then that reminded me that they'll probably — I'll get another call, and then they'll probably be sending you another check. That's our point; otherwise, things are righted with them. But, anyway, that was the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ye — no, my, um — my last therapist, for some reason...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Blue Cross screwed up their database and had it listed as an orthopedist, and so they refuse to pay her directly for services that were not orthopedic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] God... [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] It took her a year to sort that one out for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It might be a year that they don't have it in any] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: A year of endorsing checks to [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Got to [figure that out] (ph). [00:30:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eh, I don't even...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you get someone from listed as a psychiatrist in your database to an orthopedist? I don't even [slaps surface]... [Chuckles] [Sighs] Oh, insurance. Do you take United Healthcare?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I mean, I — I'm happy to bill it if there is an out-of-network benefit...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But I'm — the only panel I'm currently on [doors slams in distance] is Blue Cross, which I'll probably be getting out of in January...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Anyway. Uh, so, no, I'm not on there. But, like I say, I'm happy to bill them and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. United is what my work offers, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Dave and I have been debating the relative part of — [inaudible at 30:59] Blue Cross versus their United. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm more leaning towards keeping the Blue Cross.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah... [Chuckles]</p>

<p>[Silence for 17 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've kind of been in this terrifying situation with my mentor and a couple of my coworkers...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....In that we have a lot of the same hobbies and interests outside of work, and so, um, there was this [cons event] (ph) convention two weeks ago —— in Burlington, that two of the members of my group were at, and I ran into them, a panel (ph) over in the hallways, and — [00:31:55]</p>

<p>I mean, when I go to cons, I use a pseudonym so that if people write stuff on the Internet about [inaudible], my real name, and especially if I'm going to be talking on a panel, and people are writing that [slaps surface] I really don't want [chuckles] my bosses to find out my opinions about, like — I don't know — porn in fan fic or [claps hand] whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] — but, you know, if people are there in person, they're going to see me and recognize me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Right, 'cause [they'll see your name on that and try to equal them] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I kind of feel like — you know, especially because I — the conventions I go to, um, [pauses for five seconds] [exhales] - how to say? A lot of the things that I'm interested in talking about and listening to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, especially with my friends, at conventions is, um, [pauses] kind of social justice issues in media, which is, you know, portrayal of women, portrayal of people of color, um, and, you know, racism in the community, etcetera. [00:33:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, those are things that — you know, given that I work in a field dominated by older white men, I'm not really comfortable having them know about, like, my radical feminist opinions or anti-racism activism because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...While I'm not ashamed about any of that, I do worry that it would...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they're in positions of power, and it would...</p>

<p>[Crosstalk]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That it would cause them to judge me. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like, if my coworkers [chuckles] are going to the same event that I go to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it puts you in a horrible position, [pauses] like where they're going to know things about you that you haven't necessarily chosen to share.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yep. Though, at the same time, if they're part of these communities that I belong to. Like, we're in the same community, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that crossed my mind about the guy sort of probing you about Tuesday, and he knew about it. You know? [00:34:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, yeah, I — not that would make [a lot uncomfortable], but it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Kind of [at work] (ph) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I'm reminded of the joke how you can tell the difference between a — a Baptist and an Episcopalian. The Episcopalians meet each other in the liquor store, they smile and say "hi." Baptists, you know, run around and hide behind the [near adult] (ph). [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Well. [Pauses] Uh-huh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, keeping secrets is just so much mental effort, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What....?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is hard for me to decide when it is worth it to keep stuff private and when it is not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your feel so far for the guys in the group? [Slaps surface] I mean, not that people can't surprise you, but what's your sense of them? [00:35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Pauses] [sighs] They're mostly good guys, and I think they're all [pauses] — I think they all would be horrified at, like, overt, outright displays of sexism or racism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think a lot of them just haven't really had to think about what it is like to be a minority or a woman, and how — like, a lot of them are, probably, my guess is completely unaware of the impact, like, their aggressions can have and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It has been my experience of people who haven't really given thought to that, um, and who have no experience of that, but they get defensive when people start talking about these isms because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, it is really easy to say, you know, "Oh, well, you're talking about classism, and you're saying I have class privilege. You think I'm a horrible human being. And then, as soon as you start feeling attacked, you get defensive and lash out." And I know I've certainly done that in areas where I have privilege and... [00:36:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You thought it?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I work really hard to [whispers] stop doing that [chuckles] because it is not about me, and it is not personal, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, you know, when people react defensively, all kinds of bad things can happen. Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>[Silence for ten seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it. My impression is that it is the way that an — [pauses] — the [good] (ph), like prohibitions around things like sexism and racism...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Like normatively or like as sort of espoused cultural values...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Can be a problem in that [pauses for six seconds] when you talk about ways that somebody of privilege or [might regressed] (ph) or... [00:37:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Wasn't aware that somebody else was sort of regressing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That [pauses] — uh, think they're like — it would make them really bad [pauses] if that were true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] And, of course, this whole understanding that most people in our culture have that racism and sexism are individual crimes as opposed to, you know, systemic, um — what's the word I'm looking for? [Rubs hands]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, effects on people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So if you say, you know — so if you talk about racism to people, their minds immediately jump to, like, burning crosses where that's not really what I mean; I'm talking about racism. [00:38:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's so far out there, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, it is the racial equivalent of using words like "hysterical."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Among other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, of course, because we have this notion that individual acts of racism are heinous and only really horrible, evil people — like, only Hitler is a racist. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So if you start calling out racism, people are automatically, "Oh, my God, you think I'm as bad as Hitler," and, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."No."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "No, you're just like most people." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like most of us. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which makes it really hard to talk about this stuff and — of course, a lot of the more institutionalized form of racism do continue unabated...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or not even hidden, like Mitt Romney, or doesn't understand our Anglo-Saxon heritage. [00:39:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really? I didn't hear anything about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Earlier this week, [exhales] Mitt Romney's advisors said that he will be a better president than Obama because Obama doesn't understand the rich English Anglo-Saxon heritage and has been shunning London and — what's the five Tory Street? Whatever the name for [slaps surface] their Prime Minister's house is. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Downing Street?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Downing Street, yes. Obama has been shunning Downing Street because he doesn't understand our Anglo-Saxon shared cultural heritage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is just like, "Come <i>on</i>, that's not even a dog whistle. That's just a whistle." Like... [faintly moans]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Continues faintly moaning] Ehhhhhhh.</p>

<p>[Silence as birds chirp outside]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What about the [traumatic of anarchists] (ph)? No one thinks about them when they talk about "our Anglo-Saxon heritage." [Snorts]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh, huh.</p>

<p>[00:40:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 11 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] You know, it is just — it is — it is <i>so</i> exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pauses] [shifts in seat] — well, I mean, there's really two different things I'm thinking of when I say, "It is so exhausting."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first is keeping secrets at work and [slaps surface] making an effort to keep things private really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, it would be easier if it were safe for me then to just not worry about, um, and the other is just like [pauses] being prepared to experience microaggressions or, you know, non-microaggressions as the case may be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like, our — our weekly group meeting — well, now we're down to six people, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...When it was 20 people, I was the only woman in the room, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, I'm bracing myself for that. But even if no one does anything outrageous or says anything out of line, it is <i>still...</i> [00:41:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is kind of stressful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is <i>still taxing</i>, and it is <i>still stressful,</i> and I'm <i>still aware</i> that I'm the only woman in the room, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, this would be the exception to what I was saying earlier, that, for the most part, this stuff is under my face, literally (ph) in my face when — during group meeting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] it is just — it is — it is <i>so tiring</i>, and I'm <i>so sick</i> of it, and [pauses] — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll see you next Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I will keep my eye out for 5:15 on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Mm, and I can switch days, also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...If 5:15 opens on another day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Rises from seat] They may (ph) [inaudible at 41:50] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, think (ph).</p>

<p>[Door opens]</p>

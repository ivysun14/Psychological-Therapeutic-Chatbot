<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client number 1429-110, interview number 13, therapist month, February 9, 1971. Client number 1429-100, therapist (inaudible at 0:00:14.3), interview 13, February 9, 1971. Hi, Johnny. Hand still bandaged up I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I could have taken the bandage off today, but it looks so bad, you know, the bandage is so ragged. I have to go to the hospital with it tomorrow, but I think then they're going to take it off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you wait until tomorrow if you're going there tomorrow? Let them take it off for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I had it off three times today because it's dry, you know, it's all dry underneath. But when I do that, see, this is the way it looks. It's just a hideous, you know - it's a hideous bandage. (Inaudible at 0:01:11.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's all dirty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:01:14.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I just wrapped it up, keep this thing on. Anyway, but I'm going to take it off tomorrow. Hopefully I can go skiing this weekend, that's why I want to get the thing off. I just came back from (inaudible at 0:01:36.7), a class in social work. And we had one of these things on - it's just really like a verbatim, somebody said this is verbatim. And then you go over it, you know, to try to understand it.</p>

<p>And it's really funny, like, I hadn't done the assignment because this is when I was gone. But I read the paper and, you know, basically what they wanted was reactions to the paper. And my reaction to this, it was a guy that had written it but wasn't in class, was that it was, you know, it was from my old job, Giant. But I thought the paper was just a huge self-justification for his contact with an old lady. I just read it once and that's what I thought it was. 0:02:35.0</p>

<p>But in the class, I got real kind of - I wasn't emotional, but I was, like, excited about the class, which for me, I haven't been excited about anything for, you know, for a long time especially anything in the classroom. I don't why I mentioned that but I guess it was kind of - it was, like, everybody had opinions, even myself included, nobody was listening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so we all sat around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody was talking, but nobody was listening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And there's one guy, I don't know why it was, that really irritates me in that class, he irritates everybody and it's a lot of my friends. I don't know why it is because he usually is - you know, he'll clear his voice. You know, he won't do anything like raising his hand, but he'll clear his voice and then he'll start talking, he'll preface something. Then he'll go on and then he'll, you know, make some point, which I usually lose and then he'll, you know, (inaudible at 0:04:02.4).</p>

<p>But he talks - this is my second (inaudible at 0:04:06.4). Last time he didn't talk at all. But my friend said that he talks like this all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does he talk (inaudible at 0:04:13.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very - he's got a bit of a southern accent, just barely. But it's kind of in a non - you know, it's kind of a monotonous tone. It's not that so much, it's the things he says. I mean, they're - to me, he'll always bring in, like, one of his cases or something like that, which isn't really pertinent to what we're talking about. You know, and then it goes on for about five minutes. And I really would like to, you know - also today when I evaluated this paper, you know, I kind of think I do because, you know, I put myself in the same place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean his position, how you would have written it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, like, this guy wrote a paper and I read it and I said it's just a big self-justification, and the guy wasn't aware of his feelings in the moment. Which, you know, I think would have been true of me in that kind of situation. He was caught unaware. And, you know, like that's what I took it as. No, as I was riding over here today, I didn't know if I wanted to - like it's - I think maybe this is what I mean by that, (inaudible at 0:05:56.3). It's like intellectually I can see some things about myself, but I still can't emotionally. I cannot...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, what are you talking about? 0:06:12.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: About myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but what specifically?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't - what would be a good example? Intellectually I kind of see things like that, in a way, I have all kinds of ways to keep people back from me, usually with words. And then when it gets to the point of any kind of, like, what I call human contact, I'm not up for it, I don't know, I just can't do it. Like a way to start would be to call girls by their first name, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, and I know that. And I don't think that would be a solution, but it would at least - at least it would mean a change. But I can do it once in a while. But even like this - Sylvio, I can, if I ever called Sylvio Susie, I'll faint. I'll faint dead to the floor because I just look at her and I will not call her Susie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I have no idea, or there's another girl, her dance partner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is because she doesn't look like a Susie to you or what? 0:07:38.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's got something to do with - I know I used hers (inaudible at 0:07:46.3). The one I would be interested in saying is her dance partner, Katie Gaynor. I've always called Gaynor, Gaynor. And when I came back - I went back to the job, the day before she said - it's completely unlike Gaynor to ever say anything really personal, but she said, "We really want you back," you know, in a very sincere way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you said, "Thanks, Gaynor?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I just - I said I know that's the problem, I can't accept that. But I think she interpreted it to mean that I was just being flip, you know. And what I meant is that I have a hard time believing, you know, in my emotions that I'm really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wanted by somebody. And so, you know, like, I thought, well, I can go and tell her that I really appreciated that. But I haven't or I could start calling her Katie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would it take to do that, to start calling her Katie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it's, like, I think I could do it. But see, I've used that before. I've changed my behavior before when I saw - but it's like being superficial about it. I mean, to me, I don't know, maybe it would be of value, but to me, to be able to say...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to really want to feel as though you want to call her Katie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because otherwise, I can do the same thing. I call - okay, I call everybody by their last name now. Okay, so I call Katie, Katie, I call Susie, Susie. I call everybody first - the point is, I'm still doing it out of more of a compulsion than I'm doing it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you really want to call them by their first names.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe - what does it mean to you to call a person by their fast name or last name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It means becoming, you know, like, familiar with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, do you feel as though people are too familiar with you when they call you by your first name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, I kind of like it, you know, like when people do that. It's almost like if I do...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like giving in on a point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like admitting giving in on a point (inaudible at 0:10:53.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Admitting that you like them before you know whether they like you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no no. I'm trying to think of what I'd feel like if I would call Katie, Katie, you know. It must be something in regard to you. I could, you know, I could see like if it would be - you know, it would be helpful for me, but for some reason, it would be like conceding you a point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, but...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What that point is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know either. It's just what came into my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, let's talk about it with me, did you mean me specifically?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's, like, kind of - and I'm not going to just - I would say it's, like, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told you, you know, like - or you've pointed it out. You pointed it out that, like, I'll call a girl by her last name. All right, okay, and I've seen that I do that but I don't know why. So then for me to call a girl by her first name is to concede you the point. 0:13:03.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I was correct about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I don't want that to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why that is either. I never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, what is the big deal about that, I guess is what I'm asking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know I can - I don't know how to explain it. I didn't think of it that way before. But now it seems like that - see, like, I think I use you like a sounding board. I don't think I - most of the time, think of, you know, you as a person who's related to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I don't really - you know, I don't really like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but what you're saying is that - at least this is the way it sounds. It's like this point that I have made will somehow be generalized, and other people are going to know about it too. 0:14:16.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's - it's got something to do with - I'm on a thing now. I read some stuff on transference crap and I, you know - but if - because I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel if you call me by my first name? I don't think you ever called me anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I call you Michael every time I walk in, but I did that out of - first two times, I couldn't even remember your name. But I know since about the fourth time I've call you that specifically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because, I think the thing about - no, that's confusing to me I guess really. I don't think I can use you like a board, you know, like a sounding board. I don't think - I think mainly because I - maybe that would be good, like, to see a lot of things intellectually but not emotionally. See, now the one time I saw you outside this room is when I was down - well, you caught me completely off guard. And I felt, like, really dumb, there's that guy I've been telling this stuff to. 0:15:46.7</p>

<p>And I said, "Why do I feel that way?" It wasn't, like, - you know, like, there's somebody I really trust. Because if don't trust anybody, I must not trust you either. And if I don't trust you, that means that I'm just telling you things, which to me are valuable and so far as I can maybe see it with my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or at least you don't trust me outside of this room, I think is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel strange. I felt very - I've only seen you once outside the room and I felt strange, I felt, like, embarrassed because I felt strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Okay, now how does this tie in (inaudible at 0:16:35.6)? You were starting to say it has something (inaudible at 0:16:38.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well, I think it's got something to do, where I feel that the only thing I thought about beforehand is that intellectually I can keep on going this way, and I think it would be helpful, but emotionally, I see the difference between - I can still see that I'm this, you know, this far behind in knowing what I feel in a moment and what's really going on in the moment. You know, like, there's still that - when I react to somebody, I'm still reacting back here.</p>

<p>And I - God, the things with the word, see, I think I do that here too, not all the time but a lot of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just react with words?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yea, not so much...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably like feeling them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, with my gut. If I want to make it look like I'm - like now, what am I doing? I raised my voice, but as though I'm really - I've really got something way down here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it really isn't that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think what I think is that, like, that's one of the things, you know, that I think, at least, you know, I think consciously that I don't - that I'm not sure about that I don't know about, you know, why (inaudible at 0:18:37.3). Here I come close, put it that way, but there's still something... 0:18:49.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Coming close to getting to your gut reaction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, kind of, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I've come close at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, that doesn't mean you're really there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but see, like, it's like I'm not going to - you know, it's almost like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you're not going to commit yourself. You're not going to concede a point to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, I'm not going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's right, that's what you're saying, isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, even if you were there you wouldn't admit it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, almost. For some reason, to concede that point would be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Defeat?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know (inaudible at 0:19:31.3), it didn't ring quite right. It would... 0:19:38.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:19:39.4) too tight assed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Too what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tight assed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm too tight assed?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm asking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have to explain that to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rigid somehow, like, you know, you build a shell around yourself and just won't allow anybody to see that there's any weakness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, see, I - okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even yourself - you won't allow yourself to get to that gut feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I can know it in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, that part I didn't think because I thought I told you plenty of weaknesses. But I didn't really - I didn't show those weaknesses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but what you said today was that you've intellectualized, that is, you've talked about those things, even weaknesses but you haven't really felt them. 0:20:39.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. There's been very few times - no, because my feeling kind of just doesn't - you know, like, I don't know what brings it out. I - you know, I think about it, maybe it doesn't. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean not being able to get gut reactions of all this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's - I know that's what bothered - like, in this class, I knew that that was one of the things. Like, I started dated another girl now. And I don't know about that, but she just broke up with a guy about a month ago she was engaged to. So I'm following the same damn pattern again. And it was the same sort of thing, like, I used a whole shower of words and it wouldn't, you know - either wouldn't let her close or thought she couldn't come close, you know, any other way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Okay. Now you started saying before you just read some stuff about transference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, if...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that (inaudible at 0:22:20.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Transference, what I read about transference and I says, okay, you know, I was reading Freudian stuff. And transference, the way the guy described it was some kind of - well, I was reading on Jung too. And Jung said it was like a thing where if you intellectualize, you know, your responses, it's fine and good and you can get limited insight. But he says, really what transference is, is much more when it's an emotional, either conflict, attachment or something to the person that you are in therapy with. And so that, unless that is there, you can benefit somewhat, but you can't really get to what he would call, like, significant areas. 0:23:14.6</p>

<p>Okay, that's all words, but what it means to me is what's typical of me probably with across the board.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't get to that point with anybody?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, except this last year, like, there have been examples of girls, but then it's a sick kind of thing. You know, it's a thing where it wipes me out. Where I get - the minute - it wipes me out because I think I - well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:23:45.9) well, there's one girl you were attached to who was - who chose somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, okay, then I was...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Engaged to somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the girl - yeah, she broke up with him a month ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but at the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you mean before - okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:24:10.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both times it was like being angry, but the last time I said, you know, I almost...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you got yourself attached to people who ultimately rejected you, at least in those two cases? 0:24:22.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must feel kind of dangerous to get attached to anybody, huh? Like, your mother too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I still...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She wasn't satisfied just with you. Is that the way it feels, like, everybody you get attached to rejects you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, of the girls, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not with men? Did you...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:25:10.6) that there was a difference between women and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because the attachment to men is much different than it would be to a girl. To a girl, it's usually - well, even though I fight it, it's kind of unreasonable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not as reasonable with women as you are with men, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of like what I want to say to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're more emotional with women than men?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, provided, you know, provided that it's a kind of girl that really - I don't know, like, it's a - whatever path I'm following, there seems to be a certain kind of person that I run into and then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what kind of person is that? 0:26:01.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always take them as - and it's usually only after I get to know them, a strong, by that I mean able to make decisions, gives me the impression of knowing themselves. It didn't quite hold up (inaudible at 0:26:29.0). Having a fairly decent head and being (inaudible at 0:26:52.0) somewhat warm. I think of the three girls I've - you know, met this year, that would be, like, typical of them all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except for the warmth, it sounded like you're describing Susie Sylvio.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe there's even warmth in her if you get to know her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:27:24.0), there might be, she faked me out one time because when I told her to give me the tickets back, she said - how did she say it? Oh, I said, "Because I didn't think you had wanted them." And she said - it wasn't what she said, it was her tone of voice. Something like, "Oh, Johnny" or something like that. I don't know - I should never have started with Sylvio, I don't really know why I did because that's like the architect (ph), you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you like to screw Sylvio?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I might be projecting out the thing, but I would bet - I'd bet you a donut it would have to be upon her time, her conditions, her hour of the night, her time of the month. I'm certain it would only be done under the influence of pot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you so certain of those things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because Sylvio to me is a predictable human being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sylvio might be, but I wonder whether Susie is. 0:29:00.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm real attracted to her as - maybe I'm kidding myself. I was initially. There are two girls on our floor. Maybe I should go back to that. Two girls on our floor that I was attracted to, one girl I asked out, Sylvio (inaudible at 0:29:18.5). And first of all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the other girl's name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jackie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jackie and Sylvio.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had to think, though, I almost called her Cronan (inaudible at 0:29:26.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you call her Cronan then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I started calling her - but no, I sometimes call her Jackie and sometimes call her Cronan. I can't remember. But her and - they both (inaudible at 0:29:45.9). I remember, though, I - Sylvio, I first came up and I found this thing that was on transactional analysis, "I'm Okay, You're Okay" was the thing. And it was an outline of the book. And so I came up - and I don't know why, but I came up and I gave - and I almost called (inaudible at 0:30:10.1) conceding the point.</p>

<p>I gave her the copy of this thing and she looks around and she says, "Why are you giving me this, Alector?" And I said, "Well, you know, I just found it and I thought you might like to have it." And I think it was from that point on that I knew what I could tease her with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did Jackie call you? 0:30:38.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: She always called me Johnny except...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Sylvio calls you Alector?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, she varies, I'm not sure - last time she called me Johnny, I think. And Jackie only called me Alector once and it was a very pointed - it was after I called her Miss Cronan, you know, to a client on the phone. And she was very careful on how she referred to me after that. Yeah, it seems like such a little point that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if it's such a little point, why do you have so much trouble calling her Susie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, that's what I can't figure. Well, I mean, I shouldn't really unless I'm (inaudible at 0:31:40.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless it's a big thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, unless I think - then I thereby concede something either here to you or I concede something to Sylvio.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And to me you would be conceding that I had something over on you. I discovered something about you and that, you know, if you start calling her Susie that would be admitting that I was right. How about with her, what would you be conceding to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have to concede she's a woman then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, and what about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I don't know. Now it doesn't seem so much of a big point to concede.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that she doesn't totally fit into your pre-conceived notion of what a woman is, that is, she isn't warm, she lacks that quality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's something that with her - I wouldn't think about her at the office anymore, though. It's just that every once in a while she comes up here, and I don't know for what reason. I don't know if you're bringing it up or if I'm bringing it up. She's getting old, you know, that's another thing. Yeah. 0:33:40.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Past her prime?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's not such good pickings anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she's okay when she tries, but she isn't trying so hard. She's putting on weight too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Letting herself go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, she would never do that. She would...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't trust her to stay beautiful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, ten years, she's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Down the drain (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd have more trouble calling Katie, Katie than I would Susie, Susie, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think - I tried to figure that out too. Katie's heavy set, you know, she's - just the other day, she was in Integral Foods, and I feel strange when I start talking to her. I know she's in therapy because I know she's - I attribute that to mean that she isn't a dummy about herself. Like, that's what I think happens in therapy I guess. And she was in there and I start, you know, I said hello and all that. And she - well, I couldn't understand why she was on the north side. So I asked her and she said that she lived up there, but that she wasn't living with her husband, though. She broke up about a week ago. Which, you know, like, for her to tell me anything personal about herself, this is twice in a row. 0:35:21.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was (inaudible at 0:35:23.7) being in therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, the other thing was when she said that, "We Want You Back." That was the last time I talked to her. But that's another thing, like, I think I could talk to her if I was willing to concede the fact that she's human. You know, or if I was willing to let down some of my things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what does that mean? If you talk to her, does that mean that you're going to have to take her out or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel strange with her because she's a good friend of Cronan's, and I really wonder if I'm talking to her, you know, because I like her, you know, or am I just kind of, you know, trying to relive a few past things, find out what Cronan's doing. See, because I know, I just got to hear her name, but it still, you know, it stills gets me a little up in the air. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying is that you're not really interested in Katie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what I tell my mind, you know, and I think that's one of the reasons why I figure, okay, since I'm not really interested, I'm not going to be a hypocrite, therefore, I'll keep her at a distance. Sylvio was also a good friend of Jackie's. And, you know, like, I...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it doesn't seem to you like you can be a friend to a woman as you could to a man, huh? There's always another connotation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A romantic or sexual or something? 0:37:04.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more difficult, there's two people in our unit that I feel, like, friends toward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sixty years old?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, one's good friends with - but I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, both of them. But there's another one, the one that's 45 who I consider my friend, but, you know, is like no sexual connotation. But it was funny, like, last Friday I was going to go to lunch, so I said, "Hey, anybody want to go to lunch?" Shelly Martinez always goes, I've never seen her not go to lunch. She says, "Yeah, I'll go." And so I said, "Okay, let me see if I can get some people." So I walked around and I couldn't find anybody to go to lunch. And I came back and I said, "I'm feeling ambivalent." And I says, "I don't think I'm going to go."</p>

<p>Well, then a couple more people - well, she - Shelly said, "Well, you know, I'd still like to go." And I said, "I'm feeling ambivalent." Then a couple more people came by and they said they wanted to go to lunch. I said, "Okay, let's go." And Shelly said, "I can't, I'm going to the bank." Which, for her, you know, I'm sure she knew what was going on. And the first time I've ever known her not to eat lunch. And so I didn't say anything, but I knew that for some reason I didn't want to have lunch alone with Shelly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she picked that up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because all afternoon she gave it to me about the word "ambivalence" about three different times. But I never really said - I said, "Okay, (inaudible at 0:38:48.6). There's something here from this morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what did (inaudible at 0:38:54.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's so unlike her, you know, it's unlike her to do something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so what did you do about it? Did you talk to her about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't think it was a big point. It was a point that I knew about, and that I knew I wouldn't do it again. But the thing I wondered about was not so much what Shelly felt, was why the hell I didn't want to go to lunch with her. 0:39:16.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, why didn't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I thought about it, but I couldn't...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:39:28.8) like to go to lunch with Shelly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, I looked at it three different ways. All right, I said, number one was that if I go to - you know, if I would - first of all, it was just this indecision as to whether I wanted to go to lunch or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, that's not it or you wouldn't have said, "Hey, anybody want to go to lunch?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I can't say that. All right, the indecision started as soon as I knew I had to go...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With Shelly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With Shelly alone to lunch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not lunch, it's Shelly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because if it would have just been lunch then I wouldn't have gone in the first place. It's not like my ma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then why did you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's the first thought I had. And then I reacted...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what is it - what would it be like with your ma, what do you mean it's not like with your ma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right now, like I think of my ma in two different ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think of her in the old way where I go home have a good time, and just be joking with her all the time and never really take her seriously. Now I think of her as one of the chief reasons why I don't like myself very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the fellows as opposed to a rich (ph)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I take that first part, though, "One of the fellows."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Change it, correct me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:41:48.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so how is Shelly not like your ma? 0:41:51.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shelly...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:41:53.3) lunch with her and not (inaudible at 0:41:55.7)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's very insightful, you know. She's constantly making me aware of my own screw-ups.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you might have to concede a point to her or two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never won one argument with her. I've never won an argument with (inaudible at 0:42:20.6). Because she refuses - she absolutely refuses to - you know, to admit that she's ever wrong. And so I can't do anything. She just - twice I've - you know, I've had her and I proved that she was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She wouldn't admit it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think those are superficial. It's more I have trouble thinking of Shelly as a woman. And yet she is an unmarried woman of about 50.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so why do you think she's unmarried?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't willing to ask her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew already, she'll never admit she's wrong. Who wants to be married to somebody like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wonder if that's the way she's been all the time. Like, I've always thought of that as being - I always thought Shelly never had any weak points, never, ever, ever. But the last week, she's mentioned three times, which I've never before heard her mention, things, like, to her friends (inaudible at 0:43:48.9). And it's just a bare illusion, like, "I've got problems of my own."</p>

<p>Or it will be something like, "Those aren't quite my kinds of problems" as though something is bothering her. And I notice that when I bring some of my books - I read books at noon (ph), and most of them have been on, like, analysis and stuff. She'll take a brief look at them. And she always says that if she would ever get into therapy, she said she don't think she would benefit from it. 0:44:25.2</p>

<p>Because she said she would turn it on the therapist. And I've always thought of her, you know, as a rock. But I know - like, I kind of feel almost that when it would come to her own sexuality - you know, I don't know how I feel about her that way. And I just - I would be very leery to bring that up because I think that's the point she doesn't have guarded that well. And it's, like, almost - you can become personal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you think that that would have come up if you had had lunch with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, but it would have to be, like, become really - there's a level that I can talk to Shelly, like, when I left work and all this stuff. And I think it's, like, at a personal level. But for some reason, there's a certain area or certain point or a certain way I feel [by letting] (ph), you know, it must have been part of it. Maybe, like, I was afraid of being alone with her, not so much because I would run off at the mouth, which I usually do, you know, but maybe that I thought she would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to hear...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but (inaudible at 0:46:31.4) with her, I mean, I don't think she would do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if she did, you might be kind of interested?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you mean - you mean, like, sexually interested?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, well, maybe that connotation would come later in your mind anyhow. Like, I guess the feeling that I get is that you're only interested in - really interested in women that you can ultimately go to bed with. And you know that you wouldn't want to go to bed with Shelly, so how could you get interested in her? It's kind of like a, you know, a reversed logic or something like that. No, I don't mean really get interested in her sexually, but maybe someplace in your mind there's that fear that you would when you know that you really don't. So you better not get interested in her as a person or you might get hooked against your will. 0:47:32.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, vaguely and it's going to slip away, but I think that comes close because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's like a fear of getting involved when you know you don't want to, and that it's a sexually involved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the friendship in your mind leads to a sexual involvement, so you can't get friendly or you get involved sexually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's what you don't want to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it's, like, if I did - I never thought of it quite that way, but it was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you did, what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I mean - well, the way I even said it, you know, it was like it might get around to her not being married, which is what I, in some way question her being a woman. And maybe, you know, maybe it's more my fear than her own. But maybe she's got that fear too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When shall we meet next? Do you want to make it this Thursday or a week from Thursday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see, (inaudible at 0:49:16.3). How about this Thursday (inaudible at 0:49:22.8). Oh, wait a second, no, I can't because I've got - I think I've got to pick up some skis. Better make it - because I wouldn't be sure if I could - I'd just be curious to see what would happen if I had (inaudible at 0:49:36.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, we usually make it around - what time do we make it, six or five?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Five, about 5:10, that's when I'm usually done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that was a weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not a weekend?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Can you manage?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can get it on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How have you been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been doing pretty good.  I was in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had, um, well I had pains in my chest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I never had that before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so they didn't find anything wrong with my heart or my lungs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I still have that cough and it won't go away.  It's actually getting worse, but I cough a long time, but it won't stop unless, unless it run its course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  And how long does it usually take for it to run its course?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'll say about one or two minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you ever have a period of several days or weeks where you don't cough at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's very worrisome -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't smoke.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I mean it's been there for a whole year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they have given me all kind of medication.  They have taken blood.  They have taken anti, uh, a heart and my lungs and I'm still coughing, but it's my throat itch and my tonsils itch -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I cough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did the antibiotics help at all?  Not really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The one I think they gave me the other day, it helped more than any one and I forget the name of that one.  It looked like a little, it looked like a little bird's eye with a little hole in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a funny looking little pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it was an antibiotic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Antibiotic, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it had a hole in the middle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little hole and it looked like a bird's eye, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was white.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't picture anything that looks like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I should have, I thought to bring it.  I forgot.  I should have brought it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If that was helping though, you might want to let them know that it helped.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it helped better than anything I've taken.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because before I would, uh, cough and cough and cough and it wouldn't go away.  Now I cough and cough, but it'll run its course, but it'll stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On my way here, I was coughing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it finally went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're pretty sure that pill that looks like a bird's eye is an antibiotic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it something like amoxicillin maybe or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Augmentin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, what is the name of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Azithromycin maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I know, oh, I never heard of this pill or seen it, but it looks like a little bird's eye.  It's really white -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it had a little -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a little hole in the middle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  It's not always through, but it's like a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a dent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tip of the pen and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, that's interesting.  If it's helpful, I'd give that doctor's office a call and say is it possible to get some more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because sometimes people need to take it for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll, I'll ask my, uh, primary doctor when I go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good idea.  When's your next appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good, good.  So it sounds like the chest pain and the cough are the main physical things that have been bothering you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Any more chest pain since you got out of the hospital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't had any chest pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Only thing I've had that cough and now the phlegm is coming back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does the phlegm look like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it's white, and sometimes it looks kind of yellow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay, you want to let your primary doctor about that too for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I am, plus I go to see my ENT tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.  Is that about the thyroid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I had the test on the thyroid and they said everything was negative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I have, I want to see him about my throat, why am I still coughing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Are you allergic to any medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I know of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've taken penicillin.  You're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Make sure I have that up to date.  How's your depression been doing with all the stress and the hospital and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was saying, I was saying how I was going to ask you if you think that, uh, Xanax makes me cough?  It didn't at first, but I mean I'm just.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually not, and the Lexapro doesn't usually either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Although once in a while, it can aggravate cough a little bit for people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember if you ever had the cough before you started Lexapro because you started Lexapro with, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I cough?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I had a cough then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's been going on since before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a long time, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] also wrote a note that at one time you took Paxil.  Do you remember anything about Paxil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I took it, but, um, then she took me off of it because she didn't think it was doing what it should do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Did it seem like it worked for a while or did it just never really -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It never really got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kicked in, yeah.  Okay.  Do you remember -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I was just wondering if why I cough and then my tonsils and then my tonsils will itch and then I cough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's strange, isn't it?  My right tonsil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds more like an infection.  It really does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's why he gave me those antibiotics because I think he thought it was like, and then too, it might be, but they can't find nothing because my throat is, uh, my throat it itched, and then my tongue -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is like somebody done scraped it off.  I don't know if you could see it or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see.  Is it back in the back where it's been bothering you most?  Point to where it's been bothering you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In my tonsils.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You see, can you see back there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where, uh, I have, on this side, it look like pus on there.  I told every doctor could they see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have a pen knife.  Let me, uh, not a pen knife, a penlight.  Let me take a look.  I can shine it right back there and see what we can see because if there's white back there, that often is a sign of a strep throat kind of a thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, do they have medicine for that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you know what I've been doing, I've been gargling with salt and water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's supposed to be good for it too.  I don't see my penlight.  I know I have one in here somewhere.  When I moved the office, I put everything away and now I can't find anything.  Ah, here we are.  I got one.  All right, open up and say ah.  I do see what you're talking about.  You do have a little bit back there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but they, everybody say, no I don't see anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me compare it to the other side.  Go ah again.  Yes, definitely one side has it and the other one doesn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because they said they don't see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had, not 100 doctors, but they look at it and they see I don't see anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's all white [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.  I think you could benefit from an amoxicillin prescription.  What I could do is write one and then you can tell your primary doctor on the [DATE] if it's been helping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if it is, maybe they'll decide to give it to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that green?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me think.  I think it usually is a white pill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's probably a generic at this point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you try a green one before?  Did you have a green antibiotic before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was, uh, they gave it to me when I was in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it didn't, it didn't, it didn't move that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so the doxycycline didn't do very much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Amoxicillin just might do the job for your throat because that's usually -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How we try to treat that white -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Crust, which usually is a strep infection, and that could have to do with your cough also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that will help it out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It should.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's my pleasure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I tell everybody and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about the dose?  Excuse me, I'm just going to look in this, I think there are a couple of different doses available and I'll try to figure out the one that would, uh, fit best for your situation.  Yeah, it's inexpensive.  It's generic.  I'm looking at Amoxicillin.  All righty.  Upper respiratory, yeah.  Now you usually take the Xanax 3 times a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well when I, uh, they gave it to me, they told me to take it 2 pills in the morning and 1 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When, when I eat my dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I take the Lexapro when I eat my dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Perfect, and that's really helped keep the depression and anxiety under good control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Paxil didn't really work.  You had the Xanax along with the Paxil, but the Paxil still wasn't helping it looks like.  Do you remember trying any other antidepressants, Prozac or Zoloft or Celexa?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You tried Prozac?  Do you remember anything about how that was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE] because that was last year or the year before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't remember the results.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes when people who are on Prozac for a while, it worked for a while and then stopped working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, but it sounds like Lexapro's worked the best out of all of them so far.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've been doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good, yeah, and it doesn't seem like it's been interfering with your other medicines -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Either.  I got some samples for you this time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, as well, and also, um, could you use a calendar?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's a month at a glance, and then, like keeping track of your appointments, and things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had one.  I said I didn't get a calendar for this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For '09.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is for '09, so that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, because I have to put them on there so I can remember.  As soon as I get my, I write my, uh, dates down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's very good.  So amoxicillin, we'll give 500 mg and you can take it at the same time you take your Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One in the morning, 1 at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that for my throat?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I definitely see that white.  I definitely see it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's been there a long time, and they, they say they don't see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's, it's very, very clear.  There's a difference.  And what I'll do is I'll write a note that you can take with you to your doctor on the [DATE] and I'll just explain what I saw, and why I started it because if you've been taking it up till, and I'll write so you can take it up till the time that you see your doctor there, um, you m might even need a refill.  Okay, let me do one refill, one times one, and, um, then you can let them, I'm going to write down what I saw because it may look better by the time, hopefully and be treated.  So it may not show up when you see that doctor, but I'll write down that I saw it and why, for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And hopefully the cough will be better too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Shall I write you prescriptions for the others as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You okay?  I just saw you put your hand on your stomach.  You all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a hard time with, uh, that, not diarrhea, constipation.  I have a hard time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take anything for that?  Do you take a constipation medicine like Colace?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I take, um, what's the little red pill?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be a Colace, uh, docusate sodium would be the, um, generic name.  Another thing that's really good if you don't use it already is the Metamucil.  Have you seen that before?  It comes in a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what my sister use.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good fiber for your diet, and it works well with the Colace.  It's perfectly okay to use both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, stir into your juice in the morning, or even into a glass of water.  They make some kinds that are flavored, like there's one with a nice orange flavor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that would probably be helpful if the Colace, you know, when you describe that red pill, that's a common color of, of a stool softener.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But this is also nice because it gives you bulk and it's healthy for your colon, uh, to use the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, Metamucil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and they even sell Metamucil biscuits.  They're actually pretty good cookies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that's actually in the supermarket right next to where, they have the kind you can mix in your drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's a possibility too.  Okay, the Lexapro is 10 mg, 1 daily, and the Xanax, and are you still taking Lunesta at bedtime sometimes for sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I need to because sometimes [INAUDIBLE] until I can't go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I use, but I said I was going to start it.  I started to use it every other night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So I'll renew the Lunesta as well, and you've been taking the 2 mg dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you still go to the Walgreens, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That's excellent.  Okay, I'll get the prescriptions written up.  Do you have plans for the holiday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, uh, some girl I work with, she invited us to her house for Christmas Day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But usually we go down to Virginia, but since I haven't been feeling well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We just haven't been in a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my oldest sister's not doing well.  I'm not feeling well.  I said let's just not, but we always go every Christmas, and, uh, my sister, oldest sister's there, and my sister in laws and nieces and nephews and we go from house to house, and that's all we do is go from house to house and eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  It sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have to feel up to it.  You have to feel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Healthy enough to be able -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I didn't, we didn't go last year because I didn't feel good.  So, I hope I can go soon.  I talk to her every, every day or every other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's she holding up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's doing pretty good because her two daughters are there with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Let me write that note for your primary doctor too.  I've forgotten, what's your primary doctor's name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], okay, and I think she spells it [DEIDENTIFIED].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All righty.  Let's see I should have a little thing with stationery.  Maybe it's here.  Yes, I got it.  Have you had any fever that you know of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Even when I was in the hospital, I didn't have a fever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, please excuse me.  It sounds like my cell phone going off.  It's [PHYSICIAN NAME].  Uh, yes, can I give you a call back in a few minutes?  Okay, thanks.  Bye bye.  I'm giving her my, uh, phone number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm just explaining what I saw.  The, um, swollen left tonsil, the persistent cough and the white film.  They call that an exudate.  That's what I put down, and so I explained that I started the amoxicillin twice a day at that point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and there's a refill on here as well.  If there's a snowstorm or something and you can't make it to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that day, keep taking it until you have a chance to talk with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's about the antibiotic.  I'll keep that prescription separate and then, uh, I'll write up your other ones too.  Would you like to do copay today or have a bill sent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Could you have a bill sent to me because it's holiday and I got to buy gifts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  A lot of people are opting for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm not buying, but I buy my sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my godchildren.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My god, one of my goddaughters got married Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.  Where is she living?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you get to see her from time to time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she, uh, she graduated with a master's degree from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  That's a wonderful school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You must be very proud.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is a famous school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All my godchildren have their master's degrees.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Chip off the old block.  They've got good, good gray matter too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I tell them go get your education so you could take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's exactly right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and one of them is [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  One of them is a social worker.  She got her master's degree and the other one, she works for the county, with the bad kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You must be very proud.  They're doing a lot of good in the world.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, they are.  They are, and all of them attend church, all of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Faith can be a very important support.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I tell them, they said oh, [PATIENT NAME], I tell everybody, my godchildren got master's degrees.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's wonderful.  Well, you have every reason to be proud.  That's fantastic.  All righty.  And there's the prescription for the others, and then would you like to meet again in about a month or so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let's find a time that works well.  My book is around here somewhere.  Here we go.  How about 11:00, because around 11:00 is okay for you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tuesday, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll write that on a card for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you could also put it in your calendar if you want to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my pleasure.  So here is the bag with the samples, bag with the calendar and now I'll put it on an appointment card and you can have it all in one spot.  Tuesday [DATE] at 11:00 AM.  All righty, there you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's my pleasure and I really hope you feel better.  I think those antibiotics might help.  Sometimes it's a question of staying on long enough to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kill off that thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Somebody was saying sometimes you have to be on them a long time before you, but, uh, I appreciate you about the Xanax and the Lexapro, plus it makes me feel much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  If we can treat the depression, as well as the medical illness, they both get better, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's so many people have depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  I know.  A real -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some poor girl was out there, she was crying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, oh my goodness.  It's something, I told, uh, I said to, um, my girlfriend, I said I don't know, why is it that everything I have in my family, nobody has nothing but the, the, uh, diabetic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said I have everything and they don't have nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the diabetes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I says oh, I, now when I was working, I was fine, but then I guess when you're not around people a lot, because my girlfriend, we used to go out each one's birthday and we'd pick a restaurant that we'd never been, and we wouldn't tell the person where we were going.  They didn't know until they got there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, we used to do that all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you still do it even though you're not working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see I can't drive my car no more [INAUDIBLE], but I have girlfriends that, uh, we still go, but not, and then I have one girlfriend, I'm going to go see her.  She has Alzheimer's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's very hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, and my other girlfriend called me, said you think we should go?  I said we'll go before Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't want to go see her, but I know I should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what's really good is to go together with someone else -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because then you enjoy spending time with that other person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your girlfriend, she may or may not recognize the 2 of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But at least you're there together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To support each other, and maybe being in the group with you would help her memory even more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because she's used to being with you all as a group of friends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We used to, um, work at a paper company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, we used to, um, if the machine was to break down or, the packing machine, both of my girlfriends, the two, all three of us, we would be the first one to ask the boss supervisor, could we go home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We didn't go home.  We kept on going just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing like having a group of friends like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said oh, and I feel so sorry for her, and I think about myself.  I said Lord knows I hope I don't get Alzheimer's and my mother was [AGE] when she died, and she was just like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then that's a good sign.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was on the ball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, if your family has a good history that way, then it's less likely that you would have it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My, my mother was on the ball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, she was, I remember the day she died.  She was in the hospital and she says to me, I went there before I went to work second shift, and she just kept saying you're going to be late.  You should go ahead.  I said well, I'm not going to be late.  It's only five minutes away, and her and I would talk.  She didn't seem like she was sick sick.  She had been in the hospital a month, but she wasn't like sick sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They did find out she might have to go on the dialysis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, so the diabetes had really gotten to her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, she talked and every time we would talk and then she'd say you're going to be late.  You got to go, and I'd say yeah, I'm going to go in a few minutes, and I, I think her last day and I kept staying there and talking, and kept me telling me to go.  You're going to be late for work.  I said I have never been late in 20, 30 years.  So she says I told you I'm going to go and I will talk to you later on.  That night my mother died.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I said to my, I think she was trying to get me to go so I wouldn't be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes people find it harder to die, to leave the earth when a soul that they love is in the room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think sometimes it's, I know what your faith is, sometimes it's just between the person and God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they're waiting for that opportunity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And maybe she was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, I think she was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because they called 4:00 in the morning.  I said can't be because she just, I was there and I left there at 3:30.  Well, I had to be at work at 3:30 and I left there at 3:20, and they called my sister 4:00 in the morning.  I said this can't be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four o'clock in the morning is a very common time for people to go and I think it has to do with the people who have been sitting with them, you know, themselves might doze off or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's very common.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my sister and I both worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] and we worked different shifts all those years so we could be with her if something happened.  She wasn't sick sick for years, but she was [AGE] when she died, but she wasn't sick, but we never worked the same shift so we could be, one of us would be at home or near home or somewhere she could get in touch with us, and, uh, when I used to be off, and my son and I and her, I said we were going to [DEIDENTIFIED] tomorrow, [DEIDENTIFIED] and she, I said you have your things ready?  She said okay, my mother would be ready before we would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So we, I always took her, always took her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You all took good care of her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes, but I always tell my grandmother was mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mother's mother, she was real mean.  She didn't like my father.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's so sad when people do that, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know why she didn't like my father?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he was the same complexion I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have a beautiful complexion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she called him old black devil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's so sad when that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see, you know, I had a nice father.  He died early.  He died, he was [AGE].  He had heart condition.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, my, my grandmother, but he wouldn't pay no attention to her.  He'd laugh at her, and he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He would -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He knew that was ignorance talking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He would laugh at her, and he called her, her name was [NAME OTHER], and he called her, he called her [NAME OTHER].  Oh [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not even thinking about you.  That's what he, he never got mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for him, good for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He never, ever got mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I just wish she had seen that he was a good husband and father.  If he made your mother happy, that's what matters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what matters.  That's all that matters because she didn't like him.  She gave my mother a church wedding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she did.  My mother had a church wedding, only one of her sisters that had a church wedding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll be darned.  Then don't you think maybe she did like your father more than she let on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess she did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she, yeah, she did -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She gave him a hard time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, she gave everybody a hard time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, she, she, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She wasn't afraid of nobody, nothing.  If she'd see a snake out there in the tree, she'd get over to the tree and knock the snake down and kill it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My grandmother was something.  She was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A snake doesn't stand a chance against her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, and my aunt, my oldest aunt, she was almost like my mother, my grandmother was almost like her, but my mother was altogether different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She sounds like a lovely lady.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I says to them, we never, my mother, you know how people grow up, and my mother never went any place without us.  If we couldn't go, we didn't have enough room in the car or the truck, my mother didn't go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She stayed home with us.  If we couldn't go, she didn't go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was very devoted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was there all the time, all the time she was there, and she taught my brother well.  Like kids today don't have anything to do.  All of us had children.  There was six of us.  My oldest brother, he moved to [DEIDENTIFIED] when he was like [AGE] I guess, but it was seven out there, and my mother cooked three times a day.  We had, we had food three times a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was a resourceful woman.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We had chickens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We had cows.  We had pigs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had a full place yourselves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We didn't know, my mother cooked hot biscuits three times a day, and we, my father, thank God, and people would come by, that's why, but people don't help people today.  I remember my father coming in, whoever come past, they stop.  He said come on out in the garden and get something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mother would tell them at holiday time, you come and, uh, get some chicken, or they come past, you give him eggs or butter, and, uh, at Christmastime down Virginia, at that time, it's not like that no more, everybody, you went to everybody's house, all your neighbors.  Every night we'd go to the one's house.  The next night they'd come to our house and for dinner, and my mother always had a whole lot of food.  They would have a lot of food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a wonderful tradition.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We had, we had 25 cakes at Christmastime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And people come, my mother set the table.  They all go in and sit down and have some food, and my father planted a garden.  It had tomatoes, string beans, everything, and my mother canned it, you know, in the can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so we had that all winter.  We didn't go to the store.  We never had, we would go to the store maybe once, like at Christmastime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were self sufficient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We had everything.  My father planted a garden in the summertime and in the winter, every summer we ate, there was no, there wasn't no, uh, chemicals in it.  We ate fresh food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's organic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fresh food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we had the cows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, there goes that cough again.  Would you like me to get you some water.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would you please?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's get some water.  Yeah, there's a fountain out front.  Shut this off.</p>

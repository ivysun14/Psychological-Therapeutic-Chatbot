<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less than an hour and fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's how I know it's like pretty much exactly a 22 minute walk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "Well, I can just leave, like, 30 minutes ahead and—or like 40 minutes ahead, and that becomes leaving 20 minutes ahead." (laughs) (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—yeah. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: James is selling all the furniture, which is good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we had known that we were—that we didn't want to keep it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like a bunch of just like—a combination of a bunch of stuff we got like second-hand and stuff that—we got second-hand and like is really not—we just don't want any more and, you know. So we're keeping like my grandparents dining room table.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:00:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I insisted that we keep the Lazy Boy that James got for $25 because I love it, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and, like, the bookshelf that my mom and my uncle built -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —we're keeping, even though it's kind of a crappy bookshelf -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like, we're keeping it. But James said it was—what's amazing is, you know, he puts a bag—an ad on Craigslist, and there's a lot of work with him, like, you know, responding to e-mails and such. But then, like, people just like show up, and they give you money and they take your stuff away (laughs). [00:01:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) It's too perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So it's very satisfying—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, by proxy (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still doing ok -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember having like a yard sale or something like that once. It's like, "Oh my God, they're paying money to take our stuff away that we don't (inaudible)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. James was saying that he found it—he had found it hard in the past to get rid of the stuff for free.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, if you post something as free, people won't take it. But if you charge them -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —10 bucks for it, they're all over it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So—great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm, you know, doing not quite that well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But doing ok. I applied for a job in publishing, which is great. It's a field position in like—for publishing with—something like an assistant, which actually is a job that I'm very well-qualified for. There's just not very many of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. [00:02:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But there are a couple coming out now, so I did that and interviewed, and left my planner at the place where I interviewed, which was awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—more awkward when I went back in there. Like, "It's not here. We don't know." And clearly, like, they thought, like, "Oh, she's this crazy person who doesn't have her shit together." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wanted to be like, "No, I keep track of this. There's nowhere else it could be." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I couldn't be like quite that firm, so this morning I got an e-mail saying, like, "We found your planner." I was, like, "Yes, the world is saved." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's a bad thing to lose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although when I thought about it, there was less that I couldn't afford to lose then I thought there was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it was more like the emotional anchor of feeling like I had stuff together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A security blanket?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:03:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Very much so. (pause) I baked last night -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which I haven't done in forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. There's stuff to do -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which always makes me feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Creating giant messes in the kitchen, always a good time. (pause) Everyone is really excited about this and I'm not as excited about it. I'm trying to be ok with that. I'm trying to be like—leveling with James about that, and he's ok with that. It's just that I don't actually think it's going to happen (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:04:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't—I—I don't think I will think it is going to happen until he's been here for awhile. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I see (inaudible) on the window?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. That's ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I can't tell. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. You know, I'm afraid to (pause) let it actually happen. I just—I'm afraid to think that it will happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I talked with Candace (sp) last night. She—she was refreshingly pessimistic in some ways in that (laughs) she's like, "Oh, this is wonderful." And then she's like, "Yeah, there's going to be a lot of shit that you have to do." (laughs) Like, "It's going to keep being hard."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Yes, thank you for, you know, validating that." But (pause) she's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [00:05:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny. We haven't like talked on the phone for a long time. And I called her last week and I was—I was not doing very well. And so I called her to kind of like talk to somebody, but I was like, "Hey, Candace, how's it going? I'm fine. Just walking back from a yard sale. Da, da, da." And so yesterday, she—she said, "You know, I don't really—I don't know—like there's some people I feel comfortable—like they really want to talk on the phone. And some people I feel like don't really want to. And I was putting you in the latter category, so it was so nice that you called, and like you seemed like you were doing so well." And so on one hand I kind of want to feel like—actually I called because I was really not doing well, but I didn't because I want to keep talking to her (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:06:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It was just a weird situation of—well (pause) I can't tell whether that was an instance where I diffused my own purposes, or furthered them. (pause) Yeah. I don't really know what to talk about today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm surprisingly good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also, you know, waiting for the other shoe to drop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're going to say, "What comes to mind?" (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) [00:07:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. This weekend is going to be a lot of work, probably. I just remembered on the walk over here that I have a canoe that has to get here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) That is one of the things that cannot stay behind (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Save a paddle for (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. (laughs) And—so I'm not really sure how that's going to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's going happen. But then when it gets—once it gets here, I'll find someone who will let me like leave it with them for awhile because canoes are bigger than I remember, ever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:08:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you can't just fit a canoe in your apartment. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I don't care how you do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Sounds like a (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: My—I guess it might have been my 21st birthday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was my 22nd birthday, but my dad just gave—my dad gave me a canoe, which we—which would have been like—I think he had forgotten my birthday (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like a canoe that I grew up with—has been in our backyard forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was great—it's a great canoe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really like canoeing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I remember you saying—you were talking about canoe trips you took with him, and his being a very capable canoer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) Canoer? I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't—I think people say either canoeist or paddler. Usually -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —paddler is just what people say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:09:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that could mean many things, so (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like many of my father's gifts, it's really inconvenient to transport (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "Couldn't you wait until I was 30 and give me this?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So (pause) but I am very attached to it. I like canoeing—and they're like $3,000. Like, they're expensive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—a—a new one. Even a used one is going to be between $500 and $1,000.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And it's older than I am, so—they last forever. [00:10:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—it needs some kind of repairs, but it doesn't look very bad. It looks really fine (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we've taken it white water—white water, and it doesn't look like it could sink.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Managed that. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, so that's just one of the things that I want to do, but I've never managed to. I've never managed to take it out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's one of my favorite—(pause) James and I usually fight when we canoe together, but we're working on that, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:11:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a good, like, couple (laughs) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's sort of resonant -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm much more experienced than he is. And he doesn't—it's not just that I'm much more experienced—like, when you grow up on boats, like you get a sense of the water -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that he doesn't really have, and a sense of like balancing in boats that's just a—a practice thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so—so like I don't—I'm not—I'm very unlikely to flip the canoe when I'm getting into it. And James is—I don't think he ever has, but if I weren't holding it, I suspect he would. And I'm not used to, you know, being the one giving him directions, and so I'm not always very good at it, and I'm not used to being the one giving people, in general, directions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:12:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And James is not used to being the one taking directions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But that's because he's heavier than I am. He has to take stern, which means that he's on—unless you're on white water, the stern is the person who's doing most of the—the—the work. Like he's steering, and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stern (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —yeah, so forth. So I have to kind of like teach him that while I'm in bow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. He needs more (inaudible) direction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are places around here you can canoe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. That's why it has to come here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, and also, I think, James's going to keep the car, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or I think so. We haven't talked about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I assume so. He's pretty attached to that car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He likes that car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:13:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know? He and his dad took the engine apart and put it back together once.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think it's kind of thing for—to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, not just for fun. Like they had something they had to do -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that involved taking the engine out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, there isn't much room on your resume for skills like—I know a lot about canoeing (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just boats in general (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I learned a bunch from my dad. I don't really know how to—I don't know much about outboard motor boats.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:14:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is one of the things where like it's very rare for me to feel like my dad really wanted a son, or like he -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know—the fact that his two older kids are daughters makes a difference. But like, you know, when Amanda was probably like 10, he taught her how to drive the—and outboard motor, because we had two boats. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So he was in one and she was in the other. And I—well, we only ever had two boats. I just never really learned. And like he tried to teach me and I just wasn't that into it, and it was kind of the age where like if I did anything wrong, he would really yell at me. And so I really didn't want to do it. Like, I hit my first rock and like that was it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I hit rock—he thought I hit a rock because I was going too fast. That was probably the case but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he flew off the handle. I was like, "I'm not touching that anymore."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was the end of it. But (pause) That outfit is pretty. Looks really nice on the (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For like a little bit of money (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like 25. [00:15:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we had a—a succession. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or more like three to four ones that were all ancient and in various stages of working -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three—was your house right on the water?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. We would go up North every year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we lived close to the river. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, in most places, isn't—isn't deep enough for much of an outboard -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The motor—</p>

<p>CLIENT: —motor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you can kind of get out to 15 on there -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —with a little boat, if it's light. So we did that a few times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And how—how much time did you spend up North? Were you there -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We didn't go this year, which was, I think, very sad for everybody. Like, more than they realized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:16:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I—I—last Thursday, you know, I had a really bad day and—saw you in the evening. I—I went home and just like immediately went up on the roof, you know, with dinner. And after a couple of minutes, I was like, "This is—this is why we need to go to the Bay, or, you know, someplace like that." But just being able to be alone out in the open or like under the sky, being alone, is just—I don't know. It's (pause) it gives me strength. (pause) Yeah. You know, I always—I usually feel just peaceful in a way that I don't almost ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:17:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even though last year (laughs)—last year, on the last day (laughs) we all almost drowned, so (laughs) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that the day you've mentioned -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —where you were out and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the motor fell off the boat (laughs) and part of the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and the weather was bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like the boat almost capsized. We (inaudible) in—</p>

<p>THERA.PIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your dad -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —had to go hiking for help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) It (inaudible) peaceful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know whether—that we'll—I don't know whether we'll keep doing that. And like we -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hopefully in a (inaudible) boat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) No. I know. That only happens like once every ten years, so (laughs)—maybe five. But the (pause) yeah. You know, we have to just like find some time to not be doing anything else. Or—or just be out of the whirl. I don't know. I don't know. It's very beautiful, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:19:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's the kind of place that like you don't take casual boyfriends. Or we don't, like Amanda and I (laughs). And everybody's going to judge you. Like everybody in the family is going to judge the boyfriend based on how well he does up North(laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a litmus test.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: James does well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like—it's not important to him in the way that it is to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Going up there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And it's—it's the—the—the getting there and getting back is such a long trip. Although, actually, now that we're in Boston, it's not that far. But yeah, it's—it's a long trip and usually it's a rough trip there and back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because everybody's like riding in the car, and there's usually like a dog in the car with us and like boxes everywhere. And like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like a big family car trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is exactly like that. [00:20:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But (pause) yeah. You know, that's like home for me in a way that I don't know any other place is. (pause) Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else did you do up there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fish. Last year, my dad had taught James and I how to fish. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We caught a lot of fish, which is good. Usually we fish and we don't catch anything. I think before I was born, there were like tons and tons that—it was like a really big sport fishing area. And then it got completely overfished. And so for most of my life, there haven't been many fish, but then they've been -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coming back. [00:21:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're coming back because it's pretty tightly controlled now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we fish. We sea kayak. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Amanda and I learned how to cook up there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On camp stoves, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and how—we learned how to do like fancy cooking -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because we just had all the stuff and just went to it. And I just—you know, I do a lot of just sitting and reading if I can. And—and it was just—it was amazing that—it just feels like you—you own the whole sky. It's really good. Usually some big fights. Or often big fights. I don't like those so much (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, there were some bad years. There was one year that—I didn't learn about this until like ten years later—or until a couple of years ago, that apparently my dad decided it would be a good idea to go off of his depression medication on a trip to the bay. And I was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember what he was taking then. I think it was, you know, something in the Prozac family. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:23:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's always—like, I recently had to be like, "No, Poppa. You cannot stop taking Lamictal abruptly" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"without telling people." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "No. You have a history of seizures. You take this for seizures. You can't stop." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not on Lamictal psychoactively, though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't—I think whatever he's on psych—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —for depression -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he talks with his provider and she's like, "Yeah, whatever. Do what you want."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that's a relief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he only talked like ten years later like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. About having -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think he's done this several times. Like he just doesn't—it doesn't occur to him that it might not be good. So that was the result of just—he was just—had a—like hairpin temper the entire time, and like, it was just so miserable. It was just awful. Like, everything we did—we couldn't do anything right. And Amanda was in high school then, and she was, you know, not doing well in high school, and her grades had just come, and they were bad. And like, he was like yelling at her about that, and the—ah, it was horrible. I think I was like 12 or 13. It was like—it was before—right before I went up to boarding school. Yeah. And when he told me about that, I was pretty pissed. I'm like, "Seriously, dude?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:24:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Not just—not just that he, you know, made a decision that made all of our lives hellish, but that, like, I always thought it was my fault. (pause) Either that it was my fault or that maybe he was just like this. And to be like, no, there—there's a pretty simple explanation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he was different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) He mentioned the other day that he's really anxious about his driving now, which I feel bad about. I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In response to what happened up here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I should feel as bad as I do, but I feel badly about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—I guess I'm going to start by—just because (inaudible)—of you're going from he did this thing back then, going off his meds and one of the worst things about it was, "I didn't tell you until much later so that you always thought it was, you know, much more your responsibility, or much more just what you would like (ph)." And, you know, rather than his having made a—I don't know, a bad decision, a selfish decision, something like that, I'm—I'm (inaudible) that the transition from that right to, "Geez, I said something—I mean, I said this stuff about his driving, and now I feel bad because I really hurt him."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:26:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In my mind, the transition was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I'm finally in a place where I give him advice about his, like, health, and he takes it. And, you know—his health and his decisions. And, you know, I don't want to like mess it up or give him bad advice or make him feel bad. But I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in my mind it's, "Oh my God, that wasn't as much my fault as I thought. He fucked up and didn't tell me about it," to, "Oh my God, I have hurt him," I think, by being—you know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —by—by laying responsibility on him, which I guess is, in a way, however gently or mildly—it (inaudible) of what you did. [00:27:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I wasn't very gentle about it (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. Fair enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—or for—for me, I wasn't very gentle, so I don't really know how that pans out as a -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that sort of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my basic point is like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —when you make somebody else—when you make your dad responsible, he gets hurt and you feel bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know (inaudible) is also—I mean, pretty important to know what you were saying about being (inaudible) and the way that feels like, "Oh," and the way that you kind of find, I think, a kind of strength there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It—it—it made me think of what you had been talking about on Monday about your spirituality as well, and being (inaudible) like this. I felt like you were—or it felt to me like you were kind of—or one of the things that lead you to a strength (ph) about it now, as well. [00:29:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's a—a point in the Eucharist—I don't know if you've ever been to a—a Eucharist or—or a mass or whatever -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have. I've seen a Eucharist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but there's a point right at the beginning of like the—the Eucharist portion proper where the priest says, "Lift up your hearts," and the congregation says, "We lift them up to the Lord." And that's why I go to church. That one moment. Like that's it. And like there's other—you know, everything else, too, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that's—that's about it. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what that's about for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That's why I go to church.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:30:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, I like the music. (cries)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Nineteenth century (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Terrible lyrics, really good harmonies. God, tell me what hymn is (inaudible)—like this is—this theology is really bad (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh—I can't say I know the 19th century.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, there's one at Easter that they sing a lot -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that if you don't skip some of the verses you end up with a line that's like—basically like the people who rejected the true messiah—"Deeply wailing, deeply wailing shall the true messiah see." And it's like, "Oh."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh (laughs). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to redirect my attention away from like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sinners in hell. We're not going to focus on that (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I was in—when I went to mass, I would take a Compline by myself and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. You would do what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say Compline it's an evening service -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. I know what that is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —by myself. It's—yeah, a short evening service. And then after awhile I was—you know, there was another woman who was Roman Catholic and I kind of talked with her—you know, "Would you like to say this with me?" She said, "That would be good." And then like the last couple of days—like four or five other people were like, "Can we be part of this, too," which was really nice. So I got some photocopies from my prayer books and left it there when I left. But one night, like, after we leave—we were leaving, this other woman, who was—she was like in her 60s, she was an alcoholic, you know, had been in and out, in and out, and was just this incredibly lovely person -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —yeah, just really good. But she kind of, you know, took me aside and started talking about Revelations, and like, you know, how you have to like resist Satan and the demon, and I—I don't really read Revelations very often, so I don't remember what she said exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I go, "You know, I'm really at a place in my life where I'm focusing on the parts of the bible that say rejoice." (laughs) She said, "Ok." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we both went our separate ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Where's the liturgy for the evening service that you did (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's—so it's based on the—the services that were developed in monasteries in like the early days of Christianity or centuries of Christianity. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where you would—you know, have a—a short service. I don't—I don't remember. But like when you wake up in the morning, and then at noon, and then in the like mid-afternoon, evening, and when you go to bed. And I think there might be one in the middle of the night, but most people don't really do that one (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless you're not—unless you're actually in a religious order.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Compline is the one right before you go to bed. And it's very beautiful and—yeah. Because when I used to, like, say it over the phone to my -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —(inaudible) and it would—it's pretty—it's a very popular service in some ways, because it's kind of short and easy, and you know, you can sing hymns, but you also cannot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:34:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At church that was the Sunday night service that we would have, that we were—all had to go to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It works better with other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know (inaudible). (pause) Yeah, you know, sometimes I find some kind of peace and sometimes I don't. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is your relationship with your spirituality and with God more important than you generally let on here? [00:37:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I try not to pretend like it's—I try not to pretend like it's not important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't hear you saying otherwise. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's—I mean, it's kind of a big deal being a—like, I mean it's—it's kind of what happens everywhere, like, it's just—it—yes, it is more important than I generally let on here. But I also don't—it's more important than I generally let on to anybody, other than like Amanda and James, and I guess Candace. Because it's not as though the public face of Christianity is exactly something that I want to ally myself with. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—in that this threat of, you know, mission and Christianity is—is saying that part of being a Christian is talking about it is something that I really am not comfortable with and struggle with. And the ways it plays out in history, I think, are pretty ugly most of the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah. Yeah, it's—it's really important. (pause) But it's not—it's not always really important. Like I—I don't—there's this—I don't know. There are kind of whole swaths of time where I don't think about it that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:39:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Swaths. Sways—I don't know how to pronounce the word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Swaths.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Swaths? Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't use that word (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where—where it's not—it's not like on the front burner, because it's like—it's so much an unanswered question and so much a question, it's really distressing to me, that I kind of put it aside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What sort of—like—like sort of—do you have questions about your faith?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to the superficial questions about your faith.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there are plenty of superficial questions (laughs). What the hell is this—you call the different kinds of robes, like I don't know, chasuble? What is a chasuble? I don't know (laughs). I don't know, but the—it's very easy for me to believe in God. It's very difficult for me to believe that God loves me. (pause) And it's very difficult for me to know what I should do if I believe in God. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of God wouldn't love you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I know. That's the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:41:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? My mind works it out, but it doesn't—or my mind—there's the—like there's the—the—the intellectual problem is really a problem with, like, Christianity and Jesus as the somebody who's important. And I don't know what to with that—that (inaudible). But then there's also the—yeah, if God exists, God loves me and—but I can't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) I can't accept that. Or I don't know how to. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aside from the complications, what does that feel like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty angry, and also so pretty bereft and pretty lonely. I stopped going to church for awhile because it was—I went—I think I was in college and I went to an Easter service, and I just felt so alone because, you know, Easter is all about—is all about the love of God. That's—that is what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:42:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I—I just doubt (inaudible). You know, and I go now in part because, you know, sometimes I find some kind of strength, and in part because intellectually I think it's important. You know, I think it's important to be in a community -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —if you believe in God. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what people are for. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To provide -</p>

<p>CLIENT: To -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —community? </p>

<p>CLIENT: —to be together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's—it's hard. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you worry that I will be reductive about these things by trying to interpret them? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) I hadn't thought about it, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:45:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the main reason I hadn't really talked about it is that I—I kind of—when I mentioned it the first couple of times, (inaudible) goes, "Well, I don't know," and did like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I—in the—I got the sense that you—you didn't really know very much about like Christianity -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and—or that you were trying to tell me that you didn't know very much about Christianity and that you were slightly uncomfortable with it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which didn't bother me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) And that was like way back, so—(laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) Do you remember how it came up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm sorry. [00:46:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's all right. We should stop for now because it's time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you let me know about (inaudible), I think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Just—yeah, tell me about it whenever (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. I should be able to do it tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Great. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm almost ready.  I have 12 more hours to practice, um, which is going to be today, tomorrow, Um-hum, and Thursday and Friday 3 hours a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How, how do you know when you're ready?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm almost complete.  Um, I've had, we've had classes and, um, each class like, um, was centered around something different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's me and 5 other people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No I mean when you're practicing and you say, oh, okay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm ready to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, well, I'm just, I'm kind of completing it right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I already practiced the left hand and the right hand is coming long really good too.  I'm practicing as much as I can practicing and practicing.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you break it down that far?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I practice 3 hours a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Take about 1 day off a week; sometimes 2.  It was, um, 3 days off in 2 weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This past time.  So I can't take any more days off until Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What are some of the, uh, changes or improvements you see with the, uh, medication, taking the medication and not taking the medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Um, for instance the other day, well, actually the other 2 days I forgot to take my medication.  For some reason I kept forgetting to take my medication.  It might have been even 2 or 3 times that I forgot to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And actually I, I know I took it this morning.  Um, I, I have a little pharmacy box that I put down p.m., a.m., p.m., and like I put my medication in there so I won't forget to take it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, that week that I did forget to take it a couple or a few times, um, I forgot to put it in there and I just trusted me just taking it and, um, my sleeping, um, arrangements were different—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was falling asleep too late like at 2 o'clock and waking up like early in the morning forgetting to take it, having to go back home and take it, it was horrible.  And, um, what I noticed when I sobered up from the medication, I was the way that I am sober.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, which is, feels like I'm high.  It's like, 'cause when I'm sober I'm high and when I'm, when I'm, um, on the medication, I'm like level, still high.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On a good high.  I feel high right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From the medication, it makes me feel good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meaning like se, sedated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sedated, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, exactly, I need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And so you're, you're sleeping good though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, sleeping is always fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even before I take—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And no episodes of hearing voices—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That no one else is hearing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seeing things?  Or any thoughts come in to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Either wanting to hurt yourself or hurt anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or paranoia thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  That's good.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The medication's good to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, no episodes of even feeling hypomanic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.  I'm level when I'm on the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, I'll do that.  Um, I'm going to give you a refill this time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see you in 8 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, the reason I had to cancel tomorrow's appointment and move it to today was because I have my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I work at [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, [LAUGHING].  I'm pretty happy about that.  Yeah.  As soon as I got my job, Um-hum.  I know I needed it cause, um, as soon as I came here like 21/2 months ago, I was trying to get my job and finally got it.  It wasn't easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, like I said before, my life coach that I talk to once a week, she kind of helped me, um, gather together some thoughts and, um, ideas of a new way, a more, um, organized and positive way of approaching, uh, interviews and it kind of landed me in the spot that I am right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she really helped me.  She was just bouncing back ideas that I gave to her, but still the way that she put it, it was great.  I wrote it down and everything and I practiced—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit before I went in and presto, now I have an interview and a job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I have a job now, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are the tips at that location?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I haven't worked there yet.  My first day is Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, I thought you started.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, first day Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How is the mother doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, she's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was your, your mother or your grandmother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that was my grandma.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how is she doing then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um-hum.  I just talked to my dad.  He just got out of the hospital.  I didn't know that, but, um, God, what does he have, um, it starts with a C.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which organ system?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I can't even remember.  He didn't tell me, um, but it was something that I've heard of before.  It's common.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, does it deal with the liver?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure.  It's with a C.  Psoriasis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sorosis?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sorosis?  Psoriasis?  Something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he drink alcohol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, all right.  May, maybe it is psoriasis, but that, if it is, that starts with a P.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Well, because he said it like that, I was thinking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Psoriasis, something like that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sorosis is of the, uh, disease of the liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the liver, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how did he sound to you when you spoke with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he just got out of the hospital and he was in there for 2 weeks and, um, I called him yesterday and he sounded okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sounded okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I doubt if it was psoriasis.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a skin disorder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, you're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Psoriasis is a skin disorder and it's funny.  [LAUGHING].  My friend said something about psoriasis that was funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it wasn't funny, like 'cause it's a skin disorder.  I remember it was like, I, I a lot of the disorders are like tossing around, my, my, both my parents were nurses and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was in a program that talked about like sexual diseases all the time and like I, I am like familiar with like that much 'cause the nurses and everything.  Being in hospitals and everything now, I know their talk and everything.</p>

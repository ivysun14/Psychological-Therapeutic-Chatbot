<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got the thing in the mail. The mid thing. I mean I was rough the other day. This is going to be my final session. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have decided.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have decided that I really feel that it was interesting what you said on the phone and how it is very common for people to sort of feel that the problems that they had or the issues that they needed to deal with at the beginning of therapy have either somewhat been resolved or other ones come into play and stuff. I really feel that a lot of those things, since I have been back, I have just been so energized and getting things done and even though some of that energy is a little chaotic because of the apartment and stuff, somehow that is fueling me. [0:00:58.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think now that there are issues that I feel that I need to work on now are more about me as a gay male and I think I want to discuss that with a gay therapist. Whether that is right away, I do not think so. I think I am just so much into my work right now and I have a couple of gigs already for the fall. Yeah. I just feel that I do not need this anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some way, the things that are of concern to you, you feel that I might not be able to understand. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I know you would not be able to understand because you are not a gay male. They are very specific. I am just not. I do not know if I am not [0:02:01.9] comfortable discussing that with you. I just want to discuss those things with someone who I know has actually either gone through them or knows exactly what I am talking about in a physical sense, spiritual sense, and all of that. I know that you would not be able to give that to me. So. But I do not think I am even ready. I do not think I need to go into that even. I am not going to like jump from this to that automatically. I might not start again until the spring or something. I just am not. I just feel like I do not need it anymore at the moment. Maybe I need a break. Maybe I since I am in this [0:03:00.9] new situation and not being homeless and technically I have to have a place in two weeks and I do not have one. I am pretty freaked out about that but it will work out. I am not going to be on the street but you know that preoccupying my mind and like work and these two music gigs, it is just that I am busy and like I said before, I think the busier you are the more you get things done. I do not want to occupy my time with stuff that I really do not think I need to occupy it with. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what does it feel like to tell this to me? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good. I do not know if I have any feeling. It feels well it [0:04:09.0] is hard to describe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now is that a question that</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good that I am able to feel like I am moving forward. I really do feel that. I know that I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well I know that that was a certainly a major theme that brought you in. A sense of feeling stuck. That movement has sort of been</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has been interesting reading about the first part of the mid career survey, mid session survey. The initial things that I think that I. Were those things just recopied? Was that actual stuff that I had written? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was exactly what you had put down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. God I thought, this sounds exactly how I would say it. I was looking at that and I thought damn, I do not feel that at all anymore. Socially, I am [0:05:05.8] out there more. I do not have that fear of going to an opening by myself or going to a private party or calling up someone. I really have changed. I sort of wonder if not being homeless too, I wonder if that, I think that has a lot to do with me triggering this too. Almost like I do not have a home, so my work is the only thing that I have. That is something that I will never lose and so I might as well hold on to it. It is interesting how I sort of </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your music you talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like my career as a musician. It is like someone, you can lose your house but you never really lose your work. I really believe that. So now I am just like diving right into it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your relationship to your work seems more alive? [0:06:01.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am confident. I am not as easy to get paranoid or upset about what is judgment or lack of judgment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking about other people's first impressions and judgments to you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Either responding or not responding at all. Now it is at the point where, not that I do not need it, I really think it is important to put your work out into the world for people to look at. I am not a critical towards people as I was before or it feels that way anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had a sense that you were sort trailing off since you were saying that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I am just thinking about this gig that I am doing at this [0:07:02.1] leather bar for the next month which I am really excited about. It is outside of the whole gallery museum space. The whole post modernist white cube. That sterile clean filtered environment. This is sort of the first time that I have actually taken my work and played it into a public arena outside of that. So I am very excited. It is in this place called. Oh, I have a card. That is me. It is in this place called Bluelight, it is the leather bar of the moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know this is very interesting because I wanted to just share some of my reflections about our work together a little bit. It is so curious to me [0:08:02.2] getting this invitation it reminds me that one of the themes that I found myself speaking about is the sense in which over the time of our working together this sense of the dynamic in which of feeling alternately invited, hence the invitation, invited in and then pushed away. This kind of back and forth kind of dance I felt like we were in. It seems particularly intensified in a way in the last few weeks when we did not meet that sort of almost connecting not connecting. In fact, when you called last week, after I had made several attempts to get in touch with you, I really had begun to have the feeling that I would not hear from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was just really crazed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then I got your phone call and it felt like an invitation back in and then the next day I got no I am not sure I want to do this. I realize this is [0:09:12.4] something that I had experienced I think throughout our time together. It struck me as interesting and I think in some way I guess made me wonder about this being a salient theme. That this is in someway a salient theme for you in general. I remember the last session that we were in you were talking about</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I just got back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and we talked about just our relationship in terms of talking and listening thing. We were talking about sometimes you are talking over me or my sometimes finding it hard to get an inroad. You had said that, "Well you [0:10:08.2] know that is something that I sometimes experience with other people." So all of these things sort of made me think about just wondering a bit about what any of this might mean or the significance of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you trying to say me sort of falling in and out of consciousness when it comes to like listening to people or acknowledging people? Like when you just said a while ago, "Oh you are like zoning out or whatever." Which is was not. I just happened to like look over there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Actually no. I </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that what you are talking about? [0:11:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not know if it is so much. In fact, I have a couple of reactions because I do not think that you were zoning out, I was just noticing a shift in your tone of voice and I thought something emotionally might be happening. Not so much that you are going in and out of consciousness. I think I am just sort of reflecting on these different ways in which it seems like we struggle with connection and this sort of coming towards and moving apart. It is interesting because you are coming in saying goodbye and then I get this invitation. I do not know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not see it as that. I just see it as coincidental that this will be my last visit and I just happen to have a press release to give you. Not that I needed [0:12:00.9] proof to show you that I am doing stuff. I thought this is sort of cute. Jules will be able to get at least a little tidbit of the outside of John's outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is like a communication about some other aspect of your life that does not </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This is like something that I am very excited about because it is not, like I said earlier, it is not in that post modernist white cube of the gallery space. That sterile environment where there are certain social codes and rules in terms of how an individual acts and responds to viewing an art object and interpreting an object whether it is a sculpture or whether one is in a cinema or whatever. Even though the gallery is a social space, the majority of those galleries are private dwellings. They are [0:13:04.1] owned by private individuals as opposed to the Momo or the Whitney. They basically are they private institutions they are public domain. In a sense this is the same thing as the white cube in the sense that it is a private enterprise but the fact that it is a bar, the fact that it is a leather bar, it has its own social rules. Even though it is a public venue, there are certain things that one does in those environments. It is just very exciting for me to play in the environment where there seems to be a lot of [0:14:01.6] clanage or excretions or claimage of components of that subculture that I bring into this sterile environment. Not necessarily to basically just play on display, it is more of sort of like taking these conventions and reinventing them and then throwing them into this video tape in this museum that happens to talk about violence in popular culture and how it is interpreted by artists. I am very much generalizing here. In terms of my work graphically and visually, this place really makes sense. In terms of what is going to be going around my installation. Basically these big guys in leather chaps with bare asses going in for a slap and tickle. (laughter) And thinking about making a piece [0:15:06.5] out of this piece. I am very excited about how I am going to be documented because the first two, the guy that organizes this party on Wednesday nights, it is called Fur, this guy comes in and uses the space and basically promotes the evening. It is basically his party. He is going to be very much a very powerful fag in the sense that he wants to basically create a power situation and then take it outside of that space and have these really huge parties on sort of a saint scale. Which was the sort of flowing party, there [0:15:59.2] was a club called the saint, you probably know that. Anyway he really supports my music and already he wants to buy some of my tracks for mainstream advertising. It is going to be good exposure. Again, it just sort of like breaking down the systems, or breaking down my narratives, or breaking down the discourses that I have created in a visuality and putting them into other markets. I really like that. Sort of marketing music in various ways. There is a lot of gay men that are involved with David in this whole culture of this party that have a lot of money and are very well connected. For the first time, I am not afraid to really go after that. Since I have been back, I have stopped [0:17:01.6] seeing some people that, well I have sort of been taking a break from them, people that are aware of their problems but they do not seem to move forward. They are like really clinically blocked. They are constantly complaining about not making enough money, not being in a relationship, you know just constantly whining. I do not need to be around people like that anymore. I really believe that affects one's psyche. It is all about being positive right now. A good example is actually dealing with this gig. David hooked me up to one of the guys who was going to do the video loop for me. The first two Wednesday's of this thing, it starts next week for four consecutive Wednesdays. The first two Wednesdays it is going to be this one piece, this baby piece that I did out in Portland. Well I need to make a video loop on an hour long tape because it is just constantly playing and the piece is only 30 seconds long so this guy was [0:18:05.6] going to do it for me. Well he is just one of these types that does not return your phone calls. I am not demanding that he returns the call like that day or whatever, but over the course of a couple of weeks, he has not returned any calls. That just irritated me and that is just the example. There is one thing about being busy and being occupied, it is not like he did not call me back in a couple of days. It was like me calling and this has been going on for like three weeks and he has not called me. That type of person, it is like no, no more, I cannot be bothered with them. You might have been thinking [0:19:01.8] about that with me when over the last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What just occurred to you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, like how I did not return the calls and how I was really schizoid and not showing up here and being crazed that week. Oh it was a mad house. At any rate, so yeah, there are a few people that I sort of put on hold. I am not feeling guilty about that. I feel really quite relieved. One of them is the guy that I stayed with for my first week here when I got back to Michigan. Yeah, when I am around those people, they just start to drown me again. I start to feel those feelings of how I was before the summer started and no way am I catching that virus again. [0:20:01.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I know that you mentioned in your last time that that was one of your concerns about continuing here that this setting and this relationship felt to you risky in terms of moving backwards and someway and again I know that moving forward, moving backward thing is a very powerful theme for you. I was thinking back to some of our early work together when you came in and talking about Danny and relationships.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went on with that a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember how </p>

<p>PATIENT: I needed to go through that though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you did. I think it was hard for you to let yourself in a way, but to process some of that, I thought, was really productive and powerful. I [0:21:06.7] recall how concerned you were then about slipping back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I could just like interject here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now my relationship with him is even better. Like going away for the summer. We call each other up. We are just like really good pals. We like gab and oh it is so nice and I think to myself sometimes, we will be sort of like just chatting, and then we will bring something up about our relationship that we had together. We are just so honest with one another now and it is not, we do not get upset. We still care and love for one another but there does not seem to be any underlying agenda. It feels really free and sometimes I think god, too bad it was not like this when we were together. [0:22:00.3] </p>

<p>It was not meant to be. I am sort of a fatalist that way I guess. To get to the stage we are now, we had to go through what we did I think. Who knows what is in the future. Maybe we will get back together. I do not know. I do not feel guilty about just everything being about me. Not that I put myself on the back burner, but those last couple of years I was just suffocating and drowning. I was saying to Kevin, who I am staying with right now, I wonder if I would have had the energy that I have now if I had just decided to give up my apartment and not go away for the summer at all. In terms of trying to like do the reinvention that way as opposed to going away for the [0:23:05.9] summer and resting and then coming back energized. Even though I am a nervous wreck over the fact that I have been at Kevin's place for two weeks, I know I would not have been able to handle this situation if I had not gone away for two months as opposed to walking out of my apartment but still staying in Michigan. Yeah, I feel like nothing can defeat me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of invincible? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not invincible but I am a tough cookie. It is like I am not. I can handle it. I guess there are certain things that I sort of like worry about like the money situation too because I do not know what situation is going to come up. How much money [0:24:07.0] I have and it is like I cannot afford to get a place through a broker. That is just astronomically expensive because I have other things that I have to deal with. Some things I am not dealing with at the moment. Things that I think that I can sort of put off for a while. I think it will work out. Yeah. Just to get back to what you were saying, I remember that at the beginning I was talking about Danny all the time wasn't I? I am trying to think of when we started like in April. End or middle of April? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember talking about him all the time. He would ask me, [0:25:03.7] "Do you talk about me?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I remember too a struggle that you had because almost every time you would say, "I do not want to talk about this." I do not want to go back. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think when I look back now I can now see myself speaking. I even would say this to him, "Don't flatter yourself Danny." to think that I do talk about you all of the time. Do not pat yourself on the back. I think in a way I was trying not to admit that. I did not want it to seem that way. It felt like that was what I was doing, like flattering him by sort of giving him power, the fact that I was talking about him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow acknowledging that he had an impact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On me yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But by the same token giving up your own feelings. The [0:26:05.9] trade off in order to not feel like he was having an impact on you was almost to not at times to not fully experience your feelings which are nobody's put your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you think of it is those terms, you sort of go god, why are people upset about or get so freaked out about dealing with their own feelings when they are just they are yours for you. They are not for anyone else. It is funny how we get caught up in that. I think that is a culture thing. Unfortunately. Especially, I do not know, I think for men and women, I think in terms of the genders, I think each is different. I got [0:27:01.8] this letter from my mother last week and she had photos from the summer and she was saying how it was nice that you were here for the summer and stuff and then she writes this paragraph saying that when dad, after he dropped me off at the airport, he came to my mother's office and because I did not get by with so it was this drawn out process. I would say goodbye to my sister and then a couple of hours later it was my brother and then the next morning it was my mother and then three hours later is was my father. It was not like one goodbye. It was like four sessions of tears. So when my father and I said goodbye at the airport and we were crying and he was hugging me and stuff. So my mother writes me and tells me that when he dropped by her office and my mother asked my father, "Well how is John?" "Is John ok?" He just broke down in [0:28:01.7] </p>

<p>my mother's office. He just like started to cry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that bring up for you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I thought about what you said to me when I was going on about my father and the sense that why should I feel that I have to make the 110 percent effort to bring up issues and situations that need to be talked. And then you pointed out, why can't he meet me half way? I really agree with that. Why should I feel like I have to do the full 100 dash? Whereas my mother does that. She does meet me half way at points. Starting conversations or. My father does not do that. He cannot he is so, he [0:28:59.2] is from that generation where he is just fucked like emotionally. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know so many of my friends fathers are like that. It is sad that whole 50's upbringing. Ooh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other piece of that, and I think I was wondering if maybe it is always safer to assume the responsibility than to want more and to be disappointed. I think sometimes knowing the feelings of longing when it does not seem that it can be satisfied can be so painful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. It is funny. I thought that was interesting that she wrote that. My father has a letter in the same envelope. Basically he repeats everything [0:30:06.4] that mom says and of course he says that, "I hope I am not repeating what mom says." I have not read her letter. It is like just say it you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it seems like your father's tears, that hearing that, even if you got it second hand, had an impact on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. My mother's letters are just so. She is the one that says do not make any compromises, like really stay with your goals. Very supportive verbally. You know they worry about me like any parent would with their kids. I am like the oldest of the experiment. The one that is living in Detroit, [0:31:03.3] that is homeless. (laughter) I would probably be a wreck if I had a kid in that situation. I am intellectualizing it. I do not know. I can somewhat relate to it. The thought of my brother, he is 21, I sort of feel for him that he is this little boy. He is still little Kirk. When he was six years old, this cutey. I still see that in him let alone I was 21 years old when I moved to Detroit with $500 in my pocket. My parents did not say no. I was an adult and they let me go. That takes a lot of guts. A lot of guts. I [0:32:01.7] know so many friends whose parents get in the way of no you are not doing that. You are foolish for doing that. Just totally bashing them. My parents never did that. They have made some mistakes along the way, in terms of discipline and whatever. Like I said, I am the first born. I am the try out. (laughter) Yeah. When I look at Kirk now, I was really looking at myself in Kirk while I was home and how he would come up to Farmington for dinner and as soon as it was over he would have to go back into Monroe because that was the city. Heaven forbid I am at mom and dads overnight. I can totally relate to that. And now the thought of him moving to Paris or he has done a lot more traveling at his age than I did, but I was just trying to picture him doing [0:33:03.0] something on the same wave length. God damn, I would worry about him. I cannot imagine if he was my son. I do not know what else to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how does it feel, you brought up saying goodbyes with your father, I wonder what it feels like to say goodbye to me? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. I had never really thought of that. It has not [0:34:01.9] really hit me. You have helped me a lot with certain things and I have never really seen it as a goodbye for some reason. I know that I will not see you again unless we run into one another on the street. I do not know. I think it would be weirder if we had a relationship for say five years or something like that. It has been for a very short time. Not to discredit that but I do not know. This is like my first time in therapy so I really do not have anything to back it up with other experiences. I am pretty neutral. I really do not know. [0:35:03.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not like I was coming to the doctor every week but yeah I do not know. It probably will not hit me until like a few weeks from now, that is when I will probably realize oh I am not. It is over. I think that is probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow it is hard to </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you might see me because I will be coming by dropping off money. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess I almost got the impression as you were talking that there is something about this that was just kind of clinical and then I thought of sterile and I thought of your descriptions of art galleries. About being a venue that did not feel as comfortable as this other one and you had opened up the thought of doing [0:36:01.4] work with a gay therapist at some point. I wondered if</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Not right away. I am not like leaping into that right </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well. Yeah. Whatever. I think I was just drawing some parallels and wondering about in what ways is this forum or this</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Is this like too sterile? No. No. I think it is just honestly me being graphic in the sense that this environment was good for certain things and I did reap benefits from it. Now that I feel comfortable with those things that I set out to sort of deal with by coming in here, I feel that I have a control over them. I know how to handle them or I am not afraid of them. They were just like these figments. I am being honest there. Now there are these other things that need working on and I know that [0:37:04.8] where I should go and get that help as opposed to staying here. Yeah. You could not help me with those. Yeah. That has been sort of one decision that I made. Because there are certain things in my lifestyle that they are not questions in terms of my own morals or values, they are really abstract. I really do not know what they are. They are feelings. I know what the feelings are but I cannot seem to describe them. [0:38:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you hope would be that you might</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just know a gay therapist would</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That there would be some immediate understanding in some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. I think I might be more comfortable in that environment discussing those issues with him and that is my choice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a feeling that I would argue with you on that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I just think I would be more comfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I wondered if the last time that we met, if in someway you felt particularly uncomfortable? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was just in the sense that I was back, fresh from the summer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was struck that we had that conversation, towards the end, [0:39:01.1] about again about the way we converse and we kind of mutually had come to this decision that maybe I would play a more active role in terms of catching you in certain points. I thought it felt like a real shift in terms of the way we were dealing with our relationship and thinking about our relationship. I remember from previous sessions where you had said, "I do not want to just be talking to a chair." "I want to get some feedback." I wonder if there was some mixed feelings about that when I began to take a more active role that there was not something a little uncomfortable about that as well. I know that</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. I do not think so because my recall to that is when I first started coming here I remember talking to my friends and a lot of my friends [0:40:05.6] saying, "I hope you have someone that gives you a lot of feedback." Hopefully you are not going to have someone that is just a chair. That you go in and then you just end up talking. You have to start everything. I remember my friends telling me their experiences or their representations of their therapists and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it is one thing to have an idea of what you would like and then there is the experience of the actual experience. I guess my feelings sometimes was that it was not as comfortable for you to talk than to </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sometimes. I really honestly was not uncomfortable here for I would say honestly for 95 percent of the time. Yeah. I mean I think sometimes [0:41:14.0] you maybe felt I was when I would sort of like black out or space out or pause. That tends to make people nervous when I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had the feeling that I felt nervous in those moments?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well some people have said that to me. Not necessarily asking you that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not know. It is possible I may have been but I mostly remember just being curious as to what your experience was. I felt that that was what we were both wanting to explore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They are almost sort of like mini meditations. It is not like I seek to do them literally. Yeah. Getting back to saying goodbye, I am not [0:42:13.7] </p>

<p>personally invested with you. I really do not feel that connection. I do not know if I was somehow unconsciously keeping this arms length policy. I do not know if I was doing that. Like I said before, it is like we have not really been together that long. It has not been that short of a time either. It has been. But I would be curious to see how I would respond if it was like five years which I said before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well in one way you choosing to leave and the sense is it is a decision about a lot of things. In addition, it is a choice that we will not develop [0:43:08.4] </p>

<p>more of a relationship. Right. It puts a limit to the possibilities. I think I said before, I was feeling like in some ways we were beginning to make contact in certain ways that we felt like we were struggling with for a lot of sessions. Kind of doing this dance and figure out how to work with each other. Maybe it is important for you in some way to </p>

<p>PATIENT: Since I am leaving like half way through, would I be coming back? I know if I had stayed for the full 30 visits, I think that I come back six months later or something like that. Like a follow up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think, I am not positive about this, but I think if you [0:44:06.4] drop out at this point it becomes it is it. It is not a complete. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It is an incomplete. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not a completed treatment, and the study sort of is based on the 30 sessions. So normally yeah if you were to do the 30 sessions, there would be some follow-up. What was your thought about the </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I just wondered if I would still have to do, since I decided to end it early, if that would still be in effect. If I would have to come back like six months from now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As for this follow up which I knew I would have to do if I was there for the 30. Yeah, I just feel like I need that I need to be on my own for a while. [0:45:10.6] </p>

<p>That really feels good to want that again, whereas, I know oh my god I remember when I started here in April. Oh god, when did I have my intake with like Alex? That must have been February or March. It must have because it was a while that week before I started seeing you. When I had those few intakes with Alex and then the few weeks before that, so it was almost maybe like in February probably when I first saw that ad in the Times or something. Damn, that was one hell of a winter. Beginning of fall is when Danny broke off with me so I was still really going [0:46:05.7] through it. And then just ooh. No work, a slave to my apartment. That whole gamut. I really do feel like I have come full circle. I am empowered again. I feel like I have moved to the city for the first time. Detroit is fab you know. Good looking men are asking me out. I am meeting new people. It is like oh Jules I just cannot believe how different it is. I keep saying this today. Yeah. You know, I mean she might be out on the street in two weeks but everything is fab. No problem, I can deal with that. I can handle that. Yeah. God. Now I am starting to really think about that time. I guess if [0:47:14.7] there is one thing that I might be starting to do is going to these queer AA meetings that a few of my friends have been going. It is funny because I ran into a friend of mine while I was in Toronto and I was telling her like a lot of the reasons that I needed to get away from Detroit. Basically this one word that I used was detox from the city, from my apartment, my friends, substance abuse, sex, all of that stuff. She said, "Well [0:48:03.2] John you know what would be really interesting for you to find out would be basically a test to see how soon you fall back into those patterns of behavior that you initially left the city to get away from. I have slipped a couple of times since I have been back. I really attribute this to really not being in my home. I am really starting to miss my things. I have been living out of a suitcase, Jules, since May 1st. So like being at Kevin's, I do not have my things around. Basically, I just have this mattress in this room with stuff out of a suitcase and a few cute pictures on the wall to try to personalize it. That is about it. It is hard to sort of really get anything done there or it is hard to get comfortable [0:49:02.6] there knowing that I am going to be leaving. So I find myself going out quite a bit. It is not necessarily going out and boozing it up. It is going out to the movies, going out for dinner. A couple of times that I did slip, it was like ooh, this takes me back to that time. I am not saying that I am an alcoholic or a drug abuser which I am not; I do not even know how that is technically termed. I was talking to this guy George, who I met a few weeks ago, and we have gone out a couple of times, and he had really come full circle. He was like a full blown junkie like crack, heroin, pot. You name it [0:50:05.9] everything. He has been sober for five years now. He is positive. HIV positive. That did not, being HIV positive, did not make him become sober, it was just more about he just beated himself up too much. He was great talking to him. Like the other night, we went out for dinner, I had, oh this is making me think of something else that really infuriated me. He was just basically saying that going out and getting trashed does not make one an alcoholic. Just sort of talking about it in his terms. If you needed a couple of drinks to come to a meeting, go right to it. So not about judgment. The few friends [0:51:02.8] that I have here that go to these meetings down on 11th street in the church. My friend, Kimberly, in Toronto, she was telling me that, "You know John you do not know how lucky you are living in a big urbanism like Detroit that has these break downs of these sort of main affinity groups that specialize in all these subcultures, whereas in Toronto you go to the one up at the Legion (laughter) with Sue and Marge. Talking about George made me think about the other night I went out with my friend, Katie, this freelance curator. We went and saw "To Die For". Great film. I have never paid $8 for a Nicole Kidman but it is worth it. (laughter) So I am telling her [0:51:58.7] about George and all this stuff and I am telling her that he is positive and stuff and he is such a nice guy and he is so cute. She says to me, "Well do not fall in love with him." I was never so humiliated and pissed off. Like I just felt so angry I did not know how to respond to it. I was shocked that she even said something like that. This whole like sometimes the straight world just like irritates me so much. This whole presumption that I do not know how to explain it. I really have in terms of myself; I really have adapted the philosophy that everyone is positive in the world in terms of who I am intimate with. I just assume everyone has HIV disease and I know what I can do and what I [0:52:59.4] cannot do. I just thought the gall of her to say this to me. I do not know, I think I responded back politely. I said, "Well Katie I think it would be different if I feel in love with him not knowing and then we had a relationship which was an investment for three years and then I found out and found out he was positive from the day one." Now that is something to argue about. She apologized but that was just like one thing that really like I have never felt anger like that before towards a friend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well it sounds like it was infuriating and both literally some kind of judgment implied. Also, it sounds like it sort of it implicitly sounds like [0:54:00.1]</p>

<p>it is legislating your emotions. Like who is to say who you will fall in love with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That is what I told her. Hello, that is what I said to her. Those things you do not choose I do not think. I really believe in that and she agreed with me. I think she was just saying it out of concern. She did apologize and she did say, "That was a fucked up thing to say." I think she did mean it though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well as you bring that up, as you were talking about some of the stuff I was reminded how at various points that we did work together there were things that you would bring up in a tentative kind of way. Things that were concerning you that we would just sort of touch on and then we did not stay with them long. I guess [0:55:03.6] </p>

<p>I am wondering, I bring that up both because I feel like in many ways there were other things that you really did want to work on and again some sense being invited into your world. Then you are not being sure whether I do not know if I was the right person or this is the right place. I might be an embodiment of a straight world too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not think that what I am saying is. Well that is just coincidental that I am discussing this on the same day that I am saying that the problems that I want to address, I need to address with a gay therapist or a gay man. In terms of that correlation, that is just coincidental. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What were you saying? [0:55:59.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think I am mostly, partly because I want to sort of give some closure to things, and I just want you to know that I was aware over the course of working together that there were a lot of areas that perhaps felt like sort of sensitive areas that I had the sense that you were concerned about. That you wanted to explore but that you also had some uncertainty about how that might feel or where that might go. I think I just want to say that to acknowledge that I am aware that there are rich worlds within you. I think if you do want to explore those and you do want to take that up at some other point in your life with somebody else, I think, I would hope that you would if it would be significant. I had the sense that [0:57:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That is true now that you said it in that respect. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think mostly I just wanted</p>

<p>PATIENT: They were not all about my queerness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. In fact some of it was just, I remember some times you even mentioning it because you were drinking and you were just being concerned about excess I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could have been in any area. I had a sense that you put that out there kind of in a maybe you wanted me know that little piece of you but you were not ready to really go into that. Clearly you can only go into so much and so deeply in so much time. You know there is a limit. I think that we focused a fair amount on your relationship with Danny and to some other people in your life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That is one thing that you really did help me with. I will have to say that. Now it is hard to like go back and conjure up those feelings that I did have. [0:58:07.0]</p>

<p>I know I spent a lot of time with that one. I had to. I had to get rid of it. So those sessions with you and then going away for the summer; that really was closure. I do not know if I said this to you when I first got back, the letter I did get to him, he was saying that I did not hear that you missed me and all that stuff. I was afraid to be honest with my feelings towards him. He knew it. He was like, "Oh I know you so well." It was true. I did not again want to let him have that fucking power over me. God dammit that guy flew me over for a loop, you know. He still does but it is different now. It is sort [0:59:10.1] of cute now hearing things about him through other people. How he talks about me to his friends or the new people that he meets. He raves about me. So that is flattering. Cute. Then I go back to when we get together, there will be something that he does that will bring me back down to earth where it is like oh yeah ok. That is the thing I really do not like at all. It is nothing that drastic but it is enough to get you irritated, which you are always going to have. I am curious now because I do not know who is going [1:00:06.9] </p>

<p>to be the next one who comes around. For a while there I was very fearful of not feeling that again. That is one thing that is really great about our relationship now is that we are so comfortable talking about that with one another. Like remember when we first fell and fearing not feeling that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you really have the sense that it is possible? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now we can say that there is that sense that it is going to happen again. I really feel Danny and I are really spiritually connected. We are not true soul mates but we are each others first love and I really think that is a really powerful [1:01:02.4] romantic beautiful thing. He is my brother you know. Yeah. That was one thing that you did help me with in terms of closing our actual physical sessions but actually dealing with something within the time that we did have together. I really did feel that did go full circle. That was dealt with. Also a good part of my fears of my career. I kept saying, god remember how much I would say it, like I really have to put myself in a provocative scary situation that is how I would literally say it. Whether it was to give up my apartment, or quite my job, go away, and I did two of the three. [1:02:01.8]</p>

<p>Yeah, now I am totally empowered. Jules you would not believe the amount of people I have met on my own. Like putting myself out there since I have been back. Like it has just blown me away to the point where now I want more. Like the more I do it, the more I want. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those sound like really really important changes. Sounds like a new or renewed experience of yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just feels. I do not like to use, I keep using the word reinvented, but I do not know. Rejuvenated. I really feel I saved myself. Also, too symbolically, I am excited too because it is almost, in January it will be ten years that I have been in Detroit. That seems to be a very graphic mythological time for a Detroit local's life of does one stay in Detroit or does one choose to leave Detroit. Either one has achieved what one wants in terms of living in Detroit and being able to sort of live outside of the city and not have to represent physically itself in the city or one chooses to leave it altogether. I know so many people who are on that verge and they are all like me. They moved here in the mid 80's when there was a lot of money. We all made like really good money back then. Now we are like these really good looking bohemian fantasies with no uptown daddy's. (laughter) I do not know. I am here. I am glad that I have fallen back in love with the city because that sort of scared [1:04:00.6]</p>

<p>me. When I was in Toronto though, I could have easily gone to Europe for a couple of months and sort of taken the long way back. Like for a year because I was so in that mode of being outside of the city. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So anyway it seems like it feels mostly like a beginning for you. We are going to end here but mostly the emphasis is on a kind of beginning. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. A beginning. It is over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I wonder about the just to cycle back one more time, [1:05:07.2] when you are talking about Danny and it being hard his commenting about you not saying that you missed him or what have you, I guess I am just wondering about you cannot feel anything right now and ending that it may hit you later. I guess I will leave that to you to see what </p>

<p>PATIENT: What in terms of our relationship?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess that what I was thinking is that maybe it is hard to experience it in any way the impact of this or the relationship. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you are expecting a dramatic closure [1:06:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think I am pulling for that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think you are. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think maybe I think I have to create a dramatic ending somehow punctuated so maybe we should just </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think it is going to be like a in a month it will really start to hit me. I do not know. I am definitely going to think about it as soon as I leave here too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You will make of it what you make of it. I wish you really well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you. Alright. (laughter) [1:06:50.7] </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I was just thinking about being late, and uhm, I guess, some of the things that led up to it, which in a way I've been thinking, were unavoidable.  But I can also see that they weren't.  And yet, then I work it around so FNI somehow becomes to blame for it, which I know is ridiculous.  Because uhm, this morning I wanted, I — she wanted me to come over sometime, uhm, either today or yesterday to pick up the maternity clothes I'd lent her, and some other things that she didn't want to keep around anymore, that — both maternity clothes, and uh, some little girls clothes FYH's outgrown.  And I couldn't go yesterday, so I would prefer to have gone tomorrow, but she just made it sound like it just had to be done immediately. </p>

<p>And (Clears throat) so I d, decided well, I'd go today, even though it wasn't that good for me.  And then it became difficult, because the time that was better for me, wasn't good for FNI, according to FNI.  So I went when she wanted me to, which meant I had to put off doing things that — well my, ah, the dryer part of the washing machine is broken, and I'd, over the holiday, left a lot of laundry to do, so that uhm, by yester—, by today, I really had to do several loads.  I'd done one yesterday, which was when I found out it was broken.  Oh, no, I did one Monday, which was when I found out it was broken.  And uhm, then, then I had to take the stuff down to the basement, to dry it, and so I did one load before I left for FNI's, and I had more to do when I came back, and then drying. </p>

<p>And the way I sort of make FNI responsible now, is that when I got there, she had made it sound like, I guess, she had to take FYH somewhere, and all these things, so I had to come earlier than was good for me.  And when I got there, uh, the woman she has living in was there, doing everything for FYH, and FNI didn't have to do a thing.  And so it wouldn't have mattered when I came.  And, but the part that I think, I don't know, I was thinking about, there was some strange attitude on my part, too, because it wasn't so much I was thinking, well put off doing these things, and then I'll be late.  But it was more, there were a number of things I wanted to do on my way home from FNI's, and I realized when I left, that I really couldn't do all those things. </p>

<p>But I was sort of unaware of how much time it would take when I got home, to finish the laundry.  And feed FSO, and uhm, all the little odds and ends of things that still had to be done.  And uhm, I, I, I don't know that I, I think I hurried home, but in a way, I have this feeling that I had no sense of getting home as soon as possible.  And then it was sort of as if I came home, and then, oh yes, I have to do these things.  Then, th, then it was a real race to see if I could finish them in time.  I guess what it is, is I hadn't really carefully planned out how long things would take (Coughs, Sniff, Pause). </p>

<p>ANALYST:   But why the lengthy justification, unless you think somehow, you might have wanted to be late?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I think maybe I did.  And I'm remembering all week, I think I felt sort of well, what I said one day of, why bother come just  for 3 days?  And then I, I don't even think of it, I'm not coming for 2 days, it's more sort of — the fact that I'm not coming at all — then it becomes, why bother coming for just 3 days?  And somehow, especially today, I was feeling I think, I don't know, almost as if well, you're not going to be here tomorrow, so —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Just one more way I betray you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   I go off, under circumstances that you don't even want to think about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well then, what I started thinking of is MYDN, uhm, I don't know, I saw him more today, I guess because he was awake for a longer time, simply because FNI was about to feed him and hadn't — there was, well I wrapped a present that FYH was taking to this party she was going to for, and FNI had to get me the different things before she fed him.  And so, I was sort of with MYDN then.  And it's the longest period I've been with him.  And then I even held him, which I've never done before.  And I've always before, had this feeling of, I'd like to hold him, but I really didn't want to.  And I, I think maybe today, when I did it, I did it more out of, I wonder what it's like to hold him, than anything else. </p>

<p>And, bu, but when he first came to my mind just now, I was thinking of, I don't know, I guess how ugly I think he is.  And I imagine I, I was thinking more of his mouth.  And he has a very big mouth, and it's not at all the way FSO's was.  And his face is still all kind of misshapen, although it's getting better.  And, yet I think I'm also thinking of his penis, and at one point (Stutters) when FNI was changing him, she had to go get something.  And so I was — she'd already taken the diaper off, and, and so I was there.  Of course I'd seen him before, too.  And I don't know, each time I think I immediately reacted that his penis looks very ugly to me.  And I don't know, it's sort of how can FNI stand to have to change him and clean him there, and uhm, handle it in any way.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>A—, I, I think I started thinking still the way I have been about FNI (Coughs), of her knowing things that I don't know.  Because uh, I was thinking this time, that when I arrived at her home, MJ was just leaving with FNI's sister, who's, FNI's paying to take care of him this week, and do things with him.  And when I'd been there — I'd met FNI at her apartment on Monday, before we'd gone downtown — so that I'd seen FAYM then, FNI's sister, and uh, they were planning to do something.  S, see some movie, I think.  And I didn't know what one they were planning to see, or w, what they'd done in the end.  And I just asked if they'd seen the movie. </p>

<p>And I came in, and I was thinking it was yesterday I'd seen them, so there was some confusion because they were thinking, well yesterday we did something else.  And then, straightened out, and they were going off to see, or do something today.  I forget what it was, but uhm, I think I was mainly thinking that I don't know how much of it FAYM's playing, how much FNI sort of suggested, why don't you do this or that.  But, and I know where you can look to see what's going on for children in the city.  But yet, I still have this feeling, somehow FNI knows all these things, and I don't.  And it's as if I'm a child who hasn't experienced them yet.  Some of which I guess I probably haven't.  But uhm, I don't know, it's s—, it's really as if I'm in the position where I don't know them, I haven't experienced them, and I can't know about them, and, and FNI does.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking of something else, because it came up today.  Uh, just very briefly and casually when FNI and I were talking.  But uhm, (Sigh) well I guess when she was giving me some of the baby clothes back that she'd lent me for FSO, I was thinking, I think I said something about it would really be nice in a way, if we had another girl, because there are so many pretty clothes that we haven't used, or are hardly used. </p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, then I think I made some comment that, sometimes I wondered if I want another child at all.  But I didn't go into why I said that, which is more to do with some of my feelings just about, I don't know, the way the world is today, and all.  And a—, sometimes I just get the feeling that it's unfair to even FSO to have had her.  And uh, and then other times, I keep thinking well, each generation is better able to solve their problems than an older generation would be to solve the same ones.  So then I think, well maybe what seems to me something insurmountable, might not to her, and or, won't matter as much.  And, I don't know, I, I feel very mixed about all that.  But I didn't go into it.</p>

<p>But then, FNI said something about, well I hope you won't just have one, because apparently MJ has a lot of friends who are only children, and she was saying something about all the things that she's seen.  And it's not because the parents aren't trying to be good parents, either.  But it's just the situation of the only child.  And then it just made me think again, what I guess I started thinking when I was considering taking that job, of when we'd want to have the second child.  And (Clears throat) I don't know, I just, I keep feeling, I can't imagine trying to have another child, right now.  Or even, in thinking that I wouldn't want to start trying right now.  I still can't imagine, unless it be years from now, I, er, er, maybe I just can't imagine it at all, I don't know. </p>

<p>And uhm, I was just thinking of my fantasies about having a baby, which I suppose is very different, because I want a very particular baby.  But it seems like such a contrast to — somehow (Stutters) uh, FNI (Chuckles), I don't know why I said that — FSO got all mixed up, before I knew what she was, in those fantasies.  And now it seems like I want to really keep having a real baby, separate from that.  And somehow it's as if I really don't want a real baby.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Coughs) Then I began thinking of something that, in thinking about when we'd want to have another baby, or when I would, because MSCZ and I haven't really talked about it, uhm, I haven't thought of this, which is something that I decided, I d—, I suppose after FSO was born and I realized it would be kind of hard — although I suppose it could be done — to have 2 children and then come here every day.  And so I'd thought, well I wouldn't want to have a second child until I was finished.  And that has not until just now, entered my mind during this period of, of thinking about it. </p>

<p>And I also, d—, eh, sort of thinking that when I say I don't feel ready to have a second one or really want a real baby, and yet on the other hand, I think I do.  Uhm, and I don't know whether it's out of curiosity to try again, and see if I can get what I want, or eh — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>But it also seems like lately when I've been thinking about it, I, I was thinking too, that its something right now I seem to want to think about, even though uhm, there's no need to even think about it now, because I wouldn't want to tr—, start trying anytime in the immediate future, in any case.  And uhm, yet I do—, it seems to be somehow connected with this desire that a—, being offered that job kind of got activated again, but of going back to work.  And I don't really know whether I, I just don't understand quite why I desire it.  I'm not sure it's what would make me happiest.  But uhm, it seems like it's very important to me.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, and the next thing that I think of, and uh, well first I was thinking that a, at least at LKC, I never fully had confidence that I was good.  Or I always used to sort of think, am I fooling these people in some way, that they think I'm good.  But I did enjoy a pleasant reputation, and uhm, just from the way this woman talked, and she'd spoken to, I guess, maybe 1 or 2 people that I'd worked under, I'm not sure she got one, uhm, — but in any case, she'd heard things that made her be very enthusiastic about having me take the job, without even meeting me.  And uhm, so I suppose in a way, thinking about going back to th—, work like this, is the place where I feel recognized and wanted, and all.</p>

<p>But then, what I think of after that, what I thought of, was what we were talking about yesterday.  And I thought of it more as I don't know whether I'm actually trying to avoid it, or if I just am not getting back to it.  And I thought particularly too, about how it seems several times last night and this morning, I'd look at MSCZ and just sort of I don't know, ask the question, am, have I been feeling that you've betrayed me, every time I'd look at him. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you remember you said, uhm, when you were feeling very keenly that you understood FNAO BBK.  Remember you said that it's like all men are indistinguishable from one another?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You felt that very strongly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean, so it follow—, if I thought one man had betrayed me then I'd sort of feel every man had. (Pause) And th—, well, maybe I'm trying to make it too parallel, or something.  But, because I keep thinking that with MSCZ, whenever I'd look at him and think, did, do I really feel that you've betrayed me, I was thinking of it particularly, because of FSO.  And that we didn't have a boy, we had a girl.  But with FNAO BBK, uhm, it seems, it probably is all similar, but uhm, I don't know, it seems that had more to do with that she was a girl and had been left out of her family in a way, as suggested by this article, that I immediately picked up.  Because everybody else was masculine.  There was nothing ever said about her mother, so I don't really know where she figured in the whole thing.  And uh, I don't know, somehow a different thing. </p>

<p>Well, I suppose it, i—, i—, I mean, again, there are differences, but I was just thinking that also between myself and what FNAO BBK went through, it was maybe ah, t, to an extent, a matter of numbers, that she just had more brothers, and they were older.  But that, that was apparently uhm, those were the ones that her father was really interested in.  And the suggestion was in the article that her father really wasn't interested in her.  Or if he was, apparently couldn't communicate it.  And I was just thinking that i, in one way, I've always felt, the one my father really could love was MLWZ.  But then the difference is that I always thought he had a special feeling for FNA, too.  Although it wasn't the same as the one he had for MLWZ. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, b, but you're, seem to forget that I wasn't the one who said this.  You did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You understood, you said exactly what you felt.  And now you're backing out of it.  On technicalities, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm. (Pause) You know, what makes m—, when I said that — and I can still think it, just when I think of FNAO BBK, but then when I think I've — thinking about this in connection too, with MSCZ, that's when I back off.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?  You dreamed that I've betrayed you.  You have some fundamental quarrel with MSCZ.  It keeps coming up over and over in a whole lot of different ways.  What's it about, then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause)  Well it must be that you are masculine, and I'm not.  Because when, the thing that I can't think together, is my understanding of what FNAO did, so that I could imagine in her situation, doing the same thing.  But then that, i—, I mean, if it starts, when I think of MSCZ, if I can still understand and — well I guess, what I'm afraid of is that then, I'll think of doing the same thing.  Or that, that really I want to.  And, I mean, I think of times when I've wanted to hurt MSCZ by hurting his penis.  And uhm, so it seems like I really do have that feeling, except I control it, and she didn't.  And if I think about understanding what she did and didn—, when she didn't control it, then I guess I'm afraid I won't, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, I don't know, I'm finding it really hard to think about it now, because I am backing off from it, and doing what you j—, pointed out earlier, of I keep somehow feeling well, I understood when I read about FNAO, exactly what she must have been feeling.  Although I'm the one bringing to it, nobody has said, this is what she was feeling.  And yet then if I think about my own circumstances, I think, well they're very different.  I don't feel that way that she did.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was al—, just now thinking about, I mean, basic to the way I feel about you, or MSCZ, or men in general, must be connected with my feeling about wanting a penis.  And again, I keep putting any desire I had for one, on the basis that I must have wanted one because clearly, MLWZ got something that I didn't get, from my father.  And that, that must be why.  And yet, I can't believe that that's all the feeling is about.  And I deny any other. </p>

<p>I don't know, and then there was something you said yesterday, that (Sigh) I can't recall, but I b—, I don't know, it's almost like I keep thinking, well it makes me think of how I wanted your words to give me something, too, but, that, it would sort of provide the answer that I don't understand right now.  Because I remember when you were sort of summing up the ways I felt you've betrayed me, and it was one of the things you said before, uhm mentioning that also I would want your words to do for me what happened to FYR.  And I don't know, I just, well I just feel I'm very busy denying all sorts of things.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of, uh, MFDZ and FDB.  And uhm, we had MFDZ for dinner last night, because FDB isn't, uhm, she stayed up with her parents when, after they went up for Christmas.  And uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, he was saying some things.  She is pregnant, and he was, h, he just told us that, and I don't know, somehow we were able to talk about things that we've never talked about between us before.  Or, not very much, but at least touch on them, and admit feelings were there. </p>

<p>And uhm, one point he wa—, well he was saying FDB had stayed up because she was just exhausted.  And uhm, he made some reference to this past year, as being sort of the, it's — I've forgotten what term he used — but kind of the reaction to the relief at having a very hard year end.  And I, I don't know what I'm focusing on, except I think his using the word "relief", which, to a degree MSCZ and I assumed they must feel.  Or at least, he in particular, must feel. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

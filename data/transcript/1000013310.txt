<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: After getting to last weeks stuff, I guess I, who I have a problem with is, I don't know, I guess, I mean I don't have a problem with anything, I mean it kind of makes sense getting into last week but I'm like, I guess it's a hard time rec, I have a hard time reconciling you know like that pain and that like, about the sep, you know the separation pain with, well the fact that I'm rageaholic. I'm an angry person and you know like you know like in here I felt that I was a, oh man, I don't know, you know, just I guess lead into whatever it is that I'm saying but....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were about to say you, in here you felt like you were....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well last week when I was you know crying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And getting into...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The pain of separating; leaving my parents and on the other hand though, well maybe it's all linked anyway. I mean, I mean I'm sure it is linked to me but, you know I mean they're home. They came home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I just go back a minute because I think you were saying something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I just wanted....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I didn't quite catch it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's just the fact that I'm a very angry person and I was saying I'm a rageaholic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there was someway I think you were trying to connect and make sense out of your sadness in terms of your anger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm just saying that, I mean I guess there is a link somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I mean it's all about some kind of f**ked up feeling that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, whatever, you know whatever it is that controls me. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But did you have any thoughts about how your rageaholism connects up with the sadness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I just think, I guess I was just feeling guilty that I, I think I was feeling guilty that I was having those feelings here and I felt like "Oh well I'm not really showing him who I really am." I guess its just a part of me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's one part. The other part is, which I guess I feel guilty having those sad feelings whatever those softer or more vulnerable kind feelings when I'm really, for the most part, angry and full of rage or at least this week, at least yesterday I mean I was just on a f**king tyrant. I mean I was on a tirade </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and I was a tyrant.</p>

<p>(chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't get close to anybody I don't think. At some point I just go off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No matter what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your saying that the anger (inaudible at 2:42) angrily and that's a way that not get close to people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not, forget about having to close. Like it has nothing to do with getting to close. It's just having human...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Contact. (2:56)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah at all. I mean, not that I was trying to have contact with my parents but I guess, you know, I mean like I was, like in a, I'm in a rage against them all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Against them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About. Against them. But it against anybody. Everybody. Anything that happens is like an excuse for me to go off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like this, I'm like a time bomb. I could go off at any time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that about? Why? You've been, you talked about that a bit in the past but what do you think about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I mean it gets in my way so much. I don't know. I'm just like this bundle of feelings all the time. Well especially, I had my period, especially when I have my period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I get es... especially out of control. Especially out of control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really bad and I have a lot of guilt about it. I'm like the guys they talk about that abuse their wives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like angry outbursts and then you feel remorseful and angry afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. And, and it seems perfectly justified on my part, I feel like I'm justified.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because everybody else is so f**ked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And I know its this big control trip that I'm on and I can't even begin to start to take care of things in my life and I mean really take care of, I'm like just this really big ineffectual person whose like this big baby.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Who can't let anybody go. I'm like I had fights like I was like with everybody oh like my sister, my parents, my sister who's suppose to be coming this weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But, and then my, and my friend Chrissie, this person who's been my like best friend for a few years now and, its, the friendships, I think, it feels like, feels like it's gone down the tubes and I'm kind of like maybe my way of dealing with this is pushing it away further instead of.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By getting angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At certain things that I feel like I should be angry. Like I don't even act, I, I mean I feel like in these relationships they're kind of f**ked up anyway all these relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not dealing with them in a way that I'm really clear about what I want from them; what I need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I come off as this angry a**hole all the time. And I just don't know how to handle stuff. I'm very upset about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I feel like, then I feel guilty, then I feel like I don't deserve to work on, I don't deserve to do my singing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Specifically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm this idiot and I'm never going to have an audience anyway. Everybody, I'm going to have alienated half the world by the time I get to perform any place. And it just seems like "Well what, what am I trying." Well I guess the way I link all this up and the separating with this is (crying) is that I guess I, I just can't seem to form any other rela...I guess I was saying is that I can't seem to form any other relationships or healthy relationships. I don't even know what a healthy relationship is with anybody I don't think. I don't even know if the thing with my parents is because. I feel very schizophrenic. (6:05)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible at 6:06).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just feeling very effected by this whole thing that I'm, I feel, I feel sad about it. I feel frustrated. I don't know what I'm going do. So I'm kind of frantic. I'm kind of scared that I'm, I feel desperate about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: About the whole situation. (crying) That I've been going on for years and years like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know you want me to talk about the feeling. What the feeling is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say that, what, when you say "I know you want me to talk about the feeling" what's that about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess I'm just kind of trying to find a way to figure out to say what it is. I'm guess I want to give you the satisfying answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. But I'm just upset about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see.</p>

<p>(nose blowing)(crying)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never been able to change or deal with this. I feel like its, I'm so stuck. (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'm, then I was thinking "Oh the short term therapy couldn't even help me with this. This is years and years of s**t."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With me and my bad behavior and 20 years, 30 whatever it is you know 40 and I'm like this is how I've always been (inaudible at 7:42). I'm not changing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's frustrating as hell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) I just feel like such a failure. (crying) I don't know what I want out of life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't seem to get anything anyway. (sobbing) I don't think I could ever live with anybody. I can't live with anybody and I can't live alone. It's like nothing is good enough for me. Nothing in life works. (nose blowing) I feel like a freak. </p>

<p>(sobbing, crying and silence from 8:56 to 10:06) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you, what are you feeling or thinking right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you want to talk about. That's what I was thinking about. What do you want me to get into so we can make this into something that, you know, that I can start feeling with. I don't feel like I'm like, I just don't, I'm just not, I don't know what to do with this. Its like last night, I was like, who can I call, who can I turn to, can I, (inaudible at 10:36). I'm like maybe I'm just riding the waves of emotion and going along with them but I feel like I'm wreaking havoc.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. And you were just a minute ago looking at me saying what? "How can we make use of this?" or to me you wanted me to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you want me to sit, do you want me, what do you want, what... How can I delve into this deeper? What can I do to, you know, deal with this, get through this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Changes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know but how?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think to hear more about the anger. I hear how horrible you feel literally after this happens and how you feel like you can't be alone yet you can't really be with somebody without expressing a lot of anger which ultimately puts a distance there and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like my family, they accept me and they'll like, you know love me and take me back no matter what but other people and yet I feel like I, I didn't, I don't know what, what it is because I don't feel, I guess I feel like I've gone like this with people, with friends or, you know in certain relationships, especially boyfriends where I can you know express the anger because I guess I just get, like I go over the line of anger or I also feel like I don't really know how to express it in a way that's going to keep it, I mean some people I think are just sensitive to it too or don't know how to respond.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or don't fight back you know. Maybe it's just the type of people I'm, I may be just talking about a certain type of person. Like this friend of mine I've not been happy with for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I was like I didn't give a s**t if I, I fought with her or not. Let her know how I was feeling because I feel like she's been a lousy friend to me anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you, what did you say and do?(12:35)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what it was, was that I, we had, I had told her, she is always complaining about, she's always got, she wants a husband, she's like desperately wants to find a husband, I know the feeling, and so she ends up with these guys in long term things where she complains and I got, its like I feel like I'm the f**king therapist I get to hear about it constantly and the therapy she's in isn't really like therapeutic. They just talking stuff. They're not talking any deeper and so I don't experience her as making changes although she is a person who has more outward success financially and she does live on her own and stuff. There's a lot of admirable things about her but I'm sick of hearing about these guys and her not willing to like go out and do something, like we go hang out and go places and start getting, she says "I don't meet people in bars" so she does personalize (ph) and then she meets these smegeggeeze (ph) anyway and instead of moving on she stays with them a long, long time and then she ends up, and she forsakes our friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and its like the whole summer I was frustrated by her anyway. She's the one I went away with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is Chrissie. So well we had this whole talk and I feel like I'm always trying to talk her into changing to her and trying to help her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know its this codependent kind of relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've been on to it for a long time because I feel like I've always had to just take care of her. I feel like she's this type of person and its just interesting because she's like, its like, it reminds me of my sister too. I keep feeling like I get into these friendships with people that remind me of my sister and then, its kind of no accident that these two incidents...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Two major things (inaudible at 14:13) with her and my sister. But the thing with her, so I had, you know, she was complaining, complaining and I said "Well look I'd just heard (inaudible at 14:21) that there was going to be a Judy (inaudible at 14:22) concert. Why don't we use that to go, just go to the Bluelight and then we'll go maybe to a bar or something and we'll hang out. Well maybe we'll meet guys or something." It's like, it's not like I'm some kind of a sleaze bag but she, you know like, you know and she kind of and then she said "Oh, my cousin is good friends with the guy that owns it. He can reserve us a table. I'll see if I can call him and ask him if he can reserve a table." And because I was going to go to the venue (ph) and pick up tickets so I was waiting. Right, so and we talked about it a couple of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Since then and she was going to call. So yesterday you know she calls me from work and because she had some time and she was bored and then she goes "Oh well I called up and they don't, I asked them if they wanted to go, they don't want to go to the concert. So you know and then I didn't want to ask him because you know I felt like I was imposing on him to ask him." And I go...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is what she was saying right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was like "Well wait a minute" so I started getting into this thing where I ..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you say? (15:22)</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Well how come you didn't want to ask him?" instead of addressing a different issue which, but I started going like "Well what's the problem with asking him? I mean like why couldn't you just ask him?" And she's like, and she starts going right away "Your getting on my case. Get off my case." And I was like "I'm not getting on your case but what's the big deal about asking somebody something. It's not like, I mean he knows the guys." "Yeah but I can't impose on him. I can't de de de de de de de de (ph)" and we start going on and I'm like going "But" and the thing is for me is I feel like I was speaking my peace which is actually I feel like its forward movement for me in a lot of ways. I didn't just like let it go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was feeling like bad like "Well she doesn't care if I have to go down and get tickets but this guy all he had to do was make a phone call." So I was trying to say to her....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Well what's the problem with just asking?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you feeling as you were saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was pissed off at her but the, I was very pissed off but I didn't realize what I was pissed off about until after I got off the phone and that's what the frustrating thing was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it wouldn't have been a big deal to me so much, although I felt like she doesn't care what I have to go through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she doesn't care as a friend, like it seems to me I could run circles around and do a f**king million things for her and that doesn't matter but she didn't want to ask her cousin a favor when he knew this person and all he had to do was make a phone call. I'm going to have to make, schlep down town and get this thing and last week she hung me up the same way and didn't care about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (overlapping voices) So you were angry because she didn't care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And telling me and I felt like she didn't care about me. That's exactly right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So but when I got off the phone I realized it wouldn't have been such a big deal but she's the one who said she was going to call and ask him. And then I realized it wasn't that I wanted to go with these people. She was like, its, and I felt like, what kind of dependent little baby is she being, we always have to go with somebody? The point was we were going to go as two single women and then maybe meet men. We weren't going to go and hang out with her cousins.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was like "Wait a minute. Why'd she say she's going to invite them and then" and then she goes "Oh" and she starts going "Well listen, he didn't offer tickets. He didn't offer it so if he didn't offer it I'm not going to ask him." So then I'm like....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then. So I called her back later and I said "Look Chrissie" I said "You know I'm not trying to get on your case its just that you said you were going to ask, call this guy and ask him. It wouldn't have been a big deal but my expectations were up about this and you said you were going to ask and I didn't think you were going to ask them to go. It wasn't about going with them. It was about the two of us."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Going." And she said "Well that's not what I said." And then she changed what she said and I said "Well that's not what you said Chrissie." And she said "Well that's what I meant" and I said "Well then you should really learn how to say what you need to say because you misrepresenting yourself".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she "Look I'm getting a headache" and this is her way of getting out and I'm like "Oh please." I said "You know yeah, you know." But the thing is I'm not really addressing these things directly enough either because I didn't really, I could have just said to her "Oh please I could get a headache too. Please stop with the headache." This is how she gets her way. (18:26)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I feel like she's like spoiled.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she always gets her f**king way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's not really a good friend of mine. I feel like she doesn't give two shits about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That is exactly how I feel and I'm feeling like lately when people are like that to me I'm responding...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Angrily.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So then I get into trou...then I start feeling like I'm like pushing somebody away totally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm not caring yet there are things about her I like. I don't have to push her away totally. I could have her as a friend a little bit but I don't have that art of keeping friends so I can use them for something. You know what I mean? Like I feel like that's what's it's a matter of in a sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keeping friends so you can use them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I kind of feel like that's, that's what it is. It's not, or its because I like her too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't like this and I feel like I wish I could change that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: About the relationship and get that across and I'm not getting it across that....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not? What's?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I want to be, that I wish she could care about me better. I guess I feel like right away I start thinking "Well maybe I'm being like a lesbian here". Maybe I've got a lesbian thing or something that I feel this way about a friend but it, everything just feels very, I feel like, you can't ask that of a friend or certain friends. Like she's very, she's been acting...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't say "I don't feel that you care about me"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I have said this but it doesn't, its like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've said that exactly to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or like, yes and all summer I've been very frustrated by her in saying stuff but its like the actual working out of what that means doesn't come back to me in any kind of a way that's good for me. It's maybe being too demanding. Maybe I'm just too demanding. Maybe I'm unreasonable. Maybe she does care and she, and maybe I'm not seeing who she is that she can only care in a limited way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So your confused about how much you can really ask of her and how much she can really give you. But it feels to you like she doesn't care about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And she really doesn't and I feel like she is a user.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really thought she does care about me sometimes but about this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she uses you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like where do you draw the line and what do you, and I, you know like we had plans to go out on a double date last week for the first time and I feel like I had to like pull teeth to get that. She even like when, just to ask her to do this with her boyfriend, to meet, or this guy, this guy she's seeing, who keeps, she keeps calling saying she doesn't, he's a kook and she keeps complaining about him and I, and yet she stays with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right (21:12)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this is like years she does this with guys. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every one of them. And, and we decided we were going to go out, I was going out with this guy who is actually a reject of hers that I don't care for him at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want to see him any more. And, and we all met, the four of us, but I was the one who had to work that day. I had to get up at six in the morning and was working from nine in the morning 'til, and it was a very busy day, until like six and they were coming in, they didn't work that day but, and she'd been staying over at another boyfriends house that night was, meaning this boyfriend, and they were, she was just, they were just too tired to come all the way uptown so I had to go downtown to (inaudible at 21:58) to meet them which meant I was late. I had to rush like hell</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Through traffic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was tired and I felt like they couldn't just take, it was actually easier for them to just take the train all the way up to me because its not that difficult?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So by the time I got there I was so pissed of I was like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were pissed off, put it into words. Be that (ph) or because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was pissed off at them because I had to do all the schlepping when I worked all day and they couldn't give two shits about me and what I had to do because they wanted to be in The Boar's Head because of what Charlie wanted. And it's always like Chrissie defers to what the guy wants.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of saying what she wants.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of copping to the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I end up getting like f**ked over. So I meet them, I'm pissed off and I'm the fucking ra..., I'm the lunatic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. When you say you're the lunatic, how did you act like a lunatic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just said, I said like "I'm so fu...", I'm was like, I'm really angry at them. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like "Why did I have to rush down here? Why did this end up", because at a certain point I could have insisted earlier that they come and meet me but I would have been getting into this like haggle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I always capitulate. I always give in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you give in...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'm angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and then you end up getting frustrated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like, and I'm like thinking going over that "I don't want to have to be pissed or anything but what the f**k. I am pissed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I want to hang out with them."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I don't want to be totally without friends. I'm totally alone a lot, most of the time because I can't deal with all this, with, when, with people doing s**t like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Easier to just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: and me not insisting on getting my way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I feel like a bad guy and then so ultimately I'm the bad guy anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You feel guilty after getting angry or you feel guilty for getting what you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I just feel she's a terrible friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 23:42) to just shift gears a little bit but stay on the same theme. Do you feel that happens in here too with us? I'm wondering? Because your saying it happens a lot in different, with different people in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess a little bit with like the asking you "What do I do? What should I do?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'll ask you like.... (24:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that look like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But on the other hand I think I'm just jumping the gun too. I mean I feel like when we start working we're talking and doing stuff and you know I feel like its helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. But that notion of not asking for what you want and because you'd feel guilty if you did. I mean getting angry if you don't....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well also I don't know what I want. I don't know what I want a lot of times or what. I'm not sure what, I guess I'm not sure what is right...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To ask or what is you know going over the bounds or a certain point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean? Like I'm not sure what you know going over the line of what your suppose to do and what your not. Like what's your place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. So is that, that's different for you then from like other situations where you know what you want but you don't ask for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its similar?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I never really know what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Ok. Ok. So it's similar. That confusion about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I ask for this can I not ask for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I mean I guess, I guess maybe I'm just giving it an answer because I really don't know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How it applies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Here with us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't feel like it's (inaudible at 24:56).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you felt the similar anger in here? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Towards me about not getting what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just wondering.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I know of. Well I don't know because sometimes I think, I don't know like I had this thought earlier about you know like when I was crying and you were looking and you were looking kind of empathetically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sympathetically. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if empathetically. Maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And sympathetically I was like wondering if you could handle me. If you could, if you, I don't know, like if you had the experience, if you were old enough, if you were you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Those thoughts, those things that you've said about me before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 25:56)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'm just (inaudible at 26:00) or you know really be able to help me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Ok here you were really in pain and feeling emotions very strongly and you were looking at me saying "Hey handle this if you have enough experience." UH HUH. Is that something you stopped yourself from asking me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't want to comment on it because I didn't want to be negative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I was like trying to give you a chance.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Like trying to give me a chance instead of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean of judging you and (inaudible at 26:38).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Ok. Ok. Ok. But then you had a question which you didn't ask me or a concern that you didn't voice because you were giving me a chance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sighs) I guess, I don't know, I just feel like I'm, you make me feel like I'm a go...I feel sad because I feel like I'm a good person and I'm very misunderstood (crying). (27:13)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I was thinking this morning maybe I'm not a good person, maybe I'm a bad person. (crying) And I don't deserve anything good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do people not understand about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 27:29) I think I misrepresent myself a lot because I don't know how to ask for something in a good way because I'm, I'm usually so angry by the time I'm pushed to the point of having to ask for something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. That's, yeah I hear that .</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, can I just tell you one other incident because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's about, and this has to do with my sister too, is that she's suppose to visit this weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have a lot of stuff with my sister. A lot of bad stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we haven't talked about her much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No and she's a pretty well important character in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, not, but not in a good way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to hear about your sister but I'm, I'm just there's a little voice in the back of my head saying like "Have we moved away from talking about us" and there might be more there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I want to hear about your sister.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think there's anything with us.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I, I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except I had one thought when we were walking in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, and I felt so stupid talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe its important even though it seems so stupid to me and silly and I feel like their going to laugh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But (chuckle) no I just felt like we looked like we were ready dressed to go on a date.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aah. UH HUH. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was a feeling that I had and I, I didn't mention it and I (inaudible at 28:47) you know it was too close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too close. Right. I notice we're talking about that feeling that you have of closeness toward me and I looked down and "Oh her shoes are back on".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had them off?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The whole time until right now when you're talking about closeness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, (inaudible at 29:03) intimate things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. And so the shoes got back on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I kind of got gathered together, all together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Oh yeah that's true your sitting more...What do you think that's about? That its too intimate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it felt like positive, it felt like something you know friendly and you know positive and I guess I felt I'd be made fun of because your, you know, you're my doctor and whatever you want, your, I guess they call you, I guess your kind of, you're a doctor I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I mean your Brent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I'm Brent the doctor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The doctor, the doctor of, my doctor but your like a peer, your like an equal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: My age and its weird. (nose blowing) I guess, I'm very, a thing, it's very weird for me to be close to somebody my age. (30:03)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And to look up to somebody and to see you in a positive way or for me to feel like this could be like a good positive relationship because we're like peers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its weird to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's weird? What's the weirdness?</p>

<p>
PATIENT: I don't know. It just feels, I don't know, like it can't work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because just I don't know because you're not older, you're not smarter I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interesting to me because we moved from you know talking about feeling like we were going on a date when we entered the room to say "It can't work".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she, she's (inaudible at 31:20).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I definitely have a problem with peers. I've got this thing, well I've never felt close to peers, to people of my, you know, that would be my age, that would be weird. It just feels to me like, I guess I just don't feel like anybody cares for me or that also they could if they were smart enough they just don't have the intelligence or they...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To care?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or the experience. Not just to care but to be aware in certain ways. You know what I mean? To have that certain overall kind of like in an older Godlike type of person. You know kind of that overview of life or you know, thinking about a lot of things and I think a person who like me who isn't working in much else can be involved with all this other crap anyway. You know, and you know just, you know to can think about. I don't know, I don't know what it is, I could just be involved in life and, in a different way like your aware of things, like you know, just you know to open doors you know for somebody holding it or to say thank you when somebody does or like I'll expect somebody to say thank you if I, I don't know its just this certain, I don't know how I'm working here but. I know it just seems to me like peers are thoughtless and don't care about (inaudible at 33:16) to their own thing or...(33:19)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. People that can't understand you the way you would like to be understood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or you know, or yeah or you know or just they're not, I guess not there to take care of me maybe. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I guess that's what, maybe that's this thing that I'm always talking in symbols about like its always a parent, if its not a parent thing or an older person who I'm paying or looking up as a therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or somebody or teacher. (inaudible at 33:48) don't really count you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you feel towards me like I'm a peer that to you means that I can't care about you like a parent and I won't be trying to understand you in the same way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'm projecting to this like a lack of certain professional experience that I have like maybe that I've done half-assed stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I, professionally, and I'm like, I expect that same of you. That maybe you're not really that equipped.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you don't really, you know you just may not, just have enough under your belt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: On the other hand I think I'm like keeping myself from this young place and expecting my peers to be there too you know this baby place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not really in a position to really take responsibility and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or handle difficult situations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I don't think that you could and I don't see that me doing the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I always end up back in this baby, raging, screechy, totally helpless place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it makes me feel a little sad to hear you say that. I mean not about me in particular about us in the sense that you are not allowing for or it is difficult for me to be your peer and also to be able to help you. I don't feel angry like it's a put down or anything but I do feel a little sad like "Oh gee".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sad for you or sad for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, like, well man, you know, because she sees me as somebody her age and you know, she sees me as incapable of helping her in certain ways and you know I want to be able to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well do you really feel you could?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't be here if I didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know I think you have to be at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here. I mean like we have this like commitment to work I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah all right maybe that was a, even a flip answer on my part. Yeah I think, I think we can ride this together and I can help you in the way that I can help you. I'm, if I was 60 years old maybe I'd be helping you in a different way. But yeah. (36:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I also, maybe like when you say your feelings too I guess I tend to right away I want to like kind of make fun of it or not make fun but feel like "Well that has no weight". You know what I mean. Oh your fee.. so you feel sad about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Or how's that suppose..., are you like a sensitive guy? Is that what this is about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want to put it down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I know, and I know, and I know I hear my father's judgment about me and my feelings, like my feelings don't seem to have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hold any weight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why should yours or anybody, why not other peoples. Are they more magical than I am?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean like when I, my sad fee..or whatever like well, yeah why does that hold any weight? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well I need to understand that a little more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And your saying, I mean I guess I don't understand like why, what affect that's suppose to have on me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know either. I was just saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why you would say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Because that's how I felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I haven't been, well maybe also I feel like, well like, you know I mean I could get into that and respect it and I feel like its here, its in therapy, its with a man, I'm talking to a man who is a therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who is espousing what you believe in. Who's living it, your not just espousing it, your living it, your saying it. Ok?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But this is like a very, I feel like it's a very isolated relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And its like here we are talking deep feeling and sensitivity and then when I go out in the world I'm not going to experience that with anybody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know what that means then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I want to say it does not compute.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When I talk about my feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. When you say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About us. Your still, you..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Because I don't understand how it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel its kind of artificial and its not going to be helpful to you out there and..</p>

<p>PATIENT: (nose blowing) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You put it down and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well right, well yeah, well like I want to say well what does it mean? What does that mean that you feel sad about... and I feel like is it a manipulation? Am I suppose to then respond by saying "Oh well he's sad".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Oh oh all right then I'll be co-dependent and I'll say all right then I don't feel that way".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't feel what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know that it, it can't work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What you were sad about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Hum. Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I suppose, I'm trying to figure out like how does that suppose to be work for me? How is that suppose to be therapeutic for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To hear you're sad about it. (39:03)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How does that work there that would have any effect on me or on our relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't (inaudible at 39:12). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) But, but what I'm picking up on is that I said something that I really felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if it was a great intervention or not or anything but it, it's what I was feeling. I, I suppose I said it just because I thought it would be interesting feedback, interesting to put out there and say "Gee you know I, I feel a little bit sad that you feel that I can he.., that you, you know don't feel that I, like maybe I can't help you in the way that you" again that was just my reaction but what I'm picking up on now is, is kind of like a lot of suspiciousness about it and putting it down that I'm a guy who shared his feeling about how I feel, you know about us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's a lot of suspiciousness, in putting down and discounting "Well that's in here but what about the real world".</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I thought...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think is going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I also feel like I jumped on it I mean right away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices at 40:08) a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I maybe, I mean it but it all, it comes back because I feel like, well I guess like I feel like I have to take care of it when you said you were sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Take care of it how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well to me when somebody says their sad...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: about something that's between us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I guess I feel like "Well then you know well I don't want him to be sad. If he's sad...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: We can't just leave it at that that you're sad about it. I have to do something then to respond to it, to take care of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So his sadness goes away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? I mean I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So and then I guess I resent it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Right. So you felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I feel like I have to take care of you again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So first you felt that you have to take care of your therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right but I'm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then and then you felt resentful like "Why the hell should I"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right right. Why is he telling me this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So there was a resentment and a little bit, sounds a little suspicious when you say "I'm not sure that that's how you experience it" but maybe it was just your resentment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Why is he telling me this?" It was resentment? That was the feeling you had? Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. One of them, one of them</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So first you were pulled to take care of my feelings (inaudible at 41:28) resentful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean I feel like that, well I mean I feel like that's what it is, it's a ploy to kind of get, to kind of take care of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you say your sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes you sad. Well then what do we, well then it made me, made me feel hopeless that you were sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum. Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know because, because I don't know how to respond to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what that means. Why I should know. Why I should be privy to what your feelings are and how that's going to be helpful. (42:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And whatever, our relationship or in my process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so how, how is my kind of down feeling going to help you? What is it, why is he laying this on me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Leave your feelings out of it lets deal with my powerful feelings." I mean strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah except I mean I (sigh) I guess I mean you are allowed to have feelings I guess its just I guess I don't know what to do with them if you have them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I, I guess its not, I mean I shouldn't assume I have to do anything about anybody's feelings because their having them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Its interesting you say that to me. Its interesting because that was my response "I don't want her to do anything with it." (inaudible at 43:17) I wasn't looking for a response from you in terms of my feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just want to know why you would tell me your feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. Well because I, two reasons come to mind. One is because it was a strong feeling that I was having that I think came out of what you were saying, you know, I wasn't, I didn't come in her today and feel sad but it came out of a moment that we were having so I thought that might be important. And that leads to the second reason, which is you know you've been talking today about not feeling that you can keep good friendships, stay in a good friendship, fulfilling one and, and you know I've even been asking like "How does that, do you think it gets played out here?". So I think I shared how I was feeling in part just to kind of explore our relationship in here. You know to see if it had any relation to how sometimes what goes on in your life with other relationships or other friendships, friendships. You know what I mean? Because the sadness I was feeling was a sadness in not feeling like "Gee I can relate to you in a way that I'd like to relate to you and we can be close in a certain way". And you came in talking about how it's difficult for you to really get close to somebody but also to not, to be alone. I think that somehow it's connected in what was going on in that moment and now even. I'm not sure exactly how I was throwing that feeling out so we could figure it out together. (45:04)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I just I must have turned off because I started talking about, thinking to myself about all the things I said and stuff so I guess I just said a little bit too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the too, what was too much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Beginning this conversation and it was just going on and on and I felt like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. What did you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I just, I just felt like it was going on and I turned off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I started thinking about other things so I think to me that's the cue that I was just.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well lets go on to (inaudible at 45:50).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you were...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me ask you to death now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. You felt like it, we were beating a dead horse or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Like lets not talk about us anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah that too. Maybe that too. And I was just thinking about this whole issue whenever (inaudible at 46:12).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But so there's a reason why you were (inaudible at 46:21) about something else that you didn't want to remain here talking about us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess so too because I mean your talking about us and your saying this stuff and I'm quite, I don't know, I feel like your uncomfortable. I feel like you're uncomfortable with us too. So I don't know, I just sense this thing. I don't know. It's making me a little nervous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Making you a little nervous?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel funny talking about us and our relationship and us and just, you know, you and me and stuff and with the witnesses and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interesting how we've gotten from your saying you felt like you were on a date with me to where we're at right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean yeah but I mean that I feel like I'm on a date with you but I know we're not and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess I felt like we were both dressed up, we're wearing similar colors and there was this....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess this kinship and this similarity and you know I find you attractive and, and you know maybe that makes me sad. Well it makes me sad that I've met you in this situation and your married and you're the therapist and I would love to meet a guy like you who I could be real with you know that would be nice. That would be the answer to my problems then I wouldn't need therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) Rent a guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. No now, now its rent a guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Own a guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>(laughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was funny. So anyway yeah so I guess I feel you know like a little uncomfortable about that and I guess its uncomfortable talking about us you know and especially, and I guess it is with that peer thing too you know. You know like in the past like when I've been to therapists and they were older and stuff you could talk about, there's something safe about it. And its kind of not as safe here with you. (48:25)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I mean you have certain feelings about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which you know can't get acted upon but there in the room</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And then also like even the way you just said that it can't get, your uncomfortable with saying that. I sense sometimes that your uncomfortable saying stuff alluding to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Stuff like that or putting limits in. I guess that's where I have a problem. And maybe that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why I'm seeing it in you because I have a problem with directness with people and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really, I mean it seems to me you could be, your probably more direct than me about stuff but I sense some uncomfortableness coming from you...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In expressing certain limitations, boundaries. And I kind of, it kind of has an affect on me a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also, but I also relate to it because I, I have a very hard time with certain, with boundaries with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. Hum. But what your saying about me is that you feel uncomfortable...</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're stating boundaries right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I'm not setting limits clearly and as firmly..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, the way your talking and the way your saying stuff sometimes I sense an uncomfortableness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With saying "We don't do that in here"</p>

<p>PATIENT: With saying, with stating it. Right, right, exactly. Or even the way you just said something like it was almost said like in a jokey kind of offhand kind of, but, but also sensitive to me to not want to you know, you know, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just well not wanting to hurt my feelings or say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how do you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get like that too. And its not like I can't make the boundaries because I can and I know I can ultimately cut off certain things but I can't, you know, cut off the relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right because that's a big boundary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, right, or even cut off in certain other ways but to really state it. To look somebody in the eye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say something. Just like this, as plainly as this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would, what would you like from me, when your talking about boundaries I want to get clear, what would you like from me that you don't feel that your getting? I mean specifically.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, well I guess you know just that, that ease that, I guess a certain ease with knowing what the boundaries are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And knowing that I know. And knowing that I'm comfortable with that. You know what I mean? Like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there something that you'd like me to say or do that I'm not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well its like the way you said it just before, you just said something like, I can't remember exactly, its just a few minutes ago you said "You know you can't act out"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the way you said it was just like, it was like you were stepping, stepping on egg shells to say that to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't firm like. It wasn't "It's not going to happen in here!"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or not even like that or just like a state a fact like just say "Well you know". It was just like, it just didn't feel natural the way you said it. It felt like you were stepping on eggshells with me. (51:08)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't say, I feel led on a little bit because I feel like its your...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Led on. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Led on by you that its like kind of like that you don't really believe that and that its kind of a tease on your part or, you know what I mean like, because your saying it in a way that says to me you don't really necessarily feel sure of it or..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of the boundaries.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or that you, and I don't know if that's for you or for me that you feel that way that you can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know on your own part or if your doing it to take care of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what impact does that have on you that you feel that maybe I'm not so sure about boundaries and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sigh) Well that I not, may not really be with a professional who can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really take care of this situation or take care of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not taking good enough care of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Like I'm not really sure if your clear about your intentions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And If I'm not clear who knows what hell could break loose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I'm saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So here we are two peers and you've said that you know your in general not so clear about boundaries and I'm not so clear, well first of all I'm not being like a 60 year old authority figure who can say "Well that's it" and its scary. I'm not taking good enough care of you. I'm just like you in a way where...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your not sure... Right. Its like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) there's a lack of boundaries and nobody's going to put a control on us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. But the added thing is that there's this control is put on us by the cam...the video, being watched.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I'm saying? I wonder how different sessions would be, I think they'd be a little different if I didn't have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The witness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think they'd be different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Protection Plan.</p>

<p>(laughter) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think they'd be different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think maybe I'd be more honest. I could really be you know kind of be a little bit more direct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a little bit like, I mean as honest and direct as I'm being, I feel like, you know I could come out and say more stuff and not feel hung up about it. You know what I mean? (54:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what in particular?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you whatever, whatever I say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So there's, there is some control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's interesting. Yeah and its like I wish I kind of had that in the rest of life. I think I'd be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A video camera?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no, yeah, no, but yeah well its kind of funny because I used to feel like there was one watching me all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but you know like this is a situation where I'd be more, where I'm more careful maybe. You won't see the rage or whatever you know or the real feelings so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but I don't go let's, well maybe its just the, I feel like I go around acting out constantly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess I just, maybe I'm blowing yesterday into a much bigger thing although I think it's those little, those days like that that can really change a whole life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They can make some dramatic changes very quickly and forever. And I do apologize that we don't have, that we have a few minutes left.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah no, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't have a lot of time to talk about your sister.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I know. Its really ok. We'll have plenty of time to talk about her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: By next week I'll either have seen her or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Depending on how I changed the weekend plans possibly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The story will continue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know I guess I also feel like what if you know like I run into a problem like I did yesterday with, is there any number or somebody I could call because I really feel like I've got some really, not that I'd call con..., I don't call, make a lot of phone calls, but I was wondering if, I just feel very on my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. I was wondering should I be on Prozac? I mean, I guess I have a lot of questions about real stuff besides feelings. You know like because this is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like who's going to be there for you and who, yeah...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like a little bit, like well maybe we've you know with being home with my parents, maybe because it was my day off and it was my period and it's the first time I've been there and they've been and I've been with them the whole day and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a lot, a lot of things are coming together for you. Right? It's an intense time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I'm trying to decide whether I should move back to the city or what. Yeah there's a lot of s**t going on in my life. You know I mean I like to know I handle, I mean I survived it all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So your question for me is, is there anybody you can call?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 56:51)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have my phone number right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your asking if you can, are you asking if you can call me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I, can I call ever, yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm you know I'm not a pain in the neck (inaudible at 57:00).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (57:01)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would it be ok?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I had a problem although I don't feel like, I don't know how we would deal with it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you really asking me that right now? Because it seems, it appears to me your very like kind of you know "Would it be ok?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like you know, you'll think, sus... you'll be suspect of my motive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so? You mean like, well what do you mean suspect? I'm not sure I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know or like your, you know its just, we have that kind of relationship or is that where I can call and ask for help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a boundary, a boundary will be broken? Is that what you mean by suspect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah or like, its like am I going to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or like. Are you going to ask me [for a date or something]? (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Yeah, which I'm not. I'm not going to. But I mean do you you know understand me that I, I need you know help and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I guess its like one of these things I kind of like want to be helped but I want to be respected to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and not thought of as like just your sick patient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. But as a person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I doubt that the need will come up I mean or that I will do that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it sounds to me like you haven't really respected yourself. I mean it, when you come in here and open up there's something, you get silly, you use that word stupid, you've said embarrassed, humiliated so there's something for you about coming in here and opening up that makes you feel maybe like I don't respect you which isn't the case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I think when I just talk about stuff calmly and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I feel very vulnerable you know and I don't, I think maybe that's why I'm like a rageaholic because you know screaming you don't feel that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Vulnerability?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that (inaudible 59:02) like a, you need to control something you know, you don't have to worry about whether your going to get your wishes met or whatever you know what I mean like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah are they going to care about me or reject me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when your angry, yeah, all your feeling is anger. You're not letting yourself (inaudible at 59:23) in a certain kind of a way. (inaudible at 59:24). Let me take good enough therapy and move that boundaries.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I think there is a connection there. I really do. So on that note, yes you can call if you really feel the need to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right and I'll trust you to know when you really feel the need. You won't just call to talk about the weather.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll call if you really, really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: need something, you know help or someone to talk to. That's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I probably won't but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 60:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK? And you know it's a, it's a, its an answering machine that probably, you'll probably get my machine but I check it very frequently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...(60: 13)</p>

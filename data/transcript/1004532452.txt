<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for talking to me outside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, the rest of the weekend went fine actually. Yeah. It was good, I just didn't think about anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You look very surprised. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am, you felt really awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I do believe you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No but, I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I'm glad that the rest of the week went better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in some ways it's really good and in some ways it's a problem that I, I basically can just not think about it. So I just didn't really do anything the whole weekend and so I was fine. But you know, I can't really do that indefinitely. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. So let's talk about what you weren't thinking about then. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, um. You know, the semester is getting to an end and I, um, I've just not been doing my work, at all. Um, the work that's like people will hold me accountable to for week to week. I've kind of scrambled through, you know, and uh, it takes me... It either takes me much longer to do it or I take much more time to do it, spending much more time like gearing myself up to in indirect ways.</p>

<p>Um, but like, I've got this paper, it's an incomplete from last semester um that I've worked on a lot and was really excited about and, and I cannot think about without, you know freaking out. Um, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about it. [00:02:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, the problem is it's really kind of a book length topic and I am looking at it as a twenty page paper topic. Um, something I'd be really excited to write my dissertation on. Um, although not because it has anything to do with what I am, kind of uh, what is supposed to be the general scope of my interest, it'd have to be, I'd have to be Greek again and I hate Greek. Like I have to actually be good at Greek, um, I hate Greek. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like Greek in particular?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just don't like the language. Mostly because it's hard. (laugh) Realistically yeah. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More so than like Latin and Hebrew and other languages? [00:03:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For some reason yeah. Um, Greek and Sumerian are the ones that stick me. Um, but it's the kind of topic that I'm well suited for. Um, it's talking about, looking at um, the book of Esther, which is my favorite book of the Bible. Um, and looking at um, the influences of Greek literature on the book of Esther. Um, which there's you know, been some, a lot of kind of small scale work in the last fifteen years or so of recognizing that. That it's you know people used to look at Esther and say oh, it's a, the people who wrote Esther, the person who wrote Esther had this very solid historical knowledge of the Persian Empire because the details that he gives about the Persian Empire agrees with the details that Horiatis and other Greek historians give.</p>

<p>Um, and now people are more saying, well no, there's, he's reading these sources. The, it's, they're participating in the same construction of the Persian Empire, um. [00:04:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it. So it's not that both are thought of as accurately representing the Persian Empire but as consistent with each other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so what I'm, (exhale), so the kind of larger ideas or larger questions that I'd really be interested in getting into but can't for the purposes of this paper because it's too big. Um, is to say, well it seems clear to me that the author of the book of Esther is reading Greek sources, um, is reading Greek histories. The Greek histories are written, they talk about the Persians in the way of saying, this is what it means to be Greek. And so I think that Esther is talking about Persians in the same way, it's like this is what it means to be a Jew because it's not Persian. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>But they're also saying, they're also in conflict with the Greek sources that they're using and saying we're not Greek either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time, Esther is all about the survival of Judaism within the (inaudible at 00:05:16) and saying like in order to survive as a nation we need to be, both fully within the, both fully within the society and larger empire. And some (inaudible at 00:05:29) that apart. So it's about you know, the formation of a national identity within an international community. And participating fully and very self consciously in like the intellectual life of that community and saying look we can beat you at your own game in some ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:05:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's all kinds of very fun stuff. And like very much the kinds of topics that I'm interested in and the kinds of close relationships among texts that I like and I'm good at. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, uh, what makes those sort of issues and questions like the sort that you're interested in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Um I, I just (pause), part of it is that making connections within texts and among texts comes easier to me than it does to a lot of people. So you know, you like what you're good at?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, uh, part of it is like I think the stories are about the most important thing there is. And so the stories that people tell and the way that they tell their stories um, and I think if you want to understand what people are about that's the way to do it. Or it's a way to do it. Um, uh, (pause) yeah, you know, it, finding connections that weren't there before, it's fun. Um, yeah. [00:07:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, I think I can see how you're sort of involved both in kind of sort of narrative construction of uh, sort of national/international identity, uh, in relation to how it is their histories are being written?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Um, and then you get into the questions of like historiography itself which is something that I haven't delved into at all. Um, but, so one of the kind of ongoing debates about Esther for the last you know couple thousand years has been Esther written as history or as a story? Is Esther supposed to be historical fact? The trend now a days is to say no it is not.</p>

<p>And to me it's kind of a limiting question because I think that people are saying, are assuming that history meant the same thing to the first historians. Like Horiatis is not, I mean like he freely admits that he makes things up. (laughter) Like, he says he'll write a story and then like, it's all.. It's all a much more complicated game. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Than I mean, I think it's still a very complicated game to write history but it's a much more complicated game than we're willing to admit it is at least. Um, and so I think, I mean sort of a side question is like well, I mean I think Esther is written as history in the same way that Horiatis has written history which is different from the way that we would write history today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really it's in the categories and ways of looking at things that they had then is what's different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nobody's going to agree with me on that one. Or, it's very unlikely. Um, so the problem, I mean, the problem with it is there's just not enough evidence. [00:09:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this where you get stuck?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, it's where I get stuck, particularly in relationship to my advisor, um, who's, I know really excited about this idea. It's like I'm going to write about this and he's like, oh I'm working on a paper that's on the same topic. (inaudible at 00:09:29)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because, a, he's you know one of the foremost historiographers of our time, um. (laughter). And, you know there's this same, and what he feels comfortable committing to paper is at a different level of proof than what I feel comfortable committing to paper. So he's not gonna, he doesn't publish an article until he's been working on it for ten years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I mean ten years being a round number. But like, you know, he revises and revises and revises and revises and wants like every single nail in that coffin before he's willing to say I think this is what's going on. [00:10:13]</p>

<p>And I don't (pause), I, you know I came in because I want that scrupulosity of, of research, I want (pause), I don't want to say I've proven something when I haven't proven it, but at the same time I think that you can't be in the humanities and refuse to publish anything until you've proven it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just not how it works. Um, and not even that it's a publisher (inaudible at 00:10:45) situation, like I don't actually care about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You means in terms of uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The point is a dialogue, and you can't have a dialogue if nobody knows what you're thinking. And I think that, there actually needs to be two different levels of discourse. On the one level of discourse it's like it's published in the journals, and the other level is what all of the top tier faculty members talk about with each other. And those are the really interesting conversations, but nobody ever knows about them. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so it's like, at every tier you know, knowledge or like the innovation is kind of closed off to the tier below it and you know, not even getting to the problem with like, the fact that the you know, the nation as a whole has no idea, has no idea what history is. Um, you know, like, not (inaudible at 00:11:43), not that the University system is completely failing the country in terms of spreading knowledge, that's a whole nother rant. Um, (exhale), so it'll, and that's the larger questions and you know, I like both really worship this guy and I am extraordinarily fond of this person, um...[00:12:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... pure machinist, um we are not on first name terms yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, although more due to my unwillingness to call people by their first names unless they ask me to. Um, but... so it's, so on the one hand when I think about this, there's you know if I were in an English department this would not be any problem. Because standards are different because what constitutes proof is different. Um, but, basically he just really doesn't agree with me. I'm trying to argue for a specific inter-textuality; and say as though the author of Esther was reading Herodotus specifically, um, and the thing that would make it certain is not there. There is not enough evidence to make it certain, there just isn't. Um. [00:13:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He would want a photograph of the two of them together or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughter) And it's not even like, I mean it's not that bad, it's like this is a more, the problem is that this is a more tenuous connection that I would ordinarily work with but because the, the doors that it opens are so exciting and the different kind of models of relationships among different peoples and relationships between subordinate peoples and the empire and what texts mean and communitive, and formation of a community... [00:14:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In part that uh, is a bit like, well ok, this is speculative but if we speculate this, it leads us to some really interesting possibilities in a variety of ways and so let's like kind of tentatively go down this road and see what we get, knowing that uh we haven't applied a high standard of proof here, but are just seeing where this takes us. [00:14:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, um and you know the problem is, is that, with this is that then you become one of the people who are so enamored of their own ideas that they construct something that's not really built on anything. Um and I, I don't want to do that and I'm not even at that stage. I'm just at the, at a, like it's a pretty basic paper, I can't do any of the things I actually want to talk about with this paper, all I can do is say, like let's examine the evidence for direct connections between these two texts. Um, you know, here's one story, here's another story, look how they're similar. Here's one story, here's another story, look how they're similar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I, I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where is it that you get stuck? Is it where you're writing for your advisor and like, if you felt like it, you could write it, show it to him and know he'd be very critical of it along the lines that you've described? Or is it that knowing how critical he'll be you can't write it? Or is it that...[00:15:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the knowing how critical I'll be, I can't write it. He'll be, I can't write it. I made the mistake, I should, I showed him uh, I showed him my outline, I should not have showed him the outline. I should have not, I shouldn't have done it. Now I know, I'm just never gonna show him anything until it's finished because, and you know he's got that just like devastatingly kind like, reading through it and saying, ok there's a lot of good stuff here. (laughter) I'm thinking, nooooo.</p>

<p>Which to me says the exact opposite, um, (sigh) you know, and so I can either ignore what he said and write what I was originally going to and write what I felt like I could do on my own. Um, which would result with something that he didn't like for reasons that are good. Um, you know, it wouldn't be very good. Um, (sigh) or I can make the changes that he suggested, um, which will a, involve a lot of research and be a lot more difficult and involve...[00:16:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is the term paper?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um, and just be working with material that I don't know as well and you know slogging in areas that I'm not naturally very good at, um, and you know would end up with a, a tentative and less satisfactory conclusion. Um, you know, basically he says his take on it, that we can say that they're part of a larger cultural tradition about the Persians that's a larger Greek tradition, but we can't talk about the texts. [00:17:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, which is ok. But, it doesn't actually get you very far. Um, and also that paper has already been written. And by other people, I don't, if I can't advance it why am I doing it? Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, uh, those sound like critiques of his critique.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Yes. Um, the problem is that I'm not sure that, is that I don't know that he's wrong. Um, both because I um, you know really respect his judgment independently, but more than that because I see where he's coming from. [00:18:38]</p>

<p>Um, but it's just turned into a situation where I can, you know kind of like breaking everything down into very small pieces technique. Ok, well the first thing to do is to open the document. And the second thing to do is to read through the outline that I have, the third thing to do is write in what he suggested that I change and then I have to shut it and go away. (laugh). [00:19:07]</p>

<p>Um, it, I just, I, I'm just not brave enough or something. Like I can't, I can't just push through it. Or I have not pushed through it. Um, but I can't quite figure out why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so, you said you think he may be right in his critique. That your standard of proof is too low and you can sort of only speak in a very general way about a shared culture that these texts are coming out of. [00:20:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, that it makes sense really if you're writing about that and then you say back, well, but like, what's the fun in that? I mean, which is more like where does that actually get you if you make a sort of stronger case that you ideally would want to, I guess somewhat more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the whole bulk of my paper relies on very close examination and comparison of two different texts and relies on, it presupposes the idea that you can compare actual texts that we actually have and look at direct connections. And so what he's saying is well no you can't do that idea. Which would, if I, if I carry out his idea to his logical, to their logical conclusion I can't write the paper as, as any of the ideas that I have. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>Because I can't say um, you know these two stories are alike in structure and in theme and in key words and phrases that we see and in the way that they construct power as relating to like father and daughter. Um, I mean, (laugh), oh it's a really good story, or two really good stories. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my whole methodology is based on looking at texts and, (exhale) so I, I just have to start over and do something that I wasn't very interested in doing. Um. [00:22:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. (pause) So you really feel at an impasse with his ideas I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, uh, I'm not hearing you imagine there to be any like reconciliation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of what you are in trying to do, want to do, how it sort of specked out to some extent and what he thinks of that and seems to want you to do instead. [00:22:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well it gets into this you know do I fit in this program, do I fit in this school here, and what I want to do actually valuable, is what I'm good at actually valuable? Um. Because you know I chose this topic, I chose this topic last semester because I've felt like I've been beating my head against the wall the last year or two and picking projects that were not well suited to my strengths. And I really wanted to, I really needed to win. [00:23:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so I said, this is what I do better than anybody else. I'm gonna do this. Um, it's like well, now it seems like either I'm not doing it very well, or that's not very useful. Um, or that's not what's wanted around here. Um, and, I don't know that I have anything else to offer (laugh). [00:24:04]</p>

<p>Um, you know they did not admit me because I can remember dates. Because I cannot remember dates. Like, I just, I just can't. Um, I mean I'm sure I can, yes I can. It's just, I do not have a (inaudible at 00:24:21). Um, you know, I'm not actually (pause) it's an odd choice for me to be a historian, um but entirely, everyone thought I was going to be a novelist. I thought I was gonna be a novelist, like that's where I go. Um... [00:24:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not just staying with literature, but actually doing creative writing and spreading out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I don't wanna. Um, you have to work really hard. (laugh). Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, I mean what is not obvious to me, and it, it, I'm not sure if it's sort of like relates to your issues or to things of the situation that I just don't know or understand or not getting a feel for yet; is like why one thing you haven't proposed is sort of hashing this out with him? I mean, in one way or to one degree or another you know? I don't know how much you want to put on the table, but something more about well here's what I'm interested in, here's why I think it might be valuable and I get where you're coming from around this, but I also see it like that, is that reasonable, are we really you know? Is it reconcilable? [00:25:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I kind of have already had that discussion in my head and I know how it would go, which, he's not very good at saying no, but he has very firm opinions. And so it would, he would listen and nod and um, then he would say well, if that's what you really feel I mean, then that's what you should do I guess. You know, I just don't think it's the thing to do. And, how (inaudible at 00:26:30). (laughter)</p>

<p>Um, and,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean and he's just, I mean he's impossible to get ahold of. Like he's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like logistically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um. He's one of those, one of my husband's advisors the same way, one of those people just with the absolute best most crystalline intentions who just doesn't get it done. And at some point you have to say, you know like it's really nice that you want to be a really good advisor and that's wonderful, but it doesn't matter at some point, you're not a good advisor. Um, you know it's really nice that he cares about me, but um, you know, he'll make an appointment to see me and then I'll wait for an hour before he gets there. Um, and that's the way it is with all of his twenty five students. [00:27:28]</p>

<p>I am the one that is still in course work, I mean my needs are lowest on the priority list. The people who are defending in six weeks still haven't gotten their list of corrections from him yet. You know, like, so it's hard to, there's not space to develop the kind of relationship where it would be easy for me to challenge him directly. Um I have a really hard time challenging people directly unless I know exactly what I want to say, or unless I feel very comfortable with them. Yeah, yeah, you know, so he says what he has to say and I say oh, ok that sounds fine. And then I leave and three hours later I'm like, no that's not ok. But it's too late then. [00:28:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um and because I don't know that either of us would change our opinions at all, I'd kind of say, well, like I said I had the conversation in my head so I already know how it'd end. Um, you know, I mean I know what I need to do which is incorporate some of the changes that he suggested but not all, and modulate, make it more clear in the paper than I think it was in the outline that I'm not trying to push the evidence farther than it will go, but I am trying to see how far the evidence will go. And you know, get a mediocre grade and have it be over. That's what I need to do. Um, I've known that's what I need to do for the last three months. [00:29:27]</p>

<p>Um, but, (pause), it's like this paralysis is like spreading out over everything else that I have to do. You know. (pause) And I, and I, (exhale) I never haven't been able to work before. You know I've never been in a place where if I just say ok, I'm gonna schedule my time, I'm gonna sit down and I'm just gonna write the damn thing, put the words on the page. I've never done that and then sat down and had it not work. Um, (pause) you know? [00:30:40]</p>

<p>A lot of it's like, (exhale) I uh, I, it, it, I feel like there's just so much uncertainty in the rest of my life, in my life in general? That it's harder to motivate myself like, it's harder to say no you just have to sit down and write the paper when at the back of my mind I'm like; I could be dead in two weeks, that is a real possibility. Um. (pause) There's not a good excuse. Um, [00:31:36] (pause) [00:32:04]</p>

<p>And there is still I mean, there still is a voice in my brain that says very reasonably that it's better to fail out of school than it is to be dead. But... [00:32:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter). Yes, I realize this. Oh, um, and I, I know I just, it, like, but I'm off this, I know I don't want to give up on this. You know I don't want to give up on something that I still love because of fear you know? I love this the most when I'm healthiest. And I hate it when I'm unhealthy and to me that says, this is something I should stick with. [00:32:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, (pause) I guess it seems to me that the kind of, I don't know if conflict is even the right word or maybe just different, differences between you and your advisor on this really undoes you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's sounding like, uh, his response to you was devastating. [00:33:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, it's just too bad because he meant it to be encouragement. (laugh) He really did, and I think that he walked away from that meeting thinking that I was encouraged. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that hard to see why you weren't? If you totally like, you needed to win, you needed to like get back to something that you were the best at and really kind of feel a reminder to assure yourself about your talents and what you have to offer. [00:34:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (exhale) it's a lot of shame, it brings a lot of shame to me that it's so important to me that I be very good at this. Um, you know why should it be that important to me that I be very good at this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're feeling that good right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many things do you really have to hold onto right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:35:16] (pause) [00:35:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause) I guess uh, I think in some sense, um, of how like in here for the period that we're meeting you've been putting yourself in my hands and I mean I don't really talk about it that there's something some parallel or analogous to the way you're putting yourself in your advisors hands and I think he told you something that like, you didn't want to hear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, actually I hadn't thought about it in those terms. But, yeah. [00:36:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even, it was as though like, you know, I feel as though he isn't seeing me clearly enough to even (inaudible at 00:37:04) That, so is either, I don't understand it because I, I do feel rejected in that way. But at the same time, he has really gone out of his way to like, if it's clear that he is going out of his way to try to make sure I feel like I belong in the program. Even with this whole thing going on and with like having to drop many classes and so forth. Um, but then I just feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable because he doesn't want what I have to offer. [00:37:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, the closer he looks the more he's just gonna realize that yeah that isn't what he was looking for. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see how that would make you feel so responsible. I mean I have in mind, you know, how on one hand he's sort of (inaudible at 00:38:30) and kind of visibly be kind of helpful and inclusive. Um, on the other hand, like, saying things that make you feel like it's really because of you that you're uh, not good enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's very visibly putting his faith in me, but everything he says to me makes me think that I don't deserve that faith. [00:39:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that there's so many people that have put their faith in me in this process and I can't do this. [00:39:20] pause [00:39:42] You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things that I'm saying or have said to you that have made you feel bad in the same way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me know if that changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, I will. Or I'll try to. Um, yeah. (exhale) Yeah it, I told you that James said that the major way that he could tell that I was depressed was how I take compliments right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:40:31)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That that, (exhale), yeah it, I have a hard time with people saying things that are intended to cheer me up. (laughter) Or are intended to like make me feel good about myself. [00:40:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see, like is there any part of the, in particular any things he does that are like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there's words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is it the other way? Yeah? Um, like, trying to tell you belong when you feel so different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or saying that there's a lot of good in what you outlined.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when he goes on to say what you know, make it clear what he is looking for, it's clear to me that the things that I most value in this project are the ones that he either takes for granted or doesn't value. Um. And that may or may not be actually true. I may be making that up in my head. [00:41:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least you're feeling or have thought he's not actually um, naming specific things that you're doing or an ability you have that he values in a kind of more general way he's acting as though he values you but kind of like more where the rubber meets the road, that's not how he's responding to you? Is that accurate? [00:42:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying he is saying you need, it's just.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and a lot of it also is that, um, (exhale) that I'm used to people with lower standards frankly, you know, I'm used to people who are more impressed by the things that I don't particularly consider impressive? [00:42:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, I don't, so there's like this, a certain degree of like positive reinforcement that I've come to count on that I'm realizing that I was counting on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, now it's like now well everybody can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see right, because if you're one of the people who've gotten so far as to be working with him, then like, presumably you're doing a lot right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the way that he, and, and, yeah, and he's not gonna focus on the things that you know, that you know are right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. And, you didn't quite say this but I'm assuming that he's kind of about exacting standards. I mean like.. [00:43:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For himself probably as much or more so than for anybody else, this is just kind of his..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. Which is why I wanted to work with him (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I uh, I mean I wanted to work with him because I wanted to write like him, or more like him, you know also like me. Um, yeah. And it's kind of, it's a conflict of things, because I've worked with, I've had professors who were that same kind of very very exacting standards before and it's been a very good thing for me. Um, you know I haven't had very many instances in which people really pushed me on my writing. Um, and I've usually responded really well to it. Like it's usually been a really good thing to say, oh here's somebody who can actually sees what I can do and wants me to do better. Um, and I think just, like this in combination with everything else falling apart um, is just. You know, so it's not like this is the one catalyst you know that it's... [00:45:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:17) professor, it's a whole other story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, it's all falling apart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't have anything anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, we have to stop in a minute. Um, I guess I'm a bit concerned that our having talked about it is going to contribute to you sort of going and thinking about it the rest of the day in a way that will make you feel really bad. [00:46:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's a possibility, (laughter), um my plan was to go and eat some lunch and then try to make a plan for the next few weeks, try to you know, schedule work. I don't really, I don't know what I should do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, want to give it another day on making a plan? Because I'd imagine...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can try that, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That much is going to happen between today and tomorrow. I (inaudible at 00:46:51) talk a little more, and we're not going to resolve everything tomorrow. Go out on a limb here. But, um, yeah, I guess uh.. [00:47:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Take it easy on myself?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can try to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great, yeah go for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you have difficulty, you know, really kind of spiral down or get worried or whatever let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

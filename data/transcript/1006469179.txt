<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. I’m injured, so I’ve been hobbling around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had it in the past where I just get this like this swelling in my foot that’s really painful and gets all red and, you know, I thought it was gout and I went to the doctor a couple years ago. He said no. And then comes back and it just keeps getting worse. And like stinging pain and then it starts getting like—you know, yesterday I couldn’t even put any weight on it. Or actually two days ago. So, and now my calf is all sore, crampy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:00:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, on Friday I went to pick up the kids. And, you now, Jess’ like, “Oh, do you want me to come over?” I’m like, “You know,”—you know myself. The woman said you know that Jess should drop off the kids. And that I should drop off. You know, I do go to the bank and, you know, it’s like the first time I wanted to go and actually walk in the square and walk around. And, you know, it’s like oh and get the kids. Lucille does not want to go. And I wouldn’t call it a—I mean, you know, it’s not like laying on the floor screaming nonsensically, tantrum. But, you know, “I’m not going to go,” crying, screaming, “I’m not going to go.” But, you know. And nothing would convince her. [00:01:47]</p>

<p>And shortly into it, I realized you’re not going to talk this kid into going. And Ian even mentioned how he felt awkward, you know, you don’t usually going with her, you know. And I was feeling—I just started feeling crappy and, you know. I’m like, “All right,” you know. Magical mom fix it, you know. And then she’s like, you know, “I’m following your lead.” She said to me or something like that. So, I’m like, “All right, Ian (ph), let’s go.” She’s like, “You’re going to take her like this.” I said, “No. I’m just going to take Shamish (ph).” And so, finally, you know, that’s what happened. I just started—I was just like—I don’t know what it was. I basically told Ian I was taking him back home, you know. I went from being like super happy to just, you know, almost in tears. I was like, you know—it was like—I don’t—you know. So, (pause 00:02:50 - 00:02:55)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really hurts (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I don’t know that it was as much her about that is more kind of big picture of just, you know, I don’t know what’s going on with the kids. It’s not like I talk to them every day, you know. You know, I’m missing most of her growing up. This is a product of, you know, me not being around, you know. I mean I think it’s—I’m not really hurt at all. I haven’t been hurt yet by anything she’s done or said, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m not so sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you know, at—for a three year old. It does hurt me when I tell her to shut the front door and she tells me I can’t say that. She won’t shut up. So, you know, I was bummed out. And (pause 00:03:47 - 00:03:51), you know, I texted Marcia and, you know, I went home. And I was like, you know, she was like, “Why,” you know. And I said it’s—I said basically, you know, when I try and explain these things to her, you know, fact by fact that doesn’t seem to work, you know. One time she asked me why I was—why I wasn’t feeling well. I was like, “Well, you know, I was having problems with the kids,” you know or something. “Ian was doing this,” and under her breath, she’s like, “They’re just kids. You know, kids are kids,” or whatever, you know. </p>

<p>And then, (inaudible) work was, you know, exceedingly difficult on Friday (inaudible). You know, I mean all those little under her breath comments. And not that, you know, that’s not expected, but, you know—I can’t express the big picture, you know. And so, she was kind of thrown off by the complexity thing. And, you know, you know, it was just really—you know, it’s not that I felt sad or anything. I was just very quiet Saturday night. We went to a show with some friends. And I was quiet, you know. And, you know, she starts getting, you know, little punchy and, you know, confrontational about it. [00:05:18]</p>

<p>And, you know, she’s like, you know, “I just want to know one thing. You know, how am I supposed to, you know, act,” or whatever. Because I’m like, you know, “Don’t come up to me every 15 minutes and ask me if I’m okay,” you know. And (pause 00:05:40 - 00:05:44) this was at 4:00 in the morning. The clock had gone forward and I was like, “This is not the time to discuss that,” you know. You got a couple of cocktails. It’s 4:00 in the morning, you know. And she would not let it go. She said she let it go, but she kept going back to it, you know. Like she was just, you know. She was all wired up. And I was the complete opposite, you know. And I just could not get her to stop just talking to me about it. So, I just rolled over. And that offended her. </p>

<p>And when I woke up in the morning, I noticed a little coldness. And she’s like, “Oh, you just turned away,” or whatever. And I don’t even remember what I said, but I started yelling at her. And she apologized a few times. And I went and got a coffee and she came back. She, you know, made the first move, you know. So, but I want to, you know, kind of, you know, tell her. You know, first of all, I don’t know how. I mean, first of all, you’re finally going to maybe make your money on this (inaudible 00:06:56) thing. I’ve been waiting for that one. So, you know, I like to talk to her about it, but, you know, she’s not an easy person to have a conversation with. You know, she won’t sort of, you know—she has ADD, you know. She just starts going off on tangents and whatever. And because I’ve tried before. </p>

<p>And because one of the things she was doing Saturday night, she would say things like, you know, like, “You know, not that this applies to you, Cameron, but all quiet people are assholes,” or some—that’s not what she said, but it was in that sort of vein, you know. And so, I kind of want to, you know, sort of, you know, educate her a little bit about how, you know, my conduct is going to be inexplicable and not seem—make any sense to someone who’s not depressed, you know. Because I think a lot of her—I think originally she thought she needed more than she did and that she was going to be able to help her be something. [00:08:08]</p>

<p>All she really does now is poke the bear, you know. And she realizes that. And I keep saying I’m going to—like last night I was like, “Oh, you know,”—I mean we were both kind of tired. So, I was like, “Oh, you know, this is probably a good time to talk about it.” She’s watching, you know, The Real Housewives, you know. She might be distracted a little. But I’m kind of like—I don’t know. Just, you know, I explained things in a very long roundabout way that people don’t follow. And she’s got a very short, you know—like this thing, this conversation is going to have to happen sort of spontaneously, you know. Kind of a moment that, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what is it that you want to explain to her about your depression? [00:09:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, well, she wants to know how—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How to help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How to act. And I just kind of want to show her—originally, I didn’t want to bring these things up. I didn’t want her to feel bad, you know. But now I want to kind of explain to her, you know, that, you know look me in the face telling me I’m depressed and to get over it or something like that is not a very helpful, you know. But more so (pause 00:09:28 - 00:09:33) trying to understand why I do something may not make sense, you know. I was going to—told Jess. She’s like, “Why don’t you want to do that? Why don’t you make that one phone call? Why don’t,” you know. It’s like, “I don’t know.” (pause 00:09:44 - 00:09:48) I don’t know why I was quiet Saturday night, you know. It was well past, you know. Of course, I went and feel asleep, you know. Marcia’s like, you know, go take, you know—get some rest. So, I fall asleep on the couch. And she says she’s up all night all worried, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you asking for advice, Cameron?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember Googling something about this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) Google didn’t help you figure all right. What else can I do? (inaudible 00:10:33)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean the reality is, is that, you know, you’re like the only person that I can say things to because, you know, (pause 00:10:40 - 00:10:46)—I just don’t have anyone. I don’t have a listener in my life, you know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might be able to train her a little bit. I mean I understand that she has ADD. And that she sort of doesn’t get what helps or how to help. And that that expectively leads you to not want to talk to her about this kind of stuff. It also sounds like at least at sometimes she does want to help even if so far she really can’t. But maybe that means, you know, she can learn to help a little or help in the right circumstances or something like that. I guess—</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what is help?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think what you want mostly is for her to listen and so that she understands that to be sympathetic and supportive, you know. So— [00:11:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I thought about this, you know. And every time it comes down to doing it I don’t do it. You know, because I really—you know, it’s like I want to make all these points and I realize that I’m lawyering it. That, you know, the fact that, you know, she responds the way she responds, you know, on a fact specific basis is not important, you know. It’s, you know, getting her to respond, you know. I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, yeah. So, sure. I mean the kids—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You need some water in your flowers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause 00:12:27 - 00:12:45) I mean you can even just tell her like the point is—like the thing that will help (coughing) is for her to hear you out. And to say things that are supportive. Hear you out to show that she’s understood what you have to say and to be supportive, trying to tell you you’re doing something wrong or trying to tell you that your reactions don’t make sense will inevitably make it worse. So, if, you know, you mention about the kids and you’re obviously upset about it, you know, she can either say, “Well, yeah. That sucked,” you know. I know you’re feeling lousy or not—more than alive. So, we’re that, you know, “I didn’t feel comfortable with you the other day. Do you (inaudible [00:13:42]). You know, that sucks.” </p>

<p>Or if she doesn’t understand, well, she can ask. She can say, you know, like, “Do you what bugs you so much about it? Clearly, you’re really upset. You know, what really bothered you about it. (pause 00:13:55 - 00:14:01) You know, I want to understand.” And that if she says something like, “Well, really what you need to do is appreciate that they’re just kids and they do things like that,” is going to make it worse because you’re already feeling—not only like you’re upset about it, but, you know, (pause 00:14:20 - 00:14:24) like it means you’re not doing well enough. And then if she tells you that you’re not reacting correctly, that’s going to add to your feeling that you’re not doing things right. And that makes you feel worse. (pause 00:14:36 - 00:14:40) </p>

<p>And my hunch is that this is difficult like the more (pause 00:14:48 - 00:14:54)—the more you can convey this to her like with some feeling behind it. I mean you do have feeling behind it, but the more you can convey that the better she’s going to listen for two reasons. You know, partly because she cares and when can sort of see from the emotion behind it that this really matters to you I think that will probably—you know, she’ll probably pay more attention to that. And also just (inaudible 00:15:25) ADD like if a moment is more intense it’s easier for them to stay with it. </p>

<p>You know, whereas if you started to kind of giver her an explanation and it gets a little cerebral and, you know, you give a complicated example, like, you’re going to lose her. But if you stayed with, you know, “This is what hurts. This is how you upset me. This is what really sucked about what you said.” Or like, “This is what I needed. You know, at that moment I felt like shit and what I needed was you to just listen and say, ‘Yeah. That sucked.’ And if you didn’t understand to ask me. You know what I mean? Like (pause 00:16:04 - 00:16:14)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, we’re listing the condo. We’ll see how that goes. I mean the sorry the Marcia thing sounds a little daunting. And I don’t know. Somehow, you know, Jess’ 16 years of criminal defense has made her an expert in real estate. So, it’s been fun so far. She doesn’t understand that this is a short sale that there’s just no combination of circumstances that we’re going to get anything out of it. So, it doesn’t matter what the sale price is. It doesn’t matter how much the broker makes. And again it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter, you know. It doesn’t matter what you list it at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything goes to the mortgage company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no. I mean some is going to be doled out to the realtor and we’re going to hire a specialist to deal with the bank because I know Jess won’t do it. And, you know, the planned attorney fees, so I’ll hire my buddy Phil to do nothing. And, you know, the certain fees, taxes that you do pay bill. But the rest they just, you know—and if there’s any expense you have it goes to the bank. So—[00:17:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that’s why none of it goes to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have three appointments tomorrow. One is a woman who showed up at the lawyer for the day, but she really doesn’t have a type of case that the program handles. So, I told her I take it on pro bono as part of the pro bono panel. But I think she’s entitled to attorney’s fees. So, I’m not going to charge her but, you know, so she should hire me. I’m meeting with a guy in the day—a guy talking about some sort of estate issue. I don’t know if that will end up being a client. But another guy later in the day who needs to do some trust work for his dad and what not. And I got a woman e-mailing me how she wants to meet with me tomorrow morning. It ain’t going to happen. [00:18:42]</p>

<p>So, you know, it’s hard for me to gauge, you know, completely how this thing is going to pan out. You know, my fear is that I’m not going to collect as much in attorney’s fees as I thought I would. I’m like I can always sort of peel back, but I’m getting cases that there’s this woman basically she left her apartment because of bed bugs. The landlord filed an eviction claim against her. Got a judgment for rent of $72,000 and when she went to go apply for her mortgage, you know, almost three years later, “Well, you got a judgment for,” you know. So, she’s got to pay me, you know. So, and I’ve done it before in the foreclosure setting. It’s real easy. But this one might—you know, first of all I’ve got to convince the judge to remove the default, you know, three years after it’s been (inaudible 00:19:34). </p>

<p>So, but so that kind of stuff. Eventually when I got it I was like ugh. But then I’m like, “You know, this is stuff that you get paid for. You tell them how risky it is. You win or you lose and then you go home,” and you know. And so I seem to be getting a real flow, you know. Majority of it’s tenant stuff, but, you know, the estate planning is there. There’s a probate in there. And I’m finding that people who initially I think contact me and then blow me off or whatever that they end up following up a little farther. So, you know, I just got so many people who owe me money, you know. [00:20:21]</p>

<p>It’s like I’ve done all these—the thing about these, you know, letting people—all these attorney fee cases not give me any money. “Oh, I’m going to send you $300.” And you said, “No. Drop off $200 (inaudible 00:20:33).” You’re my tenant, you know. She’s like, “Oh, I just put the check in the mail. You’ll have it in a few days.” From Wales to Andover. Yes. A few days. Yeah. So, now paperwork is (inaudible 00:20:49). Yeah. I got this couple who hired me to do an estate plan. And they e-mailed back the signature for the engagement letter and said they were mailing a check with the original. I never got the check with the original. And I had actually—they had a baby, so I had to actually followed up and then they responded. And they wanted to know if I would come into Manchester. Kind of just fell down the totem pole, so she responded back. [00:21:20]</p>

<p>You know, did I get the signatures and the thing from the boss that said, “Yes, I can—I got the signatures. Yes, I can meet you conveniently in Manchester whenever.” And I never did get the check and the original. I haven’t heard back from her which could be the baby. (laughter) You know, and so—and it’s like this one case where the checks in the mail as soon as something’s about to happen. I’ve noticed a pattern on this. You know, when you talk about there being something. Well, there’s a hearing. Oh, I’ll get that money tonight. Why the money has to go out tonight just—so, I think once I get into it more it won’t be as big of a problem because the cash flow—I should be ahead at some point. I can—won’t be lagging like I am now. Jess just gave me some money for her health insurance at least. But, you know, the taxes I put up for her are just, you know, pounding me. And it’s going to be a good month. [00:22:33]</p>

<p>But, you know, like I said I’m just waiting for checks to come and they’re not coming. You know, I got a thousand bucks for that Ware case. A title for—it was like a—sort of a research project for 450 bucks. It’s like, you know, just—I feel like I’m at the point where I’m making more money to—that I actually could start paying down stuff. And it really is—the money is kind of coming in just as, you know—to pay as you go. I bounced three things the other day. I don’t know how I do it. I think they’re right. But one of them was like a charge on my business card for $3.32, you know. I accidentally used it. And they charged me $35. And they flipped it, but I still have two other ones. And, you know, the thing is my banker told me that this would never happen. I explained this happened to me before where I made a charge and at the time I made the charge the money was there and then when it came through, you know, I get—it gets, you know. </p>

<p>So, (pause 00:23:45 - 00:23:53) I just kind of (pause 00:23:54 - 00:23:59)—but hopefully I’ll have my three closings. Start getting some retainers. And doing some work on cases, getting demand. I got really, you know, this tenant stuff is very structured time wise, you know. And I’ve really got to get some case management system in place, you know, because everything has to be done within a certain amount of time. You don’t do it you’re fucked. And it’s not like 30 days. It’s like five days, you know. So, you take a day off in the office, you know, (inaudible 00:24:35). Next thing you know and in landlord/tenant, you know, most things service is upon filing—is upon mailing. </p>

<p>So, if you drop it in the mailbox, it’s served. You know, the time is extended three days, but that’s, you know. It’s filed—considered filed with the court on mailing, you know. Well, in landlord/tenant it’s upon receipt, you know. So, when they get it, when the court—the court has to get it by that date. So, if it’s lost in the mail and the court doesn’t get it too bad, you know. So, you know, I got to kind of wrap myself—my head around this, you know, is something just being delivered to someone’s house. Is that receipt, you know? I mean I would think so, but, you know. I don’t know. Dollar. (laughter) Draw all these arguments. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do people send things registered or whatever it is? You can tell when somebody got it. [00:25:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that’s the worst thing you can do. Because they don’t pick it up. They never got it. You send it certified mail and first class. And that way, you know, it’s hard to prove that you didn’t get it. (pause 00:25:53 - 00:26:01) I got to send a demand out today and it will go out. Certified mail and regular mail. And I’ve got to get this to Merrimac by Thursday. And I think what I’m going to do is use FedEx two day air. The other option would be like, you know, priority mail with delivery confirmation, you know. But I trust FedEx more than I—and if FedEx fucks it up I know I could drive to the court and do what I did last time it happened, you know. </p>

<p>So, yeah. (pause 00:26:43 - 00:26:54) Colleen wants to go see Lady Gaga for her birthday. (pause 00:26:59] - 00:27:03) (laughter) I think the crappy tickets are like, you know, a hundred bucks. (inaudible 00:27:14) upper like single, you know. And then Ticketmaster sells these really good seats for like 375 bucks. Like, you know, they’re just like (inaudible) some good seats. You know, it’s about what they’re going to look for on (inaudible) probably or—I don’t know. But (pause 00:27:36 - 00:27:43) staying there is like $500 a night on a Saturday. Yeah. And but there’s lots of little hotels around there. There seems to be some sort of show. So, we’ll see. (pause 00:27:59 - 00:28:05) If it’s very low on the list of (crosstalk)—I was saying it’s very low on the list of things to pay for. (pause 00:28:09 - 00:28:13) She actually asked for it. (pause 00:28:15 - 00:28:36) You know, if that’s going to happen—why’d you roll your eyes?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn’t.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just miraculously rolled. I mean maybe I ought not to use the word rolled but turned back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I went like that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause 00:28:54 - 00:29:29) So, like, yesterday I literally drove to Pembroke just to check the mail. I mean part of it is checks, but now with litigation, you know, I’ve got to be seen—I got to see if stuffs coming in, you know. And it’s like today, you know, I’ve got a—I’ve got to do that motion by Thursday. And whether the discovery comes today or not slightly affects, you know, the success of the motion, you know. (pause 00:29:59 - 00:30:05) That could be as late as 2:00, but I got to go see Micah at 3:00. (pause 00:30:08 - 00:30:11) I’m seeing her an awful lot because of the whole, you know, not taking my medicine. And stuff like that. And then, you know, I’m going to need new scripts for the Adderall. So, I have to go in and make an appointment just for that. (pause 00:30:35 - 00:30:40) (music) That’s (inaudible). (laughter) (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not my call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you’re in a lawyer’s office and you’re meeting with an attorney about your will and that came on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) It would depend who I was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like it. Like that was the woman who wants to meet tomorrow morning. So, (pause 00:31:27 - 00:31:31) I don’t—oh god. (pause 00:31:32 - 00:31:37) I mean yeah. I really got to get, you know, I remember when I worked for (inaudible) shop in Leicester. My boss was like you need to touch every file every day, you know. And I need to do that. Whether it’s just having a spread sheet and what’s going on and, you know. But I am supposed to be taking over this case and I haven’t even talked to the clients yet. And haven’t read the fee agreement, the complaint, anything, you know. And I feel less guilty about this stuff because I’m like I don’t know—really having a (inaudible). I got plenty of other work, you know. (pause 00:32:25 - 00:32:32) I want more closings though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like that’s still kind of the easiest money. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean if the seller thing works out that would be good. Got a little more easy to do while doing the litigation. But the reality is that refinances, you know, is—court time is, you know 9:00 to 1:00 or 2:00 to 4:00. So, those really—you can work around because refinances you’re usually (inaudible) them at night. And I can now file from anywhere basically electronically. So, yeah. Squeeze in the closing. So, I’ve been doing more closings. (pause 00:33:23 - 00:33:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will that pick up seasonally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You would think. You know, there was this surge and then just judging by—you know, I still have some people, you know, going under agreement and looking and what not. But I have zero title examination orders right now. And one is a very busy attorney and the other one does, you know—it’s Phil. So, he’s been doing more than me lately, so I can’t say he’s a schlub (ph). But so, you know. I don’t know if that doesn’t bode well or not but, you know. (pause 00:34:16 - 00:34:34) Did you download the new operating system update?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope. I haven’t.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most unbelievable feature on the calendar where you can just kind of go to the list of some of the—you know, who are we missing? And you go into the calendar and it’s got this little—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can make a list of your things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thing up there. Yeah. So, but you could go—you could always do that, but you couldn’t do it right from the screen. I think, you know. So, you don’t have to go scrolling through 24 hours of appointments. Boom, there’s—here’s the stuff I got to do today at one time, you know. But working all day that’s fucked up. So, (pause 00:35:20 - 00:35:25). I got to sign up for spring league tomorrow and I have to tell this guy I’m like five to five. You guys are going to have to wait around for about ten minutes because I have to sign up for spring league. So, now one—move in on my fucking office, but, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it because the checks aren’t—</p>

<p>CLIENT: What’s that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it because the checks haven’t been coming in? Is that why you’re waiting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I went ahead and told them to go ahead because I thought some money was coming in. And I don’t have to worry about paying my—you know, the contractor right off the bat. But he hasn’t been to LeTip in two weeks. And, you know, Patricia always says, “He’s on a business trip,” or something like that. I don’t know. But he’s sick or something. But, you know, I got three appointments tomorrow and my office looks like shit, you know. Because that’s the thing, you know, with these, you know—and I’m going to hold steady on this ground, but these landlord/tenants are coming to me. [00:36:24]</p>

<p>And for the most part it’s going to be during business hours, you know. I made the—you know, I did that for that woman to, you know, after work and she never showed up and I got a parking ticket at the Plymouth office. (pause 00:36:38 - 00:36:42) And so, when these people didn’t believe who good her case was, you know, I was like unbelievable security deposit violations. And she just, you know, whatever. Maybe she found another attorney. I don’t know. But call and cancel, so I don’t get a parking ticket, you know. (pause 00:36:59 - 00:37:14) Yeah. I’ve definitely gone through (pause 00:37:14 - 00:37:18), you know, a wide range of emotions, you know. But I would say I’m still for the most part, you know, happier than, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible) things that overall are going pretty well with Marcia. And that business has picked up. It doesn’t sound like you’re having much trouble being motivated in doing stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, yesterday and this morning, you know. It was really actually 4:00 that I’m waking up instead of 5:00. I kind of went yesterday—I went home and then just snoozed on the couch for a couple of hours. So, there’s that bit of funkiness, you know. Both were obviously pretty early, but yeah. I just, you know, today I’m ready to get the office and get shit done. Was that this morning? Getting shit done. (burping) Excuse me. (pause 00:38:13 - 00:38:24) I was a little, you know, what to do about Marcia.. I don’t know. I just figure I’m not going to push the issue until I really need to, you know. I think she realized, you know, she went a little overboard. Unlike Valentine’s Day where I don’t think she realized. I mean she knew something happened, but I don’t think she knew what, you know. (pause 00:38:54 - 00:39:00) But I was able to be very specific when we (inaudible). I mean I told her that these problems that, you know—let’s not talk about it. (inaudible) 4:00 in the morning, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I think that’s great. I think that makes a lot of sense. It seems like that is often when the trouble happens. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause 00:39:19 - 00:39:26) And then it’s like, you know, Laurel who is not drinking, who’s driving. He gave her a ticket, but she still—you know, it’s a huge favor to drive everybody. And it’s the paradise. So, and I even told Marcia, you know, before I even got (inaudible) after the show. And, you know, we’re all walking for pizza. And I’m like, “Where’s Marcia,” you know. And she ended up going into a bar to get a drink, you know, with a friend or whatever. And I was even said—I was like, you know, I barely see you, you know, all night, you know. And then we’re going for pizza and number one, it’s uncool for Laurel who says no drinks, you know. Let’s go. And, you know, spending time with me, you know. I went to get pizza, you know. [00:40:24]</p>

<p>And she’s saying, “Well, you know, there’s no difference in time between getting a drink and getting pizza.” I’m like, “Actually, we were waiting for you because we were pulled out in the street. We were coming over to get you. And, you know, you chose to get a drink over pizza with me,” you know. So, it’s, you know. You know, I’m trying not to attribute it to her, you know. That this is going to happen no matter what relationship I’m in. I’m going to piss off whoever I’m dating, you know. Without trying. So. (pause 00:41:04 - 00:42:06) </p>

<p>Her dad and Flo are coming to town. Hopefully, I’ll have money to get Flo. There’s like the first, you know, tournament of the season, you know. Clearly, I wouldn’t be in shape for it, but I at least want to go and run and throw (inaudible), you know. It’s not, you know—no one’s going to care if I go out there and fuck up because it’s, you know, April. And also there’s this thing called the Rock and Roll Hotel somewhere in Pennsylvania. I guess it’s like a normal hotel and then they just have these things where they have bands playing throughout the hotel for like 24 hours, you know. And Dumpstahunk, which is one Neville brothers, is the head liner. And Marcia really wants to go to that. And I really want to go to the handball tournament. (laughter) And we’re going to be hanging out at the (inaudible) with the kids at the pool. At least I am. (pause 00:43:06 - 00:43:21) How late were you today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a feeling I owe you an extra quarter in there. (pause 00:43:29 - 00:43:35) I’ll just deduct that from the invoice. (crosstalk). (pause 00:43:39 - 00:43:52) I’m sure there’s other stuff, but you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don’t you finish up now? (pause 00:43:57 – 00:44:13)</p>

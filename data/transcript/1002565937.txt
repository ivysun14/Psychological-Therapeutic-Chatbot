<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, yeah, because they don't just, special ed, when a child goes to special ed, it doesn't mean that they're fully, unless they're severely disabled but he's, I mean like mental but there's some classes because they try to, even for special ed, when they're in classes, you know, they try to work them to see if they can get them to be, you know, regular classes or whatever.  He can do some regular classes but he's in some special ed.  How many special ed, 2 or 3?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Geometry, huh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Geometry is tough for anybody, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have any problems in school with other kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not involved in fights and arguments and things like that?  Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he have any problems at home now, behavior problems?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's a very good kid, he just has a hard time remembering and, you know, he knows that his job is to take the trash out, he'll walk by it 8 times and it's overflowing until you really, you know, get him, get him to get his attention focused that that's a responsibility, you know, he's been by it 8 times, it's got to get done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's always, everything, he's got callouses on his knuckles from [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	From doing what?  How is that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The TV, the wall, he'll come down the stairs, go past the stove or turn around real quick and go, and then walk away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have that problem for a long time, since, how long you know him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Eight years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, huh.  What does your fiance, what does his father do now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, he's at work right now but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of work he does.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Construction.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, he's in construction.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so his mother passed away, right?  How long ago your mother died [PATIENT NAME], you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I forgot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] was [AGE] and she's [AGE], so [AGE], I'd say [AGE], I've known you since you were about [AGE] or [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I've known you since you were [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you grew up with who [PATIENT NAME], you grew up with your grandparents or what?  Who you grew up with when you were growing up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Step dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Step dad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which is [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, but the one you are living with, you are presently living with your own dad, right?  All right.  I see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	His real dad, his mother, he was what, [AGE] when your, he was like [AGE] when his mom came to Michigan from California.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] took care of him ever since.  They never knew who their real father was and then the mother got into a car accident and died so the state said, well, you know, you're basically the father, you've been in his life his whole life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're his father—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually stepfather then adopted him or something or what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think, pretty much, yeah.  I don't think he had to adopt him, I think they—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what is your fiancé's last name, it's not [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it's [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's [NAME OTHER].  So he was on medicine for a while, he stopped taking it when?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A few years, it was years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's not taking any medicines?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, his grandma had him taken off of it because she felt that he wasn't getting nowhere and actually after he did quit taking it, it was like he was always zoned out, he never was academic, he never would want to go ride a bike, even what kids should be doing at 10 years, 11 years old—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He wasn't doing nothing but then after they took him off that medication, he was more active, he was, you know, more socialized a little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're seeing a counselor now, is it helping you to focus better?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Somewhat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to try some different medicine to help you focus better?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, um, what was that stuff that he was talking about?  I don't remember what [NAME OTHER] was talking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mainly something to help me focus behind a car because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, we give a lot of medicines, including the one you took before, and there's a new medicine called Strattera.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, my son is on Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I said, yeah, my son is on Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's on Concerta and Strattera in one day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Concerta [LAUGHING], well, he's doing all right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he takes 54 mg of Concerta and 40 mg of Strattera—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In a 24 hour time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but he has maybe more problems than he has.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Way severe, more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Way, way severe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe we can, uh, Strattera is a new medicine, it doesn't cause, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But the Paxil—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bloating or drowsiness.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is that what he said, Paxil?  Didn't he—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Is that what he said [NAME OTHER]'s on?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He said something about on Paxil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Paxil is for depression though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I was going to say, Paxil is for depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it doesn't help you focus better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was another one too wasn't it?  His, after his mom dying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think it was about a year and a half later, his dad met this woman, her name was [NAME OTHER], she was just awful, he, he was on that medication, Concerta and Paxil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That, that kid was so zoned out, he was [INAUDIBLE] child.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, maybe he was taking a little too much, I guess.  Is he slim like this all the time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any physical problems, [PATIENT NAME]?  How come at this age, you're [AGE], he should be full of energy and doing a lot of things.  He doesn't eat well?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Pull out the bible and he'll tell you everything about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, all religions.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He doesn't get in trouble, he's not a troubled kid, the school says I'm blessed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So let me see, is the problem with mainly not able to focus?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not being able to focus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We've been trying to do driver's, to teach him how to drive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it was even hard for him to even listen.  I, I mean because I know how—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you go to driving school already?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't go, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's why I want to get on something to help me focus.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because the school even said that they feel that maybe he should, that he wasn't really ready yet because he's not able to focus and, you know, like I'm saying, when we were trying to, I'm teaching him all the parts of and, you know, I know how to break things down for children with needs, you know, I've got one of my own, severe mental disabilities, and to break things down I was trying to, I tried to break it down for him too so maybe he'd understand it a little bit better and he's still having a time, I could tell him 15 times, remember, don't forget, you've got to put your foot on the brake and put it in gear to put it in reverse to back up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I had to tell him 15 times, the same thing and it's like, as soon as he goes up and around, come back, when he goes to put it in reverse, you have to tell him again, don't forget to put your foot on the brake because there's, you know, so he wants to be able to start doing driver's training but he also, for school purposes and for outside of school purposes, he would like to be able to function a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he have any problems with school, with other kids, you know, getting angry and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get along with other kids, you have friends and they don't bother you or anything?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, he's wonderful?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have never been in a fight, suspended, I had an in school suspension but that's for tardies and minor things but no out of school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you doing in your grades nowadays?  How are you grades, all right, or going down—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're okay</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think that if he was able to function better and be able to focus better, he'd probably be able to understand more, you know, he'd be able to grasp more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or focusing on getting passing grades.  I mean with a D you can, if you have 9 absences, you flunk that class—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, after he puts, whatever he decides to put you on anything, if he does and it helps you, after, watch, a couple months later down the road, how much you'll be able to see that you was able to expunge all that stuff into you and your grades, you'll see a big difference, you'll see a way big difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, medicine will help but you have to concentrate—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it'll help, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To try, to try to memorize things too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't want you just to go through high school with just D's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The medicines are not do to everything for you though, you have to work hard, harder than other kids—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To pay attention in school and also do your homework regularly.  If you have some problems, you should ask the teacher or the counselor, maybe they'll give some special things for you to help you, that's the way to get better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He wants to just, he thinks that just if he gets a D, it's passing and he's just going to move on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he wants to be so much things in life, a teacher and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I told him, you've got to work a little harder and try to focus on those grades because, I mean yeah, a D is okay, you're passing it but sometimes, you know, depending, nowadays it's getting hard, sometimes you can't even get a job at McDonald's unless you have a high school diploma.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, getting worse nowadays, he has to [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The more education you have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe we'll try a small dose of Strattera and see how it works.  We'll start with 20 mg.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that works with OCD for children?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, OCD, so why don't we try that and see how it is and depending upon it, then we'll adjust the medicine, you know, things like that.  All right with you?  All right, you have to sign a little form here about your medicine.  Here.  He's [AGE] now, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He can sign himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What dosage?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty, 20.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that a good dose?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't know, she doesn't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the, um, medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you will try that and see.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What is it, how many, what's the dosage?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty mg.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Twenty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We start at the small dose.  You have to sign here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER], [AGE], weighs 55 pounds and he takes 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but he has more problems.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is severe, yeah, my son suffers emotional mental impairment, he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because he was having trouble with medicines before, we want to try you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At a small dose—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, if small dose don't work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see whether it's helping but if it's getting adjusted or doing better, maybe we can increase the dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are these old photos of [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, very old I guess.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, check them out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and I were not born.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were at that museum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's really into that.  He would really love to see the whole [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it's crappy nowadays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't take any medicine from the family doctor or anything?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't get frequent colds or allergies or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, he don't have nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well you can get a cold.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If he gets a cold, he just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why he doesn't eat good, why you so slim?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't have any physical problems?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, I guess, I don't know, his real dad, possibly, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	His real dad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	His sister is petite too but I think it's genetic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I'm talking about, he's the only one from his father and mother then?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, so we don't know nothing about the real father.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't know but I'm just telling you that if he has some problem eating—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He loves potatoes and macaroni and cheese, everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, he can eat all the junk food, he can gain weight.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the thing is because he's so slim, I thought maybe he had some other problems.</p>

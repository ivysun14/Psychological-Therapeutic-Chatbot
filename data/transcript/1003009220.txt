<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not sick.  I just got allergies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How was your Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was in the Caribbean.  So I went swimming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Cruise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  I love those cruises.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Obviously your family does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys ought to write some book on that or something.  How to do it right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've taken a few of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should write a book on how to, how to make a cruise the best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they have plenty to get, plenty to eat I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  There was plenty to eat, [INAUDIBLE] gambling so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?  Where'd you guys go this time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just on the Caribbean and we just went to the [DEIDENTIFIED] and we went to the Bahamas and we went to the [DEIDENTIFIED] for our last stop.  It was a little bit colder there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it was still warm.  A lot warmer than it is here and then, um, there was a bunch of people from Canada on the ship.  About half the people were from Canada.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The other half were from America which was really weird so it kind of sucks for them because they have to go back to a -12 degrees Celsius up in Canada.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], so you got a chance to talk to some of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, I was out with the Canadians mostly the whole week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For those 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't take anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I took my friends [NAME OTHER].  He's my roommate in college.  He's a cool dude.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever take anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I took, um, [NAME OTHER].  A dude named [NAME OTHER], um, to our, on a Mediterranean cruise and that was fun.  So, glad I'm did that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you guys had a nice break?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, it was fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your mood been?  Pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, mood's been pretty good.  Um, I was thinking about going off the Strattera though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't know.  I guess it's just like it kind of keeps my hyperactivity down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I didn't talk as much.  Uh, I'm not there as much.  So I was thinking of asking you what you think and seeing if I could wean off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the purpose of that would be what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just to increase my like socialization because I don't, whenever I don't take my Strattera I might forget to take it.  I notice I'm a lot more social.  When I take it I just confine myself to my room and I don't like that.  I don't know that I'm doing it.  It's just subconsciously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing in your room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing, I'm just like doing my homework which I guess is a good thing or I'm just like playing video games or wasting time and I'd rather be out like with other people.  So I was thinking of, I was going to ask you about -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been off of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Have I been off of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, like I'll, sometimes I might forget to take it for a day but that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you haven't noticed anything [INAUDIBLE] you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I noticed a tremendous difference when I forget to take it.  It's just, I'm a lot more hyper and I have a lot more energy.  Um, like I've taken it today.  I've taken it most days but I just seem to talk more and I'm more social when I don't take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a kind of drug that, uh, you know you've got to take it everyday to wo, to certain blood level.  If you don't take it then you know it could drop some.  It takes a while to get it back.  Um, don't really have to, how much are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sixty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Don't really need to wean off of it so much as you could just stop it.  When's your first day of school back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, this Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then stop it and see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And keep in mind too that if you go back on it, it's going to take awhile to be effective.  It may take up to 3 to 4 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And try and see.  Are you taking any other medicines right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, Adderall.  The 28 and the 20 extended release in the morning and then I have the 10's for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To take occasionally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I haven't been taking them over the break, but the 10's, I've been taking them over the break because I don't have any schoolwork to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They last about how long for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The 10's?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well yeah now it's been about 3 hours probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two or 3 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the XR, can you tell the duration of action with that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The XR I usually take it about 9:00 in the morning or whenever I wake up and then, um, they usually last me until probably 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon.  So, I don't know how many hours it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and what are your class work, class schedules is next term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my classes.  Well, see I don't have any classes on Fridays but um, I don't have any classes before 11:00 in the morning.  But then, um, my classes go, one of my classes on Thursday go till 8:30 at night so it's going to be a little bit different or anything else I've done before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you going to be doing in the mornings then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, mornings I'll either be working or I'll be doing homework that I have to do for my classes at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Working in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Well we have [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].  They just opened up an assisted living up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So we'll -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you go there at what time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'll probably go there, probably 9:00 in the morning.  I'll probably wake up at 8:00, get ready, wait for an hour in the cafeteria and then head on up there,  and I'll stay there an hour and half, come back around 10:30 and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that worth it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What working?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what is that for an hour and half then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just go for an hour and a half, probably everyday.  And then I'll on Fridays I'll go all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When are you going to study?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well like in between my classes I've worked it out so I have at least an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In between each of my classes so I'll be able to study each of my classes after the class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So who do you have next year anyway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who do you have for classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I have microeconomics.  Um, I'm taking a, oh, what, what's the degree you get when you go to law school?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> JD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm taking one of those like, uh, UN classes like model UN.  Yeah that's it.  Model UN nations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's under a different category.  Now it's called, I'm taking that.  That's the one that goes till 8:30 on Thursday.  Then I'm taking a computer class.  That's mandatory and, um, I'm taking another English class, my last English class.  Then I'm taking a math class and there's only one.  I'm taking 19 hours next semester so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It seems like a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But I'm ready for it.  Well like I got, my last semester was pretty easy except for my one class which I really, I did the best I could have done in it which was a C.  Um, I just don't feel, I just didn't feel very challenged last semester so I'm going to challenge a little bit this semester.  And I have until the, like half way through the semester to drop the class with no you know no harm done.  So if I want to drop the class if it's too much, I can drop it any time I want.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but I don't feel, I don't feel it's going to be too much but if it is I can drop one class and go back to 16 hours which is what I basically did this semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which worked out all right.  My roommates, he has to take a lot because he only did 12 hours last semester and, uh, in order to keep his like scholarship he has to take, he said 30 hours in a year.  So he's going to take like 19 this semester and he has to take a May semester class so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that kind of sucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you haven't gotten behind like that.  What's your GPA now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 3.1.  So I've kept my life well, be able keep it after this semester.  Which is good because my dad would be pretty pissed, losing $5000 a year, so.  But he's making me pay for college now so kind of weaning me off the money that I made in high school.  I saved up all the money in high school and now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you getting paid at your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm getting paid.  He's, he's comping me, like, an allowance scholarship.  So that's what I'm doing.  So it's not like he's not paying me for college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's kind of paying for college but at the same time he's making me balance my own bank statements and all that which is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of have a girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's about the same but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, same girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same relationship changed some?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Like during college it was bound to either change so.  I'm glad it changed.  I'm glad it didn't end because it would be like, uh, but for a long time I thought it was going to end.  Because there are so many girls up there.  I was just like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's how you sounded like last time.  You didn't think it was going to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well we made it through the first semester so.  I figure if we can make it through the first semester we can make it through every semester but I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If she's not too jealous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's jealous of all the girls there.  She like, "Now [PATIENT NAME] you can't go hang out with all the girls at the parties."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], I just won't tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do get anytime to socialize at all?  Do you come home much or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I come home probably once a month and just stay the weekend at home and then every other weekend is just partying and yeah like I'm socializing.  Last semester I was pledging for my fraternity.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I had no time to do anything because I had classes.  I was doing, I was working and I was pledging and, uh, so this semester I'll be, it'll be a lot easier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll be involved with your fraternity this term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will be involved but only to an extent.  I'm the assistant treasure this year or this semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I'll be doing all of that, trying to collect the money.  So I'll have a lot of enemies in the fraternity.  They won't like me, but, um, I will, it's not like pledging.  Pledging was just overwhelming as far as time goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then next year you'll have to participate and that, the other side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll get to participate probably before.  I'll, my roommate's going to pledge next semester so that'll be better because I'll have a pledge in my room with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So no May semester for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No May semester for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then in the summer you're just going to be working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  This summer I'm going to go to mechanic's school.  Um, just like as far as cars go and just work on cars all summer.  It's just what I really want to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  This is different.  I hadn't heard this thing ever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I was, I was thinking about it and like I figured if there was anything I wanted to do in my life besides the [DEIDENTIFIED] it would be a mechanic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does your dad think of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I haven't told my dad yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told my mom.  My mom thinks it's an awesome idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I don't know if your dad's going to think it's too cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't, I guess my dad won't think it's very cool at all but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just got to tell him that it's something I want to do.  It's going to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean you're paying your way so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know if he's counting on you working though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I think he could go a summer without me.  I've worked for him every summer since 6th grade so I just kind of want a summer where I can do what I want to do and I would have so much fun doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd like to think that you want to do all the time not just in the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know.  If I had fun in the summer I might just cancel [DEIDENTIFIED] all together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ooh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know about all of that.  I do like working in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still have [DEIDENTIFIED] as you last name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is fun.  It is, I do like working there with old people but cars is just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are finding it a little bit tedious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, well what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you're doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I love, um, I actually do like tedious things like just things that take a lot of time and are very precise.  Uh, which is why I like doing accounting and billing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even though it's repetitious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even though it's repetitious I like doing it everyday.  I, I don't mind doing it.  Um, well there's some things I mind like, I don't like going to class even though it's the same thing everyday.  I could never see myself being a teacher because I would just like, I would have to deal with people all day.  I don't want to deal with people.  I like socializing and like meeting new people but I don't like dealing with them, like, their problems that they have and just like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So shouldn't we keep you on your Strattera, then?  Keep you in your room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, see that's the problem.  I want to be out and I want to socialize and get past like my whole thing with people.  I'll just deal with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't want to be with people but it's a goal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a goal.  Like I need to.  Like if I'm going to be running [DEIDENTIFIED], I need to be with people so I need to get use to it now while there's no pressure on me.  I'm just in college.  I'm just a college kid so there's nothing too really to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did you get to be assistant treasurer?  Did you volunteer for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well it kind of was like along with the whole [DEIDENTIFIED] thing how I've been, I've been working in accounting and billing for the past couple of years.  So I know a lot about QuickBooks and Excel and I know a lot about numbers and how to make them work.  So, um, they couldn't let me be treasurer because the treasurer has to live in the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And if I'm a freshman, I can't live off campus so I have to stay on campus so they made me the assistant treasurer and then next semester I'll be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that something you wanted and you volunteered for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I volunteered.  I wanted to be treasurer.  I ran for it and I was like vote for me to be treasurer and at the last moment we were looking through like the regulations and I couldn't do it so how it works is the treasurer, he appoints the assistant treasurer so he just appointed me as his assistant treasurer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you're doing the work as the treasurer under a different name I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll probably end up doing more than he will but we'll have to see.  He's been doing it for a year so he's going to teach me you know or he's going to show me how to pay the bills and who to pay the bills to and kind of show me the ropes that he's learning.  Then I'll just take over next year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where are you doing mechanic school at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't figured it out yet.  I'll probably be doing, I'll probably have to go out of state to do it during the summer.  Um, I'll probably have to go out of state all summer because they'll, I'll have to go out to Tennessee or something like that to the [DEIDENTIFIED].  Well at least the Southeast.  Um, there might be one in South Carolina that I haven't heard of yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, there's probably one up in I think, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, a tech school up there.  [DEIDENTIFIED] maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll have to look into that maybe.  Because that, uh, uh, I much rather stay here and just to be able to make contact but if I have to go to Tennessee, I have to go to Tennessee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that would probably be up there and I'd say it's not just the summer long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's a 2 year for you.  But they have summer programs that I've looked into like just specializations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not like a whole mechanic but you, then you don't get your license but you can be, um, certified like in electronics are certified in body repair or something like that through a summer course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can see if you like it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's the only reason I'm doing it just to see if I even like doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you know you will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I will because I like working on my own car and I like learning new things and I like learning out things work.  I love learning how things work just like it's, it's just entertains me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty good hobby for you.  You'd be like Leno.  Yeah.  You do your one job and you got your other thing going.  And you had a good holiday.  So we'll just stop the Strattera and, uh, you'll let me know how you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have the Adderall, which you don't have to take everyday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because as, you know if you miss a dose of that it's uh, it doesn't matter.  So just discontinue the Stattera.  So how are things around the house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, around the house they're good.  Um, except for my sister.  I hate my sister now.  I just can't stand being around her.  She -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't think she could be more annoying you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, everything she's doing is wrong.  I just can't image her growing up like this just like everything she does just messes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's she doing so bad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know she just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought she's working and going to school and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She calls my mom a bitch on a daily basis and she's partying all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going out every night and coming back in late and she has to get up to go to school the next morning.  And it's just, like, I mean I guess she's doing all right.  She's doing fine.  She has a high GPA.  She still goes to work and I don't know.  I can't, I can't see my sister working.  Well at least being a hard worker and everyone over there is saying how hard of a worker she is and whatever but I have a feeling it's just because she's [NAME OTHER]'s daughter that they're saying that.  So I'm not really sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that where she's getting her friends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From work?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she's getting her friends from high school.  So, yeah high school.  Um, that's who she's really hanging out with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I was kind of under the impression she was hanging out with people from work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She hangs out with one woman from work named [NAME OTHER] a lot but [NAME OTHER]'s fine, [NAME OTHER]'s a cool girl, she's in her 20's and she's like the marketing person over there I guess and she works with [NAME OTHER] a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  So you, uh, you and your sister get into huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah we get into it a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Otherwise you just ignore her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just try to ignore her the best I can..</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's, what's your girlfriend doing next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going back to high school.  You -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is she just a junior?</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME], how have you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The same old, same old.  My mother stressing me - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to tell me about it?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About cooking in her house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Well, let's talk about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And using her electricity.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  So your mother's been kind of fussy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How long has this been going on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Basically all my life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All your life?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, controlling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, she likes to be the boss.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me some more about that.  Tell me about your mother.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She works seven days a week, as you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She works seven days a week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a lot of working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me some more about her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't get off days so it's like I realize what she's doing, some people change, some people don't, some things affect people more than others.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why does she work so much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess because she feels like she has to, because I'm older, I'm [AGE], my son is [AGE], I mean I don't know what she's working hard like that for.  Everything to me is paid for, except for - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, it's not for money?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't even put my hands on it no more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me a little bit more about your mother.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's [AGE], she has diabetes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Diabetic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> High blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, probably some other sicknesses I don't know of, but for now, she sneaks around and goes to the doctors for different things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't know what for.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I know I catch the hard end of her day.  When she feels like she's had a bad day, I catch it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because she says she goes to her job and works hard and I don't do nothing, but lay up in the bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She feels you're not being as productive as you should be?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but she doesn't know what I have done that day.  I could have been to one of my doctor's appointments, came to see you or went and helped my godmother and made some money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She don't know because she doesn't talk to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't ask.  She assumes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And just takes it from there and just goes off and I don't say anything to her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it doesn't take much to upset your mother?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's always been kind of like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You could be explaining something to her and if you're not, prompt with it, she'll holler and scream.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She treats everybody like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she treat me and my son like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she's not like that all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She is like that all the time, so she treats everybody like that then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know how she treats them at work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of work does she do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She works at [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what does she do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she supervises people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how does she treat people at work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably the same way, talk to them real loud and nasty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she's real loud?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fussy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  Bickering.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and she works all the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  And it's really bothering me because - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like your mother has a lot of energy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She might.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She doesn't?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  She comes in and goes to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she's - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She gets something to eat and then when she's finished eating and reading her mail, watches a little TV and goes to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At what time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She'll be going to sleep by eight or nine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about a social life?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't have a social life. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about men?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She cut them off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to tell me about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What the men?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, why no men?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She feels like, I guess, 'cause nobody to help her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Help her do what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Take care of her bills or help her maintain what she's got.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, she have a lot of money, why does she need to - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She feels like no man can equal up to what she's got.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, she doesn't want to listen to a man.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  She won't even bother.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She even tries to boss her relationships?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  Yep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What does she do for sex?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For how long?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since two thousand five, or two thousand four - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why is that?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One of them.  It was like after she found she had diabetes, everything just went downhill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Gave up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she told her boyfriend she didn't want to be bothered with him no more because he didn't want to help pay for trips and stuff that they was taking and he said he was on a fixed income so that's what I gathered from it.  She feels like a man can't help her with nothing because he worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] too, so he almost amounted to a man because had the amount of money she had, but he still had problems with checks and women.  So - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He was a ladies' man?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she couldn't put up with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was your mother ever strong in that area?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She only had, I think, three men in her whole life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she's, well where did you get all your energy, being so frisky from?  It didn't come from her did it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me about your daddy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, he was on crack.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your daddy was a street man.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  So - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me about him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He passed away - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, I meant before he died.  Tell me about him. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, he was, I mean, I don't know too much about him.  I was young.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You certainly heard things though.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've heard things about him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She just said he wasn't no good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What would he do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stay out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He'd be gone all night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  I don't know what he was doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did she say he was doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She would never tell me because they split up in like nineteen ninety one when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were a kid, you didn't get a chance to be around him much.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  I was like a baby when he was around.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Tell me about his pictures, things like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He looked just like me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He had a lot of women.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I got a sister.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I found out about her when I was [AGE].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was [AGE] or something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me about his side of the family.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They all, what do you mean?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just tell me about them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My aunt, she's a [DEIDENTIFIED] and my other aunt, she's a - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, I'm taking about your daddy's? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I'm telling you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My daddy's sister, [NAME OTHER], she's a [DEIDENTIFIED] and her husband is a [DEIDENTIFIED], a retired [DEIDENTIFIED] from the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my aunt, [NAME OTHER] - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She a dyslexic.  And fibromyalgia - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And different stuff that she keeps telling me that I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she has a lot of problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she gets depressed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Real depressed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, but her sister doesn't?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sure about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Who, my other aunt?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your other aunt.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She works and - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Works.  Both of my other aunts work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.  Who else is on that side of the family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He only had three children.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And he was the only boy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he was kind of spoiled too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was he a good dancer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't know much about him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've never been curious about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You never want to find out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just like, when my daddy died, my daddy's side of the family died with him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It feels like to me that when my daddy died, my daddy's sisters, our relationship died with him because they don't even contact me or see how I'm doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They turned their back on you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, more or less.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't talked to them.  I haven't the slightest idea.  I think they have their own family problems or their own family lives.  Even when I was out on my own, I only talked to my aunt [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The one he has a lot of problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My aunt [NAME OTHER], my aunt [NAME OTHER] and my aunt [NAME OTHER] it's like they don't even want to be bothered with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe because of something your mother did?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so, something she told them or something she said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How does she get along with them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, you know how it is, I don't know if you know how it is when you got sister in laws and your wife, she's another way and your wife calls and tells your sister this and she's looking at you like this and then you tell her something, then she's looking at them like okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's how it is, going back and forth, tug of war.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They can't, they, we were a way with one person and then they'd be this way with the other person.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's confusing to me because it's like they have gotten something up, they're telling them some misunderstanding.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of how we are or something.  Just because I'm older, it doesn't mean I don't need my family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Family is important.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, how's the medicine been working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been working all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to tell me about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which one, Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Lamictal, I take that, I think in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you having any problems with it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, what about your other medicine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just the Geodon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Geodon won't let me get up and do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It slows you down too much?  You don't look slowed down to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean compared to what you normally are.  You don't feel good being like this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just like, I don't want to be bothered with people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, but it keeps you out of trouble.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, things that I used to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Go places.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Go where?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Out at the clubs or visit with friends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's what I mean, but see you would go out and you would dance all night, I mean every song.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't think that's too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what about all the men?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The men was a problem, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I mean now it seems under control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have no friends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When's the last time you've been with somebody physically?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> November.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Boy, that's a long time for you, I mean you enjoyed that.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I don't miss the sex part, I just miss having somebody to talk to.  I can't talk to my mother, I can't talk to my son, I can't talk to my aunties.  I have to go up the street and talk to my neighbors, which have more problems than I have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You seem so calm and relaxed.  What are people saying about you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I'm crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nah, really what people are saying?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what they're saying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's their impression of what you're doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, because they're not used to me not having it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not having what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A car, a job, a house, eating, sleeping.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you still look real good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know that because if I didn't care about myself I wouldn't, I guess I wouldn't look good and I care about my appearance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I don't mean just that.  I'm talking about, I mean you're so relaxed and comfortable and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you're able just to sit and be patient and wait, normally you would wait two or three minutes and be gone.  You don't really like being like this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's different, though, isn't it? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just feels strange.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, a little different.  Yeah, I know there's some stress there between you and your mother, but, what does she say about what you're doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't comment on nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she's impressed, though, isn't she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  She doesn't - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] house.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No because I don't say nothing, I walk off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It doesn't bother you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Turn the key in the door and walk off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what I'm saying, it doesn't bother you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't let her see me cry.  I go and cry to myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You cry, why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I can't understand why.  I can't eat or cook in her house without her saying something about, oh there's a new mark on my stove, I don't know what you all is marking up my stove with.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It makes sense with what you just say about your mother,</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I understand that, but I'm just saying simple things, that's just saying don't use my stove.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean she treats everybody like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know that, but I just say, I need to cook me something to eat, I can't cook nothing to eat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She treats everybody like that, why do you feel like she's picking on you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because she knows that's a part of life, to eat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She treats everybody like that.  Can you imagine what it's like to working under her?  What do people say that work under her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't talked with anybody lately about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the past, what did they say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what is wrong with your mama.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did they say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did they say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Basically they won't say what they think about my mother to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They won't tell you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They cut it short.  It's just like your mama, ugh, she sent me home the other day and I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So they can't tell you what it is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not the only one she does, she does everybody like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  I have, I just, it just makes me stressed out to even deal with it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even trying to sit and, that's why I cry because it's so petty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Petty about using something that you can't take with you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But that's just her, though. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not that she really means it.  It's just her.  Okay, so you aren't sleeping real good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much weight have you lost?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm around 180.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you're holding steady.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Holding steady.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ain't been eating so I don't know - </p>

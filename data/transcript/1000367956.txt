<p>PATIENT:  (In background is an intermittently sounding thump, as of amplified heartbeat.  4-minute silence) I was thinking of 2 things when I, well, 1 thing and then the other when I first came in here.  And then I began to think it was strange that I hadn't thought of one of them yesterday.  Because the incident happened yesterday.  And, I don't know, I went through a series of thoughts.  But it just seems as if really I'm just trying to think of a way not to talk about either of these 2 things.  And yet somehow it makes me feel ridiculous to think that either of them bothered me.  (Sniffle) And the first one was, uhm, about yesterday when the elevator was stuck and you came out.  And before you came out, I had felt very reluctant to go get you.  And I had just started to do something when the other person joined me and the man that she had been with had said he'd let us out.  But I still felt guilty that I had felt reluctant to go to see you.  And so when you came out I just assumed you were annoyed at me for not coming.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And you didn't want to tell me that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  Well, I just felt, first of all, that it was ridiculous to even — almost as if I'm building it up into something.  I mean, if I, I think of it from another way I tell myself I'm ridiculous because why would you be annoyed.  But I assumed it because I knew I felt guilty that I hadn't gone to get you.  I think I would have preferred just to walk down the stairs or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And when you, you think about having felt reluctant to come, you eh, think of what went through your mind, or what comes to your mind when you feel, when you felt that reluctance?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think part of it was, uhm, having to come get you after the set time's over and so the whole routine or pattern in which we relate is not there.  And I wouldn't know what to do with myself.  And then also having to come to a door that I've never come to in that way and where would you be.  Sort of, coming into a forbidden area or something like that.  I think, last night if you had just been around the corner where, but in plain sight and I just went around the corner, I would have come.  But the fact that I'd have to come through this door and that I don't know where you are and what I should do to call you just made me feel I'd rather do anything but have to go through that. (Pause)</p>

<p>And just, it made me think just generally, if I'm going to see somebody about something, it might be somebody I've never seen before, and I have to go through a door that doesn't indicate whether or not you knock and enter or just go in and what kind of a room are you if you go in, it's always, I always have to just make myself go in.  I seem to find it very hard to do that.  (Pause) And then I went from thinking about this feeling that I had last night to a feeling I'd had earl—, early in the morning when I met 2 teachers on the way to school.  And they're both girls that live with each other and they're both very fashionable.  And, ah, they put a great deal of value on being very well dressed and saying the right thing and so forth.  And even though I like both of them, I think I always feel gauche in their company and awkward.  And I always feel that they look at me that way.  And this for some reason makes me want all the more to have them like me or approve of me.  And it, I just had the feeling again, which I might have imagined, but that if I didn't m—, go out of my way to wait for them when they were walking or talk to them, that they would just as soon have ignored my presence or not walked with me.  And I, I just — I mean I might be right, they might just not like my company but I just can't tell whether or not I'm making this up.  And it, again, makes me feel sort of ridiculous.  And also, just to have that matter to me really ma—, bothers me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you see in common between these 2 feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, basically feeling a certain kind of rejection on the part of whoever was involved and feeling very awkward and uncertain about myself.  (Pause) Because this, in that other occasion the same feeling of not knowing what to do with myself came up too since there were 3 of us walking and there'd just been snow, it wasn't really comfortable walking 3 across.  And then after a while a 4th person joined us so you couldn't walk 3 across then at all.  And I'm inclined to walk fast and again I immediately thought, well they are walking slower just so they won't be with me.  But it made me feel extremely awkward to keep sort of slowing down and waiting for them.  And if I walked ahead they didn't walk with me and, again, that made me feel awkward so I didn't know what to do with myself there, either.  (Pause) And then eventually one of the teachers joined me.  And my immediate assumption was that she was just being polite and that she didn't really want to. (Pause)</p>

<p>There's something about these things, though, that I guess I really just feel guilty thinking them.  Because I keep thinking to myself, well, they're so petty.  But yet when they happen, they're so strong and then I'll just put it out of my mind.  But if it comes back to my mind, the feeling I have then still is there strong enough so however petty they may really be, they aren't petty to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well (clears throat) supposing you — eh, in, in the situation here yesterday when you were out and, and, eh, didn't want to come in and find me or call me and you felt reluctant, you said that you had the idea that, eh, if I were around the corner you could come but it was coming through this closed door.  And you didn't know what I would be doing or where you could find me.  Does that bring anything else to mind that you've already told me about?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when you ask that, it makes me think of my father and his bedroom door being closed.  But I hadn't until then.  (Said very quietly; pause) I suppose that it's just — I mean, the times I can recall knocking on my parents' door and going in, were times when I was old enough so I knew what my father's reaction would be and I almost liked teasing him a little because of it.  Or at least, I knew he might start screaming and I could handle it and I knew what to do with myself.  But the feeling I had about coming in to you was just getting way into the room and then just — or into th-, whatever, wherever I'd be when I'd be looking for you, down the corridor or anything, and sort of being in the middle and then not knowing where to go and not turning back, not knowing how to get back and just being completely defenseless.  And I suppose that, if my father did have that same reaction to us when we were really small, then being so small I might have felt the same way when I went into their room.  But I can't recall that feeling.  I'm just guessing now, and guessing from what I have been told is true of very young children.  I would imagine it's the same feeling.  The other thing that came to my mind, just from when I was describing it and then when you were redescribing it, was intercourse.  Exce—, I don't know why.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I suppose partly why it made me think of intercourse is the fact that in both cases, coming in to find you — or, the, all the cases or going into my parents' room or how I feel when MSCZ wants intercourse too is of feeling that I'll be defenseless.  And I don't trust the situation in any of those cases enough to want to be defenseless.  Because the image that keeps coming to my mind (clears throat) but it seems almost like it's my imagination making it up, is of just being in a big empty room and how I must have felt if my father did yell at me and how I just want to turn somewhere and hide and there would be no place because I'd be in the middle.  (Pause) And I couldn't trust him not to do that.  That's 1 thing I do know is true, that throughout our relationship I never could trust that he would think of my feelings first and not — or think, perhaps, just of both of our feelings together but in any case, think sometimes what it did to another person to be yelling at them the way he would or to say the things he'd say.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>And I suppose I also thought of him as being even more powerful because here was my mother grown up so therefore I assumed she could fight back and she, and yet she wasn't.  (Clears throat) So I suppose that made me even, feel even weaker or more defenseless in his presence than I might have otherwise.  (Pause) I think my initial reaction with men generally is to feel a little bit stupid and inf—, well, not just a little bit but in—, stupid and inferior and sort of, they're going to see what I am and I'm going to be defenseless to do anything about their ridiculing me or handling it in any way they want.  And then if a person, and if a man doesn't sort of well, attack me, is the word I think — it's not quite right but I suppose it is right — in any form then I feel sort of grateful to him almost and I try to form a relationship almost of a father and a daughter.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It still just seems hard to believe that I could have felt so strongly about going into my parents' room that would make me feel the way I did last night.  And the only thing that I can recall is how very timid I felt, and it was after I was 6, I don't know how old but after we'd moved, and just knocking on their door at night, how timid I'd feel.  (Pause) And there was something, too, I think, though I can't get hold of it, about some of the times just having the door stay closed and having to talk through a closed door.  (Pause) I was going to say, it seemed sort of, well, not undignified but sort of humiliating or something.  But it also, when I said it, made me think that it was, in a way, symbolic of how our whole relationship was.  (Pause) And I seem to recall feeling angry sometimes too at having to feel humiliated and left out and scared at even knocking.  But I don't know whether I'm just making that part up.  I don't, I can't really recall it so much.  But it almost would be the same kind of anger as made me think of the anger I felt toward my mother the time I was trying to get her to show some sort of interest and the fight I'd had with FYC when FYC hit me in the stomach and then I in turn hit my mother.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>My mind immediately jumped to thinking how the day went at school today and then just lots of little things about school, almost as if it was a much pleasanter (sic) thing to think about.</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) Than having felt angry with your mother and excluded by her.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think I was thinking right before, right after I said that about my mother, that I was just won—, wondering if this anger — well, I suppose in part it was being so frustrated in my relationship with them and feeling it wasn't right.  But sometimes I think, might have been if I, at least fighting with some kind of emotion.  And the thought occurred to me, I wonder how much either of my parents can really feel — I suppose any person can feel — emotion if they let themself (sic) but except in a very limited way I, almost seems like my father can't, even if he were able to let himself, just having no interest in it.  And I've, I wonder more about my mother and how much her feelings are, I guess, closer to the surface and she's just not letting them express themselves.  And it's somehow more upsetting to think of her in this sort of ambiguous state.  (Pause) And somehow it almost makes her seem colder as a result, too.  (Pause) Or else, it's just simply that long ago I reached a certain point where I assumed my father was certain things and I knew he'd react in certain ways.  And I accepted my relationship to him in certain ways, no matter if I liked it or not.  But with my mother I just have a range of conflicting emotions.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

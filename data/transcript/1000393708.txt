<p>PATIENT:  (8-minute silence) I've been thinking about something that happened last night.  And I think 1 of the things that I've been trying to do before I said anything was to see how I could avoid mentioning the things that I'm afraid will make me feel very foolish.  But then, just in thinking about my reactions to what happened, it w—, it's almost as if you don't talk about the whole thing, there'd be no point in even talking about it at all.  So I think then what I was doing was trying to think how could I phrase it so I wouldn't feel so foolish.  (Pause) And then I finally decided I'm going to feel foolish but somehow I have to talk myself into not caring that I'm going to feel it or that, just it doesn't really matter.  (Pause) And of course, all this is, too, a good stall to saying what (laughs) really was on my mind.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because last night, when I got home, I was still being bothered by the things I'd been talking about yesterday and so when I saw MSCZ, I immediately wanted to have sympathy from him.  And his response was to want to have intercourse with me eventually.  And, and I just made up my mind, I'm not sure exactly why I'd made up my mind except that I was too busy feeling sort of sorry for myself so I, I didn't want to give anything at that point.  But anyway I made up my mind I wasn't going to have any intercourse that night.  And MSCZ kept insisting and kept insisting and the whole time, even times when I almost, in a way, could admit to myself that I'd really like to turn to him and, and at least be affectionate to him, the fact that I had made up my mind I wasn't going to, kept me from doing anything.  Even when I felt foolish in, in acting the way I was, I still, it's almost like I'd gone out on a limb and I had to just maintain my position.  And so, finally, MSCZ has been threatening sometimes lately that if I am in this state he's just not going to let me sleep in the same bed with him.  And so last night he did this, he sort of pushed me out.  And I sort of, I think I was just thinking now that I, there was, I almost enjoyed being pushed out, being treated roughly.  It's almost as if sometimes what I'm trying to do is to make him hit me or not ask me to be submissive, but make me be submissive.  And the image just came to my mind — I've never compared this tendency I have with MSCZ to my father.  But the image did just come to my mind that my father's only way, as far as I recall him throughout my childhood, was to physically hit us when he was angry at us or wanted us to do something and we weren't obeying.  And I know, then I'd keep going until he did hit me because then I knew that was it, that was the limit.  And the limits weren't really clear, I guess, to my mind until I was hit.  And somehow that's what was happening last night.  Because then after that, out of pride I couldn't sort of go and make up to MSCZ or apologize, but in the morning I felt, I just felt very affectionate toward him.  And I couldn't even sort of keep up face and pretend to be angry or still annoyed or anything about what had happened.  And it's probably that same reaction, too, that after I've made somebody angry, then I can be nice to them, whereas I couldn't before.  But while it was happening, there was this very strong feeling of, I'm going to get my way and then when finally I slept somewhere else, I, even though he might have felt, "Well, I've thrown her out of bed and so I won."  I felt, in turn, that at least we hadn't had intercourse so I'd gotten my way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And in the past, be—, if MSCZ and I have been having particular problems of getting along, then having a fight that really became sort of violent, not that any, either of us was hurt, but just a physical kind of a fight, rather than just sort of talking to each other, saying hateful things, it's only after those types that we could then really sort of reach out to each other.  And that used to bother me because it just seems so uncivilized.  But I guess in another way they were much more honest about, at least it was expressing the feelings we had.  (Pause) At least, for me it was because so often, when the fighting is just, well, talking hardly more than in a normal way but saying hateful things, somehow I feel, anyway, it's under a great deal of control and I'm hiding things.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about this reaction I had to the fighting being uncivilized.  And I started thinking too about the fact that sometimes what has bothered me about sexual relationship is, I don't know, I'm just, it, I don't know if I feel as if all I am is an animal but somehow there is a fear there that it's just sort of an animal thing and there's nothing human in it.  And it all just seems to add up to, I think of being, well, fulfilling being a human being and civilized just means having terrific self-control and showing absolutely no emotion, I don't really connect it to being thoughtful or generous or things like that.  (11-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny the different ways I can look at how I felt about last night.  Because before, when I was thinking, before I came in, when I was thinking about it, I almost felt as if I had just disassociated myself from it.  I hardly was feeling any feelings and then while I was in, while I was talking a little while ago, I seemed to feel sort of triumphant and glad.  And then I began the, I was quiet because I'd been thinking, I started thinking about how I just felt sort of awful and drained all day.  And I was wondering what relationship that had to what happened last night.  And then I just sort of came to a stop in being able to think about it.  And I thought of a comment that my supervisor had made to me when she saw me early this morning.  Just, she was referring to the conference yesterday, sort of, "I hope you slept well last night."  But I, I took it first as, does the horrible night I had or that I feel horrible now show so much on my face.  And, ah, and then instead of continuing to think about last night, I just started thinking about, again, little things that happened at school.  And I —</p>

<p>ANALYST: What you don't mention is what you first mentioned, which was that you, ah, wanted to avoid feeling foolish.  But you didn't say what you would have felt foolish about or what you were afraid you would feel foolish about, which aspect of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I did think of that one point.  I think I thought of that, not exactly that way but in terms of when I felt so determined to keep on doing what I was doing.  I'd made up my mind not to have intercourse so I wasn't going to.  And I just wouldn't respond to MSCZ at all.  I think I was feeling foolish then some of the times because it just seemed so ridiculous, the way I was acting.  And I don't know, just the whole thing now seems, in one way, to be a ridiculous thing to have happened but in another way it doesn't.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you were afraid I would feel it was foolish, that is, that you would sound foolish to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, and, and this is another level, I was just thinking of this, that somehow I guess I'm thinking people just don't do this kind of thing.  (Pause) So if in my married life things happen that I think aren't normal things to have happen, I don't want anybody to know about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Anybody?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, beyond MSCZ and me.  Because we have to know about it.  (Pause) I suppose it's even more, well, it was more direct in that the only person who even might know about it would be you because I would say it here.  So then it would be, I didn't want you to know about it.  But I think it's a, it's that feeling is just a reaction to having anybody outside of MSCZ or me hearing about it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: If I understand you, you must have felt, when you said you had a certain feeling of triumph and this morning you didn't feel angry with MSCZ at all and then you described, in one sense, how you, you really controlled the situation quite thoroughly, then, last night because it went in accordance with your wishes and your plans, so to speak.  You were really in control.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, in one way.  But I had wanted just to say to MSCZ, "No, we're not going to have intercourse."  And sort of, "Look how upset I'm feeling"  that type of thing.  Or, "I'm tired and look how late it is."  And to have him just leave me alone, which he didn't do.  Because he kept insisting that I really did want to.  And so then I had to just keep my point and I, and I felt very angry at him then.  Because he wasn't doing what I wanted.  So in that sense, I didn't control it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>That makes me think again, well, I thought first, when I thought of getting angry because I didn't get my way, or at least partially I didn't get my way, of the fa—, of when my father used to call me a bitch and say things such as, "You're always trying to get your way."  And that type of thing.  And I never, at that time, understood what he meant because I didn't feel that I got my way very much at all.  And I didn't feel I was imposing my way on other people that much.  But somehow it must have been the same thing as this, that when I did finally commit myself, I wouldn't consider a compromise or any other action and I would just be horrible if I didn't get it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When was this, during your teens or earlier?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I think he, he had that impression of me earlier but I don't think he actually used the word, bitch, until I was in my teens.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And I'm not sure how I reacted when he did say that to me.  Except that I don't know how often he said it but he might not have said it very often but it made a very strong impression on me.  And in a way I think I'm very angry at him for having said such a thing to me.  (Pause) And at the times, besides being angry, I think I was hurt and bewildered too because I didn't understand what he meant.  And it just seemed like sort of a, a dreadful word for a father to be using to his daughter.  (Pause) And I think I was resentful, too, that despite the fact I didn't understand what he meant, I assumed that he was right, in a way.  And so I was resentful that he had lost control and all he could do was call me names, he wasn't helping me to see what he had meant.  He was just reacting to me with anger when I reacted to him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, it seems like a lot of the times when, I don't know, I just began thinking, then, that it was not giving me the guidance that a parent should give a child and that it made me think of something else, that I used to, just in, well, I used to just ask him lots of questions that came up to my mind when I was in my teens too, about how you behave with, how a girl should behave with a boy.  Because this frightened me terribly and, and I just didn't feel at all able to handle a boy-girl relationship, even in the classroom just talking to a boy sitting near me.  And somehow he never was able to answer any of my questions at all.  Which, and I suppose it's unfair to judge him on that because if he could have answered them, I probably wouldn't have had to ask them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then this gets me back to thinking of however much, how I acted to MSCZ last night has to do with something in my relationship with my father, even when I was aware that I had, I was just trying to get my own way and I was thinking to myself, well, what, what am I going to lose if I sort of submit, submit to my feelings, submitting to MSCZ's.  And I don't know, I couldn't even think about it.  All I could think of was I have to get my own way in this.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Perhaps particularly after feeling powerless with the other man yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I hadn't thought of that but it makes me think of, often after I've either been in a mood for a long time of sort of feeling I can't do things or else, if some incidents happened and I've decided I'm going to just sort of pull myself together, ag—, I do react in a similar way, where I'll just be sort of cold and trying to be efficient and sort of indicating to MSCZ that I want him to just keep out of my way, leave me alone.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

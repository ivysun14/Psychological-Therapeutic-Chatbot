<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client Number 1923-018. This is Session Number 6, February 16, 1971. </p>

<p>(background talking and bumping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's a bit brisk, but it's not - it's nothing really bad. I'm just getting so tired of this cold weather. It's not the cold weather that I don't like; it's just being cold. [1:06].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My roommate moved out Sunday. Great plans that what I was going to do Sunday during the day. (sounds of paper shuffling and microphone swooping) Oh, I just didn't do anything. It was horrible. I just sat in my room (inaudible at 1:30). </p>

<p>I felt kind of bad 'cause she moved out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was sort of empty, and  - </p>

<p>(cross talking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 'Cause most of the living room furniture - there's, there's, like, there's three other [piles of] (ph) property in this apartment that stays there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And will stay there, hopefully; I don't want it. And then there's my furniture. My furniture makes up about half the living room. And her furniture took up all the dining room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so it was literally -</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dining room was empty. The living room's full. And the bedroom's empty. So - I felt kind of bad. I enjoyed having her as a roommate. And I still don't - the lady that was supposed to have moved in with me, she hasn't - I haven't even heard from her yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nobody has. I've just been hibernating. I thought that she was the one that responded (inaudible and crosstalking). [0:02:34.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was sure she'd be back to work yesterday, but she wasn't. I know I can't do anything, and I really don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I mean, I had nothing that's bothering me particularly except the same thing. It's always bothering me. It's not (loosening) (ph) yet. [3:09] </p>

<p>I was talking to Chrissie about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About being tense -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and not being able to loosen up. Not being able to just relax and enjoy myself, you know, or to let myself go. And Chrissie says, "Well see, you worry about it too much. You ought to quit worrying about it and do it." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great advice. I already know that. But my problem is how to go about loosening up. I've got - I've made conscious attempts at it. But I don't think you have to push yourself hard towards it. It's only because of - of release, and I don't know how to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know  - . That's the reason, you know, basically, I'm coming to see you. It's because - I just don't know how to - I don't know, let go? It feels that I should - I guess that I should do it just a little bit at a time or something like that, but  - . I realize that that's my problem; and I'm, like, too uptight about the whole thing. But I don't know how to just forget it; you know, just relax and forget it, sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've thought about it, alright. I've made conscious attempts at it. But as I think I told you once before, I just - I don't - I've, I've had no success at conscious attempts because they just seem so futile as I'm doing them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause I realize I'm not, I'm not really relaxing and just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(cross talking @4:40)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just playacting, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just playacting to everybody else, and I'm not - which just doesn't do any good. And probably not being a very good actress, either, at the same time. And I don't know how to relax.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like something that always tends - you just have to release. Somehow, it has to come out without your doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you can't make it. It's not, it's not something you have to force at. It's something you have to let out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something you work harder at to bring it out. It's something you just relax and let out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As if there was something you could [learn to] (ph) stop doing to permit it to happen. [0:05:31.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't know why I can't relax. I don't know - I'm like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Relax" may not be exactly the right word. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But, ah - hm.</p>

<p>(sound of door closing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, just forget about it. Quit worrying about it. Forget about it. Just let, you know, just like let my feelings go or something. Just let - let myself really get into something deeply  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of just on the surface. I don't know how. And I don't know how to go about starting to relax [at home] (ph). [0:06:07.5] Do yogi exercises or something. I don't know. I really don't - I don't know how to go about start to relax. I don't know what to do about it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, not really.</p>

<p>(Long pause, 42 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tried getting drunk last year. I have all my hang-ups when I'm drunk, just when I'm sober. </p>

<p>I need to - </p>

<p>(pause, 8 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 7:25) picture what it's like to be liked, of flowing, of things just come over one after the other, and your not sort of tensing on them and looking at what's happening to you. And I guess you're letting strong feelings all the way into - you said something about getting deeper instead of on the surface. Is that right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I want to be able to just into something instead of just  - . Well this is, you know, I mean - well, that is, I'm being influenced over my roommate. But like she says, "If you want to have strong feelings, if you feel like you want to scream, go ahead and scream."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...If you feel like you want to cry, go ahead and cry."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...If you want to be really happy, be really happy." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't just stay on this even keel. But I guess I really sort of restrict my emotions terribly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To one, you know, down the middle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm sure I do it myself, but I don't know how I do it myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do know that, like, if I think I'm going to cry - (sound of paper moving around) I used to, anyway - I would, well  - . All my life, if I've ever thought I was going to cry, most of the time I went ahead and cried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that I never got to the point when I would cry very often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, like I, I  - . It's not like when I thought, "Oh, I'm going to cry, I can't just stop this," you know. Unless I was in a situation where it would be stupid to cry, you know. A social situation or something. Then I have felt tears start to come up, and I have just held my breath until it went away, or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I didn't - I never, like it goes deeper. I either - I'm not subject to the emotions as (fully)] (ph) [9:19]. Like, I can have these great highs and lows. There's something - I don't know, physiological - that's not physiological - but something, you know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I just cannot do it. Because I never have. When I was a little kid, even. My mother says that I was not subject to the highs and lows. Now whether this is something that I have built into myself for some reason long ago and is so - is so instinctual that, you know, it's before I ever realized that I had stopped getting real highs and lows or anything else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 9:59)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't - I've never been able to get really excited, really. It's not that I've never been able to get really excited about anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, on the other side.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that I have not been able to get really excited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more like - I can't find anything that excites me, you know. If I can find something that excites me, I can get excited about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there are very few things really that excite me. I just can't get excited. My mother used to - used to worry. Oh, like I said, on the other side, too. Like these things that teenage girls go through, the screaming and jumping around, fainting one minute and then crying their eyes out the next, you know. But I never did that. But, you know, I just don't - I just - nothing really brings out any - just very seldom do I really get excited about anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [11:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoy things. But I just - I just - I can't build up the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's not that you don't have the capacity or enthusiasm. It's just the things you run into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the things that other people get really excited about, I didn't, you know. I just - I'll try to show some enthusiasm for -. Because, you know, if it's something that I enjoy, I'll try to (show) (ph) enthusiasm, you know, just outwardly. [0:11:32.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I won't hurt anybody else's feelings. So they won't think that I'm not enjoying it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be just kind of sit there, enjoy, without really showing any enthusiasm. Sometimes people think you didn't enjoy yourself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>(cross talking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't - I just can't - I don't know, it's not that I wouldn't like, enjoy the things that other people enjoy. It's just, I can't work up the outward enthusiasm for it. I just can't. And I - I just don't have the desire to go bouncing around the house with a stupid grin on my face, jumping up and down [wee hee] (ph), you know. I mean, nothing's brings - oh, I think once or twice in my entire life have I ever been that excited about something that I was just floating around, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I enjoyed that feeling of excitement.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've always wished that I could get excited about more things. But they just - you know, like I say, so that's the reason I've tried to force myself to act excited about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought maybe I'd catch on to my own enthusiasm or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 'Cause you know it's a really good feeling, and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You know, it really would be nice to have. And it relaxes me. When you get really excited about something, you relax. Unless you're - like, you're really excited about a date or something, you won't get super relaxed. But I mean, you know, it kind of - it releases. It's a release.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like, I suppose crying is a release.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I never - even though I'll go ahead and cry - I never really cry cry, you know, like just cry my heart out. I've never done that, either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's the kind of sobbing and sobbing thing where you've lost all control [or something] (ph) [0:13:12.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. I - where that helps, too, I mean if you really let go. You really let go of it anyway, and it's a release, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't do that, either I - except I think when I'm [wrecking] (ph) my life. [0:13:25.0] (sound of paper moving) And so this is what I want to be able to do, just let myself go. And like I said, when you try to just (banging sound at 13:33) outwardly show enthusiasm, just [gaily] (ph) get gay and happy and everything, that doesn't happen because I feel stupid. My enthusiasm is real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might look stupid, but it's not. I mean, some girl might do something with enthusiasm and be silly. But that's - that's one thing. And that's understandable, you know. But if you're just being stupid, or trying just, you know, trying to show all this outward enthusiasm and you're not really, I have a feeling that everybody in the world can see right through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you really look stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you look phony.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I - I don't know - I never know whether I'm doing a good job of it or not, because I usually - every once in awhile I decide to just, you know, try to catch on - try to really feel it, you know. But what I'm doing is just acting. I'm not really feeling enthusiasm. And I'm not a very good actress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 14:34)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not only do you not really feel it, but you don't even do a good job of pretending.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just  - . Sometimes, like pretending is the answer, anyway. And because  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if I was the world's best actress and had everybody in the world fooled, it's not helping me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you know, I don't need to have everybody - I don't need to help (banging sound) everybody else. I mean, you know. Except, you know, to try to show some enthusiasm (inaudible at 15:03). But I want to just be able to just enjoy things, you know. And if I just - I'm just sitting here, you know, and I had the feeling I had to really try to enjoy something, you know. And really pushed myself to it. And I can't - that's what I was just saying; it doesn't work. But if I just sit there and try to, like, relax and enjoy something, I can't do it. I find myself starting to playact again, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not really feeling it. Or I'm pressing myself to feel something, you know. And I don't really feel it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't really know how to go about to stop trying to (let) (ph) - just to let, you know, just to let myself go. [0:15:54.9] Because if I just let myself go and do what I feel, what I feel is usually what I'm doing in the first place (sound of banging), which is an even keel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what was just going through my head, that - like, if you - if you do stop trying, you don't end up with highs and lows (inaudible)  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Interrupting) I end up right where I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because most of the time when I'm not trying, that's where I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not worrying about anything, you know, I'm not trying to anything. That's where I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's very frustrating. Because, like I say, a couple of times whenever I've ever gotten really excited about anything, I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like one time - what was it? One time I had a date with this guy. And it - for some reason, I only went out with the guy a couple of times, and he was just like a nice guy. And I wasn't in love with him or infatuated or anything. But he was a nice guy, and (sound of banging) he was a lot of fun to be with. And we were going someplace. We were going out to dinner and to a show. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was really excited about that. I mean, the whole concept of the evening, you know - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was very excited about. And I was - this is when I was in college, and I was home, you know, and I was bouncing around the house. And my mother thought, "She's finally doing it. She's finally have her highs and lows . 'Cause this is about - this is about my mom when I was a kid. We were talking about this. I've talked to her about it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But part of what I want - what I think would solve most of my problems is if  - . One of our problems is like we just got (inaudible at 17:38) anything. And I've got to do something about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just thinking about the thing that (bothers) (ph) me the most - like, it sounds like your mother thinks you ought to have, and your roommate thinks you ought to have (room) (ph), and you know that it's nice to feel excited. But I don't hear you saying things like, "I'm really missing out on something important." Do you see what I'm saying? [0:18:23.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're wondering if it's somebody else's idea or my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, to an extent. Like, I mean there may be a lot more of your own idea than you've been saying. But, like, so far, your own part that I've heard is just, "Eehh, it's nice to feel excited."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I say, the few times that I've ever been excited I really enjoyed it. It was release (sound of banging). It was a release that - that felt good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I personally think that I could, you know, be - I don't want to turn into a - someone who's always high or low and nowhere in between and always, you know, flitting off some cliff or other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just would like to be able to relax more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is this relaxing where it is? I don't know. Like I say, when I relax, when I'm perfectly calm and relaxed in myself -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have no highs or lows - well, I will have highs and lows, but I mean nothing - I'm just, I'm not that reactive to other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's  - </p>

<p>(cross talking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I would like to be able to have this release more often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also, it all comes to, like, relating to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause I have always felt that I just don't relate to other people, this again being by myself, a loner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [20:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I was - there's no magic key, I suppose, at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I could completely turn into everything. I could - I could just wave my (rights) (ph) magic wand and, and tap myself on the head, and be exactly what I think I ought to be. And it might not change things a bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With - with my interactions with other people. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seems like the highs and lows might.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just going through a bunch of highs and lows is not going to get you close to other people. But, being able to feel more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's - or to be able to relate to other people. I mean, would other people have the idea that I do have highs and lows, that I'm always - because - when I'm just on an even keel, I'm not low.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can be enjoying myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But - I relate to other people as being depressed and low. I mean, like, I've had, you know -I'll be sitting there. I'll be sitting there thinking and, and basically maybe just sitting there listening to their music and - and just like totally not thinking about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And really enjoying myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not saying there was this stupid grin on my face or anything, you know. I'm just sitting there. And if I'm not smiling, evidently it - excuse me - if I'm not smiling, evidently it looks like I'm frowning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so people walk up to me, "What's the matter?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Are you upset about something?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. But you feel like you're doing </p>

<p>(crosstalking at 21:34)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or something. I was sitting there, no. My mother. You know, I used  - . When I drive the car, I enjoy driving the car. But I don't sit there, "M mmm," with this stupid grin on my face while I drive the car. And you know, I yell at people when they do stupid things, they'll almost hit me or something like that, you know. But I don't - you know - I'm usually, when I'm driving I'm usually not feeling anything. unless I'm having, you know, except maybe  - . Well usually I'm just enjoying. But I'm not really feeling anything, you know. I'm not feeling any, like, great exhilaration from it, but I'm enjoying it. This is the way I enjoy things. And my mom (inaudible at 22:15) I've been driving so much. She, she looks better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's (inaudible at 22:17) better. She says, "What are you upset about?" and [I'm not upset about anything] (ph) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [And she says,] (ph) "Yeah, but your face looks all sad and everything", you know. And a couple of (inaudible at 22:27) at different times in my life, when I was not feeling sad, was just kind of feeling nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. They get sort of concerned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They say, "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and anxious about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so by not (crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something needs to be fixed in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. No, it's not like that. It's just, like, when I'm not smiling, I look sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe we'll see if we [inquire and (sound of banging) at 22:51] (ph) why I was sad, if I didn't feel good, if I was upset about something, was I just tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when none of these have been the case. I've been perfectly fine. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was very sensitive about this. I used to almost yell at my mom. I'd say, "What do you want me to do, drive down the road with a big smile on my face (counselor chuckles) so you know I'm not upset?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know that, life being -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm touchy about it, you know. Because, I'm really wasn't upset about anything. As a matter of fact, my mind was almost a complete blank, you know. I was just driving, watching the road and the other cars and everything. I don't think about a lot of other stuff while I'm driving. I can't. I just kind of drive. And so - if I had more - if I had - my idea of having ups and downs, I'd be - is being more susceptible. No, that's not the right word. You know, if I had more (inaudible at 24:02) I - maybe I could show more outward feelings. My father is talking about people who bubble. And I don't, like - I don't bubble. </p>

<p>(loud background noise, like an airport)</p>

<p>But this thing, you know - if I felt more, you know, if I really got any kind of a really [sic] exhilaration (inaudible at 24:22). I don't know, I just maybe would relate better to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I didn't, like, take everything so calmly and - I don't know. Like I say, I don't act like - I'm not saying this is a key. But I [have the feeling] (ph) it may be, you know, if I could relax more or could just forget about myself, or could enjoy myself. I don't enjoy myself that much. I don't enjoy other things [so much] (ph at 24:59). I really - I enjoy skiing, first of all, you know. And I'm enjoying it recently. And I really enjoy being out all day. I really get upset at skiing if I do something stupid. I really get upset with myself. </p>

<p>'Cause I always get upset with myself if I do something stupid, you know. That's the only one real strong emotion I have, is that I really get mad at myself if I do stupid things. And I [don't know] (ph) if it's striving to be perfect, or something. I'm not sure. But - (pause). I think maybe the reason - OK, two of the reasons I would like to (inaudible at 25:49) experience - I don't know if it's - it's not so much as relaxing. I think it would be - having more feelings or something like that, which is something you're just born with one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, there's not much you can do to change it. But - except do things that you really enjoy. And then your feelings would come out. But - I was going to say something (inaudible at 26:21). </p>

<p>(long pause, 15 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you starting to say that maybe you can't change it in yourself? (inaudible)</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the way it is? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think I can help it a little bit. But, I mean that I'm going to be me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I am a personality. And my personality takes things on an even keel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you're not going to (crosstalking) get totally away from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. That'll never happen. That's me. (pause). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like things like sports that I enjoy doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p> PATIENT: I enjoy doing it. At the same time, I make myself so aggravated. Like, I enjoy bowling. But when I bowl bad [sic], I can't have a good time. When I bowl good [sic], all right, you know. But when I bowl good, I want to do better. (laughs nervously) I want to bowl better, you know. If I bowl one game good, then I, I - I, you know, I think, well I should be able to do better than that, you know. I've got an average of 105. If I bowl a 135, everybody on my team thinks it's fantastic. But I know that that 105 and that 135 is - they're both bad, because I should be able to bowl better than that.</p>

<p>The same thing with skiing, you know. I'm just - I enjoy skiing. And if I, probably if I ski - when I ski by myself, I enjoy it a lot more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I bowl by myself, I enjoy it a lot more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. And when you're with people - (crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Sports -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not doing - what happens when you're - well, like in - in competition (coughs) bowling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm bowling by myself, I usually bowl better, first of all, so I'm happier with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I don't bowl good [sic], I just, you know - there's nobody around to know that I'm bowling bad [sic], first of all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nobody around to know that I'm doing a bad job. And I'm not bothering anybody else's score, and I'm not bothering anybody else's game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (pause) - sometimes I, like, like if Jesse is there when I'm bowling, he can help me. And he's, he's got constructive criticism. And if I bowl bad [sic], well he, he won't, you know, he doesn't say anything; and it doesn't bother him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't make any difference, because we're not bowling for any reasons. And neither one of us are [sic] under pressure. And he yells at me 'cause I get mad at myself. And then he turns around and gets mad at himself 'cause he does bad, you know. (laughs)</p>

<p>I mean, well - and well, skiing is the same way, you know. The only trouble with either one doing it by yourself is the fact that you can get in the habit of doing things  - . Like, I was a skiing by myself the last time when Jesse was giving some lessons to some people, you know. And I was doing a pretty good job of coming down the hill pretty good by myself, you know. Except I was making all these mistakes that I didn't know I was making.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, so I was skiing with Jesse again, and he'd say, "Well do this and do this and do this." And here I was thinking I was doing this fantastic job, you know. And I wasn't doing a bad job. I was doing things wrong. (sounds of thumping at 29:45) But then he'd show me what I was doing wrong. And so I'd go back on myself and try to do it right, you know, and I couldn't get it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the first time or the second time (sound of scraping/inaudible). And it really makes you (mad) (ph), especially when you're on the slopes. (sounds of scraping). Here you are, you know, almost 26 years old, supposedly an adult and all of this stuff and everything, you know. And all the things are going (sounds of bumping/inaudible at 30:13). And you can't ski, you know. (sounds of bumping). Supposedly you have great control over your body and everything else. And you can't - can't do a good job of skiing, you know. I have the feeling that I'm in fairly good physical shape, that I should be able to do it just like that if I want to, you know. [0:30:28.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is not true, and this is one of the things that aggravates me. And you see these little little kids, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK, learning to walk up and down the slopes. Oh, and that just - that just frustrates me. That really upsets me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. And so I think part of what you mention not enjoying things as much as you can is that - is that you're thinking about how well you're doing, and you're getting upset with yourself when you're not doing well. And so the wanting to do better and trying and getting frustrated. And that whole clutch of stuff kind of gets in the way of just being out there and having fun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that you take things too seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess maybe the reason I don't just enjoy what I'm doing at the time is that I take myself too seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you [have to be] (ph) - Oh, I see what you mean. Like, when you're talking with people and things, you are sort of trying to be a good talker, just like when you're on the ski (area) (ph), you're trying to be a good skier. And trying to be, you know, when I'm talking to someone, I try - 'cause I know that I used to just  - . And I still do it every once in awhile - just ramble on about nothing, monopolizing conversations. Which reduces somebody else's enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And mine, too. But I realize I'm doing it. But this is, again, goes back to wanting to be center stage all the time. So, you know, when I get somebody alone to talk to 'em, I'm liable to just talk their arm and a leg off. Over something (sounds of bumping, voice rising) that isn't really that worth saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I'm try - so I'm consciously sitting there and talking to someone, you know, trying not to let - trying to keep, you know, make sure I don't do this. Because this - this hurts me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. (crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, you know, when somebody gets the floor and without pleasant conversation and doesn't really have - is not really talking about anything that important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Is that one of these things that goes on when you're in a group of people talking, and you're sort of sitting on yourself to prevent yourself from, you know, talking this nonstop?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 'Cause I do that [so terribly] (ph @ 33:02). I - even when I'm watching, and I'll do it unless (inaudible at 33:04).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just can't sit there and listen to what everybody else is saying and keep my mouth shut. And that aggravates me. Because this is like, you know, I mean that - if this - if you don't, people - people don't enjoy your company.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This could be one of the big reasons why. It really could. Is the fact that, you know, "She's a nice kid and everything, you know, but once she gets the floor, forget it." (laughs). Well, I guess I'm going to have a chance to say a word.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So (pause). And this is something where I do not feel that I can relax. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I can keep my mouth shut and relax at the same time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or throw occasional zip in, you know. It's just - this is probably - this is - this also goes back to the reason maybe why I can't - why I become a, you know, on the outside of a conversation not being able to get into it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if I'm there, is because of the fact that they know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's [something] (ph) - they're probably not consciously sitting there thinking, "If we let her talk, we'll never get the floor back."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time, they're probably subconsciously in their minds thinking - (inaudible) you know, subconsciously (inaudible) - I just don't want to talk. (inaudible) And that makes me made that I do that. [34.38].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how to overcome it, except just watching your (sound of paper crunching/inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, there's no other way that, you know - self-hypnotize myself ("You Will Not Talk"), you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (crosstalking/inaudible at 34:51) a combination of things, not being, you know, being afraid you'll talk too much, you know, just being afraid you'll run on and also feeling on the edge and like you can't quite get in. If they're all talking and you're - it's like your chair is back a little from the circle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's the reason why, probably, usually. I mean  - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is what I think is probably the reason. People you know -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, but  - . That's one - I think that's one reason that I would have - problems with people that I already know who know me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. (sneezes).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gesundheit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sneezes again). Thank you. (sneezes) (sounds of nose blowing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gesundheit.</p>

<p>(pause, 13 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The people you already know keep you out of the conversation a little to compensate for the way you would take it over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It depends on the situation, but in a conversation where - I don't know. They kind of, like, this is the reason like they kind of shy away from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that it's in - in a conversational situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I would think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Again, it could be taking myself way too seriously. This is probably. This is probably a lot of my problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taking yourself too seriously?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Just too worried about it. Just [don't worry] (ph), you know. If I could just take the attitude, don't worry about it; if you want to talk, go ahead and talk. [0:36:57.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They don't have to listen if they don't want to. But that's not really fair to everybody else. But, again, taking myself too seriously - [added to] (ph @ 37:14) all these things that are wrong with me that I don't, you know, fit in and everything. It's just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I - I probably am taking myself too seriously and worrying about all this stuff too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time, I want to enjoy other people that [ I live with] (ph @ 37:34), and I want them to enjoy me. And and I want to have friends, and more than just one or two, you know. That (crosstalking) can have a good time with, that really enjoy my (company) (ph), you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That we have fun together. And as long as -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) I sense it is serious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And unless I make some changes or - or watch these (changes) (ph), I won't have them, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - Now one thing I may be getting is the fact that whereas I don't show great emotion, like, I mean, you know, I get really excited about anything, I may be expecting more emotion out of people than I should - I mean, I should - I may be - I'm thinking that they don't enjoy my company or something when they really - that's not the case at all. That they just are not, you know, super excited about it. Or maybe what I'm - I'm wanting is more than they're willing to give.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or more than the situation calls for. I mean, the relationship (crosstalking), the friendship relationship, calls for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's a casual relationship, and you're wanting some sort of overly deep -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Indication.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I mean, I'm - it's not that I want a deep relationship; I want a casual relationship, but maybe I'm expecting - you know, the reaction I am expecting people to give to me, the outward sign of a friendship - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is not the one that's called for. And I - I'm not picking up the signs that they are giving, because I'm just looking for one sign that I'm not seeing or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not just adapting around. I - I - I just have  - . No, I - I - that could be it, but I just don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you think you - really, what seems like the case is that it's not that things are great and you don't realize it, but that things aren't quite right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you remember, you know - maybe it would help to talk about it in terms of the specific conversation you had with the group of people and what happened when -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, last night it happened. You mean like when I'm talking too much?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or when you were not enjoying yourself, or watching yourself too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean that - what happens when I don't watch myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, more - (pause). I - I'm not sure. I mean, like maybe - (pause).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think what happens in all cases, when I start running off at the mouth about something that's not really that important -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:40:51.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I always have to be getting my two cents in on any topics that relate to people are discussing things that have happened to them. If I'm discussing - we're discussing some kind of a topic, argument, arguing on different sides of, you know - somebody's having an argument on whether the war in Vietnam should go on around - but I can sit and pretty much stay out of that unless I have - until, until somebody says something really stupid, and I have something I want to say in rebuttal against it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Just like that] (ph). Where the situations in 99 out of 100 cases, where I will catch myself running off and saying, you know, really being [where I] (ph), I consider it's obnoxious. I don't like people to do that to me. [0:41:40.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think most people do. This is the reason I know that it's - it's not that I'm  - . It's when the subject gets around to personal experiences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, talking about funny things - oh, I had something like that, you know - and it's almost like I catch myself doing this, no matter what kind of an experience somebody has had, I've had a comparable experience. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of just, you know. And maybe I have, but it maybe have been trivial. And it's just as well to keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause they will have some fairly decent experience. And I think while I was saying, like, it's not as amusing a subject, but I throw it in there, you know. "Oh, the same thing happened to me," you know. And I hate someone who does that. "Oh, the same thing happened to me, the same thing happened to me, the same thing happened to me," you know. "I've done all these things," you know. But I find myself doing that. So, it's kind of like telling them, "Well, see, I've been around too."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I exist, I've been around. Things do happen to me. And I'm not the dud that I think I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's not I'm the dud that you think I am. It's really, I'm not the dud I think I am, you know. It's like, I'm telling myself that I've had all the experiences these same people have had, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in situations like that, when we're talking like, you know, I'll - well, one time Jesse and Kurtis came over for their [but I didn't care] (ph @ 43:03), right? And we were playing cards that night. And, and everything went fine until we were through playing cards, and we were just sitting around the living room talking. It was too late to start another game, and they were sitting around talking before, you know, it was time to go home. And we were just talking about things, and I was doing a pretty good job of keeping my mouth shut. And then they started talking about cars. And so I - I haven't had any trouble with my car, and both of these guys know about cars. And so I did ask them about that. You know, "I've been having trouble with my car too," you know. </p>

<p>But then they start talking about old flames and old boyfriends and stuff like that, and I was - and I was in there, and I monopolized most of the conversation. (sounds of bumping) I realized afterwards, and it really made me mad, because it was trivia. And it was unimportant. And it would have been much nicer to sit around and listen to everybody else's. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, you know, I mean, I already know about mine. And I don't know about anybody else's things that have happened in their lives - love affairs or interesting experiences or anything else, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then if something comes up in the conversation that - that I think is something that happened to me that was really amusing, that's one thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it seems like - and just chitchatting conversation -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's where you're implying there that, like, one of the things that was going for you was that, you know, when they started to talk about old flames and boyfriends. You - you needed to talk 'cause you needed to reassure yourself that, "Yes, I've had old boyfriends, too." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But, ah - no. See, what - I knew I had old boyfriends, but being able to tell somebody else about them...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... reassures me that I had one, too, because we were talking about this; and, see, I can talk about it, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I do. And do, and do. And - I really, I start conversations where it doesn't need to be, right? And I'll - it makes me mad. Usually what'll happen is, somebody will tell something; and then I'll tell something and - and it just falls flat. It just won't, you know. (crosstalking) Everything I - and it's just like, again, it's what's going through their minds, probably, is the fact that, you know, "Oh well, here she comes again. Here's another story at the same time", you know. So I just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of just - just letting it drop. [0:45:34.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, ah - and like I say, they're all situations where the people are relating things that happened to them, and I've got to relate so they can happen to me, too, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Did you have some sense of, not much has happened to you, or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you have lived less than other people, that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also, it's kind of like I want them to know, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That, you know, that I'm not really that much of a dud. That I have done things other people have done also, you know. And uh, like I'm trying to convince both of us that (inaudible at 0:46:07.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, - that they're mostly little things that happen to everybody in their life, you know. Everybody could probably talk about the same things. But, you know, these are interesting things that are happening to people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they - really, a lot more interesting. Like, mine is just an average case, and there's maybe a little extra average.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... on there, you know. (inaudible at 0:46:07.2) one way or another, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But - it all - like I say, if it's - it's just that - an argument about something. I won't have my two cents in there all the time. I'm sitting listening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I will - sometimes I'll say something (inaudible at 0:46:59.4) depending on whether somebody else is doing a pretty good job of withholding my viewpoint or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when it's an argument, anything can go more or less the way you'd like it to, like you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stay out, and you can come in when you have something to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The whole thing isn't a problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's, ah - it's more with, you know, talking on a personal level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Relating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, in a way you'd like that to go the same way an argument goes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah, I'd like to be able to keep my mouth shut unless I had something that happened to me that was on the same topic that was really funny or really good or really cute.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It's not just like something - it's just neat for everybody else to hear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, a cute joke on myself or something, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mind, you know, telling things that have happened to me that are funny, you know, even if they made me look stupid at the time, you know. In retrospect, they're funny. They're upsetting at the time; in retrospecting, funny. In retrospect they're funny. If I could just, you know, keep my mouth shut and listen to other things that happen to other people, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One time, I just kind of sat on my tongue and didn't say anything, hoping that (pause) - hoping that after not saying anything all evening in a group of people who have been around me before and know that I can talk [somebody's on the lot] (ph), that someone would ask me. Well, listen, you know, if I sit there long enough and being really quiet, they're going to wonder why I'm not talking, you know - [0:48:45.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And invite me to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all that somebody asks me is, is, is like if I sit there for awhile, and then maybe one of my girlfriends would come over afterwards and say, "What's the matter? Don't you feel well?" (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "You didn't say a word." (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But nobody came to you special with a "What do you think about that?" you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I probably would have to do it - ah, more than once.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I have to - I also would like, you know, like, thinking about [like who you] (ph) deal with, you know. Whenever I say something, say something intelligent or, or you know, some people will think I'm really smart (inaudible at 49:31). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This (sounds of squeaking/turning machinery-furniture?) - weighing all my words and, you know, another Abe Lincoln; every word is a word of wisdom, or something. (sound of bumping). It's just kind of  - . I - this is something I'd like to do, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't. And I - it doesn't, you know. But I don't worry about that so much. This is, this is, this is, this is, you know, like me. Silly [room about] (ph) you know, being (held) (ph). But I don't really - I don't really worry about that so much. It's just trying to, you know, try not to say something stupid. [0:50:15.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't really count, doesn't really matter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, uh, it makes me so mad when I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just throwing stuff in that really wasn't worth throwing in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. It's really nice to be able to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what happened to you last night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was talking. We were bowling. And, we finished about a quarter to ten, and nobody else finished until 10:30, until Sue  - . You know, I just have - I've just grow on the bowling team. Well see, her husband was bowling. I arrived at Dr. Arrews.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And her husband's team was bowling Dr. Arrews team. So both of us had to wait. And so, we were sitting there talking, you know, and I started asking her about her kids. And so I had heard her talking with some - some of the other ladies about some of the silly things their kids do. It's sounded interesting, so I started talking about it, you know. And I - most of the time I just sat there and listened, you know. I started off, but it - because it was interesting. And then I started throwing in my thoughts on the subject. Which were more thoughts and questions as to how, you know, Sarah - it was like, she's having trouble with her kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - other people have trouble with their kids. And she (said) (ph) - you know. I was - you know - my views on the fact that, you know, I'd want kids. But I don't know when they're the age that hers are, starting two and three years old, and you start having trouble with them, you know, they're  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then - and you don't really know which way to turn, you know. You don't want to spend your life reading up on 'em, and yet just coaxing and reason them and - and threatens, threatenings don't bother the kids at all, you know. They're just kind of, "Nyaa", you know. Totally oblivious of everything, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, ah (sound of bumping and furniture squeaking) - so I was, you know, like worrying, talking to her (sound of squeaking) about (inaudible @ 0:52:16.6). Then we started talking about, um - you know, the way we were raised and stuff. And I just talked too much, you know. There were times when I just should have let her talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I learned a lot more, and I got another point that was (different) (ph). When I'm talking, I don't learn anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You just sort of run it off  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like one thing follows another, [everything follows on another] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just keep thinking of different things to say, and I just keep talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, - and I've caught myself doing it, like, abruptly shut up and let her finish. And I - you know, like - and I, you know, I can learn things from what she had to say. And I enjoyed listening to her, you know, until somebody else's - and her viewpoint, and she was - And - but I always get to feel like, you know, I have got to put my side in. And I don't always have to put my side in. I realize that it's not necessary. But I always gotta keep in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) (sounds of paper crunching) (inaudible @ 0:53:24.3) ... just all the time go like that. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. Just always opening my mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - and it's very frustrating, because I don't want to do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's something that I've gotta watch so carefully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like - it's almost like it were - I don't know, some sort of natural release of energy or something, like - like you have - like as though you had some energy that - made you want to talk. And, you know, not talking would be like, oh, like for me to stop sort of swinging my legs sometimes when I - when I'm (inaudible and sound of paper shuffling @ 0:54:11.8). Yeah. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I sort of enjoy ta - I'm sort of enjoy - I mean, this is, ah, the part that's hard is basically until I realize (sound of phone ringing) -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello? Uh huh. Ah, yes. Let me call you in a minute. (sound of phone being hanged up)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like, - I en, I en, I enjoy it until I realize that it's obnoxious. So I realize what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoy relating to other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the pleasure of it, like I'm talking and you're listening to me, and I  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) No, no. It's not, I'm talking and you're listening. It's, ah - it's I've got something to say; I have done this too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It's like, like I said, it's trying to convince myself and other people that I'm - I'm, you know, I've done things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's the enjoyment of knowing, you know. I can join in this conversation because I have done this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have got something to relate to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Yeah. I've got something. (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've done this, and I can tell you the story about it and everything. And then I realize that if I would just - you know, not say anything, you know, just  - . If I could just enjoy it and just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I've done that too. Maybe, you know, I can say to myself, maybe it wasn't as exciting as that story, you know, or as funny as that story, but I've done that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've done exciting things, you know. I've done things. But - and then wait, and - and if I have something really funny to tell, tell it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the rest of the time, just be secure in the knowledge that, you know, I'm just - I was just re-enforcing me that I'm not - that I have done things, that I haven't led this dull life. The only bad thing about most of these things is that I didn't really (want) (ph) - most of the things I'm talking about didn't really excite me that much at the time, you know. They happened; but now that I can tell of them, they're - they're much better. Again, it's not getting really excited about anything, you know. [0:56:21.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The few things that I get excited about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to quit. (sounds of paper shuffling and furniture squeaking and cars in background)</p>

<p>(long pause, 17 seconds)</p>

<p>Thursday at 4:15? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I -can we make it 4:30?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, uh - I don't know if [I'll be] (ph) here by 4:15 or not, 'cause I work until a quarter to five, which probably won't happen Thursday. But,, my boss is (pause) getting a little touchy -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um.</p>

<p>PATIENT: like leaving early and stuff like that. So I guess that's OK.</p>

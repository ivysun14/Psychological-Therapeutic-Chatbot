<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) 2 things, really, are on my mind.  And both make me feel confused.  And I keep sort of jumping from one to the other.  Because I was thinking, while I was outside, about how I felt at the end of yesterday and how I just didn't know what to think or what I was thinking.  And I went away feeling very confused so that after a while, I just sort of decided not to think about it.  And I was just thinking too, today I, well, in getting ready for parents' day, which comes fairly soon, I've been trying to clean up the room and sort of straighten out what I'm doing with the boys so I'll have a day that isn't a confusing day when the parents are there.  And it just seems like I can't get myself unconfused there.  And my, just the appearance of my room looks sort of cluttered and confused, which is the way I feel.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The way you put it, uhm, maybe is what's important.  You said, you didn't know what to think and you also didn't know what you thought.  And I suspect the first comes first.  Because you said yesterday that, uhm, what you got hung up on was a certain phrase I used and you wondered what I meant and that I meant certain specific things you ought to think about, and as though you had to kind of guess what I had in mind rather than, simply let occur to you whatever would.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) In fact, that's what continued to confuse me because, uhm, I think the last thing you said, uhm, about it not being your, your purpose or it would, uhm, hinder your purpose or whatever, I went away then trying to figure out what you had in mind exactly when you said that.  And I, I think I was trying to work things out to fit into what I thought you had in mind.  But then that didn't seem quite right.  And this continued to confuse me while I was home.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, right.  (Laughs) That's the point I was trying to make, exactly.  (Pause) But you've made it in other ways, you know.  You said how for example, with your supervisor one of the big things last week was for you to try to figure out what she would do and what was alright with her and, again, as though the, the important thing is to figure out what she had in mind.  (Pause) I think it must be here that if you sometimes, at least, perhaps, eh, that this time, that if you, if you simply say what you have in mind, you're afraid that it won't be what I was thinking about and that's what you feel you have to avoid.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I think the other thing I'm afraid of is what just happened in saying something which I've known and it's obvious to me but it's on my mind and I say it.  And your reaction, as when you laughed and said that was what you were, that was your point, gives me the feeling that your reaction is, it's so obvious it doesn't need to be said.  For some reason, that made me feel more uncomfortable than, well, not more uncomfortable than anything but as uncomfortable as anything has ever made me feel.  Because it's just the kind of fear that I have that I will be laughed at.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You felt I was laughing at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, sort of the reaction, well, of course.  Because I knew that was your point and it was just something that was on my mind.  I was saying it.  And I, I don't know, I just had the feeling from your reaction that I shouldn't have bothered saying it because it really didn't add anything and, and it was just so obvious.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I think that's very interesting because, you see, another possibility might be that you would feel annoyed with me for saying what was perfectly obvious to you.  And when you have that choice, you denounce yourself rather than me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I don't know, perhaps I was annoyed but when I said what I said at the very beginning of today, I phrased it in a way, I think hoping that you would make some comment.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you have something in —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  So I could know what you thought, I suppose.  (Said at same time as analyst began talking)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah.  You didn't have anything particular in mine?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I was — however much I knew what I said, I was still feeling somewhat confused about it.  And perhaps it was simply because I wanted to know what you thought, even if it weren't exactly on the points that were confusing me.  I might have, I don't know, I'm trying to recall now, when you were talking, whether or not I was — I think I felt a little bit that the way you were saying it made it sound as if you assumed I didn't see it.  And so I might have felt annoyed at that, that after a while, if you had said less then perhaps I would have.  I don't know.  But I, I, my reaction is to deny that I felt annoyed.</p>

<p>ANALYST: This reminds me of what you said yesterday, remember, about how important it seems to you to let your supervisor, and you felt, me too know that you have thought of something.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I feel confused all over again because I, in thinking about any of this, I somehow can't leave the idea that what caused my reaction of feeling very uncomfortable and, I don't know, embarrassed and everything was because I thought I was being ridiculed.  And none of these other things really seem to be connected in my mind.  (Pause) Although it, it was just occurring to me when I started to talk that, if I do feel that you or somebody caused me such a feeling of discomfort, then I can feel angry or annoyed.  Because I think I've always felt, no matter how justified the reaction is, a person has no right to make another person feel that uncomfortable and, and so that I can then be right to feel so angry.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Sighs) But again, you know, it strikes me as, that, uhm, you at least, you know, there are at least 2 alternatives there and maybe many more.  But you felt I was, my response was a ridiculing you.  But it seems to me it would be equally plausible to think of it as indicating that I wasn't quite on the ball right at the moment, that I didn't, somehow understand that you knew, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.  It seems to me that's just as plausible but that is not an alternative that you feel you can have.  It's as though you must be wrong and I must be right or something of that sort.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) That made me think of 2 things.  One is that I can't seem to see it any other way than I started out seeing it and so then it made me wonder why I, even over something like that, which is relatively unimportant, I cared so much and it could bother me so much, what I thought had happened.  And the other thing that made me think of is that I reacted so strongly because it was just an incident so much like so many that I've had before.  I don't know, when I, I've always used the term, "I'm taking this too seriously"  to myself, when I will say something that people will respond to as something that didn't need to be said or isn't in the spirit of the conversation.  And somehow or other, that particular incident seems to be a type that I just dread.  And I don't know how much I fit things now into that pattern.  (8-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, while I've been thinking I just found my thoughts kept going back over and over again, uhm, I guess, the question where did I put the blame.  And, uhm, a thought began to come to me that another thing that often would bother me is the feeling that I'm awfully slow to get a point or that you might think I am, meaning that I'm stupid.  And so then that takes me right around to the point you said earlier.  And I don't, I don't know, it seems to be something I think now but I, I wonder if I'm just trying to work in another thing that you've said so I can agree with you.  But, uhm, it does fit into this thing of wanting to let you know that I thought of something earlier and therefore, being upset at your reaction because it seemed that you thought I hadn't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Another thing I do on just about everything that I ever think about is part of wanting everything to be set, this is the way or this is right and this is wrong.  I do try to simplify it so that there's just 1 thing involved.  And when I've been thinking about my reaction today, it just seems that it can't simply be taken down to just 1 thing.  Because another thing that was occurring to me was, when I was just going over and over it, what I'd, how I'd felt and what had happened, I thought, well, this isn't going to get me anywhere so I'd better think about something else.  And I started to think of the fact that you had said some other things today but I had hardly been able to listen to them when you had said them and I couldn't recall them.  And I realized that a lot of times I only hear part of it, only can recall certain phrases or certain phrases are what seem important and, and I guess I do an awful lot of selective listening.  Something because when it, when it keeps coming back into my mind, I only, (pause) that, or else I start reacting and I can't hear what else is said.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you feel it's important right now to sort of sort out your thoughts again before you say them?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I suppose it's sorting out.  It's not thinking something and then thinking, well, I can't say it that way or how can I say it.  It's more, feeling confused about what I am thinking or, well, for a while when I was thinking before, thinking back over the exact same thing so I find I don't like saying the same thing over and over.  But that's the way I think.  (Silence)</p>

<p>In fact, there just occurred to me, there's some (sighs) well, similarity between the kind of thinking I was doing about my reaction today and, and how I just seemed to have to, for a long time, hold on to exactly the same view of it, and yet, I have to keep working it over, and how, in conversations when I'm with people that I know well, like my family and my family are all the same way, we all hang on to certain views of things.  And then we keep reiterating them over and over and, almost as if we can't stop saying them until somebody finally says, "Alright, I agree with you."</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does any particular instance come to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, just sort of generally, political discussions and how they just never go anywhere because it's always sort of, somebody will say something and then the next person will say, "No, but what I mean is — "  and repeat exactly what they said or just not realize when enough has been said or everything that can be said at this time has been said.  (Pause) When I think about just myself and (clears throat) talking to MSCZ so often, he'll just way, "Well, I don't want to talk about something anymore."  To me and I keep pursuing it because it just seems to take me forever to kind of absorb things that get my mind moving so I can see things in another point of view or just sort of broaden how I see things.  And I also think of how, when I've been with people I've known well, if I have something on my mind that bothers me and it's something that I am going to talk about to somebody, I'll talk over and over and over on it and, well, doing practically what I was doing today on sort of replaying the thing in my mind and practically seeing it exactly the same way until gradually I begin to see things a little differently.  Or else I get them to the point where I can tolerate thinking about it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it also, saying this made me think of a conversation I had last night with FYC who called to, uhm, tell us we were invited to go to a dinner that a relative of her husband's is giving.  And I don't know, I've always — I, I suppose I share my family's attitude toward MEIR's family, which is kind of looking up to it and pleased that FYC married into it and thinking that he really is something special, that (sighs) anyway, putting more importance on it that on, lets's say, ours.  And I think I, I've been gradually growing, probably partly because of conversations I've had with MSCZ about it, to see things a little bit differently than my family or than I used to.  And I've become more aware of how FYC uses this attitude that my family has to play up the whole thing.  It's all sort of vague, I don't, all I know is that last night when I was talking to her, it, the whole conversation bothered me because it just seemed she was saying pointless things or silly things and that she kept saying things about this aunt and their relationship with her that — and going on repeating them, just like I was talking about how we sort of harp on a point.  And I don't know, there was nothing I felt I could say in reply because it didn't seem these remarks went anywhere or, or had any other purpose than that she somehow wanted me to be impressed by this relative but was, but was couching it in very subtle terms and trying to let me know what a wonderful person this was and that I needn't be overwhelmed even though I was going to be so impressed.  And so it was kind of a condescending thing.  I, it was just sort of a confusing reaction on my part.  Because rarely before have I ever thought that FYC said something silly or had purposes other than ones that I would like also to have if I could.  And I, even though I couldn't seem to say anything in reply, I felt as if I were seeing through her last night and, somehow, that I was stronger.  And it really bothered me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and it was that what she was doing last night was the kind of thing that before I saw, or before I reacted this way, I would have said, it's another example of how wonderfully tactful FYC is.  And this is something that for years now has been on my mind, that she's so tactful and can be so wonderful with people and I'm sort of like a clod, I'll say things that shouldn't be said or don't know what to say.  And I don't know, anyway, just the opposite.  And now so often it seems that her tact is more sort of subtly working things the way she wants them, sort of being sympathetic and making people feel good because it makes her feel more — I don't know, it's sort of a condescending thing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

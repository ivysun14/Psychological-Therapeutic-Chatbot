<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s been two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot went on. I had my procedure, and they found something, but I don’t know what it is. They always find something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And they took it out. And on the 7th I have a follow up with him so he can tell me like what it is and if it’s anything to worry about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, on Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t think I’m too worried. They’re probably going to say the same thing, like that it’s benign, but we have to keep checking you every three years, you shouldn’t be getting cysts this young.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the night before sucked. I don’t know if you’ve had to do that yet, but you have to drink like over a gallon of this disgusting stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’ve heard. I haven’t done it myself, but I’ve heard it’s like a really gross…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ugh! It’s like thick water. Like thick salty water or something. And my mom was there. We had a nice time together. She decorated my apartment. Like we didn’t even spend that much money. Like we went around to all these little stores, like Ross and…Marshall’s Home Goods.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like this stuff that… There’s a clearance section. So we’d find something like really good for the kitchen. Wow, look, three dollars! Or five dollars. And my place looks like a home, it’s unbelievable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that made me happy, that made her happy. And that’s it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s it? That’s all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s all you got?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s all I got about my mom. We didn’t have time to get into much of anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long did she stay [unclear]? [0:01:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday she came after work, and then stayed until Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So Friday I took her to dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you had the procedure Monday, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So Sunday was… we couldn’t do much, I had to be home all day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Close to a bathroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And… Yeah, so we just like had dinner. She got to meet my friend Carly. She really loved her. We went to Ikea, the three of us. And Carly was just being funny and cracking my mom up and… She just gets a kick out of meeting my friends, and knowing that I have good people here that I feel close to and that are good people. Because she pictures me I think like all by myself, “Oh, my daughter who’s all by herself in DC.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like friends are family you choose. So like I’m showing her…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What your family’s like, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One thing she’s struggling with right now is how my little sister Carly, who’s 20… You’re bored.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sorry, I’ll be checking every once… because it’s been going off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. So Carly, she’s 20 now. She’s very mature. She recently called me before my mom came into town and said to me, “Melanie, I have this situation. My boyfriend…,” who is this Italian guy named Diego, who my mom totally dislikes, because he’s not White and Jewish and an aspiring professional. “My boyfriend got me a night in one of the Disney resorts, and he plans to take me to the park during the day. And then we’re going to, you know, enjoy the pool at the hotel, and spend the night, and get up and have breakfast there. Like he planned this beautiful weekend for us.” Like wow, shit, I want that. Like that sounds awesome. That’s cute that he did that for you. He works like every weekend, so I guess he saved money. But she’s like, “But the thing is, I want to be honest with Mommy and tell her. So should I tell her? What should I do?” And I said, “I mean, she’s not going to not allow you to go, you’re 20 years old. Just keep in mind though, even though she already knows you’re having sex, it’s going to be really weird for her to imagine you in a hotel room with a guy.” [0:04:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: “Like just know there’s no turning back from that.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she’s like, “Okay, okay.” So she decides to confront my mom about it. And my mom was just, “I don’t feel comfortable with that. You’re not mature enough. I don’t… You know, I think you should really reconsider that.” And when my mom was here I asked her, you know, “How are you feeling about that?” And she was just so… raw. And it kind of like grossed me out, like what came out of her mouth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was like, “I know you’re feeling uncomfortable with it, but how’s it going?” And she’s like, “Oh! It just… I can’t believe…” She called her a “[].” Like that’s what she used to call me when I was a kid, like a pain in the ass kid. And she…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With that kind of valence to it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, why is she making my life more difficult?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said… yeah, just, “I don’t know why I’m so bothered.” And I’m like, “Well, let’s think about it. Like what part about that whole situation bothers you the most?” And this is the part that I’m just like, Ew! Ugh! Don’t want to think about that. She said, “Well, I know they’re probably going to go to the hotel, and like take off their clothes, and take a shower together, and then have sex all night.” And I’m like, “Like adults do.” You know. And she’s like, “Exactly! And she’s not an adult.” But like she’s kind of torturing herself by picturing the deep… Like I don’t even want to picture that. Because Carly…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she pictures it with that kind of vivid…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s not a repressive barrier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just grossed me out. And it made me think about like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s really an interesting observation. [0:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: … stuff that tortures her, and how she must have… I remember once when I was living with Kevin already, and I would come home once in a while… No, I wasn’t living with Kevin. This is when they moved away and I had an apartment of my own, but she kind of knew that Kevin would spend the night occasionally. And so one weekend when I went to visit them I brought my laundry with me. And she did my laundry, because she wants to, she takes, you know, pleasure in just taking care of me like that. But then when she was folding my laundry she was like, “Oh, it’s so disgusting me. Like I picture your sheets, and I picture your underwears, and like how he must sleep over.” I’m like, oh my God, this is like too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my mom is very much like that. It’s like she doesn’t want us having sex, she doesn’t want to know about it, but yet like look at the vivid images that go through her mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, yeah, and as if they’re… it’s partially probably the reason why. Like in some way she’s hit so raw as you put it, like it’s so raw to her, it’s so felt and thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like even wonder, I started wondering, like is it okay if you do that? Like what about you and Billy? Like I just wonder what her own mentality of her sexuality is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, for herself. What’s okay for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking too, but what about… also what about a younger girl being in that situation? That some way… not just you and your sister, but her as a younger girl.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was telling me something new that I… it’s so obvious, but I had never put it together. She was saying how much Carly reminds her of herself as a young girl. She’s like, “You know how Carly is very mature, and like just flighty and out of it, and she’s kinda like an airhead, and knows nothing about life. I was exactly like that.” [0:08:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she got married like when she was 21, 22. Like I can’t imagine Carly married a year or two from now. But it makes sense. Like she’s always talked about herself like, “I didn’t like school, I didn’t like to study. I didn’t clean my room, I was irresponsible. Just like Carly.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in some ways she kind of puts herself in the state of mind of a… almost like a child and sexuality. You know what I mean? Like there is something like… As you’re sort of pointing out, like she can’t be thinking about it that way with Billy. It must be a kind of a different kinda…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I wonder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you wonder. But the way she described it is almost like the… kinda the… the recoiling-ness of like… of a girl. You know, it’s almost like how a young girl would think about those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like sheets and, you know, sex…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Underwear and… yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … and panties, and all that stuff. Underwear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the way that… yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that kind of weirded me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet there’s a lot of confusion for her about…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know she has a weird trauma. The other thing that was really weird is… so we found a great breakfast place around the corner from my house, and super cheap. Like you can get this huge breakfast for like six bucks. Perfect. Saving money. But then during the breakfast she said something to me like, “Remind me when we get to the car I have to tell you something I’ve never told anyone before. But I can’t say it here or else I’ll start crying.” And I felt like almost like a wave of anxiety come over me, and I felt like I do when I have clients in session and they tell me, “I’ve never told anyone this before, but I need to say something.” Like it makes me nervous to a certain… Like I can handle, but I always like, “Oh my God, this is important, this information I’m about to receive. But this is my mother, and I’m not in therapy right now.” And was just like uneasy. [0:10:20]</p>

<p>And we get into the car, and she says, “You know, sometimes I wonder if I should tell my brothers about something that happened to me when I was a little girl.” And I’m like getting all these ideas, like maybe she’s going to tell me that her father molested her, like her brothers molested her. What’s going on? And so she said, “Did I ever tell you that we had like a family birthday party, I must have been like six years old,” and some guy who was like probably 19 or 20, a friend of her brothers’, who were much older than her, they were like 16 by the time she was six. She said, “Did I ever tell you like he fondled me. He like touched me.” And I was like, “Yeah, you’ve told me this.” When I was 16 I remember we both got really, really drunk, and that’s when she told me that she… that happened to her, and that she was raped. But that’s like the only other time she’s mentioned that. So I was like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The incident when she was six, or the rape?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the six. The six year old.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, “You’ve told me this.” She’s like, “Oh. But did I tell you what happened after that?” And I was like, “What happened?” And she said, “Well, I just had this horrible guilt, because I ended up… as the party was wrapping up I told my mom and dad… I told my mom what happened, ‘That guy touched me.’ And my mom told my dad, and my dad was like drunk and pissed. So he’s like, ‘Who is it? Tell me who it is, I’m gonna kill him.’” And my mom pointed at some guy with a hat, and it seems like the guy that touched her had taken off his hat and given it to someone else, so she pointed at the wrong guy, and my grandpa started beating him up. And she feels horribly guilty for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, wow. [0:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I kind of helped her just explore how… like as a little girl, I can imagine… you know, what other choice do you have? Like, “Whoops, I made a mistake, never mind.” Like with your dad being that impulsive and flying off the handle. Like maybe he would have attacked you or gotten mad at you if you would have admitted like, Wow, I made a mistake. So. But then she said, “Yeah, have I told you that?” And I was like, “Yeah, you actually did tell me that too.” Like it’s like ingrained in my memory because it’s the only time she ever told me about this stuff. And she said, “I’ve often wondered if I should have told my brothers.” Because her brothers remained friends with this person for the rest of their lives. And in fact she had to interact with him again, like at gatherings and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we were kinda talking like, “Well, what would that accomplish? Would that make you feel better somehow?” And she’s like, “I don’t know why I’m thinking about it.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There’s just so much unprocessed stuff there. She’s a tortured soul. And Carly called my crying just like two days ago. She’s like, “I went to go say good morning to mommy, and I was in a good mood and everything, and out of nowhere she’s like, ‘Carly, I’ve been thinking about it, and I don’t think you should go on that trip to the Disney hotel. I’m very uncomfortable, I haven’t been able to sleep for days.’”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I get a text on like my other messenger thing that says—from my mom—”Melanie, are you awake? Can I talk to you? I haven’t been able to sleep. I’m so anxious.” And it’s because of this thing with Carly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s really something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And she knew about Carly… the trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being sexually active?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, no, she knew about the Carly was going to take when she was talking to you about that story? When she was recounting this…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was why, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It must be kicking up a lot of stuff for her. You know, as a young girl, you know, becoming sexually active, that being in her head. Wow. [0:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Billy doesn’t know. And so she’s holding all this on her own as a parent. Billy is under the assumption that Carly’s a virgin. In fact, who knows if it’s just denial or if he really is naïve and just doesn’t know. Because every time… She goes through boyfriends like every month. And every time she gets dumped, which usually is what happens, Billy says, “Oh, I suspect what’s happening is she’s refusing to have sex with them and that’s why they’re dumping her.” Which plays into that image of like she’s an angel, she’s good, she’s…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … untainted. And so my mom says, you know, “I could never tell Billy about it, he’d have a heart attack.” Like it just would blow his mind, he couldn’t handle it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she’s keeping that from him and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s really hard for her. Because like there’s something, as you were putting it, like raw and un… well, unrepressed in some way. It’s almost like Billy has that kind of repression that a lot of fathers have about their daughters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know. But not so with your mom maybe. It’s like too much in your face.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was like that with me as a teenager too, and it just…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It weirded me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I got it. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then with her own sexuality, like when she would become uninhibited and drunk for example, it’d be like just in your face. Remember I told you that story how we went to the beach. And this was like a few months after she got her implants, so I must have been like 16. And she was with my aunt, my aunt was driving the car out of the beach, and they had been drinking on the beach all day. And so my mom like stated blasting the music, and like took off her top and like flashed everyone. Like in public.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and… Or she’d make really perverted jokes. Especially when she’s drunk. Like she said something… When I took her to dinner we had two margaritas, and it hits her really hard, and she was just like… I forget what comment she made, but she said something that I was like, okay, that’s gross. Like it’s too raw. [0:16:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was gross to… Yeah, it’s too raw and in your face.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if it was my friend. Like Carly and I talk like that all the time. My friend Carly. But my mother, it’s just… And we can talk about adult stuff, but I don’t know, she like crosses the line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there’s something about the way… yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I find myself redirecting the conversation to kind of like contain it. Because it could blow up, I could add fuel to the fire and probably engage in a really inappropriate conversation with my mom. But I don’t want to go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you mean you could kind of… yeah, if you guys were friends or something you’d…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or if I had no boundaries. Or I didn’t want to maintain that image of my mom as, this is my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes, right. But yeah, in some way you found that she didn’t really have that… maybe when she was drinking at least, she didn’t have that kind of sense of you as being…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when she wasn’t drinking she’d be more…</p>

<p>CLIENT: She’s appropriate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She… yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More appropriate. Unless she says something, you know, like what she said about Carly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Right, where she can’t help it. Almost, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She kept making jokes the whole time. And looking at the weather channel, like, “Oh, maybe there’ll be a snowstorm the day I have to leave.” Because she was hoping her flight would be delayed or canceled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she said something like, “You know…” She takes a lot of medications, like for migraines, for her depression, her anxiety, her panic. Like she has pills for everything. And she said something like, “You know, before leaving the house I took my pill box, and I said, ‘Oh, I need to have just the right amount for the right amount of days.’ But then I decided to bring like five days extra or something just in case.” She just has… Like I hear it in so much that she’s saying, she has a wish to just live with me. [0:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How is that for you? What’s it like for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I wish she lived closer. That would be nice. I would love to see her more frequently. But I just… It makes me sad I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because home doesn’t feel like home I guess. She’s…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s sad to hear she feels that way, that home doesn’t feel like home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it’s… I feel sad for her. I feel sad that Billy can’t provide that kind of warmth and nurturance that she craves so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just have such dysfunctional relationships with their families. Like sometimes I question, will I be able to have a normal relationship with my parents and my sisters? Because Billy doesn’t get along or talk to his family, my mom doesn’t get along and talk to her family. Not really. Like she was telling me something when she was here about how… You know how I have that uncle that like his son did something illegal and so they’re hiding out somewhere in Alabama? And then she has her other brother who lives in Chile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That brother, he has a daughter that’s like one of my best friends, my cousin. She has twin boys, she lives in Alabama. And so she wants her dad to visit her, and so she sent him a plane ticket.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the Chilean uncle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Chilean uncle. So she pretty much lives like two hours from my mom. And so she’s talking on the phone, my mom is talking to my uncle on the phone, and my uncle said, “I’ll be in Alabama.” And, you know, now Rodrigo, their other brother, is also in Alabama. “We should all get together. It makes sense, we’re all gonna be like within two hours of one another.” And so she was telling me, “I don’t know why they keep wanting to see me.” Like, “I live a very comfortable peaceful life. I don’t need anything to stir up anything. I don’t know why they want to see me.” And I was like, “You’re their sister. Like you’re family.” “Yeah, but we’re not even close, they don’t even know anything about me.” I’m like, “This is true. They don’t know you the way I know you, for example, but…” I’ve noticed, like I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing or what, but at least in my family, the Chilean side, they’re all about like loyalty. Like it doesn’t matter how many years you haven’t talked to the person. Or if it’s just surface, like my dad, the conversations I have with my dad, like, “Hi, how are you? Everything good? Okay, bye.” It doesn’t matter. Like that is your family, that is blood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You’re gonna spend time with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you’re gonna see them and keep in touch. And my mom is just… she doesn’t want much to do with any of them. So… It’s like she just wants to… She says things like, “I want to live in just my peaceful little house, I’m very peaceful, with just my daughters and my husband, and I’m fine like that.” Like she wants to just be protected in this little bubble. [0:21:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as if something about seeing her brothers is gonna stir… rock the boat for her, stir up trouble or…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that’s very raw about seeing those brothers maybe for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I remember years ago, like five, six years ago, I happened to be visiting while her Chilean… the one that lives in Chile was visiting Alabama for some reason. And he spent like a night or two at my mom’s house, so we were all spending, you know, time under the same roof. And she freaked out. Like they were having a talk in the kitchen or something, then he went to bed, and then I went to the kitchen to get a drink, and she was like freaked out. And she looked like a deer in headlights. And I was like, “What’s wrong?” She’s like, “Something weird just happened and I don’t know what to make of it. And it like made me feel really weird, and it reminded me of things from the past.” I was like, “What happened?” She’s like, “Well, I was just talking to my brother in here and…” You know, she was wearing like a T-shirt, because it was time to go to sleep and she wasn’t wearing a bra. And it seems like he was like using his hands to talk and must have bumped into her breast somehow. And she said that that like… she didn’t know what to do. Like she froze.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there’s so many issues with sexuality with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you make of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I started asking her, like do you think it brought back some kind of memory? Like do you think… How did it make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She’s like, “It just made me feel so uncomfortable, and I just like froze. I was just like, get out of here, run.” You know, like it just… it had a trauma feel to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, “Well, it’s… I don’t know, I wonder if he’s ever been inappropriate with you, or if it’s just bringing up a lot of… because you’ve had other experiences that have been really inappropriate so… that you haven’t talked about a lot.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But it was her brother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was her brother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And another thing, like… So that brother’s son, who is now like 36 or something, my cousin [one? 0:23:11], once we were all at a family gathering, and… I don’t think I was there. No, I wasn’t there. But my mom told me about it afterwards. And she said that they were all drinking, because that’s what my family does when they get together. And she said that Oscar came up to her like to have a heart to heart, and he like put his arm around her shoulder, and I guess she was wearing shorts, and he was like going like that to her. She’s like, “Oh my God, it made me feel so uncomfortable, and I just froze. Like there was something so inappropriate about what he was doing.” Like I know Oscar, like I don’t think he meant it that way. But like she just…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, she just really responded strongly to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So there’s been a lot of situations like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, her body’s responding to something, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel so bad. Like I wish I could give her therapy. I can’t. I wouldn’t want to. But she needs it, she needs some good therapy. Maybe in her old age when she is like living near me I’ll pay for some good therapy for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah. Boy, it’s all right there on the surface to her though. It’s not like there’s a lot of digging that needs to be done, she’s really… And for her part too, you know, it sounds like she’s trying to make sense of it. You know, asking questions and…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or at least talking about it as if it’s puzzling to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Over the years it’s increased, like because she knows what I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and she knows how I think. So I think just sharing with her my work and psychology in general she’s become more curious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking the same thing, that you’ve kind of influenced her to be more curious about herself. [0:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Another thing I wanted to bring up, and this has to do with just how poor models my parents are of like just maintaining good family relationships. So Billy has his mother, Olive. Have I mentioned her in here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. I don’t know that you have, actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it’s his biological mother. His parents got divorced when he was like six, and she didn’t get custody because supposedly she was a floozy. She was sleeping around with the whole neighborhood and the neighbor. So dad got custody. And then…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would do things like say, “I’m gonna come pick you up,” and just would never show up. Or…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They never really lived with her. And she was very passive aggressive, and just nasty, that’s how he describes her. And he has a very nasty relationship with her. Like he will insult her, hang up the phone on her. And she’s been living in North Carolina the past few years, alone in an apartment. And she’s a pain in the ass. But I can’t be mean to people. So once in a while—and I think it’s because she’s lonely—she sends gifts from QVC. Like she spends her life watching QVC, and sends me weird things, like a portable battery for my cell phone, or coat hangers, or… just weird stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coat hangers, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it’s so sad. Because she does that in order to get people to call her. Like because then I have to call and say, “Thank you for the gift,” and that’s how she draws people in. And I don’t like talking to her, because every time I talk to her she’s very inappropriate. Like she’ll say stuff like… She’ll start off fine, “How is everything? How are you? My health is bad.” Always her health is bad. But then she’ll asking questions like, “So what’s Billy doing for money?” You know. “He’s not working is he? What are they living off of? Do you think like your mom’s father is still sending her money? Does that still happen? Like did he leave or something, what?” Just like, this is none of your business. And it’s none of my business technically. Like don’t talk to me about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very gossipy kind of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And it puts me in a bad place and… So what happened recently, from what I heard, is Billy got into a horrible fight with Olive. Because she insults him. Like this is their relationship, they’ll get along and laugh and everything, but then once in a while she just becomes nasty, and he’s like, “That’s it, I’m not talking to you anymore for a few months.” So he said something to her about a suggestion for some kind of business or something, and she said to him like, “Pft! What do you know about business?” And that was like the biggest insult you could give Billy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because like he prides himself on like, “I’m a businessman, I’m a salesman.” Yeah. So…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re cutting him off at the knees. [0:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he said, “I’m not talking to you anymore,” and basically blocked her number. So she’s been calling Carly and I practically every day and leaving messages, and saying, “Melanie, what’s going on with Mommy and Daddy, they’re not picking up the phone? I’m very worried, what’s going on?” And obviously she knows what’s going on, they got into a fight and he’s not talking to you. But it’s hard, it puts me in a bad position, because I’m not naturally rude. Like I don’t just not call people. And I feel bad for her, but at the same time I don’t want to be dragged into this.</p>

<p>So I asked my mom, right before she came to see me—and I could hear Billy in the background—I said, “Mommy, can you tell Billy to please like call his mom.” And I’ve heard from Carly also that Olive won’t stop calling her. Like she keeps calling us, like can you say, “Look, Melanie and Carly don’t want to be rude, but they don’t want to get in the middle of this. You’re having a fight with your son.” And so I heard her put the phone down and say this to Billy, and say, “Billy, can you call your mom and tell her to stop calling?” And like a kid having a tantrum, he’s like, “I’m not calling her! I’m not calling my mother!” [pause] Like are you serious? So I’m just going to have to eat it, like just deal with it, and keep on ignoring her calls. Like you’re not being the adult here. Like I’m not even the granddaughter, I’m the step-granddaughter. Like I have nothing to do with this woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s just like… it’s like a child. So…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And leaving you to kind of figure it out for yourself, or not a lot of guidance from them, or kind of like a feeling that there’s a…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he told me… he said something the other day like, “Well, just pick up the phone next time she calls and say, ‘God damn it, don’t call me anymore!’” And I was like, “Billy, I don’t have that relationship with her. I don’t do that, I’m not going to talk to her that way.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. [0:30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he doesn’t get it. They’re just like all these little things make it clear to me like they’re just not acting like parents. They’re not acting like adults.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The more adult I become the more I realize like, wow, you guys kinda fail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, and you see them… you see them really, you know, with all their kind of dilemmas and kind of emotional… you know, the very emotional responses they have to things, you know, to their family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yeah, I think kind of really… I guess you give them kind of a sympathetic eye… you know, a sympathetic look at both of them and, you know, sort of see them as really struggling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Billy was on speakerphone when my mom was here, and she was like, “Oh, what did you do today?” He’s like, “Well, you know, I just finished cleaning up the house a bit. And Carly was out with her friends today so I went in there and cleaned up her room and changed her sheets and made her bed for her.” And my mom like looked at me and she’s like… she just laughed a little, and she’s like, “I need to take you off speakerphone, you can’t say these things in front of Melanie.” Because like, you know the whole thing about like, “Oh, why won’t she grow up? Why won’t she be responsible?” Well…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like your mom knows that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you might as well wipe her ass. Why don’t you wipe her ass for her?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So on a totally different topic, so I kind of think I’m dating someone. Did I tell you that I had a date with a psychologist?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I told you I went on a first date.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, at least one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There’s been like six dates by now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [0:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually spent the weekend, this weekend at his place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He lives in Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, right. Right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what’s his name again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: James.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so far like I can’t find anything wrong with him. I mean, I’m sure there’s a lot of things wrong with him. But he’s just so funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he has such a great sense of humor. And like my kind of sense of humor. And smart, and friendly. And just affectionate and caring and sensitive. And I have fun with him, you know, and he wants to do stuff and be out in the world. We’re supposed to go to high tea on Saturday. Like I’ve always wanted to do little things like that, you know, and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like what did we do? On Saturday night we hung out at his place a little bit, and then went out to dinner. And we were making fun… well, I was making fun of the area. Because I was like, “I want to meet some of these Bunker Hill women.” Because like I’ve seen Ted, and that girl was like, “Don’t you come into Bunker Hill.” So I was like… He took me to a bar, and like there was a rough crowd. Then we got food. And then we watched… like rented a movie at his place and saw the movie. And sleep was… nice. Like I was able to feel comfortable…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … and feel perfectly at peace, and like it felt really good. I think it’s just that we’re both new to each other, so I kept on waking up. Like every time he moved or shifted I got like self-conscious, like oh my God, am I sweating, am I drooling? Like what’s happening?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that that’s normal. But I just… I feel really comfortable around him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [0:34:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But… So we had sex. And I remember… I remember thinking, the first time anyways… like I just remember him being on top of me and thinking to myself, “What a disappointment.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was really sad. Because it wasn’t bad. It wasn’t bad. It just wasn’t Brian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, tell me about the disappointment. What struck you as disappointing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There wasn’t that like fiery passion. I wasn’t as turned on as I am with Brian. But I know that like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you feel for him? What did you notice in him in terms of passion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was really into me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, Brian does the opposite, he acts like he doesn’t care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he… So James was showing passion? Is that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I remember…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know if you remember me saying last time I was with Brian I remembered looking up at him and being like, “Oh my God, you’re so angry!” Like he was hurting me, he was going really hard, and I remembered he had just such an angry look. And that’s when… Like for the first time I wasn’t in it as much as I was like analyzing what was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I remember looking up at James, and it was like total difference. It was like total passion, into it, and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it wasn’t bad. I did not have an orgasm. But like I expected that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s different from Brian?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lose count with Brian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? It’s… yeah, okay. It’s very… wow, very dramatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it’s very dramatic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very dramatic difference, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And… It’s not that it was terrible, it wasn’t. But it just wasn’t the same. And I know that we’re just getting to know each other, it’s not like he’s gonna call me names and pull my hair. Like, you know, little things that might turn me on, he’s not gonna do that like the first time. But then what was interesting is… so we parted ways, and the next day he texted me good morning, I said good morning. And he said, “Are you feeling okay? Because I woke up really, really sick.” It was like, “I’m fine, what’s wrong?” He’s like, “I don’t know…”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He said that he woke up really sick?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He woke up really sick. And he said, “I don’t know what’s going on. I have like a bug or something. Like as soon as you left I was throwing up nonstop. I can’t eat anything, I can’t keep anything down.” And I felt really bad, and I started wondering, like, oh my God, am I sick? But I wasn’t, I didn’t get sick. Something was going around. And he works with kids, so he probably had something. And he didn’t text a lot, because he was sleeping basically for the next two days. And I remember just feeling an unease. Like I never feel uneasy or uncomfortable or in a bad mood, and I was kinda moody. And I kept on asking myself, like what’s going on right now? And I only noticed like a few days later when he was feeling… coming out of the flu and feeling better that he started texting me, using humor, and, “When can I see you again?” that I was like, “Whew!” [wiping sweat off forehead sound]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was some kind of feeling of separation…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … that freaked me out a little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how to take that kind of… It sounded like you felt like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I felt rejected, it was weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though it’s not his fault he got sick, but… So Carly’s hypothesis is… she’s like, “You know how you said you weren’t too into it? Maybe you were more into it than you thought. And so that’s why that separation kind of freaked you out.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. No, how to make… yeah, what… yeah, like… I’m curious whether you’re making… how you’re making sense of like not hearing from him as much. I mean, knowing on one level he was sick. [0:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew he was sick. But like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like, oh my God, like this has the potential for something really, really good, it feels really different, and what if I lose it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm. Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like seriously, this guy is like marriage material.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, something too might be opening up for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but then we don’t have time to get into this. But I have a big problem, because I told Brian, which I think was brave, but not so brave, because he ended up kind of getting off to the idea. But I ended up telling him. And it was interesting the way I did it, because we were talking on the phone, or this was over texts or something. Over texts is just less threatening for him. And so I said something like, “I have to tell you something.” And he put, “Uh oh, I think I already know.” And I was like, “What?” He’s like, “No, no, go ahead, tell me.” And I said, “Well, I met someone.” He’s like, “Yeah, I figured, because you took your profile down.” And I’m thinking to myself, “So you’re still on it. You’re still checking my profile.” I didn’t even meet him on OkCupid, I met him on eHarmony. Which…</p>

<p>So anyways, so I said to Brian, like, “If you noticed that why didn’t you ask me about it?” Well, we know this. Because Brian doesn’t talk about hard topics. But I was like, “Look, what’s happening is this isn’t even a relationship yet.” I think this was before we had sex. Like this was on the second date or something that I told Brian, “Look, I met someone.” And I said, “He’s just… We get along pretty well, and I think… He’s just wanting to offer me a lot of the things that I’ve been waiting for you to give me.” And I almost felt like it was a plea, like step up before it’s too late. Like I didn’t say it in those words, but I felt like that’s what I was telling him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah? [0:40:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing changed. In fact he… I didn’t hear from him like for a few days. He said he got sick, and I believe it, because there’s some bug going around, I know a bunch of people that are sick. And then he worked a horrible schedule. And then today I get a text that says, “Mommy is in the hospital.” It’s interesting how he put that, “Mommy is in the hospital.” So I questioned myself like, is he talking about his mom, or his wife?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s what I was wondering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s talking about his wife.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was like, “Yeah, she’s having some major issues, she might have to have a hysterectomy and a transfusion.” And I’m like, “Geez. Are you worried?” He’s like, “Ah, a little bit.” And I was like, “Is this part of the reason why you’ve disappeared? Like it sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. Where’s the foster kid? Like this must be a pain. And you’re worried about her.” And he said, “No, I told you, I got sick and I had a busy work schedule.” So he didn’t give me much. And we haven’t talked about… he hasn’t asked me about…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the James situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But right away he turns to sex, and it’s so unhealthy. Like he started… He texted me I think yesterday when I was with James, and I couldn’t… I didn’t answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn’t even notice my phone. And so he was very angry with me by the time I got home and I texted him back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm. Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was very angry. And I was exhausted. Because like we had celebrated the Super Bowl like just eating junk, and drinking beer. And so by the time I got to my house I was just like spent. So I just remember last night him texting me like, “I’m very angry, but you need to go to sleep.” I said, “Yes, I need to go to sleep.” And then suddenly my phone rings and it’s him. And I think he was masturbating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just remember like being in and out of sleep and saying like, “I miss you. Why haven’t you been around?” And that’s it. Like he finished, and said goodnight to me. And so I asked him about it today, I was like, “Did what happen… did I think what happened happen?” And he’s like, “Yeah, I pretty much masturbated and you were just like listening.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like this guy has problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah, in some way he’s… it’s kind of eroticized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he kinda said something today when I talked to him about, “Oh, I had some really fun filthy new fantasies I can use.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know he’s probably referring to me dating someone. [0:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. Yeah, that goes into the… it gets kinda… it sounds like you hear about the anger through a kind of a sexual medium. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just have to be careful, because… I mean, this is a new relationship. We’re not even calling it a relationship yet. But like… like I could potentially ruin it, you know, if I don’t start distancing myself from Brian. And it’s…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it’s still… still the draw still is there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s very much there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay, yeah. Has it been added at all because of like the response he’s had? Has it made it more… Has it like enhanced any kind of erotic quality, or is it…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Same as before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just still like has a lot of power that way over me though. That hasn’t changed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, definitely worth talking about. Because it… I think what’s going on with James is opening something up. Not to say that something with Brian hasn’t as well. But it’s hard to kind of… I don’t know. I imagine it must be a lot to kinda hold those two things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. I don’t want to ruin this. Did I… Is that water?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just does that. It just does that, that’s water outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I’ll have to keep talking about that, because I don’t want to ruin…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that’s significant. Yeah, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0324-006, interview number 20; client 0324-006, interview number 20, April 28th. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at [00:15)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My little organize (inaudible at 00:20). Is that going?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Un-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the ones we use at work go twice as fast, but it looks like (chuckle) it's really going very slowly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah this is the slow speed that's in here. [Hit eject] (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to be awake by the time I got here. That's the reason I got here late. I know I managed to stay up most of the night and sleep most of the day is actually what had happened last week, but then I woke up at a quarter after three or whatever time it was that I called you. Things went really badly that I had to make an appointment to come in. Just things kind of up and down ever since I was here before; some very good in that things are finally halfway straightened out with my boyfriend. I even practically said (ph) I needed to talk to me after some very bad episodes, which is kind of what had happened last week and my system communication, which was the whole part way before anyway, and we talked. </p>

<p>The whole thing having boiled down to the fact that he was just really afraid of being too committed to me and my very weak dependent state needed him. And I couldn't convince him of my not being weak and dependent because every time he treated me that way, I became that way. And have a relationship basically functioning on the fact that he's sacred to lose me for fear I'll do something drastic, is not to cool. He doesn't tell me that directly, and he finally did. But he just didn't communicate with me in everything that he says and does, so. [2:32]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like one of those packs (ph) and assumptions that really rested on a state of force (ph) that doesn't get anywhere (inaudible at 2:38).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just that's his operating assumption that he's not always conscious of himself but, at this point, he's always there. And for a long time, he's been staying at my house like every single night; weeks, I think, to help me with the kittens. And I finally just couldn't stand just having him around without no communication, and [I felt bad] (ph). Two o'clock in the morning or something I told him to leave (laughter), and I couldn't go to sleep for that third night in a row. And that's when I just got very upset. I got very upset, and I don't know. It all got very irrational, and the whole old thing would come out of it. So if I can't communicate with him, I can't communicate with anybody. And I get really - I can't bring myself through (ph), and like then he finally left thank goodness. </p>

<p>I think it was like, I guess, Monday night. I brought him and his kitten and another kitten over to his house and stayed for a while, which is of course not what he wanted. He wanted me to be at point where I could sort of let him go and not feel upset about it. It's like because I wasn't upset that I didn't go, I was upset about feeling very insecure of myself as far as - I wasn't upset about him, the loss of him as much I was about what the heck I was doing and what I was going to do. [4:47]</p>

<p>And I guess that night I also worried about a bunch of therapy sessions [that I had that day] (ph), which was Tuesday or something; yesterday, which [hadn't gone] (ph) very well, not a single thing. Work is finally getting better. I keep getting bawled out from my supervisor at the hospital for not showing up. I'm thinking - I'm not sure when, you know, maybe a week ago, week and a half ago, and not showing up until later [because I couldn't get up] (ph). And what it would be is if I had been up all night arguing or something like that. I guess this was Monday a week ago. </p>

<p>I knew I had a family therapy session Friday evening. As it turned out it lasted very late, like from 4:30 to 7:00 of solid arguing with the family, or their solid arguing for deciding she wants a divorce in the middle of the session, so it was very traumatic. And - or I didn't know it was going to be that traumatic, but I knew I was going to have to be awake for it. And my boyfriend and I argued all night, so I didn't go to work until one or two o'clock that afternoon so that I could be in good shape for that session. Unfortunately - I didn't have any appointments that morning, but that's not the way they run. You have to be there even if you don't have anything to do, or even if you are going to be exhausted when your really important stuff comes up. [6:18] </p>

<p>So I guess it was that Thursday that I saw him, or I saw his (inaudible at 6:26). After Wednesday, which is the day that I came in here was a disaster. Oddly (ph) I managed to slash my face across here Tuesday night and it didn't go away very well, and I had ended up putting on piles and piles of make-up. And it still, I mean, I had a nice cat scratch in places (ph) that I could have given to anybody, but I didn't feel very good about it. I just didn't (inaudible at 7:00) go through last week, but at the same time it did because it was a - I had to do a good job to sort of forget where I had been and what I had done.</p>

<p>I don't know sort of - I really see myself as so trapped here. Not in the city itself, but from what I made the city or haven't made the city for me. And because I spent so much time being out of it and that much time, of course, then being lost and being blind and stuff like that. I don't know really - I really begin to think that the only thing I can do is just to completely get out of here, and I don't know where to go. But - and I mean like really do something drastic as far as starting some kind of completely new life, forgetting what I've been through the last three years because I really don't have that much energy to spend all my time living down things or catching up on things. [8:19] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you didn't set out to do it this way, but the stretch of your life here makes it almost like you're saying not possible to progress more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The progression is so minimal compared to the backsliding, which is so great. It's not all the way back, but it's - it just cancels out any progression. And in fact - I mean one of the really good things that's happened in the last couple of weeks is I saw this girl in my class to talk to that - and to do things with, which has been really good. And she just started dropping over sometimes, and we'll go shopping, to find new places to go shopping and stuff like that. </p>

<p>And I mean I know this is something I've sort of needed ever since I've been here and haven't had, and it's kind of at times like that that I realize who I should be and who I'm not being. I mean one of the biggest things that's hanging over me is why (ph) that I'm not doing, that's just plain living. I mean to the point of like feeling that I haven't really done anything in the last three years, and I damn well better start. I'm getting ancient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like - it's almost like there's so many, well things that feel like failures and this you're feeling - this life state here that it's almost impossible for you to get any reinforcement because there's so much built up about what you haven't done. I think I mean - I sense (ph) confused, but I mean ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it went well into my confused mind, but my (laughter) thoughts are clear. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK good. [10:49]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really true. I mean it's - I really don't know how to get out of this except to just leave, and I don't know what I'd do if I leave. But I'd really gotten to the point where I really don't know how to organize my life at all, I mean unless it's organized for me. And I really don't care about going to classes, the one class that I'm supposed to be going to right now. I go to work when I have to go to work. I mean when I have something going on that I have to do that like right now I'm not working on Wednesdays and Fridays. I'm working really late Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday so that in a sense part of it is just being exhausted. Like I worked until nine last night, and I got home about a quarter to ten. And by the time I finished dinner, it was midnight (chuckle). </p>

<p>And that doesn't make, like I don't use the days that I'm off at all. I mean I just drift, and I've got to stop that. But I've also got to feel like that there's something that I'm - I mean I'm going to have to set up a program for myself if that what it amounts to that I can stick to because I keep buying all these programs that are far to grandiose to stick to right now. [12:44] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just make an assumption (ph) about this. Something struck me about me about what you said about not being able to organize and needing somebody to do it for you. And then this - what you just said now about making sort of plans that don't work, and I guess the thing that's hitting me is like something about there not being anything worth organizing for or something either interesting or rewarding being missing. In fact, I got the feeling like there's no point. For some reason, there's nothing that motivates you to do the organizing or that makes it worthwhile to make a plan that would be keepable, or that would bring you some benefits and I'm not ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really pretty true. I mean I really - anything that I would be organizing to do would be organizing to finish up work that I don't care about. Would be - nothing really working towards anything so that it's just sort of organizing yourself to get through the required drudgery, and I don't like that. I mean I know that's why I'm having trouble doing it because I don't really get up in the morning with any great inspiration to do anything. And even when I work all day, which is very rare, but the few times that I do, I don't feel like I've done anything; at least nothing exciting or nothing working towards anything, which that's really true. I haven't really thought about that. I've been so busy being mad at myself for not doing anything, but somehow I've got to make it be interesting or be worthwhile. [14:48]</p>

<p>In a way that's why I stared working at the Family Guidance Clinic is because I knew that was something that I was interested in or thought I was interested in. And to work with some really pretty cool people, but I really need to get to know them better, especially my supervisor, she's fantastic. And I guess I needed to see some kind of work to be eager about and to like - that's the only thing I really have an interest in doing in. I was reading stuff that [I was willing to work on] (ph), which is good. [First of all] (ph), I'm completely in the dark about what I'm doing, but I mean that's why - like in a sense, my boyfriend, I was feeing really bogged down at some point, which I usually don't do. I don't think about things I need to do.</p>

<p>My boyfriend said, "Why in the heck did you take the second job when you were bogged down with your first job?" And I said, "Just because I was just going insane, and I needed something to be inspired about." And I mean I'm not sure that this is going to prove that, but that's why I took it. And at least I gotten somewhat inspired about it or somewhat interested and I feel like I am learning something about the families that I can help. That's really fantastic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's awfully complicated isn't it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: God yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was less [than you had] (ph). One person is just three times more complicated or something like that. [16:47]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The first family that I'm seeing is a family with three kids, two of which are presenting patients. And at first they take is the family, the holistic family approach, which I like because I'm very interested in family interaction that I know [it's my strength] (ph). And - but you end up, you see the parents and you see the mother by herself and the father by himself and you see each of the kids. And I guess since I saw you last, I've seen each of the kids at one time for like a half hour each. And I saw the father by himself who ended up contradicting all the nice stories that the mother told about their lovely happy marriage, and then I see this - I've seen one kid that I saw last night for a long time. </p>

<p>And it like putting pieces of a puzzle together trying to figure out what the heck is going on, not only with each individual but with the whole situation. And it's frustrating, but it's also very rewarding when you get anywhere. Like after seeing the parents without even seeing the kids, I had made a whole bunch of hypotheses about what the kids were like, and it was proven pretty true. It was proven really true. I was very happy because while I was testing the kids, my friends were in the waiting room. They were - we were all going out to dinner, and they all - my boyfriend and two of our friends had picked me up, or were picking me up. </p>

<p>And so they were out in the waiting room with the other two kids while I was interviewing the third kid, so they were observing the behavior, interaction of the kids and the mother, which I had not observed. And it just fit in just so perfectly, I was very happy. I don't know what I'm going to do with them now, that's sort of becomes the second (ph). [18:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's something about, at least for me, in these learning situations that on the one hand, I always just felt sorely unequipped when I started. I mean really just not knowing what to do, but also feeling like if I get anywhere, it's because I had to do something. I mean I just - it's not like taking a course and carrying back what the teacher taught you and getting a grade, like you can't you use words (ph). I always felt, at least, I sort of - it was something about me in there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In that sense, it's always felt more of a learning situation in a classroom but ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, I mean, that's really the way I feel now. And then I'm scared as far as what kind of an intervention can I make because the way I see the family anyway, it's - I can see what's wrong with them. It's so well entrenched, and they all want it that way, but I'm not sure that I can change it. But on the other hand, this family that I'm seeing at the hospital, which is just a couple, the one that walked out and the woman decided to get a divorce, some things that I said actually worked. I mean at least they worked for the next week because they came in very happy Monday, and I felt so good (laughter). It was the first progress that I've made in a long time. And somehow if the learning can be related to something, to actually being able to do something, than I feel OK and I feel some things are worthwhile. And I really feel like a very good person, a very whole, coping kind of person ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like a person who, well ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: When something like that's going on. And then I just come home and face me or whoever the person is at home, and I don't like her at all. And part of it is that I've made home such a prison I think, and I have gotten it to the point where there not being anything [interesting there] (ph). I told my boyfriend the other day that we were talking that, we finally got down to asking each other what we wanted each other to be, to do, which I was amazed at and ... [20:52]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Amazed that you got to the point of being able to ask a question like that you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was amazed that he accepted it. That he went along with it or was - I don't even remember who broached it, but I think he did. Trying to (inaudible at 21:03) with the implication that he actually felt that there was some hope for some change, which is what I'd been telling him all along that there either had to be some change. And I thought there was some hope for change, or else we had to quit. And anyway sort of indicating that we just sort of had to be more comfortable and just more happy together in just being able to be happy with what's going on in life.</p>

<p>And I mean like at that time the sun was setting, and I said - I told him like I really have forgotten how to appreciate sunsets, which is really terrible; I seriously forgotten how to appreciate anything. It's almost [like I don't] (ph) appreciate the kittens. (Inaudible at 21:53) drudgery, and God I don't want to be that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that's something really horrifying about feeling resentful of those little, little balls of fur.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah there really is, and I mean somehow when I got my cat last year who was much worse as far - like I still have three kittens in my room, I keep them pretty much caged up but they keep getting out - but she was much worse as far as - she larger, she much harder to house break. And these kittens for the most part are like going on the paper when we do let them out, or they have managed to s**t on my bed everyday that I haven't been home. Just one of them, I haven't figured out which one it is yet. [22:49]</p>

<p>And my cat did it last year, ten times worse than their doing it now. I had to - my bed is just a mattress on the floor, and I had to pick it up everyday after work and stand it against the wall. And I don't want to have to do that with these kittens if I can help it, but I mean last year somehow even though it was a lot worse I was able to laugh at it, and I haven't been this year. I haven't gotten really upset about it, but I mean there's a whole attitude that I need to get back I guess. And that really bothers me when I don't have it. </p>

<p>I sort of get (ph) of where I am or where I'm going, to really better be going someplace or being something. And somehow every time I do feel good, like last night I was exhausted when I got home from work. I had talked to my boyfriend for a long time, and I've falling asleep after a little dinner or something, and I just felt really good. And I felt really independent and very free, and I felt like I could go to bed. And I could get up early this morning, and I could do lots of good things. And somehow by, it seems like at midnight when I felt this way, and I decided I'd just read a little while, so I read for about a half hour. By the time I got through reading, I had the most horrible stomach ach. I had a sore throat. I couldn't begin to go to sleep because I just felt really, really lousy. [25:06]</p>

<p>I ended up like staying up until four or something like that, which really ruined today. Oh I know what happened, I ended up I guess trying to go to sleep, and I ended up thinking about my mother again in really a bad way. I mean she was - that somehow ended up getting me upset and sort of exacerbating the stomach ache, which I felt like I was reading too much, but it wasn't just that. It was just really tension (ph), which I wasn't really ready [to think] (ph). I felt really good. </p>

<p>And basically like I was just thinking I couldn't remember what I was thinking about last night, but the one thing is just - it's the fact of doing that, of like thinking about things just because I'm supposedly going to bed, going to sleep. And having to really get me completely upset, which is what I do. And I really don't know how to stop those thoughts, and it doesn't matter whether I'm alone or whether my boyfriend's there. It's usually a really miserable time even though I can feel beautiful a half hour before. Like everything just sort of, I mean, a part of it I guess is it's nice setting down barriers and relaxing to go to sleep except somehow ... [26:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In all that (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I get to sleep, it all comes in before I start dreaming. I mean I wish it would wait. But anyway last night, I just - I was thinking about all this, I don't know, it was just all sorts of images that kept coming to me. Basically my point being that I wanted her so much to be still alive, that I wanted a second chance to try to go back home and to - I was really, I was thinking as if she were still alive and what I could do. It was like fantasizing what I should be doing, and I almost had to hit myself and say, "You can't do that anymore." I mean it can't be done no matter how much you fantasize about what you could do, and how in fact I could keep her alive. And I could get her through what she was going through. And I could have convinced her she was a worthwhile person, that there was something good to live for. But that I had to be there to do it, which I wasn't.</p>

<p>I just sort of let her find it though on her own, and killed herself on her own. And somehow that feeling of just not being able to do anything, it was just really impalpable. I mean that's, I think that's when I got up and started reading or something like that because I really - I was just getting more and more upset the more I was thinking about it. And I mean from the time she died, everyone would tell me, you know, don't blame yourself, and you did all you could do, and all that nice kind of stuff. But - and to a certain extent, I have to feel that way, but I don't believe it. [29:10]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it was something like when you were telling about that, was that - was that like a frame of mind that you sometimes get in or into about what happened, or is it more like that's kind of the final way you've been looking at it so that's kind of where you are know with it, that ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think probably it's a way that I'm just now letting myself admit to. It's a way that I couldn't admit to. So it came to some (ph), couple of months ago, it wasn't - it was like something I wouldn't even let myself think about before. I wouldn't let myself think about a whole lot of the real situation of what our relationship really is because it's always been too futile for me or to overwhelming for me to deal with. I mean I've been running from it ever since I was kid because I could not meet her demands, but I ran an [hour away] (ph). I ran in a very unkind, ungrateful, un-everything way; hard way. And I mean I got a lot of anger towards her also, but and I know that I'm justified in having a lot of it because she's really f**ked me up in a lot of ways, but it wasn't her fault because there was my fault in letting myself get f**ked up that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it sounds like then this is a whole or the beginning of a whole aspect that I thought you were saying that you're just know beginning to let it in, and I guess it sounded to me like it's kind of a slow and painful process of going over it in this way. I don't mean going, illuminating ... [31:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you haven't - but you haven't been able to let yourself be open to it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's very true. I mean I really just not thought about it as much as I could, I mean, except as an objective fact. But, I mean, just a few nights ago, the time that my boyfriend was over, I was just sitting paying bills or something. I really - I got so I couldn't read anything that had her name on it. Not that had her name on it, but that had her signature on it; anything that she'd written. And I was just, I was going through letters, and there were two letters from her to me last November. And I wasn't trying to read them. I managed to read like about two lines before I could put them in the envelopes again, and I was really a wreck. And it's like I really couldn't face them, and then I wasn't really thinking about what I was thinking about last night, I was just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Terribly, I don't know, stung by those lines or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was, well basically it was the things that - it was here being good and generous, which was the side of her that I haven't let in, in a long time. It was her being a person that would do anything in the world for me, and she was. And I think a part of last night too was I was reading out of my escape novel, Graham Greene's Travels with my Aunt, and I mean it really made me feel good in that I really wanted to travel and to do a lot of things that the old woman in there had done and was doing. [34:06]</p>

<p>And somehow it's like - and it mentioned how, it mentioned the cover (ph) of people in there that just really had the wonder of life and really wanted to travel, which is the way I used to be and the way my mother was. And somehow if I had ever got out of the mess, not even a mess, the inactivity that I'm in right now and did something, somehow the only person that I - that would really be happy about it would be my mother that I could really share it with. And a good half of her would really delight in what I was doing. I mean I traveled in Europe a couple of summers ago before I came here. </p>

<p>She had a marvelous time. I mean just hung on every word that I said about everything that I did kind of. And she'd always wanted to go to Europe, and she - well she lived (ph) there, and my father had never really traveled as much as she wanted to herself. But kind of doing new things and meeting new people and stuff like that was really her life. It really - she used to [want things] (ph). And now it's gotten to the point whenever I think about doing something out of the mold that I'm in right now that really is exciting, that really is fun, the first thing that comes to me is mother would really be happy to know that I'm doing this. I mean it would somehow - it would be something that I could share with her. I couldn't have shared it with her for the last couple of years, but before that I could have. [36:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and that's like - that kind of the memory it is for me, it's been formed at a very sad or things about - I'm thinking right now about my grandfather who I used to spend time (inaudible at 36:37). He loved to travel, and every time I take a trip I just think, "Oh, dad would have loved this." [You know what I mean] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes me - it's something like OK and you're saying in the last couple of years, I wouldn't have been able to communicate with her. But it's - somehow that memory touches on that essence of what's good between you in some way or it sounds like it may have been covered over with a lot of, I don't know, bad stuff. But there's something kind of very sad about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, unfortunately, just because everything that I really am and really aspire to are values that she's given me, or that she hasn't told me but that identify. And, I don't know, that's really hard to separate out, and somehow I guess I got to become it myself; all of the things that I would like to become. Like somehow there's something, I don't know, I mean I really don't know what's in me that's kept me down for the last three years. It hasn't been all the traumatic (ph) circumstances though or there haven't, I mean, there've been a lot of really bad (inaudible at 38:12) but that's not what stirs up that (ph). [38:15]</p>

<p>It's in something in me that's been afraid to move, and it's been afraid to take any steps in any direction whatsoever. And it's the other half of me that can't stand the position I've put myself in that sees no hope of change. That is constantly wanting to kill herself, to hurt myself or whatever. To really just punish myself for sitting here doing nothing because like the side of me that's wants to sit here and do nothing doesn't even have the strength (chuckle) to try kill myself. I mean it's not worth it. </p>

<p>But the other half of me is just really anger at it. And at the same time it's these, it's like some kind of, I don't know, like the only image I can think of is like maybe some kind of a conscious within a person that has no substance itself, expect feelings. And it's the person or the material part of the person that has to go out and do the things that the immaterial part wants. And if it doesn't do it, the immaterial part cannot do anything actually to make it - to make the other half a whole or power the body to do anything. And it's like it really has no means at its disposal. I guess the way I'm feeling right now. [40:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except to despise the one that suppresses, sits there and like I got something [stuck there] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it despises that part that sits there, but the part that sits there somehow is so insipid that it doesn't have any relations to anything. And the part that wants to do something doesn't know how to begin to tell the insipid part how to go about doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop in a couple of minutes. This is the last session of our 20 sessions which ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And that means that Cam Dierdrick will be calling you for the further (ph) sessions [that I was telling you about] (ph). I still don't know where I am, but I must leave it if you still want to continue. I mean I could give you call on the 24th of May and let you know where I am if that's OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

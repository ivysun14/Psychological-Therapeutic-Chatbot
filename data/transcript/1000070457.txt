<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: This is either the end of the immediately preceding interview or it is actually the eighth interview with Client 0623016 and the preceding interview belongs to some other client not in the research. Identity must be established later, but before rating of the EXP variable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were talking mainly about how you can orient a male or a female to (inaudible 00:45) it was pretty interesting. I haven't been to college for a long time so it was pretty interesting. I learned a few things outside a term, you know? I might go back and finish it off. </p>

<p>Strange things have been happening. One of the reasons I went to the psychology class is because of my sister. I don't know if you've ever heard of anything...like we don't even know. But something...I don't know...kind of psychosomatic is happening with her.</p>

<p>She has this...I don't know...she's had this inner ear problem for a while. But she was out in San Francisco, she wasn't doing anything and she was alone for eight months. She was with her husband and he was working, but she wasn't really doing anything. And her husband's family is kind of neurotic anyway. She supposedly had been talking herself into all these sicknesses and illnesses. </p>

<p>She's gone to a couple of doctors and one doctor suggested that it might be psychosomatic or something. She said it stemmed from family problems and she won't say anything else. I don't know. It was pretty interesting to me because she asked me all about therapy. I think she was thinking of going to a psychiatrist or psychoanalyst.</p>

<p>I think she wanted to go to a psychiatrist. I think she has more confidence in them. But from what I knew about what was happening, I said, "Maybe therapy would be better for you." [02:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel is kind of happening with her now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if...you see, she dropped out of college to go to San Francisco. My dad was really mad about it...that she stopped and everything, so I think maybe it's because she's starting up again in another school. I think something is fighting with that, but I'm not really sure. But it's really an interesting problem. But she won't say anything more than it's a family problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's pretty troubled.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you went with her today then...helped her out a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to see. Like she gets these really dizzy spells in the afternoon and everything. I just thought if I went with her, I could see what was happening.</p>

<p>It really got me the other night. Like I told you, she was talking about...she wanted to know all about therapy and stuff. It was kind of funny because I tried to tell her...because after Adrian was born, what I was doing...I had a lot of time and I began thinking about things. I said, "My problem is sort of mental," but I think hers kind of turned toward the physical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like she has travelled the same way, except that it expresses itself (inaudible 03:56). Are you concerned about her or just more or less curious?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm both. It's just like...I don't know...she always kind of surprises me because you think she's very callous about things and she's taking this whole thing very hard. I guess maybe she needs more attention than she pretends to need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She always looked like she was stronger than you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or she didn't care about things. If somebody did something...no big deal, but maybe deep down she really was the complete opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like now that she's troubled, she's leaning on you a little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess maybe it's more my fault. I think I've just been seeing people in a funny way. I don't know if it's me or them, but they...everybody just seems so...like they're falling apart. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>Like, my girlfriend, the one who recommended me to therapy, she just...when I go and see her and everything, I talk to her...she just doesn't...it feels like any minute she's going to have a nervous breakdown or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's really having to hang on (inaudible 05:22) the whole time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She keeps saying things like she's okay and she knows that she's functioning 100 percent and that she's above average as a person and all this. When I see her and when I talk to her, it's like every...she's just falling apart as a person. I don't know. Maybe it's me...the way I relate to her or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems like all the people around you are really struggling to hang on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know. Maybe it's just the way I see it. Maybe it's not really happening...like I'm not sure about it, you know? She goes to therapy sessions here, too, and she kind of recommended the whole program to me. She was telling me it was really...first of all, I think... as a person, I don't think she sees herself all that realistically. </p>

<p>But anyway, let me tell you. She said she was screaming and yelling at her therapist and everything. In a way, we were talking about how we related to our therapists and stuff. And she said that she related to her therapist as a close friend. I guess they're about the same age anyway and she wanted to relate that way. I said, "I think that I relate to my therapist as a therapist-to-client or whatever you want to call it." I said that I prefer it that way for certain reasons because I thought if I got too close, I don't think it would be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 07:01)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think I would improve or just be able to, I guess, see things as they really are. I know there are friends, but maybe I need the authoritarian-type figure out there...somebody who knows more than I do.</p>

<p>It was interesting because my girlfriend said that she saw her therapist sitting there and then first of all, after they became friends, first of all, she saw her as this big authority figure. But now she realizes that her therapist is a girl like she is and they have a lot of things in common, but her therapist knows more than she does about psychology and that type of thing. And she's a girl who doesn't like it for some reason. She's now in a position where she's competing with her therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like she doesn't really want her to tell her anything or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. I don't know. She said she felt very hostile, maybe, to the therapist. She thought the therapist was making her feel that way, too...where she was the client and she didn't know as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was sort of making her feel like she really didn't know enough to know what to do with her own life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't think her therapist was doing it to be mean or downright nasty. I think it was just the feelings that my friend had because she's a psychology major, too. Like I said, every once in a while, she'll come out and tell me what happened in her session. Like I said, she screamed at her therapist or she cried and everything like that at one time. I think I said, "I think maybe you need a new therapist or something like that." [08:58]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really so different from the way that you would want yours to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. First of all, I didn't want it to be where I'd be competing with my therapist because, like, I think it's defeating the whole purpose of me coming. I don't know. I think she just treats everybody that way, though. (coughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should I get you a glass of water?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would you (inaudible 09:29)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 09:32) Let me see what I can do.</p>

<p>(09:37 - 10:49 counselor leaves and returns)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks. It's like one of those things that you can't fight like your stomach growling.</p>

<p>So anyway, like I said, I just (inaudible 11:19)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like there are more sides to them than you could see before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I kind of get scared, though, when bad things happen to them or they appear like something has really changed. I guess it goes back to the thing that I didn't want people to change. I just want them to be (inaudible 11:43).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like being afraid that if they change too much, everything around you will just go crashing down. You won't be able to count on them to be out there anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I guess it...well, with my sister, like I don't want to see anything bad happen to her. Like, I don't want to see her get really sick because she's really close to me. </p>

<p>I don't know. My girlfriend is just...I valued her as a friend for so long. She was a roommate of mine awhile ago. I don't know. She has changed so fast that she really can't handle it and I don't think she knows it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like if she changes too fast then she'll be out of control or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just...I just see her kind of as a...I mean like say somebody who's taking drugs like heroin for example. You know how their face becomes really drawn and just really sickly and everything. Like even her appearance has become that way to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think she's really suffering (inaudible 13:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. A lot of times, I think she brings it on herself in a way. I'm just beginning to think that the way we are, everything that we do or just everything we say...anything like that...it's all because of our parents. I really believe that. </p>

<p>When I look at the situations and the incidences and the things that have happened with her and her parents, I think in a way it's kind of (inaudible 13:40) because she has just lost her sense of balance. I don't think she really knows herself or what to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like they've fixed it so she just has no mind of her own anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she has a very strong mind of her own, but I don't know if it's really her mind because she always says to me that she wants to do one thing and she wants her life to be like a certain way. And everything... her reaction and everything like that is the complete opposite and she can't really control it deep down, although outwardly, she's a very strong person. I don't know. Maybe it's a mental-type thing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like even though she wants to do one thing, she always does what her parents would want her to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In this case, it's not what her parents...it's the...I guess it would be the exact opposite of what her parents would want her to do in a way. But because of the things that happened to her when she was younger, it just turned out that she does them this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you can't get together what you want to do and what you do, do as long as you have a really strong pressure on you from your parents.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like you know what I'd like to learn more about? I'm not saying that she's insane or anything, but I don't know...she has something that...in her mind that kind of makes her mentally a little...I don't even want to say "abnormal." But something in her mind that makes her not normal. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>I don't know if you can call it insanity or something, but somewhere in there, there's kind of an imbalance or something. Like myself, I don't think like I'm insane in a sense...like psychotic or anything like that. I may be hung up or really neurotic or something like that, but like I know that I'm not really crazy in the kind of way she is, you know? [15:49]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really a difference...some of the things that she feels that you just can't relate to anymore. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And like little by little, I'm beginning to realize that in her situation and other people's situations that sort of...they're not really responsible for what they do because there is this thing in their mind...this imbalance and they really can't control it kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's what makes them do things even if they don't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Before, I could never accept it. I just thought it was the person like trying to be mean or something or doing it that way, but now I'm kind of beginning to realize that they really can't help it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Everybody has that experience, I think, sometimes more or less... some feeling like you just can't help doing something even though you know you shouldn't or you know that it isn't the best thing or it isn't even what you need. And then sometimes, if you see somebody doing that (inaudible 16:55) you start to wonder about yourself because you know you have that same problem sometimes. But all you can see is that they do it more. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Today in the psychology class...you know I said I was really getting interested in it and you probably know because you're a psychology major, but they were talking about id, ego and super-ego. I guess the id is the person...the party that's demanding, that just wants everything on the spot...that type of thing. </p>

<p>I was kind of wondering like where...how an insane person...what part of the id or super-ego or ego or whatever...what part of the insane person would stand out more or which of those three things would control the insane person. I think it might be the id. Do you think that's true?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes, it is. It's sort of like...what happens is that those things aren't really in balance somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are in balance, you say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're just not balanced right because everybody has all three of those parts in them. It's that (inaudible 18:08) And I guess it's just a question of working things out so that you can do the things you want to do...that your id is asking for...without losing control from your ego and your super-ego.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If say a person was... I don't know...kind of insane or something or whatever, would the...like the id be in control ever since childhood or like would it happen all of a sudden?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of varies a lot. People don't usually change all that fast as a rule.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it would be something that was building up ever since they were little?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not necessarily. For some people, it seems like they can trace all their problems as adults to things that happened in their childhood. I guess for most people it seems like they can trace it. But it may be that it doesn't really bother them until they get older, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like sometimes, bad things could happen when you were a kid, but you could be a well-adjusted kid. And then when you have to be an adult, then they become problematic, where they weren't a problem before. That's why most people have a really hard time when they get out of late adolescence into their early 20s because it's a whole different kind of thing to be a happy adult from being a happy kid. You have to be on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And more people kind of freak out when they've got to live (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a hard time. It's a hard transition to make to be an adult and being responsible for yourself and not just obedient or something to someone else...learning how to rely on yourself, sorting out what you can trust in yourself and what you can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just...I don't know, I just keep thinking. I'm trying to apply it to the different people around me and stuff. I don't know. In my psychology class today, I was really thinking about Adrian and if I made certain plans to do things so he would turn out one way, would it be okay, or what if I just let it go along as it is? [20:50]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of plans were you thinking of making?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well today, he talked mostly like about well, sex. I guess he was talking mostly about girls, but I could...even my girlfriend has told me that Adrian would turn out to be a homosexual because he was just raised by a mother and there was no father-figure around and all this type of thing. I guess it...I told her at first...I said, "You're crazy," but then when somebody says something like that, you start thinking about it. And so I guess I was kind of thinking today, what could I do to make sure that Adrian turned out to be a normal male...that type of thing.</p>

<p>And I really...I really didn't know. I came to all these goofy conclusions in my mind and stuff, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that I'd never let him try on any of my clothes. It was really stupid stuff. Or I wouldn't let him play with my purse and things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard not to worry about that, I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I guess I'd think about it anyway if somebody hadn't said that statement to me. But I have another friend whose dad died when he was really young. I don't even think he knew him. And he was raised by his mom. He turned out pretty well-adjusted and everything. I mean as far as...I guess...I don't know...he's a conscientious objector. I mean, I don't think he's perverted or...he's going into the priesthood or something like that. So he's 27 and he's still a virgin and everything. But he seems to be well-adjusted in responses to men and women and stuff like that. So then again, I realize I think it's just the person's environment and the mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That puts a little burden on you in a way. [23:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I guess. But I don't know. I don't want to go out of my way to...at least I don't think I want to go out of my way to make sure that he doesn't try on my clothes or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really seems silly to you now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but like so many absurd things really happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. You know like movies or stories that you see. You know how like when kids play a younger role and they play grownup, I mean, they try on their parents' clothes, get all dressed up and that type of thing. And I have all these thoughts and like I'm the only one around or something and Adrian really does...he wants to try on makeup and all that type of thing. </p>

<p>I don't know. It's kind of...it's weird because in a sense, everybody that meets Adrian and talks to me says that Adrian is all boy. Like he's crazy about trucks and that type of thing. He won't even touch a little doll or something like that. But I just think something could twist or float (ph) (inaudible 24:26)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like so far, he's alright. You're afraid someday, though, he'll just change or something and he'll learn to be just like you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess sometimes, I think about it, but I think everything will turn out okay. But it's just these spots that I've been thinking about. It's kind of strange. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what your mother did [in return] (ph) that got you so angry with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think at the time, I was just kind of being super-conscious about being kind of liberal with him and everything. I don't know, like now, sometimes, if he wakes up in the middle of the night and he won't fall asleep right away, I put him into my bed with me and everything and he'll go to sleep. But as soon as we move, like I know I've got to break him of doing that. He'll have his own bedroom when we move and he'll stay in his crib or else cry it out for a couple of hours. [25:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems that you're really afraid that he's going to get too attached to you and that somehow that'll warp him and he'll end up being just like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He is really attached to me now. It's very kind of unbearable for me because he always wants to be around me. And if I just pick up a magazine or I want to write something, he gets really upset and he'll come over and push it away and want to sit on my lap. Or if I hold...touch someone's arm or something like that, or put my arm around someone like my parents, my sisters or anybody like that, he comes over and he pushes...he takes my arm away from them and he'll put my arm around him. It's cute, but I know it's kind of bad, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really afraid it means there's something wrong with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not wrong with him, but I just think he's just being...becoming really attached to me and that he should just...I don't know...realize that I can...I guess he's kind of young. But there are other people around for them and for him and for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just that... part of it is just so you wouldn't be so tied down by him or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old is he anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's just a little over a year. He'll be 13 months on Saturday. [26:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All that I know about that is that kids are supposed to be very heavily attached to their mothers at about one year to almost three years. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've been reading as many books like Dr. Spock and all that type of thing and I know they're supposed to be, but like I can't help wondering if it's really all that all right because his dad isn't around all the time, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's really sort of like every time he does something that's confusing, you're always going to have to wonder whether another kid who had his dad around would do it, too, or something. But I think the hardest thing for a kid at that age is if he doesn't get to attach himself like that because it's a normal stage and then they outgrow it after. And the only way that it gets messed up is if they aren't allowed to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Because that's just a thing they go through. They're very attached from about one to two-and-a-half. They want to be there all the time. And then if you let them, then they feel really secure. Then they'll move out of it normally at two-and-a-half or so. But if you keep pushing them away, then they just need it more and more and more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't really pushing him away, but like sometimes it annoys me because I just feel like I want to be free and alone for a few minutes, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I can really understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But since I have to take him all the way down the stairs when I get my mail and things like that, it's difficult (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's really hard to have a little kid and not really have any time to yourself. It's really a hard job being a mother. [28:39] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I'm getting up at like 6:30 and 7:00 lately. He'll come over and I'll have one eye open and he'll try and open the other one and everything. He scrapes the whole side of my face here [that's why it looks red] (ph).</p>

<p>Like I was reading that they say that a parent is supposed to get away at least once a week to be by themselves from their kid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a whole lot easier if you can off on your own every now and then. It's a pretty overwhelming job to have to be on every waking hour like that. That's the really hard part about not having a spouse around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well like even when Robert is around, Adrian always...he still wants to be near me and everything. And I don't know if it's because he doesn't know Robert or he just doesn't get along or can't communicate in his way. But it's doubly frustrating because there is someone there doing something with him and baby still wants to be with me and everything. Robert feels frustrated because he doesn't think the baby likes him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard for you to see a way of this [is the way it sounds.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I take a shower or something and Adrian sits there crying and everything. I don't like to see him cry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really want him to be happy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's so nice, like for his birthday, somebody gave me some presents late for him. They gave them to me in the evening and he had already gone to sleep. So I gave them to him the next morning and he saw these big packages and I kind of showed him that they were for him. He was so happy and excited. It was so cute. He was trying to talk, but he makes sounds now. He looks up and everything.</p>

<p>I took him into the living room and he was rushing along. He couldn't wait to get at them. And he was kind of moaning as I was moving them to the next room and everything, but it was just the cutest thing...he was so happy. I really loved that moment. It was really cute. It was like Santa Claus had come during the night or something. [31:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really could feel like you'd given him something beautiful then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Especially, I just like to see the smile on his face. He was really excited. I don't think I've ever seen him that excited.</p>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My throat is so sore. It feels like sandpaper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were talking about...thinking about taking away some those toys and stuff and making sure he always plays with trucks. And I was sort of thinking as you were talking about something you told me about your own childhood...that you were always encouraged to do girl things or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really can't remember too much about it, but I think because there were so many girls that we probably did. Like my mother is very feminine. She always likes the house clean type of thing...that type of thing.</p>

<p>But the only toy I ever really didn't let Adrian have was a gun, I think, because it was an old, dirty one anyway. My mother had found it. Usually I let him look at most things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really...the way you believe in that is to let him do his thing, but I guess you have a certain amount of pressure from your mother's ideas about restricting him to boy things and being worried if he does girl things and stuff. You have to keep sort of reminding yourself to let him do his thing. [33:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The pressure or the trouble comes in when she says things like, "Adrian, you can't play with a little doll because you're a boy," and stuff. I mean, at least he could look at it. </p>

<p>If there's nothing harmful...he just had a lead-screening test where they drew blood from his arm and they asked if he had ever...if I had ever seen him chewing or sucking on any things. There were some things in there you'd never suspect of having lead in them because of maybe dye or something like that. I don't know. I think sometimes my mom forgets or she doesn't really know for sure.</p>

<p>It was funny. He had the needle in his arm when he had blood drawn and it didn't hurt him when the needle went in and I guess it had to stay in...it seemed like about five minutes or something. But I didn't realize that the baby's veins are much smaller than adults' and everything and like the blood trickles through maybe two or three drops at a time. And like Adrian was getting nervous because there was this thing sticking in his arm and like it was pulling up his skin. It really looked horrible to me. I thought I was going to faint.</p>

<p>And he was starting to cry and get...he was getting really nervous and wiggling a lot and he didn't like it. And I said, "Can't you take it out?" And she said, "No. We don't have enough blood yet." So then he did start crying and I was getting really upset and I said, "Can't you take it out?" again and she said, "No." Finally, then everything was okay.</p>

<p>But it was strange. They put a bandage on and I think for the next couple of days, he kept looking at his arm. And after the bandage was off, he saw it was kind of black and blue and everything. He kept looking at his arm. And it was the first time that I've ever seen him remember anything or know about something that has happened before. And it just kind of got me. I mean, it was traumatic for him in a way. But even now, he pulls up his shirt and he looks at his arm. [35:21]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like he's making sure it's alright, I assume.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He remembered. I was just kind of thinking would that have some kind of some kind of reaction on him or do something to his mind a couple of years from now or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really worry a lot about his having some kind of bad experience now that's really going to suddenly crop up later and mess him up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for some reason...I don't know why. I can't explain it. I think maybe why...I guess because I feel a lot of guilt about him and everything because like I was thinking about giving him away and all that type of thing. And like I just feel like he's so beautiful and perfect and everything and it all turned out well in the hospital. I really didn't deserve it because I was so stupid about things beforehand. And I just feel like something is going to happen. I don't know when or something because I was like that. I really didn't appreciate everything that happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like because you were thinking of not keeping him, almost like you're not sure that you deserve him now or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because like it wasn't...I don't know...it was kind of like two levels of wanting him or something. I don't know if you'll understand what I mean. Like a part of me wanted him...like I guess maybe the mother part or the part that loved Robert or something. And then another part of me didn't...like the part that wanted to be free and still go out and do things and have fun like that.</p>

<p>And I don't know. I just kind of feel guilty at times about that because at times, I really wanted him, but other times, I didn't want to be a mother or anything like that. [37:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like in a way you always wanted him, except part of you kept saying that it would just be too much of a burden or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I really didn't know at the time how much of a burden it would be. The burden would be the part about not being free, you know? But I think my mind was made up for me actually when I was in the hospital and I had the caesarean section because it's stupid when you have that, you can only have three children in all when you have a caesarean section. So part of...well, I had already made up my mind before that. </p>

<p>I guess you know when I went in, that I really wanted to keep the baby and stuff, but after I had the caesarean, my mind was kind of made up for me because it would be really stupid of me to give a baby away like when I could only have two more and everything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of became more precious or something (inaudible 38:18)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, I had to keep him in a way. I wanted to and everything. And like I kind of was talking to myself and to God or whoever and I said, "I kind of understand." Like after having the baby in your stomach nine months and carrying it and all of that type of thing, I kind of realized what it was then, even before I saw him...just when I heard him cry in the operating room.</p>

<p>But, I don't know. Now, I just...I don't know. My mind is still separated on the fact that I believe women should be allowed to have abortions. Because maybe...I don't know...maybe I know what it is to have a baby in your stomach and that type of thing. But I still think that women should be allowed to have abortions. I don't know. Maybe I might have had one if it had been legal and all that type of thing and if I had known more.</p>

<p>Maybe I wouldn't have even had a baby if I had known more about contraception and stuff, but anyway... [39:21] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard when you're young to know what the best thing is to do. Then it's sort of like you made your decision and it turned out so well for you in so many ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, like it was kind of just decided and everything. Like now, I keep thinking if I had given Adrian away and he was with an adopted family or something. He's really just a beautiful little boy and everything, you know? I really don't think I would have done that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like being afraid every time you enjoy him or look at him and he's so beautiful, that the hand of God is going to reach down and pluck him away because you weren't always sure. I guess even now sometimes, you must have moments when you're not sure and are just really being afraid of getting punished for your unsureness. It makes it hard to enjoy him when he's at his best.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I don't know...like I have this feeling that for some reason...I don't know...maybe it's because I've been taught you don't get something for nothing. I just feel this feeling that good things just don't happen, I mean, and that's it. I think like there's...to follow bad there's good, but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're going to have to get punished with something to get...to make it even.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much punished, yeah, but something that would make enough joy and sorrow to make it all even.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must make it hard when you're enjoying him because then you're always sort of adding up all the bad things that are going to happen to get you (inaudible 40:56)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think about it so much when I'm really enjoying him at the precise moment. But when I start thinking about things...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's probably hardest when you're thinking that...any kind of unsureness or remembering any unsureness and then you really must worry about something bad happening or something when you feel guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If something...he does something, I yell at him or I mean like that type of thing. I just...I feel bad because I've done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess probably you feel bad because it's sort of a moment when you're not really loving him at your most. And that's that unsureness that you feel guilty about. [41:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I think I have a distortion of the whole thing in a way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Having Adrian and not having his father around. I guess what I said before...not really knowing if I'm doing something or something is happening because of me or because of outside things or something else that will happen. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like even though you do what you think is right, you're never sure if it would be like that under other conditions or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there are just a number of things influencing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like every time anything goes wrong, it's sort of like you really start blaming yourself a lot or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not every time because sometimes, I know I'm doing things right. It's just every once in a while, something happens to me and I think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's hard to know that you're doing the thing anybody else would do even with a father around or something. It's hard to know that he's coming out the same way he would with a father around. [43:05]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's the thing I think I think about most. How much influence, say, would Robert have? But like you said before, I realize that...I think with babies up to about a year or two years old that their mother is their greatest influence on them. But I still wonder how Adrian would just be if Robert were around all the time...if he would even be closer to Robert and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What...if he were closer to him or how it would be? Well, I guess it would be okay with me. I mean...I don't know. I think I'd like to have Adrian know and like as many people as possible. I think it would be good for him just to meet a number of different people and to know them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of makes it less demanding on you in a way, too, if you don't have to be his whole world for him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 44:02) I don't...I think as much as you say about mother being the main person that the baby wants the first years, it's still hard for me to accept it because I just feel like my freedom is really down to this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like being trapped a long time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think it would be the same way with anybody. (inaudible 44:30)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess every time you have one of those difficult feelings or painful feelings about motherhood, it just gets sort of doubly hard because you always wonder if it would have been the same way if you'd married his father or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's just...I guess as far as time goes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I imagine all kinds of women feel like they're trapped in a little box with a one-year-old child. But then they wouldn't be wondering, I suppose, what you're wondering. That makes it harder for you, I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's hard. Like I just said when I think about it, that's the main thing (inaudible 45:16) (coughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course, when there are rough edges, you're going to be thinking about it. When everything is just swimming along, you don't think about it so much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think...like the last time Robert was in...I think I'm kind of resenting him because he wasn't giving as much to Adrian as I was as far as just feeding him or changing him. (coughs) But again, this is the situation, whether mothers are supposed to do this and fathers aren't or if it's because Robert is not around most of the time normally. [46:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like that in a way, you wish there were some guidance from somewhere about how it usually goes and how it's supposed to be so that you wouldn't always be wondering whether it would be different or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because like I told you, I've been reading knowledge (ph) books, but some...for some...for obvious reasons, I don't really believe it and trust it, like I said, because his father is not around and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like you're sure in a way that it must be making some basic difference in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like even though it may not. But for some reason, I feel that way because I guess I think of a family as a father and mother and a baby. I think a lot of women raise their kids without fathers and it's no big deal, I guess. But for some reason, it's bothering me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's really hard for you to imagine what a family without a father would be like. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like, even now, they're letting single people adopt babies...like if it's a single man or a single woman. I guess I should just be grateful that Adrian is okay and everything. But it seems like I just want more. [47:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just want more...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like the family-type thing is what...two parents and a kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like in a way, to turn that just a bit, like you're really grateful to have such a nice kid and everything, but it's not really enough for you either, to just have a nice kid. You sort of need a husband around, too, to go with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know...not so much the husband...it's like the father role because I don't know...I think I just want to make everything as good as possible for Adrian with his father and everything.</p>

<p>I think I am really thinking more of Adrian in this case because...I don't know...I guess maybe with a husband or just say, calling it "a husband and a baby," I just feel less free. But like if I said "a father for Adrian," and everything, it just (inaudible 48:31), I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really just sort of like everything would be easier if there was not just you and the baby, but a man who was there, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I think it would be. Like I don't know for sure, but I think it would be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess that word, "husband," really turns you off a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't turn me off, but like...I don't know...maybe it's Robert as the husband or something. I don't know. Maybe it is the "husband." I don't know. Because I keep thinking of...just lately, I really...I hate being like just...I don't know...a housewife or just keeping the house clean and everything. I really hate it. It's not anything great or fulfilling or anything like that. And I always thought it would be. </p>

<p>I always said to these women...I said, "God! What could be more creative than setting up a house, all the rooms and cooking really nice meals and everything like that? You're just putting all your creativity into the meal and just doing all these exotic things and stuff," and it's really a drag. [That's coming down to it.] (ph)</p>

<p>So I don't know...maybe using the word "husband," everything just makes everything...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like being trapped as a housewife. [49:46] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But like a father for Adrian, I think, it just...it kind of centers more around Adrian and I don't know...I just...I don't know...maybe it seems more like a companion, then, for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And less like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Less like just...I don't know...just...well, I guess when I think of "husband" and everything, I keep seeing all these family situations that are unhappy and everything. It's beginning...it really is...a husband and that whole type thing is really beginning to seem bad to me and just brings unhappy connotations. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like when you imagine sort of the ideal world for yourself, it's you, it's Adrian and his father, who Adrian is really close to; who's like a friend for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like my companion or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess that father is somebody who doesn't make you have to be a housewife and stay home and cook and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe it's just when I talk about it or something that it really bugs me. If I was just doing it and nobody said anything about it, I could...I'd be able to do it and accept it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like making the meals and taking care of someone. I don't think it would bother me then. But for some reason, when I talk about it now, I (inaudible 51:23)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like in a way you always thought it would be so neat and now you don't think it's neat at all. But you're saying you could adjust to it and it wouldn't be so awful, but it sure wouldn't be terrific or great or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, like, I keep wanting the relationship between me and the man to be...I don't know...more exciting than just a husband and wife keeping house and taking care of their kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the main point about a husband? Is it that it means there's nothing happening between you and him emotionally?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Well just from everything that's happened to me lately, I'm like relating to Robert, but I just...I don't feel like I'm doing as much like with myself with him. You know what I mean? I just feel like I'm fulfilling...like cooking the meals for him and that's the only part I'm relating to him. </p>

<p>Like with other people, I can...like, I...all these other parts are coming out, but of course, I cook meals or take care of the house. I'd just like to get part in somewhere where they all fit together. I guess everybody is kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like wanting to be able to be yourself with all your sides with somebody. And when you think about husbands, what you imagine turns you off, but it sounds to me...it's like the husband for you is somebody who makes it impossible for you to be most of your sides...just the main side or something. [53:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. I don't know...I've just seen so many situations where it is or just a wreck (ph). I think everybody has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there are a lot of situations where it's like that. Some people find other ways to do it, too...with luck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Like with the other ways I've seen, it just doesn't seem...I haven't seen that many, actually. I think I've seen very few, as a matter of fact. But it just doesn't...it kind of seems unreal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like...I don't know...something is wrong somewhere. It's not going to last or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like it's too hard to be true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, what I think is...like I've been conditioned so much into...to expect certain things. To be the way they are, you want certain words, "husband," that type of thing. And yet I keep putting all these different labels on things and yet I...I don't know...I don't really want to, but it just happens and I can't really live my life. You know what I mean? Doing it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you really want to get free of thinking things will always be the way you've always known them to be. It's really hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I'm kind of living the way...that way now without putting all that many labels on it, or at least I feel I enjoy living without the labels. But like it always creeps back again that I do. I end up...I, myself, end up putting the labels on things and I don't really like it. [54:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think the point about the labels is sort of like when you apply a label, it's sort of like making your life into the way you've always seen lives be or something? It's sort of like snapping back to what you're used to or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of, but like everything that has happened to me...I was really...I don't know...it just happened. It wasn't really planned or I didn't say I want to do this certain thing or live this certain way. It always ended up kind of by accident and just feeling highway robbed and not really knowing and not being able to say that I'm doing such-and-such. It kind of all happened accidentally in a way.</p>

<p>And I guess a lot of times it was pretty enjoyable. But it frustrates me because I'd like to know...I'd like to be able to control what I'm going to do and to do it and to enjoy it, too. But it just doesn't seem that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like you really wish you could look at the things that you've done on your own (inaudible 56:11) and say, "Well, look. I did that." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wanted to do it and know that I did, but it's never been that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, "I deserve credit for that and when I make a decision in the future, it's going to be my decision and I'm going to be running my own life," or something. I guess sometimes, you feel like that. </p>

<p>Other times you've been in, we've talked about Adrian. You've said that you sometimes have moments when you're really confident of the way that you've chosen. But it's still like you don't really have something you can argue back with, like, "This is my way and don't pull me back that other way," or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like certain things, you kind of feel that they're right, you know? I mean, I think it's just like a matter of knowing right and wrong, like with the baby or something. He does something, you know. I think anybody would know that it's right or wrong and that type of thing. So there's no question there, really. [57:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like it would be nice to have that kind of confident knowing that your way was your way or something, and that you had picked it and you were doing it and you were responsible for it or something. Then I guess the labels wouldn't be so powerful somehow. I guess those labels are really your parents' way of pulling at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I wouldn't mind them so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, it seems to me like that business about the husband thing is really sort of like all the husbands that you saw in your life...they really have a pull on you. It's like when you think of "husband," it's really hard not to think of it the way your dad was or something like that and to imagine it some other way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, or even the stereotype. Even today, in the psychology class, like the example they always give...or you hear so much about the middle-class husband. He loves his wife and everything and then he goes out and cheats on her sexually and stuff like that.</p>

<p>I mean, for example, the teacher...he didn't really have to use that example, but that's the one he picked and everything. That throws a bad shadow on the word, "husband," again, too, you know? At least for me, it did. Well, he could have used "wife" or something, but he picked the husband, which is, I guess, in our society and culture, that's a more obvious one to pick. But I just thought it was a bad thing to do. [59:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He put a damper on the word, "husband." He said, "Here it is." He told a story or something about the husband who went out and cheated on his wife and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just sort of fit right into your fears that husbands are really bad all the time anyway or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just did something to (inaudible 59:28)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a husband is really sort of a tyranny for you where you don't get to sort of be yourself at all and do your thing. You start getting locked in this little box with somebody else doing everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so many people, though, have done it, too. I think a lot of just...like TV has done it in all these stories. I'm sure a lot of times that they've done it in humor...good humor and stuff, but it's really getting to be something. Even Women's Liberation is coming up with these things against men and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really seems to you like it would take an enormous amount of control and stuff to be able to break out of that mold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. I don't know. It's just...I don't know...maybe I just have these...I'm just getting black feelings about love, too, because all these people that I know...they've been married three and four years and the husband or the wife will come to the other...or like my friends even...and say they don't love each other anymore. The only reason they're staying together is because of the kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me in a way when you were talking about what you used to think about housewives...you remember you were saying that you used to tell everyone about how it was the most wonderful, creative...in those days, in a way, you probably really bought that husband line.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like everybody...the first thing you do when you get out of high school and college...well, I think a lot of girls do it when they say they want to get married and have a family and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of wanted a husband, then, who would lock you in a box with your kitchen and go out and do everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, at the time because well, I didn't really know any of...I didn't really know how to cook... [1:01:37]</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: This is the end of the eighth interview with Client 0623016.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...then either. I didn't do anything. I didn't even make my bed at home and stuff like that. I don't know. I was talking about something I didn't really know about. But that was the way to do things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm thinking is that it's probably pretty hard, though, even though it hasn't been so long ago since you've thought that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's probably a couple of years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty hard to feel confident of some other kind of way of thinking of it when you've thought of it so recently. In a way, you're saying there are a lot of things that you used to believe two years ago that you don't believe anymore and that you wish you could be more confident of what you did believe. [1:02:38]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think...mostly getting back to the husband and everything...I think if I met someone or if I knew someone that I felt more of a full person with, I'd probably...I probably would want to like settle down and get into the family thing again. So I don't know. I think most people would if there was someone that they really liked and wanted to be with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you would want to go back to that sort of housewife thing again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because...I don't know...like being with a person and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like the only way you could imagine how you would be with a husband is to sort of be the way [your mother was or something] (ph) even if it was somebody you felt like a full person with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, like I keep...I keep wanting it to be more. But thinking that...I mean, in most cases, it isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true enough. But I guess the real question in here is how you would want it to be for yourself if it could be what you wanted for yourself, even if nobody else in the world ever wanted it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But do you see? This...even like this question...it's kind of like a couple of years ago when I wanted the family bit...what we were talking about [a week ago] (ph). At that time, I didn't know that then and like now, I think this might be the case again. I don't know what this other thing might be either. [1:04:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way the hardest part of the thing you're going through now is sort of like rejecting old ways and just not really being sure what the substitute is or something...wishing you could be more sure of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's like...you've heard the saying, "I know what I don't want, but I don't know what I do want." (inaudible 1:04:43)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It seems to me like it's such a short time ago that you gave up all these other ideas. There's bound to be a period where you're resettling and figuring things out and finding out what the new way of looking at things means for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just have a feeling that 20 years from now or something, I'll just go back to the way I was brought up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It really has a strong flooring. I really hear that. It's just sort of like as far away as you move, there's always this rubber band that you're yanking against, pulling you back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think my dad was like that a lot. I think he...after he had his fling or whatever in college days and stuff, he's gone back to being really conservative and kind of that way.</p>

<p>I don't know if I really want to, but I just have this feeling, or maybe it's a fear, that I'll probably go back. [1:05:44]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess there's a lot of fear in that...of just sort of reproducing your parents' lives in a way. One way or another, you're getting pulled back by the stuff that's inside you, too. Just sort of not having the strength to hold onto yours, you're finally getting yanked back into it. It makes it really important for you when you're not sure of why you're doing things the way you are. That's what gets you upset because it...I mean...they can pull harder or something [that other way.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like, I don't know. I feel kind of like I know why I said I'm moving along doing these things and I didn't know that I was going to do them, but I kind of enjoyed them anyway...more so than I would if I was living in a park anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, it's sort of like saying, well, you have some things you're pretty sure of anyway. And it gets better with time, I guess. It must be better now than two years ago. Maybe with time, you'll be able to really form some real confidence about (inaudible 1:06:50). You won't be so worrying about (telephone ringing 1:06:52)</p>

<p>(counselor responds briefly to phone call) [1:07:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does the start of the session take (inaudible 1:07:11)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, it's alright. Anyway, before I'm evicted, how does that last sound to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess it's pretty much the way things are (inaudible 1:07:25) I don't know. I'm just...I don't know...everybody...you keep talking about yourself and saying things and all this stuff, but in the end, what you are is just what you do from day to day, kind of, you know? I don't think (inaudible 1:07:45) you think about things that are...trying to change. I mean, I think we are what we are. I don't know. </p>

<p>I think I'd like to learn more about psychology, though. I was going to ask my sister if I could borrow her books. But I think I am...I'm going to try and read up on some of that stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like it's...in a way, the real issue is sort of how you get what you're thinking to have anything to do with what you do or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like...in my mind and everything, I'd like it to be the same thing because I don't think it ever (inaudible 1:08:20)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like so you could get it together so what you're thinking relates sort of...made you do what you do or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you do...are you like that...[think like that?] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm more like that than I was when I was younger. I'm sure not completely like that. It seems to me like in a way it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess you'd be...if you were, you'd be really pretty straight and sane and everything. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me like the hard part is sort of sorting out what you want and where you are and who you are. And then once you really have that clear, it gets easier to pull it together with (inaudible 1:09:12) It's hard when you aren't really sure of what you are ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I think what I told you before...it's been going away from that for me for the past couple of years anyway. It's like I came to therapy because it was getting harder and harder for me to determine things.</p>

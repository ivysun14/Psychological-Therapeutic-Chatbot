<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. (inaudible at 07:31)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, is it hot in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just (inaudible at 07:43)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you need me to turn on the air, let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 07:48)</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>We're going right after this, so. I know I shouldn't be, but Graham (sp?) called and (inaudible at 08:17) single right now and (laughter) so. I have a big decision kind of to make and David (sp?) talking about it and I wonder, like, if I could bring it up with you, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure, I can turn on the air. I'm happy to do so. Do you want me to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, sure.</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>So, I went part-time for my job in 2011 in the summer or in August to give more time to writing, and so now they want me back fulltime and I'm thinking of picking that up. I don't know if that's a wise decision. I mean, the other option is to go to school for another degree and work part-time in there. I've been finding a job there, like, writing about scientists and the grants that they get, but that's going to be a lot less money and that's just going to be, like, 15 hours a week. I mean, ideally I should do that so that I have more time to finish my book, which I'm just so—I'm scared that (pause) (laughter) giving more time to my writing and then nothing happens and then I just [be like] (ph), "Oh, I gave up such a nice job and..." (laughter).</p>

<p>So, there's too many variables right now, plus if I have my full-time job then I'll be able to pay more rent (inaudible at 10:27) a fun (ph) place with new (ph) roommates so I can live kind of a little distance away from my mom but still be in the same city, you know, and stuff. I wanted to find a place of my own but that'll just be too much rent, because I have to pay my mom rent and then my own rent—that's be too much money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You pay your mom's rent too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn't really (ph) have a job, so she doesn't really (ph) pay rent. (laughter) So that's why it's been better to live with her because, you know, then it's just like (inaudible at 11:04), you know, I want to see it as being someone else's rent (inaudible at 11:09). So I don't know, like, I've made, like, (inaudible at 11:13) and stuff as to what exactly will be the best scenario—to stay put with my mom and saving money, that way I can go to school and take that part-time job, or go to school, work full-time and live separately. I don't know which scenario will make me happier and make me more productive. (laughter) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want to help you think through it, but you started this session by saying you're going to on a trip. Graham called and you can't help but go. What does that mean? What are you hoping to get from him (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) I'm just so, like, I'm not—my heart is just not in anything right now. I am heartbroken over Victor (sp?). I mean, when I went to see Graham (inaudible at 12:14) he was, like, my first, you know, real (pause), like, intimacy and, like, seven years, you know. (laughter) So, I had a good time and it was, like, my first experience like that in so many years. So, I have good memories of that. But then I started things with Victor (sp?) (inaudible at 12:38) in a whole drama, all that. Such a messy thing, and yet I had a good time with him too and then I fell in love with him and then that ended badly, so. I guess I just want to go to be away from here and be in the city and just have, like, Graham treat me, pamper me, you know. (laughter)</p>

<p>I mean, he's not looking for a relationship and I don't love him and he doesn't love me and he's—it's just, I don't know. I guess he's looking to have sex. And last time he said, you know, "I feel like I [want to] (ph) have sex." That was after, like, two nights and I said no, because at that time I didn't know that I could do casual sex. I don't love him and I wanted my first time to be special. I wanted it to be with someone I really love. And, you know, since then, (inaudible at 13:36) have been trying (laughter) it doesn't work. So, I'm just like, whoever can, you know, open me up, great, then I'll be (laughter), you know, be able to be ready for David (sp?) or for whoever I chose to be with for—you know, whoever. Because Victor (sp?) pretty much said no. (laughter)</p>

<p>It's so awkward. (inaudible at 14:03) be like, "Can someone please have sex with me?" (laughter) I feel, like, so desperate. I don't want to be desperate. People tell me, like, my friends tell me it's OK, you know, like, don't put pressure on yourself, you know. People remain virgins for a long time. That's fine, you know. I want to be fine with that. I mean, that's probably what will happen this weekend. He will be like, "Oh, you're a virgin," and then he will never want to see me again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like, I had such a bad experience with Victor (sp?), like, recently, the stuff that he said that I feel like I want to be believe me and then the same time I don't want to believe me. Like, I said I'm sexually suppressed and it doesn't work with him, he's not satisfied. And so I don't really (pause) (sighs) I just have—I feel like I'm not good in bed, although, like, other men have not turned me away, (laughter) have not pushed me away, have not complained. But still, I don't know. Maybe I do have (pause)—maybe I do give signals that turn people, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What Victor (sp?) says really makes an impression on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I totally gave my heart to him, like, I really just (pause) put down all my barriers, like, put down my guard completely and trusted him completely. And even when he got really, really upset I gave him the benefit of the doubt and said, "Ok, you're upset. You're acting from anger and that's fine." I've never been like this with anyone. I've always—and that's the thing that he's hating too. He's like, "You're just not in the same maturity level as me. I don't respect you anymore. I have a very low opinion of you. You're not even a human being to me," because all of these things, because I'm such a doormat with him. I don't know why [I'm always that way] (ph) because with other men I'm very, very mature and, like, I think. (laughter) Like, I can maintain my distance and (pause) [I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think it is about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He represents that for me. Like, I had a dream where Victor (sp?) and David (sp?) were both defending their thesis. They were at the same program. But in my dream we're all sitting in this room and they're both defending and David (sp?) goes first and he's talking, and everyone's all impressed, and he's talking big and lofty. But while he's talking, Victor (sp?) is sitting next to me and he's holding my hand. And, you know, he's looking at me and he's paying attention to me. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>I just think of him—he reminds me of my dad in some ways. Like, the way he's built. He's kind of bulky and (pause), yeah, physically—and just he's just made very strong, and my dad was that way. And I don't know, maybe (laughter) it makes, like, the (inaudible at 17:25) complex coming out, but I don't know. Like, I feel—that really attracts me to him, that he's so strong and has a temper and—you know, I feel like I'm like a little leaf (laughter) next to me, like the little doe (ph), which is why he probably doesn't want to sleep with me because he doesn't want to be a pedophile. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he make you feel safe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Completely, I mean, which is why this is (inaudible at 17:58) because, like, you know, one moment he puts his finger inside my vagina and says, "I'm going to open you up and, you know, this and that," and then the next minute he's pushing me away and, you know, he doesn't want to do anything with me. [We don't have to do anything] (ph). I don't know. He likes (ph) to push and pull, you know, that's his nature. But, I mean, I am trying to get the point where I can just put this aside and be a functioning human being again, you know, doing my job, work on my writing and take care of myself and my mom and (inaudible at 18:41). I don't think I'll ever stop loving him. It's just too intense from my side and I feel like it is from his side too. He's just afraid and he's just seeing this things that he doesn't like and I don't know. I mean, I want to show him that I'm not immature the way that he thinks I am. I'm not a juvenile. I can be (pause)—I can respond to him like an adult. (laughter)</p>

<p>I mean, I just keep telling him that (inaudible at 19:15) because I was so afraid to lose him, you know. I was acting from the assumption of love and he was just—I mean, if he were Graham, we would probably not have any of these issues because I would be reacting in the exact same way that he wants me to react. I mean, he does expect—I mean, he expects me to just roll over, like, when he says go away or when he says he doesn't love me back, you know. I'm just supposed to say OK and walk up (ph) like an adult, instead of, like, wanting to pull my hair out or, you know, make a scene. (laughter) That is what he doesn't like. And I'm going to do that because I don't want to lose this. I don't want to give it up. I haven't experienced it for a long time and I feel, you know, like when you're just like the Sally—Harry Met Sally moment at the end, what he says. You know, like, when you find someone you love you don't want to just, like, wait around for years or months or days—you want to be with them right then and there, you know. I just wanted my life to kind of start, you know. [00:20:26]</p>

<p>I've never seen anyone as husband material until him, you know. So I don't want to give that up. But that's fine. I want to get to the point—I don't know if I am there yet, but I've at least vocalized that it's not—I mean, I'm fine not having that at this moment. I want my work to be more important and be kind of mature. And if he can see that I am in that place and reciprocate down the road, awesome. And if he can't then, I mean, I'll just, you know, love him from a distance. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: he sounds a bit volatile, like you just never know what you're going to get.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's the problem (inaudible at 21:25)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the attraction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, yeah. Yeah, probably [my love will fad] (ph) if he's constant (ph) like me. (laughter) But it's so much nicer to have that though. Like, even, like, with David (sp?), like, I know he loved me. I mean, I knew he loved me and just (pause) I'm the kind of person who wants to share everything with the person that I'm with, you know, and like, if I see something beautiful I want to text them. If I have a nice thought, I want to keep it away so I can tell them the next time I'm with them. If it's a nice day, I want to see if they want to take the day off and spend it with me, you know. (inaudible at 22:16) Partly I'm afraid I'm taking the job because he said he would like me more if I had the job. Maybe just a passing comment he made long ago. he probably doesn't remember. Sadly, I remember every single thing he said. (laughter) [00:22:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When's the last time you saw your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gosh. 2001 when we were, like, fighting and I came to live here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he still in India?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's actually here. We had a scary thing happen recently when my mom and I both got friend requests from him on Facebook. (laughter) We don't want him back in our lives. He apparently is in Los Angeles, appropriately. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why appropriately? Does he spend a lot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He spends, he drinks, he smokes, he's a philanderer and, yeah. (laughter) He gambled away, like, my scholarship money and he would take money from my mom [and me] (ph). Like, she was the one who always had a job when I was growing up and even in the U.S. and he would control all the finances, telling her she couldn't handle them herself, so he had all the control and he would spend it on women and call girls. And, like, my mom would actually walk in on him having sex with someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you ever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she did this thing where she completely kept that side of him from me, sadly. I wish she'd told me long ago so that I would've helped her take the stand (inaudible at 24:08). So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did she leave him or did he leave her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I made her leave him. It was about a house. Like, it came down to this thing where he wanted me to sign the loan papers. And this was going to be a loan for, like, 115,000 dollars, and I hadn't even graduated. And he convinced my mom too. And, you know, my mom was like, "Why won't you do this for us?" (laughter) And my boyfriend at the time, you know, the nicest, smartest guy. He taught me everything. Jeremy, he said, you know, "Don't do this. I mean, you don't even have a job. You don't know." The economy was kind of going bust. And how could I graduate, you know, taking such a big responsibility and, you know, like, the house was probably going to be, you know, a whore house. (laughter) Like, he would, you know, mess it up. I wouldn't probably be living there.</p>

<p>So I said no and he screamed and yelled. And Jeremy was there (inaudible at 25:21) abusing me and stuff and calling me on the phone abusing me and, like, telling me he'll kill me. And then I just called my mom and said, "You know what, I've had enough. I'm going away." (laughter) And that's when she kind of—that jolted (ph) at her and she then said, "Fine, I'm leaving him," and she came over to my apartment and kind of hid there and, like, sent him letters saying leave. He cut off the electricity and the phone and then got her stuff and then he just kind of left. And wrote letters for the next month or so, but then went away. And then my mom got a divorce a couple years later, because there you have to be separated for two years (inaudible at 26:09).</p>

<p>It ended in a very, very mild manner but I think, I mean, it had to end that way because they were together for so many years together. Together as in, like, illegally married. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How good was your mother at hiding these things from you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh very good. I had no idea. (laughter) Yeah, I had no idea. You can always joke when—he wasn't around much. When we were in India he would always, like, go away to different cities, but he always joked about having girlfriends and, like, in photographs of his workplace he was always surrounded by women. And there was this one woman who always came to our house and she was very simple and plain, and I really liked her. And then only years later, like, when I'm grown up and I'm 20 or 21, and then my mom tells me, "Oh, she was your dad's second wife," basically. They even got married.</p>

<p>And I just was like—I felt so betrayed, you know. Like, I really liked this girl. Like, she would come over and I'd just, like, hang about her and I'd think she's so pretty and better than my mom, you know. I would, you know, hug her, you know, stuff, and now I'm like, wow. (laughter) How could she be—but now that I'm more mature I can see her point of view as well because, you know, when you're vulnerable like she must've been, and young, and you have this strong, powerful man come over, you just are, like, you're swept off your feet, which is kind of what I was like recently, and you lose sight of what's right and wrong and, you know, you don't see that he's married. And you know the wife and the child, so you shouldn't do anything like that. [00:28:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wait, so the woman was the wife after your mother or before your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, after. Like, so, I mean, they were having an affair. Like, he would bring her from his workplace, which was really close to where we lived. Like, he would bring her over and I guess they'd have sex in the afternoon and stuff. And, like, it got really intense for them and they got married. And my mom was weird. She's like, "Yeah, I even offered that I'd step away, step out of the marriage and they could get married." (laughter) I don't ever want to be like that shit. I hate that. Why was—yeah. No wonder Victor (sp?) says he lost respect for me because I turned into that woman. (laughter) I don't want to be that woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That woman who?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but, like, who?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who is swept off her feet. [00:29:17] I was swept off my feet because it felt good and it felt romantic, and I thought that's an OK thing to do when you feel safe, but apparently not. (laughter) Apparently it makes you forget what's right and what's wrong. It makes you cheat, basically, on someone like David (sp?). It makes you—yeah. So, I don't want anyone to have that power over me. I don't want sex to have that power over me. It basically just destroys things, and it did in this scenario. Like, and like I said last year, I threw this big birthday bash for David (sp?) at Victor's (sp?) place. You know, we were such good friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is before you and he had started something or after?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is before. This is last year, like, May 2011. And he bought me (inaudible at 30:21) biography for my birthday. And this year, he did absolutely nothing because I'm a woman. I'm, you know, I'm not his friend anymore. I'm this woman he's sleeping with, so.</p>

<p>I don't know, I feel if he says, you know, he can't really—I mean, women quote things that he said to them back to him and he absolutely doesn't like that, but then, I mean, I keep telling him you've sent me so many mixed signals. Like, you know, on one hand he's polygamist and he's afraid of hurting me. If someone else comes right along he'll sleep them with them, that'll hurt me. And then the next moment he's talking about how his mom his hounding him to get married and then that kind of gives me hope that, you know, that's why I started to think of him as husband material, you know. (laughter) [00:31:22]</p>

<p>He says nobody's ever fought for him like this, so I keep doing the crazy stuff because I feel like that will show him that I'm fighting for him, but I don't know. I have absolutely no confidence in anything that I say to him because I don't know how it will be taken. Like, once I'm away from him and I'm calm and I'm thinking, then I can kind of see his perspective and think like him, but yeah, when I'm, like, around him, like, kind of—and he's, like, hopping on his feet, you know, hopping mad, then I can't really think straight. So it's probably not a good mixture at all, which is what he's saying, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever miss your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I guess when I try to write about him, I try to think about him objectively. [00:32:29] I had a dream this morning that I was with my mom and my father/David (sp?) (laughter) and we were going to IKEA and I was moving him into a dorm or a new room or something, and we were shopping for stuff and we were pressed for time so we were rushing, you know. I have just basically a lot more anger towards him, just, like, for practical reasons. Like, if he were still around, if he were just [likely more sane] (ph), you know, my mom would be living with him and I would've published something by now, you know. I would've not had the responsibility of my mom. But then again, maybe I'm just using her as an excuse. I probably am. Or my own feelings (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You very quickly went to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you started about feeling burdened and angry, and then you're like, "Oh, but maybe it's just"—like, you didn't want to go there. [00:33:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) To talk about my dad?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Talk about your dad, talk about your feelings, talk about feeling burdened by your mom and that responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing I can do. I mean, I will talk about it and I'll just feel horrible and then I'll just sit and, like, wallow in this thing I can't really do anything about. So, I feel like I should just accept that I have her as a responsibility and just, you know, accept it and move on, you know. (laughter) You know, do something about it instead of just lamenting, but I've lamented about this for so long. (laughter) I mean, yeah, I wish she were married. I wish she had found some other guy. I wish I had siblings to share the responsibility, but I don't, so. Like, David (sp?) and I were talking the other day and he was like, "You don't have to feel responsible for her happiness," and that's the thing. Like, I do. [00:34:35] I cannot help it. I feel like moving away from her and living with other roommates will be the solution because I'll be in a house surrounded by people for who's happiness, I'm not responsible, I don't care. But then, even with the distance I'll probably still worry and feel slightly guilty thinking that, "OK, she's just sitting in front of the computer watching soap operas and (pause) feeling sad and lonely."</p>

<p>She feels really lonely, but I can't really—what do I do (laughter) about that? You know, what do I do? I mean, she could live in the city where she has more friends, but then the city healthcare is not as good as the state (laughter) healthcare system, so she wants to be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she have a lot of health problems? [00:35:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not a lot, but just, like, little, little things that, you know, her knees bother her and she goes through therapy for that, and then she has seasonal allergies. I mean, she's very good about taking care of herself in that way that she will just, you know, go to the doctor by herself. I mean, sometimes she needs help. Like, yesterday I had to drive her to this place far away, like, 20 miles away. But, yeah. She's good about keeping herself occupied most of the time. It's just, I hate to see that she's lonely. I mean, but people deal with that. I mean, like, David (sp?) doesn't' even think for more than five minutes that his mom is lonely without him. But at least, I mean, he has—that's the thing. His mom is married, you know, like, her husband will eventually come home and he, you know, won't be having sex with other women and he'll be, you know... [00:36:45]</p>

<p>I mean, I don't know. I guess I have to just figure out a way of accepting the sadness and feeling not too guilty, not too badly about it, and just laying that aside and being productive. It's just I'm very afraid of getting to this place where I'm like, "Oh no, it's all my fault." I mean, she does make me feel guilty for (inaudible at 37:20). Like, she'll say (inaudible at 37:24) "Why did I get married? I was, you know, doing my PhD and, you know, my parents forced me and I got married to this horrible man. And then you came along and that's it." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the end of her narrative, you coming along?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. And, you know, she tells me that when I was born, like, no one really wanted to hold me and my mom was like, "Take her away from me," you know, she didn't want to look at me and all that, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because she was upset because, like, when I came along she was kicked out of her in-laws place because they thought that I wasn't my dad's because I came right after nine months of marriage. Plus they were unhappy with her about other things as well, so they sent her back to her parents, and I guess she held me responsible. Not for the whole time. She did, you know, bring me up so nicely. But that moment is kind of etched in her memory and she kind of brings it up. And I feel bad, but then I'm like, "Well, you know, she was put under so much pressure at that time. So, you know, I probably would've reacted the same way, so." I hope not, but, you know, I don't blame her too much about that, so. [00:38:57]</p>

<p>I just want to get to the place where, you know, I see her as a responsible adult, you know, who's responsible for her own happiness. And, you know, I cannot be too sad about the fact that she's sad.</p>

<p>You know, that's the thing with the job. Like, I guess I've almost said yes, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the job with the program?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or then the fulltime job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The new job. I mean, I don't really know. I'll have to (pause)—I guess I should think more about it, like, which scenario.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're in a difficult situation. [00:40:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: it's a difficult situation? Like, what do you recommend? (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea what's best for you. But there's just—I don't know. I could see why you want to do anything not to be like your mother and end up like her, which sort of helpless and feeling like a victim really. But then to be different from her, maybe you feel like you're abandoning her, being disrespectful or being disloyal. I mean, it's sort of like everywhere you turn there are drawbacks to how you want to be. And without Victor (sp?), I mean, I'm sure that your attraction to him is to complicated, but I wonder maybe you feel like you don't deserve any better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, yeah. I mean, that's the thing with David (sp?). Like, he liked me and he's so fabulous in the sense that he's nice and he's steady and he'll always love me and he would never cheat on me and he's intellectually so ambitious and successful, and his family's good. [00:41:15] So, I just was like, you know, let's jump, you know, this is a good catch. (laughter) So I didn't really consider that, OK, maybe he's not so attractive and I'm not attracted to him. Yeah, I definitely think that if I find someone who, like, meets stringent (ph requirements then I just need to jump. But I'm not going to jump anymore, because (pause) I want to get to a place where it's like if there's in my life, great. If there's not, all right, you know. (laughter) I admire that kind of attitude and I've seen that in other women and I want to be in that place. But I think the only way that I will get there is if I have an occupation that completely satisfies me, and that will be my writing. Somehow, I have to work on that, but then I've also, you know, make money and pay my rent and mom's rent. [00:42:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But one of the problems is nothing in life—a man, a job, nothing—is completely satisfying. It can be very satisfying, but there's always disappointing parts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. How do you live with disappointments still (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I mean, I have to get to that point where I can say, you know, I've had so many disappointments in writing but it's still better that I'm doing this than not doing it, you know. Even the disappointments are worth it, because the process, the journey is fun. It can be fun. It has been fun at times. I just feel so horribly, like, so negatively about the times that I've spent on (inaudible at 43:28) stories that have gotten rejected. Like, they got rejected and then I think about, "All those Saturdays I spent in the library working on that stupid shit, you know. It's so horrible. It's so ugly. What a fucking waste. (laughter) Why the hell couldn't I be objective and see that I just was not ready to write about that time or, you know, that scenario?" (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, your reaction, your sort of strong with a violent reaction to being rejected I think speaks to just how much you yearn to be accepted and approved of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I guess that would be because of my dad and his, you know, the things that he would say about how I wouldn't really do anything in life and just how he had very high standards for me and I never met them and never really made him happy, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He would say this to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and much worse. (laughter) [00:44:29] Yeah, I do have this tendency to want to seek approval. One of the reason why I'm taking this job, my full-time, is because everyone approves of me and they keep telling me, "You're so talented and we want you. Are you going to take the job? I hope you do." (laughter) So, yeah, I'm not, like, Victor (sp?), I'm not that strong person who's [been beat] (ph), who can wade through shit, who can take a job where there is not that much, you know, approval and it's only hard work. I guess that will be the sign of the [strong person] (ph).</p>

<p>Will he ever, like, forgive me? Will he ever, like, turn around and, like, look at me with love again, after the things he said, you know? I'm stalking him (inaudible at 45:35). (pause) I'm relieved I didn't get served, I didn't get the restraining order. (laughter) Police didn't come after me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you think they would?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, because David (sp?) was really, really afraid. (laughter) And I've been asking other men, like, "So, when would you kick a girl out of your home?" They're all like, "Well, if she's stabbing me." (laughter) And then I'm like, wait, I didn't' do that. You know, I didn't threaten him. All I was saying was, you know, I love you. (laughter) And I can see from his point of view that he's just feeling this aversion to he's seen and he's probably also upset about the way that he's reacted to me. I mean, if some person brings out of an ugly side in you, you're not going to want to see them, you know. [00:46:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is very true, that when people hate other people, it's often that they hate how they feel about themselves or the presence of that other person. Absolutely, I agree. [We should be good] (ph). We're going to need to stop for today, OK? So we're on for Monday. I mentioned that next Tuesday I can't, but I could meet next Friday, if you'd like to meet twice next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do—I think I had mentioned that we have Monday, Tuesday for a few weeks, but not next Tuesday. So I think so Monday we're on, and I think next Friday the time I have is 10:30. Is that a possibility, 10:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 10:30, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so let's do that. OK, sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have my checkbook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, thank you. So it's 70 (inaudible at 47:33) session, so I guess 140.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so sorry, this is not my right checkbook at all. Can we try my credit card?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bring it next time, not a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No no no, no, it's OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was rushing and I picked up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 47:59) don't worry about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. (laughter) I mean, you can totally just charge my card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you prefer that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I'll definitely bring my checkbook next time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bring your checkbook (inaudible at 48:12) that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, thank you. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, you too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know about that. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know, it's complicated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Yeah, but] (ph) I'll try to be calm. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care, OK? Bye-bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, bye.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, yeah, I, uh, can't stop worrying about money even though I should not be worrying about money, but I kind of always worry about money. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...This [chuckles] — the — like, being in treatment with you and not hDanng a job is — is really freaking me out. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — [pauses] yeah, even though it is — everyone around me is, like, "No, really, it is OK. It'll all be taken care of. It is OK," [taps surface] I can't, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like you just absolutely can't afford it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, from some perspectives, like, my weekly budget is less than one of our sessions. Um, yeah — but I mean not counting rent and utilities and stuff, but everything else, um, because we spend so much money on flights. [00:01:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but — which isn't [sighs] [shifts in seat] — you know, I feel good about what we're spending our money on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we're spending it on what's important. [Shifts in seat] Um — but, like, for me to have a weekly budget is new since I got married. [Chuckles] Like, for me to have any kind of structure in my life...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...About money...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Is something that I've had to, A, figure out on my own [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I — when I was growing up, my dad just wouldn't talk to me about money at all. Like, I was going [slaps surface] to private school. I knew that the tuition costs somewhere around $20,000 a year. I knew that my dad was not paying that much money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know how much money he was paying. Um, as it turns out, the school — I had a scholarship for about 80 percent of that. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but — like, I knew I had the scholarship, but he wouldn't tell me what it was or where that money was coming from. Um, but I never felt like we had any money because I never had enough money to — like, my — my monthly allowance from my dad wasn't enough to actually cover, like, shampoo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like — and it was just — you know, he's a man. He didn't know that [pauses] — you know, that girls are more expensive than boys, like it just is. Um, and I didn't know how to tell him that because I didn't know whether — you know, I didn't think that he could afford to give me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, $60 a month rather than $40.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, you know, everybody in my side of the family is either a member of the clergy or an artist. Like, I [chuckles]... [00:03:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Was basically raised with a mentality of, "Well, you know, you do what you love, and, eventually, you find somebody to pay you for it, and you get by."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, I had one uncle who gave up — who was a stock — who's a stockbroker, um, and so they have a lot of money. But I didn't find out until recently that he taught English for ten years, and he gave that up because — for his family, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, because they needed the money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. And, you know, so, in some ways, it is like I also thought he was, like, the black sheep, but, no, not really. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I — I believe in that. Um, I kind of — that is how I've made my life choices.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:03:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, at the same time, I've just [pauses] — I feel as though — I feel as though money is something that I cannot predict, I cannot control. I never have enough money, and things just come out of nowhere and, suddenly, I'm in trouble. Um, so being married to James is very good because he's kind of like, "No, it is actually really simple. It is really just algebra."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And — you know, he just — there's not — none of this emotional weighting for him, um, so he just [whispers] does a budget. Um, [chuckles] [sniffles] and, like, I can, you know — I figure out — we figure out my budget for the week, and I can stick to that, and that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but, like, [pauses] [sighs] you know, so I'm sticking (ph) that apartment, and James doesn't realize that my apartment rent - that moving into a single, my rent is going to probably double. [00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I've told him this, but I don't think he really believes it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I can't start looking for an apartment until I have a job, and I don't have a job. [Sighs] Um, [whispers] so [pauses] [sighs emotionally] [pauses another nine seconds] Yeah, so on the one hand, it is very easy to say it like, "No, I — just therapy is what I need, and it is probably — you know, it is the best thing I've got going for me right now, and it is really keeping me running in a good way." And — so that's what we do. Um, on the other hand, it is really hard for me that — to say that my well-being is worth that. You know? [00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Faintly] Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, which is — as I understand it, one of the reasons why you're here in the first place...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. [chuckles] Yes. [Chuckles] [Pauses] Um, so that's one thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, of course...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interrupts] Right. I'm going to — I'm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, we can keep talking about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think there's one other thing that I — uh, which is — like, [pauses for nine seconds] — and [pauses] why, again, aren't we paying 500 bucks a month for a Blue Cross plan that would cover your treatment (ph)? [00:07:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Exasperated] I don't know!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — because I've given James the options, and James is not — and James is not interested in pursuing that one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's the person who's in charge of this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm trusting him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [sighs] but, I mean, yeah, it is something to bring up again. Um, [shifts in chair] yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I — uh, or [pauses] — yeah, getting on his plan, which I could bill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I looked at getting on his plan, and I don't think that's going to work...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, because they don't cover more than one appointment a week with [inaudible] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which, I don't [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've don't know how they couldn't cover that, but whatever...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] It is a different state. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's [natural — there's natural elemental parity] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um... [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, whatever, that's — that could be. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, it is — I mean, you know, in the explanation of benefits, they...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah — no, with the Blue Cross, I know that, for you — because you're currently on Blue Cross - it would be filling out one three-paged form and sending it to them, and that's about it — maybe a phone call...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...To get a price quote before you fill out the form, but that'd be it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I've looked. I've gotten price quotes online.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I need to talk with — bring that up with James again. It — it is just [pauses] [sighs] because I worry about it, I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] And I just...[chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know — yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I feel [shakily] so un — incapable of dealing with it, I don't want to push James on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:08:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you're right. Um, [sighs] [pauses eight seconds] it is just — it [sighs] — [sighs] any time money comes up, [slaps surface] it is just — it is one of the things that really sets me off. [slaps surface] and then I feel like I'm [slaps surface] never going to be good enough at, and I feel like I — I have no [becomes emotional] control over, and [shifts in seat] - you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um, [pauses eight seconds] I guess my impression is that you're terrified about money, and what you're really terrified of is, uh, kind of how worthless you know you can make yourself feel, like not deserving of anything; which, um, [pauses] — uh — I — I guess stuff like that doesn't - kind of part of what's so scary in all this. Does that make sense? [00:10:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Softly] Yeah, yeah. Um, that is — it is more that, as soon as I start to think about it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like my self-worth just plummets. Um, as soon as I start to think about it, I start to feel bad about myself. Um, and, uh, you know, bad about myself in the, say, like angry, dangerous... [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Want-to-hurt-myself ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I decided I'm just not going to hurt myself anymore. Uh, and at that — about a week and a half ago, uh-huh — just like, [snaps] "This is what we're going to do." I don't know if that'll last, but, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Go for it.] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I — [he did] (ph) [inaudible at 11:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] it is hard, um, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and so (ph)...</p>

<p>[Silence for 10 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then, yesterday, I decided to — to force the issue with Franco, Sascha, and also with Dan (ph), um, and said [chuckles], "[Fuck this] (ph)." So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah, [I read it] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I wrote Sascha an e-mail in the morning, just saying, like, "Hey, what's up? Uh, I — you know, I hope that you're OK." [00:12:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I hope that you and I are OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, "I was disappointed that I didn't get to hang out with you last week, and I'm — was frustrated that you didn't reply to my e-mail." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean — and then, [chuckles] as I was coming into campus in the afternoon, I realized, like, "It is raining today. It is going tomorrow. It is going to rain the next day. My umbrella is at Franco's. This is ridiculous." And so I texted [chuckles] him and was just like, "Can I have my umbrella back [chuckles]?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and then, with Dan (ph), I realized, actually, that the e-mail that I had meant to — thought I had sent, saying, "Yes, let's talk," um, I never did send...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or it didn't get sent, so we were kind of both waiting to hear from the other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I e-mailed him and was just like, "Yeah, [slaps surface] I would like to talk." Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:12:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] With Franco and Sascha, it did not — I do not feel good about this situation, um, in that [shifts in seat] [pauses] Franco, um, texted me back, and he was like, you know, "Yeah, give me a call. Like, come by when you're done." Um, and so he came out to meet me, like out of the house, and, like, had the stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "Here. Don't come in. Here's your umbrella."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it was a — it was a situation where he was, like — he's — both he and then Sascha later, you know, [slaps surface] were like, "We're sorry. It has been a really busy week." And, first, Sascha had horrible migraines, and now Franco has this horrible sinus infection, and Sascha and Franco — is like helping Franco be - like, basically deep clean the apartment to get rid of any possible allergens to make it better. So he was, like, "Sascha is sorry she can't come down. She's, like, elbow-deep in bleach." Um, [I'll pretend, sure] (ph), it is true. [I'll pretend, sure] (ph), it is not actually the reason that they're not talking to me, um, and that makes me incredibly angry. Um, it would not hurt me for either — I just feel like I tried to make it really, really easy for Sascha to level with me, and she didn't, um, and I don't have any patience for that. Um, [sighs] I have a whole lot of sympathy for Sascha, but it doesn't go that far. Um, I need people to be honest with me. Um, so I — I was talking with this — James about this last night, um, and he said, "Well, what would you have wanted them to say?" And, honestly, I would — I'd really prefer... [</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I expect, anything. [00:14:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [chuckles] "I'm sorry. There is stuff going on that makes it hard for us to see you right now, and I can't tell you what it is." I would have been totally OK with that. Like, that would be fine. Um, [pauses] [sighs] and the — the thing that is also really hard is that I would — I would never have relied on Franco in the way that I have, I would never have felt like I could just call him up and say, "Can I spend the night with you? I need somebody to — I need to be with somebody." Like, I would not have put that on him if I had thought that it would hurt Sascha; [sounds emotional] I wouldn't have done it. Um, the reason I thought that was OK was because Franco said, "Yeah, Sascha is OK with it, and if she's not OK with it, I don't care. You know, she's going to have to be OK with it." And now I feel like I'm getting punished for that, and now I feel horrible about [becomes emotional, shakily] having... [00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I [exhales, about to cry]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...About having relied on somebody. Um, I feel bad [shakily] about Franco — the way that Franco has [begins to cry] taken care of me. Um, [whimpers]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I — you know, I feel like I'm hurting somebody by having — [begins to cry] — by needing this. [Whimpers] Um, it is just not — it is just not fair. [Exhales] [pauses]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it is not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I — I didn't see it coming. Um, [pauses] you know, and now I really have [shifts in seat] done everything that I can do. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, [pauses five seconds] you know, I think Sascha is staying 'til Thursday, and then she and Franco are going to the Beach for a while. And he said, "You know, when I get back, like, we'll have lunch." So we'll have lunch, and I'll tell him these things, and [slaps surface] [whispers] we'll figure it out. Um, the thing is like I — I want Franco to choose Sascha over me; I just think that's a false choice. Like, there is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not why you're asking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really is not. Um, [exhales] and so I'm angry with Sascha for putting them in this position, and I'm angry with Franco for allowing himself to be put in this position. Um, but I'd also — I don't even know that that's necessarily what is going on. You know? I have — I don't have access to... [00:18:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The information, and so I can't — I can't figure it out. Um, you know, so, of course, I catastrophize. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but, I mean, it does, I think, play into one of the things you're most afraid of, which, I think, relates to the money issue, as well, which is, um, feeling like you've harmed the people around you for what you've needed from them or asked for from them... [00:19:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And that you always try to sort of preemptively check out whether that could happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but, I guess, feel precisely in this case like you were kind of misled around that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, which doesn't stop me from feeling like I ought to have been able to keep it from happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, no matter how much I — I recognize that I am not caught. [Chuckles].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I cannot keep these things from happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, [pauses] you know, I don't [shakily, emotional] want Franco to be another person that I lose because he cares about me. Um, like, [emotionally] that's bullshit. I'm not willing for that to happen. Um, [shakily] [pauses] [begins to cry, sniffles]... [00:20:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 8 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not — has that happened, maybe, with Dan mostly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking of Dan, mostly. Um, but [sighs] [pauses for five seconds] I don't — I'm at a loss for more than one example otherwise, but I guess I feel like [sighs]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you worry, in some way, that that could happen with me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, you better not fall in love with me; that's all I'm saying. [Chuckles] Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — I [shakily] was talking to Amanda, um, like, right after Dan told me that he was in love with me, and I was, like, "This is ridiculous! I don't understand this." [00:21:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I'm not the kind of person that people fall in love with." And she was, like, "Tanya, you've had three people fall in love with you in the last year. Like, you are that kind of person."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Slaps surface] [Exasperated] [seems to be both chuckling and becoming emotional] I don't understand. That doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Apparently not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] And — but I — I can't control that, [shakily] and I cannot — [begins to cry] I just lose people. Um, [cries] [sniffles] [recovers emotions] — but then I also feel like [slaps surface] I — you know, and there is also that I really, really don't want to be my mother. So [sniffles] I have more men friends than women friends, and part of that is, I think, not, you know, not, you know, being raised by a man and not being comfortable, at all, women for, you know, most of my childhood. And part of that is my field is heavily male-dominated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:21:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, there's two other women in my program that are anywhere near me in age.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess three, but one of the other ones is — she's not taking courses this year and hasn't been on campus lately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and — yeah, so [sighs] uh, [pauses] — and — the way my mom works is, whenever there's a man in the room, she wants to [exhales] infatuate that person, and she will — is very, very charming, and she's very, very good at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pauses] — you know, so one of the — one of the grudges that I hold is that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Our whole lives, she said, "You are the most important people to me," but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Anytime there was any other man in the room, we were less important than that person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:22:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, always. And so I think, "Is that me?" I don't — like, I honestly — like I don't know. Um, like, I am a flirtatious person, but, more, it is just like I just like people, um, and I talk to people, and I trust people and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...[Chuckles] I - [becomes emotional] I like those things about myself, [begins to cry] but [cries]— like I really value those things about myself [sniffles] [cries] [whimpers].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, I can imagine it is very awful to think about essentially pushing people away over that (ph). [00:23:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [pauses] yeah. [Sniffles] And I'm either lucky or possess their judgment in being married to James, um, who is the least jealous person I've ever met - like, really, the least jealous person I've ever met, um, in that, [sniffles] I talked with him about some of this last night, and he was just, like, you know, "Tanya, I really want you to know that you can tell me when you fall in love with people, like, you can tell me when people fall in love with you. That doesn't threaten me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, which is shouldn't, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [exhales] you know, 'cause I mean, yeah, I'm always going to pick James.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] but [pauses] he has to - [pauses] [whimpers] that's one thing that he could have to deal with, that I don't have to deal with. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here's something that you say, like, in a way, in spite of your not being so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Much how it happened, has happened to you, is something you're worried about here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Suddenly sounds upbeat] Not too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I'm definitely — it is definitely a possibility that I'm always on guard against, um, with you and with other therapists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] you know, 'cause, like I said, like, I fall in love with everybody; that's not a big deal. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Like, I'm not worried about my ability to keep our relationship in appropriate levels and appropriate conduct (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I — I do trust you in that, but also, I mean, [sniffles]... [00:26:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Yeah, you are] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I kind of — I trust everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It still scares me. [sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [slaps surface]</p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has that ever been an issue in any other therapies you've been in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nuh-uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would assume you would've mentioned it, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it hasn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank goodness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't know what to do with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, eh, Dan threw me for such a loop...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, you know, because in my relationships with the teachers, I've always taken as the same — you know, similar to relationships with therapists. It is like, this is the same relationship. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have to worry about this, in this relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [pauses] Although, I have a long and glorious history of having crushes on teachers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, since Dan, [chuckles] that has not happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [inhales laughing] So that's something that it has cured me of... [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or at least, you know, put it off for a year or two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, you know, I'm at the point where they — there's enough inherent equality in the relationship that it is not — it can't be a safe place anymore, in that, between graduate student and professor...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...There is loss of a distance. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um — [shifts in seat] um, you know, I — [pauses] yeah. [Silence for 11 seconds] But, you know, I feel bad even saying these things because it is still a little absurd to me that people would love me or could love me. Like, I [becomes emotional, shakily] — I don't understand it. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, and on one hand, it is like I sort of heard it literally isn't money but also, in a way, is a metaphor you're feeling not worth being here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:28:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet, at the same time, like [people want to fall for you] (ph) for you or, um — uh, like, worried about — yeah, like people sort of, um, want to be too close to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or I don't think "too close" is the right way to phrase it, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, close in...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Close in inappropriate ways?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Inappropriate ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. No, that's much better put. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, because I don't — I don't think that it is possible for me to be too close to Franco.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I do think it would be possible for me to be close in inappropriate ways to Franco. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I did fall for Franco one summer. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Yeah, that was the problem. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [chuckles] Franco never noticed but James noticed, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...He and I were...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you noticed? [00:30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I noticed. Um, and he and I were having a rough summer anyway, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: James and — James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I, um — and so we — they were — there was some [fight to that bet] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And that was something we had to work through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, in part, we worked through it by, you know, me — you know, me saying, "James, you can trust me not to do anything inappropriate," and him trusting me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, in part, it worked. We've worked through it, but I got over it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um — but, eh — I don't — I don't see that happening again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if it did happen again, I would tell James about it, and we'd work — work it out; like, it would be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, that's clearly — that's not the issue in the present with Franco at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, it is almost like your impression is that it is kind of Sascha's issue more than anybody's. [00:30:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That — [exhales] — that is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially with what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean, that is what I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, now and then, I feel like maybe I'm being unfair to Sascha. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I — [pauses] I don't want to be unfair to her, [speaks softly] just because I'm really angry at her. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, in some ways, because I'm so angry at her, I'm — I'm trying really hard not to scapegoat her in this situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, to say, like, "No, this is something that we're all doing." And it is — it — you know, she couldn't do — you know, she couldn't be this way if Franco wasn't part of this relationship. At — like — [slaps surface] [sighs with exasperation] I don't know. I — [pauses] [exhales] I feel like I'm getting hurt because of things that are not healthy in their relationship. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, on the one hand, it is kind of not my business if things are not healthy in their relationship. Um, if there's abuse going on, then, yeah, that comes with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, then that's a different story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I watch for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm, you know — and I'm pretty clear about when it is my job to say something and when it is not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I mean, I'm clear in my head, but I'm not actually clear about it because [speaks more softly] I want to control everybody's lives. Um...[chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lost my train of thought. I'm sorry. [Speaks softly, like preoccupied] Um, [pauses] — yeah, I think there was a narrative there, but it wasn't very important, and now it is gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or it was a repetition of what I've already said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else popped in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [00:32:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll be surprised to hear me ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Inhales] I just really don't want to lose these people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, they're better than this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Um, [pauses] and I, myself, am so [becomes emotional] out of sync with the world that I don't — I wonder whether I'm the person who is causing all of this and not even — I don't even know it. You know, I don't [pauses] feel [sniffles] [exhales] — on the one hand, I feel — I — I — sometimes, I feel pretty confident in my actions and in the way in — that I'm doing the right thing, and sometimes I think [slaps surface], "How can I even tell when I'm doing the right thing?" Like, I can't even [begins to cry] [pauses] [exhales] — [00:34:03]</p>

<p>I don't — [whimpers] all of my mechan — mechanisms for assessing the world around me are [chuckles in exasperation] way off, and I don't know how they're off. Um, [pauses] [sniffles] you know, maybe I'm just being ridiculously demanding and not comm — but not communicating what I need; um, that's a real possibility. [Exhales while crying]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 14 seconds] - hmm, [pauses for another 17 seconds] not really. I mean, [pauses] how have you not made it clear to Franco and Sascha that you need some kind of response from them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, all — all I did was, like, shooting an e-mail, saying, "Hey, let's go see <i>The Avengers</i>." Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Didn't you just say you wrote another one, saying, like...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then I wrote another one. Um, [pauses] but — I mean, part of the reason I'm angry at Sascha is that, through my entire, you know, period of depression for the last year and a half...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...She's been really supportive, sent me a couple of really great notes. She sent me this, like, incredible care package. Um, and every single time she wrote me, she said, "If you ever want to talk, call me; I'll be there," and, actually, this is the one time that I've reached out to her, and [dissmissively] nothin'. Um, [exhales in exasperation] so it is hard not — for me not to say, "Well, I guess that doesn't really mean very much that you said that." [00:36:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The part that doesn't is the part where you didn't communicate your needs [chuckles] clearly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is different being, like, "Hey, let's go see <i>The Avengers</i>!" Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You know, that's not the same as...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is hard to — um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not a cry for — an obvious cry for help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Wait just a minute] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uh, [pauses] but in — right? — you sent her a follow-up just recently, saying, like... [00:37:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Basically like, "Hey, what's up," when I heard from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and — and she wrote back and said, "Yeah, I'm really sorry. We've been busy and sick." Um, [pauses] yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, which...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wouldn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Sounded pretty hollow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] It sounds like it, but, I mean, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, maybe I'm thinking these horrible things about my friend, and there really is nothing more than that. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes emotional] ...But?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Doesn't really add up. She knows quite well, I can only assume...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...The kind of straits (ph) you've been in. [00:37:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, in any normal week, I mean [sniffles] — considering, you know, on the Thursday before last, when - that was the last night that I was staying with Franco, he stayed up two hours past his bedtime because he was worried about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means he was worried about my safety. Like, in any normal week, he would give me a call this week or last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [sighs]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so even if — I guess the point is — would be, like, even if it was just them being busy and sick, it still, uh, is pretty lame.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I know this, but I — I don't know it. You know, I know this, but I have to keep treading that same ground of, "I am justified in being upset." [00:38:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. It seems like the alternative and the thing that was just starting to happen right there a minute ago was you start thinking, "You know, but maybe I just really have no idea what's going on or how I'm acting, and my view of things is so distorted in my current state that I'm maybe completely misreading this..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...And really not communicating what I need." I mean, that — that's, to my mind, kind of the boomerang happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's exactly it. [Drums surface] [pauses] That's — it is kind of [exhales], you know, it is the boomerang that pretty much always happens before, you know, "Maybe this is really [becomes emotional] my fault."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I'm angry at so-and-so for doing such-and-such — <i>errrrr</i> [growling sound].</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] [00:40:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Laughs] "Sorry."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] "Oh, no, wait. Really, it is..." [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Gimme (ph). [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "No, really, it is..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...It is all me, my fault."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like my point here...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is just — it is easier for things to be my fault than to be somebody else's fault. Like, I can deal with that way better; not actually, [chuckles] but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm much more comfortable [chuckles] dealing with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sort of is a control, in theory, in your hands but, on practice, actually much less so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Um, [pauses] yeah. [Exhales] I try really, really hard to let go of needing to control things. Um, but I'm really conscious that I do that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:40:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I work really hard not to. Um, [sniffles] you know, like not asking you what we're doing here. [Chuckles] And so [laughs more vigorously] [tries to recover from laughing] sometimes, I do weird things because of it. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [chuckles] but then, like, I don't — I don't have a good sense of what I should be able to control and what I shouldn't, so [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Gets up from seat] Have a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. You, too.</p>

<p>[Door opens and closes]</p>

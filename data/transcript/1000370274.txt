<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) After I left yesterday, I, uhm, was just thinking about the question that you raised and that I had raised at the end of the day.  And I realized that I had felt that I, I couldn't have you say the question and not tell you that I had already thought of it.  And it made me think of the reaction I have when, for instance, my supervisor will make suggestions and I always feel I have to say, well, I'm already doing that, or we've tried it or, some such comment if I have, if these things had occurred to me before.  (Pause) I don't know, it almost, it's almost as if I'm trying to prove myself as being better than I expect people think.  And, and so I have to, so the important thing is more to assert what I have done than to follow up on suggestions or, or to just, for instance yesterday, to think about the question.  I, I don't think I really could even think about it.  I was too busy trying to make it clear I'd already thought of it before. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I really couldn't think about it when I got home, although I wanted to.  And I was just aware of feeling very uncomfortable.  And more or less the feeling that I had all last week had come back, even though I didn't start out yesterday feeling that way.  And it seemed to come back while I was here yesterday.  And then it was, just kept increasing so it was really bad when I got home.  But at least that reaction helped me, I guess, accept more than realize something.  Because all last week when I was so upset about school, I tended to think that if I could just get things straightened out at school everything would be alright, rather than thinking that the trouble was somewhere else and that school was only 1 instance of the results of the trouble.  But I think yesterday and then today too, I felt better about going to school and what I could do and the feeling then was more, if I could just feel more confident, then I could handle these things. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I just, when I finished saying what I said about, uhm, the way I'm emphasizing what, what the trouble is or what's important, last night when I was thinking about it, it just seemed such an important thing to have realized.  And now today when I think about it, it, I just sort of feel, well, of course, there's no point in even saying it.  Or perhaps I'm feeling that's what you're thinking.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!  (Patient laughs) I was going to just say that here you are again sort of taking away from yourself, degrading it immediately.  It can't be worth much if you thought it, that kind of feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I just thought of something that, uhm, MSCZ will often do.  And I don't think it would bother me at this point unless it, if it hadn't happened earlier but this is something that all my family used to do and almost still does.  They, anything you say, they almost attack it as, again, that reaction: well, of course, you don't even have to say that.  And I think in my family I've always had the feeling that anything you say you'd better be ready to defend vehemently because it might be attacked very strongly and ridiculed.  And I don't know how much my parents actually participated in this kind of reaction.  Now they, in a discussion they'll do it if you don't agree with them.  But even if they didn't participate when we were younger, I don't think they ever sort of supported us, any one of us and, and gave us individually the feeling that what we were saying had merit.  And they just sort of let us fight it out amongst ourselves. (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose that's 1 reason why now, when I do say anything and when I'm part of a group of people and we're just having a general conversation, if somebody differs and questions even a part of what I say just in a very good spirit, uhm, I immediately will become extremely defensive and wishing I hadn't said anything.  Or else, I'll just become terrifically aggressive.  And I suppose this would be partly why I don't feel confidence.  (Pause) And I think, before, when I was, uhm, thinking about why I don't and then also the reactions I have of either anger or fear, uhm, I'm still, I can't quite clarify all these thoughts, but somehow in there is a feeling that I never, I can't recall any time really feeling that I was important and that whatever I did or said for myself, being myself, was uhm, I don't know, worthwhile, I, is the word that comes to my mind.  But I just didn't feel recognized as being anything that was particularly me.  It was all sort of traits that my parents wanted the whole family to have, everybody be a good student and everybody be obedient and everybody be admired by their friends and that type of thing.  And the whole thing that they used to do of, what they gave to one, they gave to another was, I don't know, almost as if we didn't have individual interests to recognize. (Pause)</p>

<p>I just thought of something else that, uhm, I've been aware of at other times when I've been talking.  But it seems to fit into this whole thing of degrading myself first so I'm the one that does it and it's not somebody else.  Uhm, often when I've said things here, I've said them and then I felt I have to add or it just comes out before I even know I'm going to say it: "I think"  or "  I guess"  or "  I don't really know."  (Silence) And I just began to think of something that I've often wondered at, and that's my great inclination to give advice to other people when they're not too sure how to act in different situations and how I always seem so positive.  And sometimes I'll realize that I spoke too hastily but very often I'll think I'm giving awfully good advice.  And yet, if I'm the one in the same situation I can't follow that good advice or I don't think of those good things.  And (clears throat) I don't know, it's like I'm 2 different people. (Silence)</p>

<p>I began to think of my assistant and I, and something that had happened today to her.  She had had to, uhm, work with the class we had last year, one point.  And they've been a particularly hard class to handle this year.  And when I saw them once it had been my feeling that they just needed to be told there were limits and nobody could go beyond them, which they're not being told.  And, ah, then today, my assistant did actually give them quite a lecture and, and, I think, made them stop and think a little bit about what they were doing.  But, uhm, I think the real reason I began to think of her is because often when I see her teaching, things will occur to me, both that, or I can see where things that she's doing are good and then things that perhaps she could have done differently.  And then when I'm teaching, I'll often do the exact same mistakes that she did or perhaps even worse.  And sometimes it'll make me feel very, well, guilty, I suppose.  Because I'll be critical of her and yet I make the same errors.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I was thinking about the fact that so much of what I talk about, and it just seems when I think about how I feel, so much of my time feeling is spent on feeling angry or afraid or guilty.  And then I began to wonder if, just as at school I'm afraid of a new program, even though it might be much more to my liking, I wondered how much I'm afraid of or resisting feeling any other way because this is the way I understand or at least I'm familiar with.  (Pause) And then it seems, it's almost an excuse when I will think, as I just was a minute ago, well, how can a person feel another way if they have had so many years experience with one type of reaction.  I mean, that, well, just the way my family reacted to me, whatever it was, and I reacted back to them, it seems impossible to change it now.  But then I just wonder if, well, I, if I'm not using that.  (Pause) And it makes me wonder, too, how much the fact that I've looked at things in a pessimistic way comes from having to keep myself in the state of feeling unhappy or how much of it's a f—, fear that if I don't look at the worse side, then I might be much more terribly disappointed or unhappy.  (Pause) Perhaps there's something of both but then I think of sometimes how I am with MSCZ.  And it almost seems as if I have to keep making myself see the things that annoy me or bother me, or I don't know, just I can't allow myself to feel particularly happy for very long.  And if I do feel happy, I'm always sort of uncomfortable about it and, I don't know, there's something that's not nice about the feeling of being happy or I was going to say painful.  It's not exactly that but — (pause) I don't know exactly what it is but it's sort of, I can tell I struggle, then, to get better control of myself.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does an instance, an example come to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, 1 time, 1 type of situation that I'm often aware of this is if we're driving somewhere.  And I'll suddenly just feel very close to him and very happy and content just for that moment.  And then I feel very warm and yielding to him and I can feel right away that I fight that.  Because just as I'm beginning to feel it, I sort of get a feeling of being sick to my stomach.  (Pause) And it's sort of a similar thing if either before I — well, I don't know, it's more, I guess, when we're involved in intercourse and I might have been responding very happily and then I'll suddenly get this feeling.  It's not as clear then.  I, the clearest times that I know this has happened is, as I said, when we're in the car.  I suppose then I know I'm safe to feel very warm toward him for a little.</p>

<p>(6-minute silence) I was thinking more about my feelings toward MSCZ and how, I don't know, I almost am incapable of feeling anything half the time, more than half the time, because I put myself first and I'm just too concerned about myself.  So that he's almost in the role of a companion who also should have me first in mind.  And then I began to think of my assistant and how I, in a less intense way, do the same thing with her.  (Pause) And that, with both of them, every once in a while I can feel very warm toward each of them.  (Pause) I don't know exactly what word to use, but somehow that there's an interaction taking place, it's not just me dominating it.  And no matter how happy it makes me feel to have that happen, I can't sustain it.  And I'll begin again to think of myself first and feel they should too and feel I have to sort of assert myself and show I'm the one that's smart or think of things and sort of show them up.  (Silence) And with my assistant I have to, I react, if anybody else praises her, it upsets me very much.  It's almost as if it's a derogatory remark to me.  But I can praise her if I want to, if I'm in that mood and I want the position to be the one to praise her, I don't want anybody else to.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I was, think everything I was thinking of, I was thinking of lots of little things and they all somehow related to this very competitive feeling I have with my assistant.  (Pause) And somehow I think I have a very competitive feeling with MSCZ too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, what occurs to me: earlier this week you, ah, you know, at one point were thinking a good deal about how you're older and you made the point that you're older than MSCZ and your assistant.  And now you describe that these are the 2 people that are on your mind and you're very competitive with them.  And you feel each in a certain way, you feel vulnerable with each one if you let down your guard and you want them to be around for your benefit.  It sounds familiar to me somehow.  Does it bring any other situation to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, sort of in a vague way, my parents.  But, I don't know, then I keep thinking that, however much I feel that way, especially with my father, that we were around, or that deeply he wanted us around for his benefit, uhm, I keep thinking of how my mother had all sorts of very good attitudes about things and I don't, I suppose I've just never known how much she did the same thing, despite the fact that she would have, uhm, I don't know exactly what, how to put this but, that her theories were very good but I don't know how well she carried them out.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, as you talk, if, if I heard what you said literally, it would be almost as though your family consisted of you and your mother and your father.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Sometimes and FYC.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And that leaves 2 people missing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I'm not too sure what I did do about them or thought about them.  (Pause) And in the back of the, my mind, getting in the way of all this, is wondering what it was you thought sounded familiar.  (Pause) I almost feel I can't go much further in thinking my own thoughts because I'm not sure if I'm talking about what you were meaning.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which, of course, would defeat my real point, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

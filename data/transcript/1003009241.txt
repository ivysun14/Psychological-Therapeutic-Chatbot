<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so hi.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so [PATIENT NAME] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can you prescribe me something that, my, my dick, I mean, I like to get a hard on, and I don't have the money for Viagra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I mean, I don't.  My insurance -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does Medicare cover that, or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no they don't pay.  Okay, and anyway with this I work 2 days a week, it takes me with Depakote and Geodon it takes me when I wake up a good hour to 2 hours just to sit up.  And sometimes, you know, I got to be to, when, when I work, I got to be at work at 10:00, so it's very difficult for me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For me to, uh, function, you know, just function.  So then, I mean, the Seroquel I love.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Seroquel doesn't do me no wrong.  That I take 100 during the day and 100 at night before I go to sleep because, uh, that's the only thing that puts me to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm fine with Seroquel, but if you can, is it possible that you can, because the nurse me told to ask you, at in the hospital because that's the only reason I go off of it.  You know, you know, I mean, I go off of it for, for a little while and she calls the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you get to keep that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, is there anyway we can work on something?  You can -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's take a look and see what alls going on.  Um, so you're complaining of it's hard to get an erection -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or it's hard to sustain it, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard to ejaculate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, well, I, I never have sex, so it's, it's kind of hard -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To ejaculate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that because your wife doesn't want to, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she never wants to.  You know, she's, uh, she's doesn't have any horny bone, horny things in her body.  You know, but I still like to get, I, you know, I, I love the feeling of, you know, being able to get a hard on and have an orgasm.  You know, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm, I'm addicted to that, and when I can't do it, it destroys me as a man.  You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have erections in the morning when you wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, not all the time, you know, I can't remember, but I remember having a hard on once or sometimes, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I can't say no.  I cannot tell you no, but yes, I remember there was a time.  You know, not every morning because it, in the morning I'm dead.  You know, in the morning, forget about it.  I mean, you know, I probably can take even a Viagra and nothing happens, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you still on Depakote?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir, 1000 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A thousand mg -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking Seroquel 100 at night right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A 100 in the morning and 100 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Geodon 80 twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eighty, well, I'm, you told me I can take all the medication at nighttime [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So are you taking the 2 Geodons at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking the 2 Geodons.  You know, I, I usually take the Seroquel during the, the days that I'm not working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, in a day.  You know, but if I'm working I'll just, like, when I get home I take 100, then I before I go to bed, then I take another 100.  But I love Seroquel, you know, I love Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you like best about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, uh, it relax, you know, I can't tell you that it gets you stoned because it doesn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it, like, relaxes me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, relax, it just a very good feeling.  You know, very, very good feeling I get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, let's have you hop on the scale, see what you weight today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I gained some weight since the last time.  Wow!</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's it say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two ten.  What was I, 195 last time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've gone up a little bit there I suppose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Holy cow!  That's because I've been eat, I've been eating.  In the hospital I ate like crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, let's see.  Yeah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, she has no reason to call the police on me in the hospital on.  You know, I, she could just say, "Take it", and I would take it to deal with [INAUDIBLE] thing.  You know, she minds because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is where my problem started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told her that an alien came to me and told me a few things.  Told me she was my daughter, that she was also my wife, and there are a lot of things that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of alien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she looks like a human being.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Alien from another planet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From a, from a, other side of the universe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A space opened up [PHYSICIAN NAME] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she walked in to my room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In the living room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is, this is years ago, okay.  I've seen her one more time besides that time.  But sometimes she communicates with me, sometimes, not all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, but she might just want to talk about aliens.  I tell her that they're going to destroy this world.  You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be.  Although you know, there's a lot of asteroids and comets out there too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but they, they tell, no, they believe that the human race is the garbage, the, the, we as humans are the worst that there is in a life form.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what she says.  And she says that I have many daughters, you know, she says I have many daughters and they're all, she says I am the oldest.  The oldest that there is.  Okay, but I don't want to get into that.  You know, I don't want to get into that because that's not important.  All I know is when I tell her that, "Honey, after I die I'm going to come back and get you," you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and you know, you can be with your family and everything else, you know.  She, she goes nuts on me [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  I might have some Viagra samples for you somewhere around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll have to look and see where we got those.  Hold on just a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're going to give me some Seroquel today [PHYSICIAN NAME]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just, do you have Seroquel at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm almost, I'm almost out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well have a seat there, and let me see what I got.  Now, here's also is a patient voucher, it gets you something on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have to mail this in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For Seroquel?  Thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  So are you going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me see if I got anything here, I may have some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you thinking of changing my medicine or, or my [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we'll talk about it.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, when I try to quit it, I'm almost breaking my jaw.  My teeth, I already cracked a couple.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you try to quit what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depakote and Geodon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I, I clench my teeth so bad that I've already broke 2, 2 teeth, and I don't have no money to fix them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you get like a tight jaw?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I clench it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when do you get that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All day long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you quit taking the medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let's see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  God knows I need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, there's some for you, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay [PHYSICIAN NAME], thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you going to, you going to change it or no?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're saying when you stop the medicine you get a tight jaw, not when you take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not tight jaw, I just keep, you know, what I'm talking about?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it goes away, but I always break a couple of tooth, but it's more important for me going under a medication that I can, that I can function if there is a medication out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't take anything for your heart, no nitrates -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No nitroglycerin -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  I'm, I'm healthy.  That, that they said, um, next time we do a blood test, uh, I want you to check my cholesterol because I remember -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A long time ago when we did a blood test -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The doctor told me, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] usually, but she saw me once after I took the blood test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said that my cholesterol was high.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, did you have any in the hospital?  Did they check your cholesterol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I told her to do that, but she said she can't do that.  She, she told me just do that after I, uh, uh, the next time I take a blood test, go for a blood test.  She just took the blood test, that's it.  Because I told, uh, the black lady -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, uh-huh, yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I told her, can she do that because I wanted to do that.  She said no.  I wish she would have done that because I want to see a doctor in case if I have high cholesterol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, who's your family doctor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you know, you did see, like, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], those guys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can follow up with them.  They have an office on [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, I'll just call 411.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So the, um, Seroquel, does that help you to relax at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very much.  I mean, it's the only that puts, if I don't take it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even when I stop taking -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll say you could take 2 of these then at night if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Even if I stop medication -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always take the Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay?  I, I, I have, I have never stopped taking Seroquel.  I always take it, and, uh, it, it really, it's a comfortable 8 hours sleep, you know, comfortable 8 to 10 hours sleep I get.  And I can't do that.  I mean, if I just take Depakote and Geodon I can't fall asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> By the way, this thing says, expires [DATE].  They might still honor it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, you can try that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll increase the Seroquel a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'll probably help you sleep and relax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So 200 mg at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two hundred mg each dose because you're only taking 100 once a day now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you're taking it twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so let's, so take the 200 at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just at bedtime?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and if you get nervous during the day you could take an extra 1 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> During the day.  So we'll give you a little extra for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let me get you a different prescription for that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you did, you did give -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you a different one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Thanks [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I love you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I love you too, okay.  So you're doing pretty well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing real well, you know, it just, she goes nuts when I, I mean, I try not talk about my daughter, you know, and my wife, or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I want her to know that there are aliens, and there's lots -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what's the name of the alien?  Do you have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a name for that alien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is her name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I want, I want her to know that there is another side -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's the other side to get, life form filled for the life form.  There's a, you got a universe here -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we got another universe here.  There's another earth over here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a parallel world?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, you know, and, and I, they say I am the one that's going to judge this planet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I am the one that at the end -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I die I will judge this planet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  That's kind of like what God does, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, whatever.  But that's what they're saying.  There's no one older than -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're saying I'm the oldest.  There's no one older.  And I know it sounds crazy, but she's beautiful.  Beautiful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you wish your wife was more like her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I mean, I mean listen [PHYSICIAN NAME], my wife is this mother of my son -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will, I will never let her go.  Never let her go.  Okay, never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even if she divorces me, she's going to be with me after life.  Okay.  I will never let her go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you, are you, by the way, did you quit smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much you smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, 2 packs a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I quit for a while, you know, with the, the what was that?  Chantix?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to try it again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I enjoy smoking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You enjoy smoking, but you know, there's a lot of health risks in smoking.  Strokes, heart attacks [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is Depakote and Seroquel again.  I mean Geodon and Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, this is what you were discharged from the hospital.  You were on the Geodon twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Seroquel we just increased that a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you're not changing my medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we're giving you just a little more Seroquel during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  And the Depakote stays the same, and you got the Viagra now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm stuck with Depakote and Geodon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know what's nice about Geodon is it keeps your cholesterol under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so stay with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, the cholesterol tends not go up so much like it does with the Seroquel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can sometimes cause that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the gray one, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, by the way, if you worry about your cholesterol, you should really be worried about your smoking because that's got more hazards [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I love smoking.  I don't mind dying.  I'm not, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's going to be a beautiful life when I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then why are you worried about your cholesterol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just, yeah, you're right, why?  You're right, beacuse there's a beautiful life after -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, the biggest risk factor is your smoking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.  Yeah, I don't worry about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I forgot -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless you want to niacin and oat bran -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm fine, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, any suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are you kidding me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing, no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's the worst sin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To want you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To kill your body because your body is your temple.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay?  Your body is your temple.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You don't do that to the body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you hearing any voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, if, if I, if I, if I didn't believe in that [PHYSICIAN NAME] I would be dead tonight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would take all my medication, one shot if I didn't believe that the body is your temple.  You should respect and honor your body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you.  And so how is your sleep at night?  Can you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get 8 hours of sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get, I get good sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's pretty good, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's why I gained.  I, you know, in the hospital I was eating like crazy, getting everybody elses food.</p>

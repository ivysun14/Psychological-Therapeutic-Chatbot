<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what did he say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently nothing is wrong and I'm not sure I agree with that. Obviously my hand is in pain and stuff. It's been better for the past few days and stuff like that, but the whole idea that if I use my hand too much it will make it unusable he said was incorrect. He gave the analogy of if you want to get fit you do that by exercising whatever part of the body, and your body likes to be used. He thinks the pain is part of my whole — not just being vague because he ends up having this conversation with lots of people, but that the long pain is caused by some unconscious fear of not being able to use that body part anymore, except that I do certain things, they hurt. I do other things, they don't hurt. Then he gave the analogy of a smoke detector going off and half the time the smoke detector goes off you're just cooking - there isn't a fire. You shouldn't ignore it but then you see, "Oh, wait. I'm just cooking."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is smoke, but it's not Jonasgerous. And you have pain, but it's not Jonasgerous. 00:01:38</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have a new wrist brace now because the old one actually broke up on Saturday, so I had a day and a half of not having a functional wrist brace. We tried gluing it back together and it totally, totally failed. Actually now I have two wrist braces because he also gave me a soft one to wear when I sleep; though I tried wearing it last night and it was actually really, really uncomfortable so I switched over to this one. And then for part of the time I actually took of the wrist brace when I was trying to sleep and then that hurt, too, and so it's like I still need to protect it yet. I guess the other thing is also my body's desire to protect itself is also some of the pain. He told me I should get off the Vicodin since it's really strong stuff, especially because it's not completely erasing the pain anyways. He said do whatever you need. He said to me whether or not I want to go back to work that I shouldn't just stop using my hand. If I want, take Ibuprofen and use ice and all that stuff and wear the wrist brace all the time and it was fine. It just seems like really not a helpful answer. 00:03:05</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So basically what he is saying is there is no known reason for the pain that he can see and there is no indication that there is anything to worry about in terms of losing functionality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He also was saying so what if I get — everybody ends up getting arthritis anyway. I might end up getting it in my hand sooner. I feel like if I have arthritis I won't be able to function anymore. I'll have to give up doing anything at all because I won't be able to use my hand. I don't really know enough about arthritis actually. This was all hypothetical though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not something he's talking about having now, but down the road.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did, I guess with the diagnosis to make the wrist brace mention that it was for arthritis pain. I'm going to go back in a month and when I go back in a month I'm going to get an x-ray and stuff. I guess the x-ray will show if I have arthritis. I feel like I basically can't actually do anything about that; but then he said my hand was always going to be hurting. I don't get how that works with the whole "what if it has arthritis"? 00:04:24</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe asking him some questions about what arthritis means and doing a little bit of research? I know enough to know that arthritis in a joint does not mean that you can't use that joint. Arthritis is simply an inflammation that leads to pain and there are different types. There is the more common type of arthritis, which is something that most people at some point in time later in life develop is not debilitating. It's painful but it's manageable and people can still continue to use their bodies. That's the most common type and it sounds like what he is describing, something that you might have in that hand earlier than some other older adults because you use that hand more. People do function with pain. Obviously that's something that you need to learn to cope with if that's the case, but it doesn't sound like that's where you are now. He is using arthritis pain to get your brace covered. It sounded like that's something that you might expect later on down the road, but it sounds like he's saying that right now there is no known cause of what you're feeling. You didn't have x-rays, so if there is some inflammation in the joint which is what arthritis means . . . 00:05:55</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure why he didn't have me do the x-rays instead of having me do them the next time, but I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am. It really sucks that my original doctor, Dr. Hughes, is retired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt that you could really trust in him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like he would probably have something more useful to say and maybe he would have actually thought it was carpal tunnel, and if so I don't know if that would mean anything different or I would have had to get surgery or something. The doctor ruled out carpal tunnel. I'm not sure why; and that's just really confusing because the problem was that day my hand wasn't hurting, at least at that time. And it's like there's numbness or pain. Sometimes it's numbness and sometimes it's pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you think it's carpal tunnel? Is that something you've had before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's just a guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Based on . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Based on the fact that Sydney has had carpal tunnel. Also him realizing and self-diagnosing when he was typing at his old job and eventually everything got better. I don't know it's carpal tunnel but I'm still not convinced it's not an actual injury that needs some sort of treatment because my hand shouldn't be hurting in the normal use of it. It's not like I'm doing anything particularly outrageous, I don't think. When I was on the archaeological dig — sure. 00:07:44</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what might be some other reasons that you're noticing pain? There wasn't an injury; you're not using it in ways that are unusual like you were on that archaeological dig.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. I'm honestly not sure. I'm typing less and when I do have to type it's worse or something because I graduated. I'm very, very, very, very underemployed right now; therefore the week before I got injured I actually went to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The week before you noticed it hurting, right? There wasn't any. . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there wasn't an event the week before and I actually started noticing it at work and I stopped for the day. I was like, "My hands hurt. That means I've worked enough for today," which is reasonable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now is that something that you would typically notice? If you were typing a paper back in the days when you were at school and typing a lot, would your hands hurt at the end of the day if you had typed a lot? 00:08:58</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. They would hurt if I wrote a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's not really out of the norm for you to notice that at the end of the day if you had done something repetitively that you would have some pain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I'm knitting I will eventually notice pain or numbness depending, and then I'll stop for a while until it goes away and then I'll knit again. Sometimes with studying, sometimes with dying now but that used to not be the case. It's been there on and off. It wasn't until the archaeological dig that it didn't instantly go away either right when I stopped doing the activity or a few minutes later. There it went on for a whole weekend after I'd stopped doing the activity and was trying to limit the movement in my hand. He did say that was an actual injuring event. Nothing happened this time, but I was noticing maybe it was just enough times sleeping on my wrist funny or after not having used the wrist brace and stuff. When I first started using it, it hurt when I was trying to wear it to go to sleep, which why I was sort of resistant to wearing it to sleep, but then it would hurt more if I didn't wear it. I've finally gotten used to it but now have the new one that is different from my old one. It fits differently and I'm trying to get used to this. I can't really tell. I don't know what's going on. I wish that he had given me a more useful answer. 00:11:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you hoping he would say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he would actually give me a diagnosis and say like, "Don't use your hand for two weeks and you'll be fine," or something like that or perform the surgery and then it would be fine. Or if he had just said . . . I don't know. Theoretically this is the best outcome because he said I'm fine except the problem is it still hurts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't do anything to make the pain go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He didn't do anything to make the pain go away. He did at least given me a prescription for a new wrist brace, which does help I think. I do think the fact that Dr. Hughes was worrying about the whole pinched-nerve thing because it does hurt less if I'm wearing the wrist brace but it still does hurt to do things when I am wearing it, like I guess that can't be the only thing then because if it were the only thing I wouldn't hurt myself when I knitted or did anything like that. I guess maybe because I'm struggling against the wrist brace to do certain things. When I was doing the paperwork for the appointment and trying to write with the wrist brace on my hand and had really, really, really awful handwriting because I didn't have as much control and it was hurting me a little to grip the pen, so there it was like I was struggling against the wrist brace. [00:12:57] This one, I guess goes around more and so is like a little bit more protective than the old one was. It's harder to struggle against it. It's also limiting my ability. I guess if he had given me some sort of definitive answer like, "Yes, you should always wear your wrist brace when you are doing a risky activity," or "You could just wear it to bed every night and, once the pain goes away, you don't have to wear it all when you're doing risky activities." If he had given me some sort of instructions, at least, even if he hadn't done anything to make the pain go away, if he had given me some actual instructions that would have been useful; and he didn't. 00:13:45</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like he left it up to your judgment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really problematic because I don't trust my judgment on this anymore. No matter what, I have to use my hand and it seems like things hurt and sometimes they don't hurt right away, they hurt after doing it for a half-hour or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How intense has the pain been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today it has not been bad. Yesterday was fine during the day, though in the evening it was hurting more right before I was going to bed and I was really wishing I could take a Vicodin. I didn't but I still have the leftover Vicodin because she prescribed me exactly enough for the ten days between doctor one and the specialist, three pills a day. Most days I ended up taking two pills and there were only a couple of days that I took three pills, so I still have a bunch of extra Vicodin. I guess I shouldn't be using it. The pain hasn't been at such high levels as it was before that I guess I don't feel as justified in using it. But the pain has gone down. 00:15:15</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One way of thinking about it is that pain is our body's signal that something is wrong. Sometimes that's a really useful signal, like with a smoke detector when the smoke is actually a precursor to raging fire and we want to pay attention to it. But a lot of times there are pain signals that we experience that aren't really useful to know about anymore. If you have a chronic pain injury that is an old injury and it has healed as much as it's going to heal and it still hurts, then that pain is like a misfiring signal. It's just like when you're cooking and there is smoke, but there is smoke because you're cooking food on a stove so there is no Jonasger there. Sometimes our body's nerves are not very precise. They feel pressure and they feel temperature and that's it, and they can be really imprecise in what we experience from those signals. Sometimes we feel pain in a space that nothing is really going on. There's not even smoke from cooking on the stove. [00:16:29] It's just that our body is perceiving something that doesn't make any sense. There is not necessarily any Jonasger. There is not necessarily any problem. It doesn't mean you're not feeling it, but there is nothing behind that. It might be that, for whatever reason, your nerves are firing and there is not necessarily an injury, may be assessed for that. You're going to have another follow-up in a month just in case there is something that got missed, but you said the pain is less now than it was. Maybe things are coming back into alignment where, since there is nothing physical going on, the signals are starting to wear themselves out. 00:17:20</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. It's just weird. I'm wondering if I'm going to start it off again if and when I do go back to work and stuff. I would have gone back to work today but then I was feeling sick this morning so I'm going to work tomorrow. I'm just afraid then after working tomorrow and possibly if this is sort of what I end up doing if it's work for three or four hours and then the pain hurts too much so stop working for the day, how am I supposed to have a job — like an actual full-time job if the pain gets to be too much at that point? 00:18:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was the pain too intense to work through, or is it the pain mixed with fear that you're doing damage too much to work through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the pain and the fear mixed with the fear of damage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's an important difference because I know there was a lot of fear before you saw the doctor, and it sounds like there is still some because you're not totally sure that you agree with his assessment. But I know before you were talking to him there was a lot of fear about what did the pain mean? Did it mean that this was going to be debilitating? Did it mean that you weren't going to have function in that hand anymore? If you couldn't function with that hand, how would you manage? There was a lot of fear wrapped up in what the pain meant. [00:18:44] There is a big difference between managing pain and managing those fears. Most people can learn to cope with pain. If it's around all the time, then we just do. We get sort of desensitized to it. It sounds like he's not expecting this is going to be pain that lasts forever. He seemed pretty confident that the pain wasn't linked to function. It sounds like you can go to work, see how you feel, and let those worries that it means something foreboding, leave those options aside. You've done the responsible thing - you went and saw the specialist. You scheduled another follow-up. You're doing what you're supposed to be doing to take care of yourself. 00:19:44</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really annoying that I can't really do anything else, that it still does hurt sometimes and it's not completely back to normal. If it were completely back to normal I could just go about my daily activities without using the wrist brace. Today I was able to make lunch, so that was something. I'm back to being able to drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good. And you feel comfortable doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly. Driving home from my parents' on Saturday night was really, really scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a long drive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being at night and I was going 70 in a 65 zone and people were passing me. These people must be doing 80 or 90 because it wasn't that crowded. It was a Saturday night and not that many people are driving on Saturday night, so why not drive as fast as you can, clearly? I was just so terrified the entire time that I was going to lose control of the vehicle. I didn't, but I was so afraid. 00:20:56</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you think you were going to lose control of the vehicle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was a little bit tired and it just felt like so much work to hold on to the wheel and make sure I stay in my own lane and all that because I'm not used to it anymore. I used to be able to do this all the time and think nothing of driving 80 miles an hour if it were late at night and not that many people on the road. Now it's like anything above 50 is scary because I just don't do it every day like I used to, or every week. In high school when I had my driver's license I was driving on the highway at least once a week, usually more than that. 00:21:47</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just feel out of practice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very out of practice. When I first started driving when I was in high school it wasn't scary then, so I don't know why now all of a sudden it's like the scariest thing ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you're just feeling fearful of a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that one is reasonable and it's just that we all train ourselves not to be afraid of driving, where really driving is this really, really, really Jonasgerous activity. It's only out of necessity that we don't think about it when we're doing it. You are traveling really fast in this box of metal. There is a bunch of other boxes of metal also driving really fast; and if someone else loses control, even if you're in complete control, you could still get hit even if you do everything right. [00:22:48] Maybe also because Sydney's car is smaller than I've been driving before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel more vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I can feel it more when I'm being pushed by the wind and stuff like that. Day to day stuff like driving around town is fine. It's only on the highway that this happens but then I can feel the wind. It's like a Honda Civic or something. It's tiny. I learned to drive in a station wagon and the only other car that I had really driven with regularity before this was my mom's mini-van, which is also really big.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very different feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Then you're all high up and you can see everything, where with this car you're really low and down to the road. I don't know if it's actually rational that I should feel this way, but it was just like I'm never driving on the highway at night again, which I may or may not be able to. It's not like it's that often that I have to drive on the highway anyway. Sydney couldn't drive home because he broke his glasses and he needs to get new glasses. He's feeling sick today so we couldn't even take him to get new glasses. At least now I have my hand, so I can do these things. I don't know why I'm scared of driving. I wasn't scared of driving when I first started driving when I was younger. There's no reason I should be scared of driving. 00:24:38</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There may be something to that adolescent invulnerability. You feel a lot of awareness now of what the actual risks are with the ability to pay attention to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was a teenager we had Driver's Ed and they told us about all the risk of something. You watched all the videos like Red Asphalt and whatnot. We were required to learn this information before even setting out in a vehicle really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is true. Adolescents do have documented abilities to not pay attention to things like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And still get 100 percent on their driver's test?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is a difference between memorizing information and how it's processed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yes, adolescents can absolutely memorize a lot of information. It's how people get through high school, but your frontal lobes are not actually completely developed then and that's the part of your brain that's responsible for processing risks and forethought and planning and being able to project the way you're doing all these risks. It's not just remiss that teenagers tend to think that they're invincible; it's actually just part of development. They haven't yet completely developed with some of the functions that allow us to feel really vulnerable and do a lot of that forethought. You're an adult now and you can calculate these risks and keep them present and not think, "Ah, that's not going to happen to me. It might happen to somebody else, but it's not going to happen to me." That's a pretty typical line of thought for a young adolescent. That stuff might be true may answer it on a test because they know that's what they said; that's what was in the book — but it's not going to happen to me. I'm different. 00:26:36</p>

<p>CLIENT: We now have computerized tests. I forget how long they give you to do it, but for my learner's permit I finished it in four minutes and got everything right. Four minutes; that's all it took.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't take a lot of thought. That's pretty cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I probably since then have forgotten almost everything on there, especially because the stuff that was already in Driver's Ed was a lot more extensive than what ended up being on the learner's permit test they give. Maybe there are 20 questions. I don't remember what percentage you needed to get right. The first question was a trick question. It was about alcohol and one shot versus a bottle of beer versus a glass of wine — which has more alcohol? The answer was they're all equal. (Chuckles) Somehow I remember that. I guess you learn things like if there is a green light that's been green for a while you should pay attention, not just go through, because it might turn yellow. And things like yellow actually mean stop if you can and not zoom through it. Those things. I don't think we were required to memorize statistics as to how many people die in car accidents in a year. We had to do some insurance stuff and that one was really annoying. 00:28:03</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm surprised you're nervous so much about your learner's permit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am. I don't know why. I guess I just remember useless facts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a lot of years ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was 11 years ago, in fact. (chuckles) I guess I'm just so out of practice because all of college I wasn't driving except when I was helping move for summers or . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is a big difference between knowing stuff and practicing it. You can know a lot of rules of the road and not feel comfortable driving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think even after I got my actual driver's license I don't think I remembered most of the things that I learned from Driver's Ed. It wasn't like I was thinking about a lot of them most of the time. I don't know how far you actually have to park from a fire hydrant, I just know that they don't really ticket for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So practical knowledge versus (both laugh).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet the fear that you felt on the highway is a lot less to do with rules and more to do with just feeling fearful. 00:29:20</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the fact that they were going 80 miles an hour or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just had a sense that this didn't feel safe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't want to be going 65, which is the limit, and then have everyone be honking at me; and I didn't want to be in the right lane because all the merges were happening in the right lane.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of risky, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate merging so much I will do whatever I have to avoid being in lanes that merge. It didn't help that the rear side-view mirrors were off because I didn't think to adjust them. Sydney has them different from normal people. I guess he had heard on car-dot-something that most people use side-view mirrors as an extension of the rear-view mirror and turn to the left to look at their blind spot before changing lanes or turning or whatever; whereas if you tilt your rear-view mirrors a certain way you can actually see that blind spot, which is what Sydney did. Which is all well and good, except I was totally not used to it and I was looking at it and thinking . . . 00:30:23</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was probably different for your height versus his height or where you sit in the car versus he sits when he drives.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, too, but it was also really I just couldn't figure it out so I still had to look in the rear-view mirror and look to the side and just not use the side mirrors because I couldn't figure out what they were supposed to be a view of really. So I should have really set them myself, but realized that when I was on the highway and was like, "Okay, I can't really do anything at this point." I just wanted to get home and was like, "Okay, I'll just stay in my lane even though people are going fast." I was feeling terrified when there was a giant truck next to me. I hate driving next to trucks. That was true when I was a teenager because they teach you the whole "you need to give space on both sides of the truck and in front and in back" and same thing with a motorcycle. A motorcycle is just like a truck except it is a motorcycle. Even if I didn't know that rule, though I guess not really a rule, it's just a precaution, giant truck they can't see you. It's huge. It could crush you at any moment, especially when it's not so good about staying in its own lane. 00:31:43</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It certainly made sense that you want to be far away from them. Well I'm glad you made it back safely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am, too. I was so worried that I wasn't going to and that I was going to crash. I was wondering why Sydney trusted my driving and thought that I was doing a helpful job or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he feel comfortable and safe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So two people in the same car — one felt safe and one didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He also didn't have his glasses so everything was blurs. He can see a lot better without his glasses than I can because his eyes are a lot stronger than mine are, but still I'm wondering if that doesn't have something to do with it. He finds it relaxing to be going fast at night. I guess also because you don't have to do anything but stay in your lane really, because it's not like you're stopping at red lights. It's not like you're turning. You could be passing people, in theory. 00:32:46</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it like for you as a passenger? If he had had his glasses and he drove would you have felt comfortable in the car or do you feel nervous as a passenger as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually feel comfortable in the car. I'm not thrilled with nighttime driving on the highway even as a passenger, but it's not nearly as scary; like I don't have this fear that he's going to lose control over the car the same way that I have the fear that I would lose control. There was a while after I had the car accident where I was really afraid of any sort of driving, and no matter who was the driver I was really, really afraid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now you feel more afraid if you're the driver?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not really trusting yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or trusting Sydney's car, perhaps. Maybe if I were driving a truck I would feel differently, but I actually would probably feel more terrified because I would be afraid of tipping over. If I were driving an SUV, though those also roll over, too. If I were driving a mini-van, I guess. 00:33:53</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like that's what you're used to driving because your mom . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mini-vans and station wagons. I am used to driving those two cars and that's it. Because when my mom got the mini-van . . . my dad used to have this other van that was like a really sad van and I never drove it then and then he got this new car and he was like, "No one drives this car but me," so I've never actually driven dad's new car, which is now . . . I guess it's still this new car that my mom has my grandma's car but now both of them have small cars, so I've never driven either of those. That's not true. I've driven grandma's car because it was the time I was driving for her when I realized that her license needed to be taken away and said, "I'm going to take over the driving," but I wasn't driving it on the highway. I was driving it near home, so that wasn't scary. But this is my first experience in a while of driving small cars on the highway. I guess I drove on the highway when we had the concert at the synagogue or wherever it was and it was a good . . . 00:35:25</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long ago was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This was maybe two weeks before the spring concert, so it was in May. It was with Sydney's car, mind you, so it wasn't that long ago that I was driving home but we weren't driving as fast and I wasn't tired. You know when we drove home from my parents' house, we left at ten. When we were leaving this concert we left around eight or something because we were trying to get back by nine. It was still dark out but . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you weren't as tired and I think that has something to do with where your thoughts go and what you are feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I were really, really tired, wouldn't I just not be sensing anything at all and be like, "Okay, I'm driving whatever?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your subconscious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It used to be like if I was driving and just wasn't paying attention, my subconscious would take over and there was an autopilot and I would, you know, sometimes like there were two ways that I could leave the house usually and one would be the way that I would drive to school and the other would be the way that I was driving to work. I think the drive to school one was the autopilot so sometimes I would just . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you just kind of turn that way without thinking? Yeah, how alert are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was able to compensate for that and it's not that hard to drive the other way to get to work from there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you would recognize that you've gone off course. 00:37:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Driving is scary. Maybe I should just not do it on the highway. Even before I met Sydney I was never driving ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how much your responses and what you feel anxious about have to do with how much you have taken on recently? Because you have been, as he has felt less capable of doing things and as he has felt more depressed, you have taken on more and more responsibilities for yourself and for taking care of him and in the relationship. You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself, but I think there was this period of time in your relationship where you got to enjoy being taken care of a little bit — not having to be so independent, not having to be responsible for everything. And now there has been a long stretch where you are taking on more and more. I wonder if it's feeling like a lot that is making your anxiety about everything just kind of . . . 00:38:22</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. And it probably doesn't help that I was leaving from my parents' place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's also usually tense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was so pissed off at my dad. The last time I stayed overnight at my parents' place with a significant other was when I had brought Jonas over and that time my dad was like, "You guys need to sleep in separate beds." One of us was on the couch and one of us was on the air mattress. Then this time he was like, "You and Sydney can't sleep in the same room." It's not like we have another bedroom or anything like that. I was like, "If you had other friends who are your age and they were unmarried and they were staying here, would you have them stay in separate rooms?" He was like, "No. You're my daughter." Blah, blah, blah. I guess I'm 27. Now it will be okay with Cullen and Doreen. He's like, "Why don't you just get married?" I'm like, "We're dating for six months." Sydney and I have been dating for six months. It's not responsible to tell someone to get married after six months just so they can sleep in the same bedroom. I mean we could end up sleeping in the same bedroom if I was like, "It is fine. It's not your business. You let me do it last time. It's not your job to impose your religious views on other people." Because otherwise one of us would have had to sleep downstairs where there are no doors or anything. That's not cool. They don't have that kind of set-up. Now I'm just like, "Okay, fine. If you want to insist on this I'll just never stay over for Shabbat again." [00:40:06] It's that simple. Just don't stay overnight because it isn't worth it. If it were like an across-the-board policy or something it would be one thing, but for some reason if I do it, it's wrong. But if someone his age does it then it's fine. 00:40:28</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An age thing or a parent thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, maybe it's a parent thing. But he knows that we normally stay over at each other's places and stuff. It would be just this one night that we would be maintaining this fantasy or something - this very, very, very impractical fantasy that doesn't really work when you don't have extra bedrooms for people to sleep in. It's not like we would have any privacy anyways even with the room. I don't know what he thought was going to happen. It's not like we were going to have sex considering my parents there. Because my parents were there and the doors don't go all the way down. There's a gap this big so you can hear things through the doors. [00:41:16] Neither of us were feeling really well anyways. It's not his business what I do and him trying to be holier than thou and getting annoyed about certain things about Shabbat and now he's just trying to get everyone to be as religious as him. It was really, really frustrating because I made a conscious decision not to be orthodox and that's my decision and I'm not going to all of a sudden stop seeing Sydney or go back to not touching guys before marriage or something like that. I was really pissed off. 00:42:00</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're really mad at your dad about a lot of different things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really mad about my dad. There was also a problem because Sydney was feeling lots of social anxiety and was nervous about my parents and thought my parents were going to disapprove of him because he's depressed and unemployed and I was like, "I'm depressed and unemployed." They know that he's financially independent and stuff and I don't think they are judging him for that. They've never said anything to him, but he's just anxious and he ended up not coming along to Friday night dinner. Also what happened was we couldn't get to his nice clothes because boxes and boxes and boxes from the move that haven't been settled because we haven't done second move. Dad was calling around to find clothes in Sydney's size to borrow. Sydney was feeling like he was being judged for not having nice clothing when part of it is that he's been too depressed to go out and get nice clothes that fit since he's gained weight. [00:43:19] Then we both ended up not going to lunch the next day because we were supposed to have Kiddush. The whole point was the Kiddush, which then officially was because of dad's birthday which is coming up this week. I slept through it. I thought they were going to wake me up before they went to shul, even though they were going to go to shul earlier than we planned but they didn't I had no way of waking up because I didn't have an alarm set, so I just left. I woke up and it was noon and my dad was like, "Are you guys going to lunch?" They came back and I was like, "I don't think so." We ended up staying in because I was feeling . . . I also mixed Tylenol and Vicodin, which . . . 00:44:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is too much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Too much acetaminophen. Because Friday night I was in pain. I hadn't taken anything before I left to go to dinner. I asked if they had Ibuprofen and they had Tylenol and they were like, "Is Tylenol okay?" I'm like, "Okay." Then when I went home I took the Vicodin and as soon as I took the Vicodin I felt dizzy. I was like, "Wait. They both have the same action ingredient." Sydney looked it up on the Internet and he was like, "Yeah, that's bad." It wasn't like an overdose; it was just like you're not supposed to mix these two. Since then I've been fine, but it did cause me to sleep in all of Saturday and be tired all day and stuff. 00:44:51</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were really angry. You weren't feeling well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think I was still feeling the after-effects of that when I was driving home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can affect how you think about things and how you were feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess if you don't feel completely in control of yourself it's harder to feel in control of the vehicle you're driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And I really do believe you're all one being. What you're feeling emotionally, how well rested you're feeling, what you're thinking, all the pain in your hand — all these things impact you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I slept for twelve hours. I should have been feeling well-rested.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But for some reason you did feel tired you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was late at night again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes when you sleep more than you are used to, your body is not used to that either. You just feel off-kilter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was a lot going on that made you sensitive to things that maybe at other times you would have kind of brushed off. It's also not just what was happening that one weekend, but what had been happening for you along the way. You were feeling with your dad, but there are lots of things you were angry about right now that we notice more or less. You're angry about the job search. You're angry about things not going the way you planned. You're angry about Sydney not recovering as quickly as you would have hoped. There are lots of things that simmer under the surface that you may or may not be paying attention to, but are affecting you anyway. 00:46:44</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I can really do anything about most of these things anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. But that doesn't mean they don't affect you. I'm not asking you necessarily to do something about them, but I think being aware of how they might impact you is important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Such that in the future I don't drive?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such that in the future that you attribute what you're feeling to the actual cause.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if that's actually going to make things better at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes knowing why we're feeling a certain way just helps us feel more settled because then it makes sense. It doesn't necessarily make the feeling go away, but it makes sense. Sometimes that makes it easier to manage, even if it doesn't make it go away. Why don't we stop there for today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We are on for Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you then.</p>

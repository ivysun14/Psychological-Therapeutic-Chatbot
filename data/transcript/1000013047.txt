<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, we had quite an uneventful Christmas. We went to Indianapolis like I told you. I felt so good about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then your (inaudible at 0:00:26.7) turned up. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really did. Five children. They have an older boy. Which tends to, he really tends to hang our oldest boy up, you know. He ceases to function like we know he can. And then the middle one got very, very quiet. Very scared. The little one, you know, nothing seemed to bother him. He still climbed and got into things. But, I don't know. There was some funny games being played. And I don't think that Susan and I really needed any kind of fun and games being played around us. 

</p><p>They're a couple that we really know. Probably better than we know any other couple. You know, it's not sit around and play boardgame and puzzle type stuff. It's when you really talk. And the first night went well. We sat around the fireplace and really enjoyed talking to them. But then gradually, I think we stayed too long for one thing. Gradually there began to be these games, you know. Somehow I feel like [Ronan the man,] (ph) feels very much like he has to prove his masculinity around me, you know. But, he's in theology. He came here and got a PhD in theology. He's got a string of degrees. He's one of these people who eventually make it through the divinity school here. You know, that's got 14 degrees before they make it through. 0:02:16.5

</p><p>I feel like he has to prove his masculinity. And he proves it by, you know, playing with his wife in front of us. He kind of, in a way he kind of embarrasses her. But, you know, I'd like for people to be free to do that. You know, to be able to touch their spouse. I'm not real hepped up on him touching my spouse, But, you know, he usually doesn't either. But this time it really put us ill at ease. But you know, after I left you Wednesday, I talked to Susan about some of the things that were bothering me on a sexual level too. It came to me I guess Wednesday that many of the things had very little to do with sex. They had to do with my feelings about myself. You know. And it is very, very hard (inaudible at 0:03:15.9) do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What he was doing was, you felt like he was doing something to her for your benefit. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And in the past, you know, in the past I guess because there's that freedom, you know. That's like in the privacy of your own home there's a lot of freedom. We probably, we did play around too. But it just wasn't there this time. It's disappointing that there wasn't any of that feeling. It also made me feel ill at ease. It's real funny. Because there's no easy way to say the way it sounds, it comes out so that you can get the feeling right. It's sort of almost, you know, kinda hanky-pankyish. It really sounds to you. It's more of a first degree [rapo] (ph) but with your own the mate (inaudible at 0:04:16.0) game he was playing. It really made me feel ill at ease.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: One of the, sounds like part of it was because it felt like a game. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It really did. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Probably there's something not real about this.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, we really talked and got a handle Sunday, Susan and I did, about this thing. Because something she feels like she's bothered by it. And she's faced with a problem too. You see, of course you know her therapist is Jan.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Ok. She's also faced with a very real problem. Because she really feels something for her therapist. It frightens her that, that may be a homosexual kind of feeling. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:23.3)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It also may mean that, you know, because she's fighting that fear that any kind of sexual act at all, you know, she denies herself because she can't separate, you know. This thing with her therapist and this thing with me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. She's kinda scared of what that means about her.

</p><p>PATIENT: She has said some things that have really and good and yet sometimes they've really hurt. Like she said that she'd rather be with Jan than be with me. You know, that doesn't feel real good. I can understand that, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't feel good at all. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't feel very good. Sometimes she likes to be with her therapist. Sometimes. So that I think this is really part of it. It's like, if she was having a lover it would be even different. A lover who's completely satisfying her. I don't think it would be any different. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Umm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That just leaves me nowhere. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know. It really leaves me nowhere. 0:06:35.5

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Even if you both think you don't know what your dealing with her in terms of a lot of fear. But you don't know what to do

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And it's working out just beautifully because we're both just working very hard. So when we come to bed we're both tired. And we can avoid it. And that begin to grow, you know. And when it becomes a thing, you know, a commitment, a hurdle. "Oh we've been meaning to have the Joneses over." "Oh we've been meaning to have a sexual relationship." That sort of thing. "Well, let's get it over with." My God, it just gets so complex that...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That it becomes a job.0:07:24.3

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just have some real goofy (ph) feelings about it. So, I just can't. You know, I can't respond. I can't feel a part of it. You know what I mean? She told me the other day that this was what, this was all she figured I thought about all the time. And it begins to, and I had some nerve, you know because hell, that does enter my mind quite a bit. I can rationalize by saying well, you know if I was receiving any kind of gratification it would be different. But I'm not, you know. And therefore it keeps getting bigger and bigger while the other things are getting shoved to the side. I don't like to do that. So, I don't know what to do. It becomes a thing in itself, you know. And that's one of the things that, I think we made a mistake in examining (inaudible at 0:08:32.0)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like, you'd like to kinda shake off thinking about it and then just be able to go ahead and do it without thought. Being so self conscious. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And so after our big talk on Sunday, Monday night we started to and stopped. And she said, "You know, I'm really angry at you. Real angry." I go, "What are you really angry at me for?" That sort of thing. So, yeah, I begin to resent her being in therapy. And me ever being in therapy because hell, things were better before we were ever in therapy. That's why I asked you about a cure. You know, when in the hell will we be able to operate on our own? You know. It's really great, but. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In spite of getting that feeling of because of therapy it's all so self conscious. It's all so examined, explored, and tied up. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's almost like nausea. Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:09:48.4

</p><p>PATIENT: So.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:09:55.6)

</p><p>PATIENT: I've also thought about, God, sometime Monday night I heard a strange noise downstairs. I got up went down, there was nothing there, you see. And I thought, "Maybe somebody will come in and just kill me right now." You know, in my sleep. I don't understand this business that I've got. In my kind of fixation on death at that unusual time, to come bounding up and I think, "You know, I could die tomorrow. And I just, whoa, where do I go and what do I do then?" You know. 0:10:31.0

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's very frightening to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, very frightening. I wish I could figure out what happens after you die, you know. I guess I could buy a little real estate somewhere for after I die, you know, I would know where I was going. That sort of thing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That terrible uncertainty. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not as bad now as it was say three or four months ago. I guess it's just because other things have taken it's place, you know. But it really bothers me sometimes when I begin to think about, you know, what happens when we die. You know, I am going to die. It scares me to death. But I don't want to get all (inaudible at 0:11:34.7)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But what's the feeling like? I mean, scary but I wonder if it would help to explore more what the scariness is (inaudible at 0:11:50.2)

</p><p>PATIENT: It's separation. Like, lonely. It's like general anesthesia. There's nothingness, you know, mouth's closed. You begin to fall through space. And then, the first thing you realize is you're in the recovery room and you're hurting. I find it scary, you know. There's no confidence in it. Where do, you know I can understand the body, where the body goes. That I understand quite well. But where do I go? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like, (inaudible at 0:13:04.4) where do I go and is it all alone? 0:13:06.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:13:08.7) completely alone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can see all the nice people in here, sitting around the funeral saying, "You know that Russell." You know, and there's Russell aching somewhere to be, you know, with them. Anyway I'd [kinda to die of cancer because you] (ph) eventually die from all that crap you're on. I took a trip to Fort Lauderdale on a train. And I remember arriving into a city and seeing the people on the train station. I looked at them and everything from the windows and they were all talking without thinking they weren't being seen at all. And I thought, "Gosh, this is what death is like." You know, where you can see what people are doing but they're not aware that you're there. And you have no way of communicating with them. No way of making yourself there for them. (inaudible at 0:14:19.3)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Like a little show] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then maybe, you know, that may be a feeling that I have a lot. To be really shut off from people. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [And be very, very much afraid of that.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. [Is there anything wrong but there's some times.] (ph) (inaudible at 0:14:54.8) there are times when I'm with people I'm very unhappy. But, you know, the lonely effect. Where it's like, three pals at the library at an hour when kids were in bed. Of course the kids gave me something to do. They were some companionship or something. But they're quite young so, you know a kind of mutual companionship. Kinda one time. At least I had that out (inaudible at 0:15:32.5) But it was so lonely. But that's what happened Monday.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You felt lonely on Monday?] (ph) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess so, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Somehow you couldn't even get through to each other. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible at 0:16:14.5) these feelings. That, you know, beginning to wonder if, you know. You know, I'm going to be this unhappy in marriage. To feel this lonely in marriage. I don't want to be alone, you know. In fact I have all of the responsibility but none of the advantages. I want to just, you know, have some of the advantages of being alone. And it feels pretty screwed up.0:16:45.5

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:49.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: I know I'm not alone, you know. Susan would say a couple of times when she'd kinda like take just a day off just to be by herself. That's scare me, you know. I felt that we were drifting way apart. I think we were probably too much into each other, to worry with, to see the forest for the trees. I resist drifting that far apart. I (inaudible at 0:17:24.3) the loneliness, I guess. You know, I guess I'm frightened of the things I might do to alleviate the loneliness. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Such as searching for someone else?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what I told her riding over on Sunday. I thought it might be, the best idea might be if I could, could I just find somebody else, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Which was kinda the, you know, I guess it was a threat that I used. Not that it's threatening but, you know. I guess it something I use. Sometimes I really feel that and she can't, you know she can't, I don't think she can really hear what I'm saying and she gets threatened by it. You know, he's going to run out and find somebody. She really can't hear what I'm saying. That I really need someone to be with. Like, doing more things with. You know, I can intellectualize it. Weigh all these things, I can say, "Well, she's in therapy and I'm in therapy and we're both examining a lot of things, you know. Which makes us both very critical and self analytic and all this sort of thing." When you're analyzing yourself you have very little to give anybody else. And, you know, yet, I mean how can you just say "Well, we're going to be in therapy for a couple of years and we'll just call this off that couple of years." You know, just because we're in therapy. 0:19:10.9

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Living through.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. We'll just stop living for a while. There are a lot of things that have really, really hurt me about it. And, yeah, I tend to feel frustration. I feel like, how can I be (inaudible at 0:19:37.6) than I'm going. I had no, didn't have any idea what to talk to you about sex, you know. I don't know what to examine, what to look at. It's almost like I wish I had given you a list of things, you know if we ran out of things to talk about you'd say "Well, let's take a look at this today."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think that you're in kind of a morphis (ph) feeling right now. (inaudible at 0:20:11.0) "I'm feeling hurt so let's stop for now." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I sense feeling very hurt by Susan some way pulling back, holding back, you're not with me.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. That, it happened before. It happened before when I've really needed a person, someone that he really let me down. And I really needed someone going through adolescent stuff and understand the problems I was having in adolescence. There was nobody. I really needed somebody to understand the problems I was having when I was first married. There was nobody. So I said, "Well, you know, I can make it on my own." And that sort of thing. But I really, I really don't think I can make it on my own. I don't really stop and think about it. I don't stop and think about that very much now. Pretty much busy convincing myself, I think oh, yeah. And that's why sometimes I think, well, why come over here, you know? Just hear myself rap for an hour, you know. I don't know. 0:21:51.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Positive] [ph] feeling, "I don't want to kinda count on having somebody." For fear they won't be there, somehow. That really puts into a thing where I'm feeling that I feel about how much I like to hear and some of us (inaudible at 0:22:17.4) caring and giving a hard time. (inaudible at 0:22:21.0)

</p><p>PATIENT: The other thing that I guess really is hard and I really don't have any sense of where we are, you know? I really don't have any sense of how these things hit you, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean in terms of how I feel about it all? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or how I feel about you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:23:00.5)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Things like that. You know, I really don't know where you are, you know? About me, you know. It's a funny, it's a funny role. If you were giving me a physical exam, "I'm going to prescribe X medicine." That would be one thing. If you were giving me a physical exam, "I'm going to take out X organ." But, it's not like that. Somehow it doesn't feel like that. It feels like, you know. Like I know that I must have said things that upset you, but I have no way of knowing, you know, what I have, you know. Or is that important, so you know. l guess I'm still trying to define where I am or something. It's new and, it's not new anymore is it? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nuh uh. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just (inaudible at 0:24:08.8.) I don't know what, there's nothing I'm putting on the scale to weigh out. I can't. There's no commodity that I'm taking home in my pocket. And that's where I guess I am. The other thing really, as I said, probably that analogy is not as good as the one that just a worry that I just, you know. How do you feel? Where are you? Is that a valid question to ask you? You're here for a reason, you know. I don't know whether you're supposed to be my friend or whether you're supposed to be someone who would become my friend and will obstruct your ability to look at me. You know, so, I really don't know what you're function is or are you? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Very unsure about both how I feel and in some sense what my role is. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Uh huh. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess tired of it. To where you sometimes say, in essence, when are you going to tell me? Somehow I am collecting data and this is that and some kind of answer. 0:25:31.9

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't think, the other thing I don't think I had thought about this. I don't think I want you to be my mother. I don't think I want you to be my lover. These are roles that I might try to put you in, you know. I just can't get a handle. I guess if I can just make it through without having to put you in a role of being my lover or my mother, you know. It might be, it might be well, but still, I don't know, you know, where you go or what do you do? Do you go "whew?" when I leave? Do you get mad at me, or? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do I have any feelings? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Do you have any feelings, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) Especially about you. Can I relate this to you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think I'd just be, if I had some feelings I'd bring them out. I'm sure it would take some time, you know, to feel comfortable with a person. And I feel like I'm feeling comfortable with you. If I got mad at you I feel like I'd want to say so. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't think of what else it could be. I haven't felt shocked

</p><p>PATIENT: You haven't felt shocked?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I felt like it was really (inaudible at 0:27:06.)1 Some things I've said must have shocked you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I didn't feel that. I think I do feel and understand and I don't know of a way to get it (inaudible at 0:27:26.9) I don't feel like a person to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I haven't, I just I haven't really wanted you to be a person, per say. It's sort of like nausea, you know? I don't know how you, I don't know what your experience with nausea has been. But I can understand after a while that it's like sick for hours with nausea, you know. And I know that if I went ahead and vomited I'd feel much better. And that's really how I feel. I don't. I wish I could, you know, I wish I could, you know, really let you just have everything. But I don't know how to say everything, you know? I know I have been asked to say everything. I have every position waiting for me. I start in with Susan and say, "Well, ok. Now it's my turn and I'm really going to let it down to her. I'm going to really tell her every little detail." And I get to about to the second sentence and, you know, somehow it's either threatening or makes her angry or what have you, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you stop. 28:49.8

</p><p>PATIENT: I stop it, you know. It's really hard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's here that you could. I mean this is kinda your opportunity.

</p><p>PATIENT: This is where I'm supposed to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're supposed to, yeah. (chuckles)

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm supposed to do it here. But I can't quite pull it off. I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it would feel like somewhat, well your image came to mind, but like sticking your finger down your throat. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I know that feel odd. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like, I really don't want to go through that kind of feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, just to feel better. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I'd rather just stay nauseas. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right now I'm faced with this problem. I, there's a young woman, been around for a year. You know, she's really in pursuit. And I just, you know, sometimes I feel well I don't. And other times I feel like, well yeah. I think I'll stop running so hard. And I especially feel some kind of a justification for it when things like this weekend. You know, things like when I realize that it has been, you know, two and a half months now since we've had any kind of sexual relationship. And I think, "Well why should I do this? Why shouldn't I stop running so hard?" You know. I mean, God, I realize, I've come to realize that I never, half of me would really have a good experience with a woman except, you know, this crappy business of a sexual urge. Why do we always have to come to that? Why can't it be something that I feel no sexual urge? And then I say, "Well, why shouldn't I feel sexual urge? And why should I have (inaudible at 0:31:11.6) sex now and then?" The same thing over and over that I discuss with you. It gets so repetitious in my mind that I just, God, I think who? It's time for a new therapist. Because I've told you twice or three times and you're getting bored. It's time for somebody new so I can tell them. I keep looking for this person and that says well, it's ok. Whatever you want to do is fine. Whatever you do will be fine. And it never happens that way. And I can't really do that. We have laws that say that whatever I want to do is not always fine. We have people who are often better than the laws that say, "Uh huh. I see you've been sitting and talking with Ms Jones. Is something going on there?" And that effects me. I can say all I want to it doesn't effect me, but it damn sure does, you know. Because that saying really degrades me. What they're saying is something that degrades me. It's I can rationalize it. I can intellectualize it and say well, it's that they don't understand. Many times they say it because they wish they could have this type of. That they could get in Ms Jones' pants or whatever, you know. What kind of way is that? I just don't want to be bothered with that. But I can't, I am bothered, you know? I am bothered. 0:32:55.5

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They can really get to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: They can really get me, you see. And somehow I'm looking for a place where someone says, "Ok, be free. And no matter what, I'm going to be there. And no matter where, I'm going to be there. And whatever you do, I affirm you and I affirm what you do." You see? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. That you're all right? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I'm ok. But I just can't get that from here. But why do I need that? I don't know, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know why you need it but what can you do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why do I have to have that kind of (inaudible at 0:33:44.5) affirmation? And the thing here, that that says complex the situation. But then the easiest thing to do is just, you know, bing bang thank you ma'am thing. You know and that would be the sex. And I feel that I could, you know, that I could pull off very quickly. Where the other, having a relationship with a person takes a lot of time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's a level that it'd just be like that and..

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. There's an end to it. There's a finale. Both people satisfied and they turn over rather crisply, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That's not what you want. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. That's really not what I want. I want to be able to live them, you know. And I want to be able to live with, I want to be able to have these feelings about women. And I want to be able to have these feelings about men too. And, I don't know, maybe I wish the men wouldn't be so hung up. They're so hung up on these other things that I just, I can't get to them. I can't really. It would just. If I told them, most of the men that I work with, some of them that I really enjoy being with. If I told them I love them it'd drive them straight up the wall. You know, they would get all sorts of funny feelings. Or maybe I would get all sorts of funny feelings. Maybe that's what I'm saying. I know damn good and well that they would too. I don't think I'm that far missing the mark that they wouldn't get some funny feelings too. 0:35:41.4

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But what you're saying too is, "I want to just feel free to care and to love them."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And to love them without feeling that "I'm going to get hooted at for making some kind of sexual advance or just being unmasculine."

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. I don't really want this image that is so driven into me of man. The idea about men never cry. You're three years old. "Now, Russell, you can't cry anymore." I was told that. Did I tell you, did I ever tell you the story about what happened to me as a child? Because I really. I've lived with this. See how this sounds. Because I think this is part of my hang up. I am very attractive by the physical looks of a woman's body. Just the nude physical look of a woman's body. And I've often thought about why. Well when I was a kid growing up. I grew up in a pretty poor neighborhood. And a rubber tree, this is in my. Do you know what a rubber tree looks like? A rubber tree is usually quite large and it has a big foliage. And the interesting thing is the roots come off the branches so it makes caves. Little caves. And there were girls in our neighborhood. And we used to go out to the rubber tree and these caves and we'd play undress and look at each other. And I used get some of the worst spankings for that. And I remember one day, this girl that lived across the way. Her name was Helen Jensen was over at our house. And she had probably infantigo (ph). You know, she had sores. And she had gentian violet. I didn't know what it was at that time. She had gentian violet painted on her. And they went all the way up on to the gluteus maximus. And so we were playing in the house and she said, "I have to go to the bathroom." Well I said, "Ok, can I go with you? And just look?" And she said, "Oh, your mother is going to spank you." And I said, "She'll never know. She's outside." And so I went in there, you know, and she got up on the pot and in walks my mother. Oh, horrors among horrors, you know? I believe it was more subtle than that. Because something had to do with the gentian violet. She found gentian violet on the toilet seat and she said, "Russell, did you go into the bathroom with Helen Jensen?" And I said, "Yes, Mother." And she said, "Well, you know what happens when you go to the bathroom with at little girl. You get spanked." Oh, I'm going to get it again. And that, I always felt was why. It became so forbidden. That's part of the reason why. 0:38:42.6

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It made it a fascination. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. And I don't understand how you break old habits like that. You can bring them up. You can intellectualize. You can even say, you would even say to me, "Well, that sounds like a good justification for your fascination." You know. Then what do I do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:39:03.5) so fine. I still feel a real attraction, a real fascination. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I got, like I couldn't get enough, you know. I've often thought about going to a nudist camp. Because at a nudist camp you just see, you're just super saturated with it and you don't pay any attention to it any more. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it wouldn't be important. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Like it wouldn't be that important. I never have thrown myself down that far. But sometimes.. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel with that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well..

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like it's still that important to?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah because I don't see Susan undressed that much. And when I do, I'm so damn gawking that I make her feel self conscious, so I, you know. It's a cycle type thing. I make her feel self conscious. She tends to undress less in front of me, you know. It's crazy. And I feel myself destroyed. It's obviously very important. She has some funny feelings. She was brought up in a house where there was a father and a daughter. The tea for two scene. Her mother always went in the closet to undress. Privacy was the greatest thing in the world. Of course, in my family you know, being all boys there was no privacy except my mother. Who just hid out somewhere. And so she got all these funny feelings about looking at a man's body. She can't stand for me to be undressed. You know, she just doesn't. And it kind of makes me feel funny. You know, it makes me feel like I'm ugly. 0:40:46.9

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it sort of feels again like you're saying something about you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're ugly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know what I do though fun. I say, ok. This is what I do for the sex. It's craziness. But you have to understand. This is the way, this is the way I condition myself so I don't get hurt. The way I conditioned myself with my family not to, to let my father hurt me or my mother hurt me. I say to myself, "All right. I'm just not going to look at it. I'm not going to look at it." And I say that about sex, ok? If she feels that way I'm just not going to have any sexual relations with her at all. Period. And I'm not going to have sexual relations with anybody. Well, God damn. I don't think Houdini could do all that crap. 

</p><p>But I say to myself that it's worked in the past. You know I'd say, "I'm not going to love my father. Because I'm going to leave him. He's expecting too much. I'm going to leave him." So the beginning of my sophomore year in college, I left him. You know, that isn't my father. And it worked for me, you know. I always felt a little strange telling people that. But that's the way I felt. I had to do that. It was either all or none. We either loved each other or we didn't love each other. He hurt me bad enough. I said to myself, "I hurt too much. I'm not going to love you anymore." And I'm done. Just like that. I've missed him. I wish he was all right. I wish he was not an alcoholic. 

</p><p>But I've done this, you know, in my relationship with Susan. I just said, "Well, you know, I'm just not going to have any sexual relationship with her at all." And it's because she makes me feel very inadequate. She makes me feel very ugly. So. Maybe I can find somebody who makes me feel good. And that makes me feel very bad. Because then I say to myself, "Well, what am I going to, I'm using this person." Ok. You're the person that I'm going to pick out and you're the one that's going to satisfy my needs. And I feel very bad about that. It feels very needy selfish. 0:43:21.4

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't feel like a real, a complete anyway, relationship. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I'm not giving anything. I'm just taking. I'm saying, "You're not worth a damn, person. You're just going to make me feel good." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you are saying that when it hurts, when it hurts that much, then that's the best way to protect yourself. The only way I can really do it is to cut it out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok, and so that's some kind of little wall. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. A very rigid wall, you know. Because I work, you know. I'll stand here and I'll grit my teeth and I'll do anything that they say but I won't. And sometimes I think I'm going to pull it off. You know, this is really disgusting. I can be really cold, you know. And Susan feels the coldness, because I can, I can you know, I can really destroy her. She makes me feel like I really can. I sometimes wonder if that's not a bit of a game too. You know, that "You're the one that's going to really destroy all the beauty that I value. My lovers make me feel good and look what you do to me." Oh God, this is crazy. It's time to go isn't it? 0:44:44.2 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, we've got, oh gosh you missed it by 20 minutes. We can go after ten if you want to. A good five minutes should get that time recorded. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But you can't, (inaudible at 0:44:56.0) hard a stance if you will. I mean, what do you that to get around the hurt. I don't want to be so hard on her. I don't. I don't know. This is (inaudible at 0:45:14.8) and I begin to allow myself to be vulnerable, I get hurt and I destroy her right back. You know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You need to help me [in feedback Wednesday] (ph) 0:45:27.0

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I felt that too much.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I understand it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And Susan has this (inaudible at 0:45:42.2)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: Why should I go through being unsatisfied, unfulfilled either physically or emotionally because I'm going to die very quickly now. I really feel like somebody's going to shoot me or knife me or I'm going to feel bad for three days and I'm going to go and have a blood count and find I have leukemia. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Umm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And then I will have missed all the sex. (ph) I will have missed ever really feeling like, you know, something that mattered.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I want to live to get (inaudible at 0:46:32.3)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You, you came, yeah, it came down more to it. I'm 35 years old. Now 35 years old is hardly what you would call an old man. But I almost said to Susan, you know, if I keep going rocking along going through all this crap with you for another five years I'm going to be over the hill. I didn't say that but that's the way I felt. And then I won't be able to, to be able to snow anybody. I won't be able to be handsome enough to even attract anybody in five years. And then I won't have anything with you. I won't have anything with anybody else. You see? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:47:16.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: Very short life span. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's the way it feels. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the way it feels. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like your head saying, well that's what it feel like when your life's (inaudible at 0:47:31.0)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. Well, you know, intellectually, of course I'm just beginning to believe once again. For the first time in my life I'm beginning to believe that I'm really smart. That I have an above average intelligence. Now, I'm very vulnerable to that too. Because when I miss something it's very important for me not to, it's very important for me not to make a C to make an A, you know. Even when it's not important. When you're on the pass fail system, it's very important for me to make an A. I don't care what the rest of the people are doing. I don't care what they're satisfied with. I want them all right. And I'll argue why I missed one. It's very hard for me to miss one, you know. It's very hard for me not to get them all right. And these are things that, these are delusions that carry. I wanted so bad to be able to say, "Ok, I missed a few." You know. Ok, people really hurt me. I admit people really hurt me. But I can live with that. Because that's two sided. Number one, I never admit people hurt me. I've always felt, I used to be much more jocular than I am now. That's the defense that I use. I'm the clown. You can't hurt me, I'm the clown. You know, I've got this face painted on and you're not going to do anything to it. 0:49:02.5

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's there no matter what. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I'll make a joke out of it. But I guess I want to deal with the hurt so I'm going to accept that in the gut, you know. I want to be wrong sometimes and be able to accept that in the gut. I don't know. You know, I want to really feel sometimes that somebody really cares about me, you know. That I don't have to do all the caring. That I don't have to carry the weight of the world on me. And that, you know, sometimes I can just be taken care of. Somebody just will take care of me. And I never really, you know, I never really get that feeling. The alternative, remember back when we were talking about the problem I had with the technicians. The alternative is to go to sleep.0:50:05.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There seems to be no medium, you know. I can either divorce myself from the problems. Nothing's solved. I understand that now. That came home very clear to me for the first time when we talked about it. They will get solved. But I have no part in it, you see. Sometimes I'd like to have a little part of it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A share in the part (inaudible at 0:50:37.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. You see, right now, and I guess that's why I talked to you earlier today about where you were. What, it seems unnatural for, it seems like it's all me now. And that's as unnatural as it not being any me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right. 

</p><p>PATIENT: This may, this may hurt to hear but you know I've often wondered, you know, if I just couldn't come in the room and talk in the microphone. You know? I couldn't. You're here. I feel you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Only I don't feel you could either, so. (chuckles) So it doesn't really hurt me. But I guess it, I know the (inaudible at 0:51:35.7) and I've been, it's a sharing process you want right here as well as other places. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm a very, very much a feeling that I can, that this is a model, you know. This is the one place that I can investigate the model. It's not crazy to look for something like models. Science you do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, I think actually what I think you've done here is therapy's evolved. You've been trying out different ways of, looking for different models and (inaudible) yourself by interactions (inaudible at 0:52:22.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: I have something to tell you. This is going to really crack you up. Especially if you, if you understand (ph) what I saying. I feel like sometimes coming in and saying (inaudible at 0:52:31.6) just to see what your reaction is. And I guess this is where I'm glad I didn't because I guess I really begin to verbalize to you why I felt bad about (inaudible at 0:52:40.9). Come in saying, "Russell, let's make love right now." Just to see what you would say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)

</p><p>PATIENT: It's crazy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Umm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I guess what I was trying to really say was you know, I've been going on and the one empty face that I feel is you, for you. And I was going to do something extreme, you know. When I feel empty, I feel that I do this, I push you know. I can't be satisfied with letting these people stay in a morphis (ph) (inaudible at 0:53:21.3) sucks. To feel one To be able to touch one, you know. At least I knew that you had to react to that, you know. If nothing more than just laughing, you know. If you, if you took me serious, well I didn't even want to think about if you took me serious, you know. What would I do then, you know? Suppose you said, "Ok." What would I do then? But I needed to know where you were, you know. I'm able to say that in words. I'm glad it didn't have to go to that, that kind of, I feel like that's a manipulation, a trick, you know. I always feel good when I can say what I'm feeling, you know. Where it's not a game. And that was a game. That would have been a game. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm a very indirect display of saying, "Who are you and where are you?"

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's hard for me to live [while you're hearing] (ph) it's not pretty well planned out. That's been the problem with New York. The problem with a PhD you know is the fact that it's elevated my scheme of life. And, you know, it still seems kinda unnatural. But it seems to be getting more natural. That's why the other unnatural things like, you know, having a mistress and going into therapy, you know, I begin to say, you know, to weigh the difference. Going to therapy and having a mistress, you see the difference. They're both kind of unnatural situations. But I enjoy the therapy. Now would I enjoy a mistress? That's kind of a, it's the idea of looking (inaudible at 0:55:35.)1 you could lay about, you know. I'm just now beginning to understand that it has very little to do with penis to vagina contact. Practically nothing to do with that. It's so much deeper and says so much more than that. And that, that's only a minor part. Biologically I've always know that both the male and female genetalia were not meant for upright animal, at all. You know, that's what makes sex very difficult. You know, if we were intended to be upright, we would have had it sitting right here, you know. Which would have meant it would be very easy to have sexual intercourse. But it has very little to do with that, you know. 0:56:32.4

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot more you're going to get at. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: How can I get at it, you know, I'm working the, in the same work I've had. People will not understand what I'm getting at, you know. How do you, do you go along and say "Ok, you don't understand and I can understand your comments but it says to me that you don't understand and that's all right." Because that's not all right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want them to understand. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I want them to understand. I want them to understand that the woman that I'm sitting there talking with for an hour, I'm not sitting there propositioning her for a solid hour to try and get her in bed with me. That's not the point of it, you know. And this is often times very common I guess. There are people over there who honestly believe that I've been to bed with at least 25 people in the three years that I've been here, you know. Sometimes I feel stupid that I haven't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's why I was [angling you]. (ph) (chuckles)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) That applies to feel that somehow they don't really know me. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but that's what I feel. That you don't (inaudible at 0:58:07.5) That you understand that that's not where it's at. And then I realize that it's their problem. Well, how do I, how do I show you what I feel to let them know that that's not always where things are happening. Now I understand that that is a problem for them. I can't be that strong all the time. They usually hit me when I'm not very strong. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)

</p><p>PATIENT: They get their chance, you know, raise the red flag or something like that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then wham.

</p><p>PATIENT: Hey, are you going away for New Year's?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Probably not. I'll be here. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You're going to be around. Ok. That's it. Bye-bye. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Bye. 0:58:50.2

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(Background talking)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yesterday, I was a little better. I felt better after I talked to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The rest of the day wasn't as hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Is this better, if I move that further away? Is that a pain in the butt? (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And, yes, this morning has been much better. I (ph) just got up and had breakfast and was thinking about plans for the day and things I want to do. And that's really nice. So, it's unclear whether that will last and whether I will actually do them, but (chuckles)</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to go to the yarn store. I would like to go find out how much a tattoo costs. (chuckles) [00:01:00] So it's not - yes, I'm feeling a little better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [Great deal] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles) Yes, so somehow - I told you about Sascha (ph) and Franco (ph) and the situation that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...was going on there last week. So the situation that is going on this week is Sascha (ph) is in town this week. I had e-mailed her on, I think, Tuesday night or Wednesday morning when I got - right when I got back in town. I was just, kind of, assuming that we would spend time together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had (ph) e-mailed her and been (ph) like, "Hey, let's go see 'The Avengers'." But I also wanted to give her an out so I said, "You know, if - but, just so you know, I've just been getting over food poisoning so if you want to take a couple of days to have distance from that," because she's OCD, and vomiting is her worst thing. [00:02:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the worst thing, ever, for her. So like, "If you need a barrier of time between seeing me and when I had vomited, that's cool. Or if you just wanted a quiet week with Franco (ph), that's fine."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't heard anything from either of them, all week. And that really has hurt me. (sighs) Yes. You know, its - I know that - I suspect that it's (ph) a situation where Sascha (ph) is hDanng a really hard time. I know that she's hDanng a really hard time. Franco (ph) is trying to take care of her. [00:03:00] Part of that is - I haven't tried to get in touch with Franco (ph) this week and I'm not going to, because that's not a - that's not the right thing to do now. But, at the same time, I'm just like, "Dude, this is - this is as bad as it gets for me. I need you guys to step up."</p>

<p>So I was talking this over with James (ph) last night and its one of those - I (inaudible) hate these situations, where it's like I can't really tell him everything that's gone on because its told to me in confidence and I - but it was told - I wasn't really supposed to know about this but - that Sascha (ph) is feeling this way about me, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, kind of, have to know, in order to behave appropriately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I [follow that] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, otherwise, I would be like - because, otherwise, I would be calling Franco (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) And that's not what is going to be good for her right now.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - be good for either of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just - I hate secrets and not talking and not being above-board. [00:04:01] It just drives me nuts. And, that (ph) I can't talk to James (ph) about it, is really the (inaudible) - but all I said was, "Based on something that Franco (ph) told me in confidence, I think Sascha (ph) is back in the feeling threatened by me place." And that was - he got everything out of that. That was enough for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) But he was like, "Well, that's easy, I'll just call Franco (ph)." (laughter) And it took me a lot of convincing to say, "Yes, that's appropriate." Because it's like, in my mind, "Won't that just put Franco (ph) in an untenable (ph) situation?" And, you know, I really want to protect him because he's trying really hard to take care of his fiancé, who is his first priority and needs to be his first priority. And, also, trying really hard to take care of me, who is his best friend - [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or - other than James (ph) and another guy that we don't like. (laughter) The guy that - who went to high school with Franco (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know him very well, but - so, but [James (ph) said] (ph) two things that were really good. Did you turn [this on] (ph), by the way? Or did I forget?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I just didn't remember (ph), sorry. I just realized I hadn't noticed you turning it on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think I just spaced out there. Okay. (chuckles) That's pretty normal. So [he said] (ph) two things that were really helpful. And the first was, "You know, it's not up to you what Franco (ph) and I do to take care of you." You know, that's our choice and that's what we want to do. So (chuckles) (inaudible) - okay. [00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. TBryans, I think that's exactly what I needed to hear right now. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, then, the second thing he said was, "You know, your relationship with Franco (ph) - my relationship with Franco (ph)," - "mine" being James's, "is different from the way that you relate to Franco (ph), the way I relate to you, the way Franco (ph) relates to Sascha (ph). And you're just going to have to trust that the way we work, I can call him up and it won't be pressure for him." And I think that's true, in that (pause) - yes. Yes. So, James (ph) is fantastic. That is the moral of that story. (laughter) [00:07:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I still am upset, though, in that - I don't know. (pause) I am angry at Sascha (ph) for the fact - because her (pause) - her unreasonable emotions, that she doesn't know how to control, that she doesn't know how to deal with, are getting in the way of (sighs) her being a good friend to me. (pause) [00:08:02] Yes, at this point, I just feel like she needs to step up. But, at the same time, I am in - right now, in the same kind of place, where I - there are some things I just can't step up for. And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What [other critical] (ph) thoughts do you have about her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not trying to take your fiancé away from you. I am not closer to your fiancé than you are. I'm not; I'm just not. It's not - I am no threat to you. And you know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you saying that you - what you're really critical of her for is her thinking otherwise (ph) is bullshit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think (pause) I'm feeling critical of her because she's kind of throwing a tantrum. And, sometimes, that's what people need to do and that's fine. But (pause) I really need her right now. I really do. And I'm angry that (pause) she's either not understanding that, or that she's not able to be there, despite what she is going through. [00:10:24] At the same time, that being said - "A", I have not told her explicitly, "I need you in this way." So there's that. "B", I'm not sure that it's a reasonable expectation. I'm not sure that it's reasonable, for (ph) me, to expect her to be able to just get over this right now. Because she's in some kind of a (ph) pretty deep hell, right now, also. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>And (sighs) (pause) - and, so, I'm not sure that - you know, I'm not sure that it's reasonable for me to be angry with her. I'm also - and just the way she treats Franco (ph), pisses me off. I just - it just pisses me off. I would never treat somebody I was with like that. It's just unacceptable. But I'm not that - I'm not in that relationship. I'm not - what works for other people is not the same thing as what works for me. And I have to hold onto that. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's something I've learned. [00:12:01] And I need to (chuckles) - I have - I feel like - that I am fairly insightful into other people's relationships, like what other people need, the workings of other people's lives. I need to know that I am not God and that I am not the person who should be in control of that or should understand what's good for them. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's sort of an interesting [running route] (ph) there, in my mind, from being pissed off about how she treats him, to knowing better, to knowing its not for you to know better and to step in or to presume that (ph) what works for you, works for them. [00:13:05] I guess I imagine - I bring it up because I imagine you look a lot at the second [2 steps] (ph) there, from - I don't know that I'm (ph) being clear what I'm feeling; like you're pretty sure about what would be more decent and what would sometimes be better. And, then, talking yourself down from that. That's, sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...[Steps 2 and 3] (ph). But I am imagining that Step (ph) 1, where you went from just being pissed off and critical of her, to then feeling like, "I know better. I'm insightful about this." That part gets lost. I'm not saying you're not insightful or you don't know better, but I am saying it starts with you just being angry at seeing how she is treating your friend. [00:14:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, and I am at some pains to distance myself from that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how it seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. (pause) (inaudible) I - it's funny because I am so protective of Franco (ph), but I don't - we're just really, really, really different people. [00:15:00] It just - we work really differently. And, so, in some ways, he has been a really good friend for me to have, to kind of (pause) just learn that what I need is not necessarily the same thing as what other people need. Yes, like he (pause) - he does not cry in front of other people, ever. He does not really talk about being depressed, hardly ever. He doesn't - and I need to do that but - like the way that Franco (ph) deals with his illness is totally different from mine. [00:16:01]</p>

<p>[It is interesting] (ph) - it's been good for me. (pause) It's been, also, good for me to say, "Okay, the things that Franco (ph) values in me," [and that's like ways] (ph) that I am there for him, "are not necessarily the things that I - that I can bring [not as] (ph) easily." But (pause) I just want to go see "The Avengers". (chuckles) I don't have any other friends who would be as into it as Sascha (ph). [00:17:03] (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Left high and dry. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, right? (laughter) I mean, I don't have any other friends within 800 miles. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause [00:17:23] to 00:17:45) Until James (ph) and Franco (ph) confer (ph), then we'll see what happens. And I think if Sascha (ph) is just really not up to talking to me this week, that's okay. I mean, it's not, but I'll deal. [00:18:02] We'll get back to being friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How big a blow has this been so far? I mean, (pause) - I guess, in a way, when you say that, I'm, sort of, not sure who I'm talking to, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes perfect sense, actually. It's kind of been creeping up on me. I guess I just - (inaudible) various (ph) times it occurred to me, "Hey, I haven't heard from them. Hey." You know, Franco (ph) saw what I was like last week; he knows this is really bad. [00:19:10] And, so, it takes me a while for me to - it takes a while for me to notice. And, then, it takes a while for me to - I guess it's not right. And, then, it starts to hurt. In (ph) a similar situation, Dan has, throughout this, said, "You know, if you need to talk, I'm here. If you need to talk, I'm here." And, finally, I said, "Look, I don't know what 'need' means. I don't - what I need right now is a mentor and I don't know whether you can be that for me anymore. [00:20:01] And that's not where our relationship is right now. Yes, it would be - it would comfort me to talk to you; it would be a good thing."</p>

<p>And he wrote back and he said, "Okay, I - " for whatever - for some reason, "I can't talk this week but I'll be back in touch." And he, also, been in touch. And it's kind of, again - I put it out of my mind and then I suddenly say, "Well, wait a second, these are my people." (chuckles) "Where are they?" (pause) [00:21:01] Maybe, it's just that (pause) - you know, I think I continually underreport. Maybe, but I don't know why [they're not here.] (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You think the worst?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause [00:21:55] to 00:22:25) And I don't (ph) - again, it goes back to (pause) the idea that I should be able to expect people to take care of me, when I haven't said, "I need this from you," is a really foreign one to me. And I'm not - I'm still not sure whether I am onboard with that. [00:23:03] So, maybe, it's that I've (ph) been avoiding people for the last several months. I can't tell whether this is something that I have done, whether this is my fault. That (ph), certainly, - that's always where my mind goes, right? How do I fix it? (pause) It's not like - it's not like other people always help, you know? [00:24:09] I'm not being very clear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's, again, moving away from anger and disappointment towards Franco (ph) and Dan (ph), in that - I guess, I was just thinking about how (ph) Dan (ph) said he'd be back in touch. He said, "Oh, I'm not around this week but I'll get in touch (inaudible)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: The (ph) next week was (ph) over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds pretty clear - I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I (inaudible) mis-remembering the e-mail, or whatever. Or I - [00:25:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) he didn't write and say, "Look, blah, blah, blah, Sascha (ph), blah, blah, blah. Sorry, this week not so good. Blah, blah, blah," which would suck. But -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would be something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I guess, yes. (inaudible) "I probably really just haven't let them know how I'm doing and so it's really on my shoulders, that I'm not hearing from them. If (ph) I had only been clearer."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to avoid that movement. I don't know if you can tell. (chuckles) Because it's not going very well. I'm working on it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that I can tell. (inaudible) earlier, when you were talking about being mad at Sascha (ph), it (inaudible) -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I'm trying really hard. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) I guess so. (pause [00:26:07] to 00:27:03) How come you're working hard at that? I can imagine if you (inaudible) - just not sure what you have in mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, its a little bit trial and error. It seems like the way that I feel, with being angry with people, doesn't serve me well. So, let's try something else. So it's (sighs) I don't know if this is going to be tangential (ph), or actually directly, relate (ph). But, so, with being upset with you last week and - I don't think being angry with you was ever, really, the right word. But, being upset; feeling really hurt. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>It was really, really important to me to tell you that because I can say, "Okay, it's out there. And, if we need to talk about it next time we talk, then we will and we will." But then I (inaudible) on other things. And, in the intervening time, the being hurt went away. Yes, which, I mean, I knew it wasn't - it wasn't a rational feeling to begin with, and it (pause) (sighs) - so it's like (sighs) [00:29:05]</p>

<p>I don't know. That's just the - it's the only way I know how to deal with being angry with people; is to say, "I'm upset about this. I need you to know that." And, then, in some degree, it matters what they do. And, to some degree, it really doesn't. (pause) But if I don't say anything, it just doesn't go away. I'm still angry about the stuff that like - you know, I'm still angry at my high school theater teacher for dropping the ball, when I was in this bad situation. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>And, when he was (inaudible) - he was the confidante of both me and Bryan, and he was the person who was saying, "Okay, this is what I think you guys need. This is how we're going to handle this." And just, then, lost sight of - I don't know what happened. But he was the person that we were both trusting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've never had it out with him. And it wouldn't be useful to. He wouldn't remember what I was talking about. But I can't - its just there and that doesn't serve me well. [00:31:00] So, now, it's like I can't tell Sascha (ph) that I'm upset with her, at this point. Not where things stand right now. I'll need to, if we're going to be friends. I don't know what that's going to look like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, at some point, when you tell her, [if I follow] (ph), what will really matter to you, will be putting it out there. That's the thing that helps you to move on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...as opposed to how she reacts or - it doesn't sound like its exactly cathartic; it doesn't sound like it's so much getting it off your chest, as like putting a flag down, or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not my responsibility anymore or like - I don't know. [00:32:02] Because if (pause) - if I tell her that and she says, "Yes, that sucks of me. I'm really sorry. I was just having a rough time," ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...then it will be completely over. I mean, then, I won't - I just - it will just be gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I tell her and she reacts poorly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and gets defensive and lashes back at me, or whatever, then I don't know what will happen. It's possible that I'll think less of her and I don't want that. But, at any rate, I'll feel like I've done what I could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:33:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I guess I just - I don't know - I never know how to deal (ph) with being angry. There's just not much that I can do, because I can't - I really can't stand it when people feel guilty about what they've done to me. I just really can't stand that. (chuckles) I'm like, "No, no, it's okay. Really, let it go." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if she responded (inaudible) at the moment, saying, "Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad. I know we were so hurtful. I feel really awful about it. Oh, 'self-flagellate, self-flagellate, self-flagellate'," that would drive you nuts? That would - [00:34:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be really hard. So, in some ways, it's hard for me to tell people that I'm angry. Because if they think that I'm justified in being angry, then that will make them feel bad about themselves. And, then, I'll feel like I made them feel bad about themselves. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, then, it's back on me. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I see.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I can't stand that, which doesn't make very much sense. But it is what it is. This is why it's impossible, ever, to tell my mother that I'm angry with her because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure it has nothing to do with it. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [00:35:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because it's impossible for her, ever, to let go of guilt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause [00:35:09] to 00:35:50) Because, I think I also - I project the way I react to people being angry with me, onto other people. I find it so hard to let go of guilt, that I assume that other people will, also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So if, again in that case, Sascha (ph) was like, "Oh, my God. (inaudible)," you assume that she'll be carrying that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, with Sascha (ph) - (inaudible) [I don't fucking know] (ph) Maybe she will; maybe she won't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With most people, probably not, I guess. I hope not. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause [00:36:31] to 00:37:01)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In fact, actually - I think, maybe, how you often are with people or how you treat people, especially the people you're close with, is the opposite, in a way. I suspect that you - I'm not saying you idealize them so much as, I think, haven't expressed tremendous faith in the people that you're closest with. In this way that is, sort of, both felt and intended to be very constructive, in terms of how you feel about yourself and in terms of how you want them to feel about themselves and who they are for you, I think. [00:38:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, I guess, I imagine that's like, often, unconsciously, a large part of your project with people. I don't mean that it's like - it sort of goes hand - like, [part and parcel with] (ph) being close with somebody, for you, I would think. And, so, when you do something that feels like it's making them feel bad or undermining them in some way, it's at odds with, maybe, something you're working on with them, or in how you relate to them. [00:39:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Its like - so, when people fail me, most of the time that doesn't shake my faith in them. But I can't figure out how to make people understand that. Does that make sense? You know, its -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you tend to feel as though they have, or should have, shaken your faith in them but, in fact, they haven't? And it's hard for you to get them to see that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I mean, it's very rare that somebody will do something that hurts me, that makes me say, "Okay, you are a different person than I thought you were. And I can't trust you in the way that I thought I could." [00:40:01] Most of the time, yes, I choose to - I choose to trust pretty much everybody and, particularly, people that I'm closed to. Most of the time - yes, of course, people fuck up; that doesn't mean that I'm not going to trust them next time. (sighs) But when I mess up - when I fuck up for somebody else, I feel like they should never trust me again. And, so, (sighs) - its hard (ph) to treat other people the way you want to be treated; [this is] (ph) really not helping me right now. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't want other people to feel that way about me. [00:41:05] And I don't (ph) want other people to think that I won't keep trusting them, or that I don't still trust them, or that I don't understand. (pause) But I don't know how to say, "Yes, this is not okay," without saying, "we are not okay."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The image that's coming to my mind is you doing a lot of the work, building the boat that you and the other person are in. And, then, being worried about doing something that's going to cause a leak, or that is going to put - its, sort of, a goofy metaphor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (inaudible) [00:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But (pause) you're not so worried about being able to keep the ship in shape, in response to how they react, but that's not true the other way around; that if you're telling them something not okay, it could really (inaudible) between you - you (ph) really worry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. (pause) Yes. I just (ph) try to do too much for the relationship. [00:43:05] I try to be the person who is taking care of both sides of it. And that does not work. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like you're so worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like things could go under. And, I think, often, they do not because the other person falls apart in the [present day] (ph), with the people around you. But, because your reaction is so intense, you come apart. [00:44:01] I'm not saying that always triggers when you have a really hard time, or really go, "Whoa." But, I think, sometimes - [am I] (ph) making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I'm still working through it. So (ph) (pause [00:44:33] to 00:44:53)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) I guess I'm thinking of some of the stuff with (ph) your sister last week, or that meeting with your advisor a few weeks ago. [00:45:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, (inaudible) - I, actually, didn't see what time it was so I don't (ph) know if we have to stop now or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...five minutes ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have another thought, before we stop [for now] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I'll see you on Monday. But I'm out the following Monday, which is a holiday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's neat (ph), because I, also, am out that Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yes, [I'll see you] (ph).</p>

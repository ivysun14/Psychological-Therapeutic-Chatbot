<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much for participating in this important research.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can't take it, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I see my wife, she's sick, you know, next to me, you know, and I can't do nothing for her, you know, I feel like I'm losing her and I'm losing myself in her too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's too much, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel her suffering—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To see.  Have you been experiencing any panic yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I got like maybe 3 times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and sleeping, I can't sleep, sometime I sleep 2 hours, 3 hours, sometimes less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel I'm tired, I feel like I got a headache and still, you know, I'm tired, I want to sleep but I can't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My mind keep thinking, going and the pain in my arm and my leg and my low back, you know, it's bothering me a lot now, especially in this weather.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, today I'm going to see a specialist for it, I have appointment at 2:00, 1:45.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll see what he tell me.  I get a headache too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get any rashes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I keep itching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On my face sometimes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I keep itching, even, I'd say maybe it's too hot, it's not, I'd say maybe from the heat, there's no heat—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I keep, over here, I keep itching my face, over here on my head, always I keep itching it and I did, I called up the doctor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did appointments, it's, I think this month, I don't know exactly the date, I'm going to see why I keep itching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I wonder about that because of the medication that you're taking is very familiar, I don't think that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was starting, you know, itching, it's almost for a month, a month and a half, I keep itching a lot over here in my face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, mostly around the face it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, mostly right over here, most of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you ever had a bug bite or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My wife is saying maybe it's a mosquito, I say I'm in the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sitting inside the house, it's not, there's no mosquitos.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have pets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we used to have, no more.  We used to have a cat, my wife, she was allergic so we give her up.  We used to have birds, we gave it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about a dog?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we're not allowed to have in the house, no dogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have mice in your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's a new construction my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No mouse, none.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have a lot of trees next to my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a lot of deer in your neighborhood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's, yeah, there's deer, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I see a lot of them in the morning when I'm going to the mosque.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like, it's not that far from my house, it's a park and there's a lot of, I always see 3 or 4 deer always and rabbits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How have your seizures been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My seizures are okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My seizure is okay, just my, what do you call it, um, I get upset fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My attitude is getting worse and worse.  Even my kids now, they tell me dad, what happened, you was good, now you started getting worse than before.  Anything, any little tiny thing, I start getting mad, screaming and I don't know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know in the past we've wondered about the bipolar condition—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kicking in and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See now everything is okay, now my son pay, you know, the payments and everything is okay now.  He's good with his wife.  I don't know why I'm, I get up in the morning with an attitude before I go [INAUDIBLE], afternoon, any little tiny thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like to sit by myself, tell my kids and wife go [INAUDIBLE] she go up in her room and I stay downstairs and watch TV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Let me review your medications with you.  You're still taking the Phenytek, right, the Dilantin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um, how about the Lyrica, did your neurologist give you more of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and let me also review, how about the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Topamax, I think I'm still taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, because I did a prior authorization—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For the Topamax, so that's good if they, so it's the Dilantin, the Topamax—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Dilantin, now the, they switched it to a different kind, I forget to bring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phenytek probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's sort of a brand generic—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Name I think and how about the Clonazepam, are you taking that pretty regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because that can help with the panic, the outbursts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I didn't have no more medication left in my house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Trazodone, remember when you had Trazodone available to try to help with sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or agitation does that help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It didn't really help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, does Klonopin ever help with sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See what happen when I take the medication, they help me for the first week, 2 weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It started to wear off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might need a stronger dose, I mean considering that the panic is kicking back in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're having trouble sleeping.  They make a 2 mg, what I'm thinking is, um, if you take a 1 and it doesn't do the job or if you know, if I take 1 mg at bedtime, I'm not going to sleep, you could go ahead and take a 2 mg but at the times you think a 1 mg might do, you could just break it in half.  It is generic, you know, I think you won't have a problem getting that dose and considering you have sort of the dual issues of the seizure issue and the mood swings, um, and you're familiar with those medications, I think it could be helpful, so I'll go ahead and make that adjustment.  I'm also going to write a note for you to take to your doctor, um, because I at least am becoming increasing aware, um, and some of my patients at a clinic yesterday, um, that there are certain diseases that travel with deer and if there's an insect that bites a deer and then bites a person, um, some of those illnesses can be transmitted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know, it's happened to a friend of ours, she was in [DEIDENTIFIED] in the summer and this where she get and when she came over here, she felt like she sick and this and then she went to the hospital for a while, after a week she went, she almost died.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, uh—huh, did they ever find out what it was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was from a deer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	From a tick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it give her like Lyme disease, something like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think it's worth asking those questions, that could be a possibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The blood tests are not always 100% reliable, um, there are several illnesses that can even travel together in the same tick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and they can have symptoms like itching, rashes, joint pain, confusion, headaches, mood swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Confusion, she's got.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seizures.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Confusion, that's, me and my wife, confusion, it's a lot of times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know that's been going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and if you walk through that park and the grass is tall or whatever, it's a question worth asking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's not far from my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just think it was maybe, less than a quarter mile—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if it happened to a neighbor, you know, again—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's worth mentioning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, you know, there are, sometimes the blood tests aren't reliable and some doctors can make the diagnosis clinically—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the good news is, antibiotics can bring a lot of relief, um, so it's worth considering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sometime I keep itching my face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only this side, I keep itching it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I have one or two patients who, at the site of the original bite—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They keep getting irritated and irritated and sometimes when they take antibiotics, it goes away and it doesn't sound like you recall a bite but not everybody does, so that's certainly a possibility, um, and the medications that you are taking now, you know, in the past also we have needed to adjust those sometimes seasonally and a bipolar disorder can be like that where especially in the spring and the fall, it can rev up a little bit, there's the change in the length of the days, there's religious holidays for a lot of people—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so forth, so I think that tends to take a toll sometimes, so, um, I'm going to go ahead and write for the adjustment in the medication and the renewals.  Um, it sounds like your neurologist isn't renewing the Lyrica anymore, did you feel like that was helpful, in addition to the other things or not so much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the interesting thing is, that in terms of aches and pains and, you know, your muscle pains that you've had, if it is something like fibromyalgia which is sort of roughly in the ballpark of things like rheumatoid arthritis and such, there are, usually is some relief but if it's not, it usually doesn't do much anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He told me I had like a disc in my back—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that certainly could be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it, yeah, he said that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Part of it as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they took me to the hospital and I did the test and it showed up, you know, I have a disc in my neck, that's why I got pain in my arm and low back and my leg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He gave me medication for painkiller, it's not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't help or nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's interesting.  And sometimes several things exist at the same time and that can make it kind of hard to figure out what's causing what, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, [INAUDIBLE] I go to the gym, I say if I go to the gym, I can't be on a machine for 2 minutes, my leg and my arm is like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He say you have, you have to walk, I say if I walk for 1 block I get tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One of those illnesses I was talking about make people feel a lot worse—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like they can't even do ordinary kind of exercise—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not lazy, no, just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't, you know, if, my legs sometimes just stop, I can't walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, there could be something medical—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's definitely worth looking into.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying, I'm not going to give up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, that's the spirit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We keep asking the questions, we're likely to get answers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you go online, do you have a computer in your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to write down a web site that's worth taking a look at, it's a local organization that deals with those kind of diseases and there's a lot that you can learn by looking there, maybe some questions you'll want to ask your doctor about because I think the deer are really the key thing and I mean sometimes people are like, oh, you live in [DEIDENTIFIED], you don't have to worry about deer, well, I've walked in [DEIDENTIFIED] and seen dozens of them, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They live in any green area.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the morning, in the morning I see 3 or 4 of them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every morning at 5:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they are, skunk too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of skunks.  We do not live that far from the park and it's a lot of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm very glad to hear about the seizures being under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's not bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent, excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the only one, it's like I say, my attitude.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That and the headaches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, that's the irritability—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Headache I know is not from, I can't sleep, I can't go to sleep so maybe that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And sleep can really be disrupted too sometimes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With a, you know, a physical illness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See I feel myself tired, I want to see but I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, it's extremely frustrating.  The additional Clonazepam may help, um, do you still go to the Rite Aid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, um, and remember the tablet I'm writing for now is twice as strong as the previous—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So sometimes you may only want 1, 1/2 rather and other times you'll probably just want to take a whole one at bedtime to try to promote the sleep better and it should also help calm the racing thoughts, maybe some of the irritability, you know, that goes with, uh, the season as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like last time my wife, she went for, she was itching a lot, she had, she went to the doctor and he gave her medication, it's not covered, $359.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went to the doctor and said we can't afford it and he gave her samples, he gave her a lot of samples.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's a lot of money, $359.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well [PATIENT NAME], I'll tell you about some things that I don't think should be a secret either, there was an outbreak of scabies in this clinic, do you know what scabies are?  They're kind of a bug—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they go under the skin and especially at night they can be really, really itchy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now often you'll see like little red tracks on, on your limbs, your arms, your legs or something.  It doesn't sound as much like your situation because it usually doesn't go to the face but if someone is itchy all over, sometimes that can be the case.</p>

PT:	Mine is in my face and in my arm and sometimes you see like a little thing full of water like so I keep itching it and go up to this size—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And even in my face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it like a blister or is it more kind of solid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like more like a blister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More like a blister, huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They may want to do some blood tests and really look into that and if you did, you know, I'm, it doesn't sound likely but I think for a public health standpoint, it's good to know if a place has recently had a scabies outbreak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If that were suspected, there's an inexpensive cream, you put it on at night, chin to toes, leave it on for 8 to 10 hours, wash it off the next morning, repeat in a week, that's inexpensive, it usually takes care of that aspect of things but I don't think you'd find it just in 1 or 2 particular places.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They travel all over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, mine is just in face and arm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I keep putting alcohol on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, does that help, it probably cools the area.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cools the area I put it on so I don't have to keep itching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You guys couldn't have poison ivy could you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I don't think so because you don't have any red, red bumps—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or dots or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why we, like, like a week ago my cousin say he have, they found in his house, uh, bedbugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he call a company and they charge him for every room, $300.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yikes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and he said the 3 bedrooms and the bathroom cost almost $1200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, have any of them been sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All of them and they didn't know why, they said nighttime when they go, they start itching and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then they call up a company and the company came to say, yeah, you have bedbugs and he say he changed everything, he bought—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When he bought the house, now this time he say he changed the bed, he throw the bed, he throw the mattress and everything, he bought everything new and he got the company came and did spray to the house, I don't know how they are now, I didn't seem them after that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, well, if they keep being sick, you know, I'm a suspicious kind of a person, you know, maybe those bugs could have bacteria—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too, I don't know. .  You know, it took a long, long time in history before they realized malaria was spread by mosquitos, you know the name, malaria, bad air, they thought it came in from the air over the swamps at night, so that's why they always would have the windows shuttered up and not letting in the bad air which could cause malaria.  Finally, somebody figured out, it's coming from the mosquitos flying in from the swamps at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right, most of it from mosquitos.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and actually it's not only the mosquito, it's the little parasite inside the mosquito.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see in outside, like big mosquitos in my backyard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huge ones, I tell my son we have to call the company to come spray all the grass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and they found West Nile virus too around here.  That's fantastic, I'm so glad that you're getting the Topamax also.  We worked hard to get that, uh, that prior authorization.  Are you taking the 50 mg, 4 times a day or the 100 mg twice a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A hundred.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A hundred, okay, twice a day.  All right, so that's the 100 mg, 1 p.o. and twice a day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  All right and let me also jot down, I'm going to just write a note to your doctor about some of the things we've—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Been thinking about, maybe they can consider—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Give it to my family doctor, no?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I got my citizenship too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Congratulations, you wait till now to tell me.  Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know you were thinking about that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last time we got together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was so happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] taking me and my, his mom, my wife back home for a couple months vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is so wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He want us to go now, I say, Huh-uh, no, there's no fun, it's winter, it's cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, you want to go when you can really enjoy it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, you know, you can't enjoy it now, especially now that you get up and a couple more hours it be nighttime.  I want to go in the summer when you can enjoy it, it's still 9:00 and you still can go out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so these are just some things he can think about and I was thinking maybe you and I could meet again in about 8 weeks or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, see if this is a good balance of the medicine for you, you know, keeping things on a more even keel and I'll have some more information for you as well about, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The possibility of maybe, you know, something that could be treated medically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good to see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take care now, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.</p>

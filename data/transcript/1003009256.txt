<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, okay, so, yeah, we can try the half tablet of Ambien and see, have you tried that yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's always been a full one, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, you can try that and if that doesn't work, let me know, and we can see if we can get, you know, the full tablet every night approved, if you need it or we can try a different medicine if they're just going to balk at -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, allowing you to take that one every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why do, why do you think they're blocking it like that, is it just because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Cost.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of the insurance companies are limiting how many pills you can get because it's more expensive for them to pay for it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Ambien, when they first got it approved, they got it approved, they got it approved just for short term use, even though a lot of people now use it long term -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, to cut costs, they try to limit how much people get again, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's fantastic.  Yeah, that's the other thing.  So thrilled with our insurance right now, because they changed the plan, so originally I'm supposed to have insurance until I'm 23 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As long as I'm a full time student -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, which I am, and now, just as of like, I don't know, last week or something, my dad told me they're changing it to, um, you have to be full time student and living at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So my insurance, as of [DATE] is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I hadn't heard of that before, I've never heard of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have to live at home, you can't, so what if you're a student out of state or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, yeah, exactly, so yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, so you lose insurance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] when my dad told me about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what are you going to do, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, my mom's going to look at different plans and stuff like that, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So your insurance now is through your dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does your mom work, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where does she work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well she has her own company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a financial planner, so and he works for [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, boy, yeah, so that's a challenge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't want to be without insurance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you get insurance through your job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they offer insurance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can, but it probably would be terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, but my mom is looking at options because I kind of freaked out about it a little bit, so she's going to, she said don't even worry, you know, [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just hold on one second, someone's paging me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll turn it off so they keep beeping me.  Well good, at least, at least you're checking it out and hopefully you can find another alternative that will work well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean insurance is getting more and more difficult these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't been affected by like the economy or health insurance or anything until this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So now all of a sudden I'm like part of that statistic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], how old are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE].  Because I had heard from someone else the other day that they were even going to extend it, health insurance if you're in college, up to the age of 25 in Colorado.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I heard that from someone, I don't know if they passed a new law or what, maybe that was just one other insurance company, but, um, I'm just wondering if, if they can do that, if they can require you to be living at home.  You know, there are, there are state insurance regulations or guidelines that, that insurance companies have to follow if they insure people in the state of Colorado -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I still don't know where you would go to find out that, what those rules are, you know, because, you know, again, I've never heard of this one where you have to be living at home before -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really odd.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mom is like doubting it but my dad said it's very clear in the, you know, message or email or the mail or whatever that you have to be living at home, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So there's like a 3% chance that it's not correct, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, it's, it must be something new because I've never heard of it before here, it could be, though, that they are trying to get more stringent controls and trying to eliminate people from insurance, if they can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was not good news -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you don't want to be without health insurance these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I talked to somebody who was in the hospital for a week, she got sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And was in the hospital for a week and her hospital bill was $100,000.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow, really?  That's scary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was a young girl in her 20s, young lady in her 20s, so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow, that scary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it could, it could get really hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, just that, um, when I got that Wellbutrin filled, um, it said on the little bag that the prescription comes in that, um, all right, it cost $7.50 and it said our insurance saved us like $428.69 or something like that on generic Wellbutrin, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so that's why I was so upset, like, you know, I can't ask my parents to be paying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm thinking what we would try to have to, have to try to do, I guess, if you lose your insurance is try to get you on the least expensive medicine as possible -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That worked for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, that's another thing, but still, it's hard for somebody to try to switch medicines, it doesn't work as well, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, hopefully you get more information over the next weeks and see if there are some other options.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll definitely find out this week [INAUDIBLE] definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, so anything else going on, any changes?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Um, not really next to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stupid guy things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, and we've just been hanging out, you know, or whatever, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, he just, uh, I'm starting to understand more how men and women think differently because he does -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says some really stupid things sometimes and I don't think he means it, to be, like, hurtful, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't always get mad at him, I think he just doesn't think about it, I don't think he means harm, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like what kind of things will he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, well, this is weird, but I'm just going to be candid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like last week, he goes, we were sitting on this couch or something, um, and he goes, in a really disappointed voice, he goes your boobs are never going to get any bigger, are they, can you believe that?  Can you believe that?  I got so mad at him and he tried to like take it back, say no, that's not what I meant, blah, blah, blah, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not what he meant?  How can you take that wrong?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  And, you know, I told him, I was mad about it, I really was, and I told him something like that, you don't ever forget that, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why would he even say that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, seriously.  And I know the type of guy he is, he's the type of guy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of guy is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's the type of guy who likes, you know, blond girls, big boobs, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's, I don't, I don't even know, he's that kind of guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he has some image of how he wants you to look?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.  And so, I got really mad at him and I told him, you know, that's like a big hit to the self esteem, you know what I mean, he's like, oh, you're perfect the way you are, blah, blah, blah, but hello, you know, I think about that every freaking day now, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, yeah, can you even believe that?  I couldn't even believe it came out of his mouth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, [PATIENT NAME], it's just something, it's something to keep in mind at about what, uh, you know, how, what's important to him in life, is it that you have big boobs or is it that you're a good person, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or, I mean, I mean, that's, yeah, that's kind of a telltale sign.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, isn't it, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd be, yeah, it would make me a little cautious about, you know, is this guy, is that what's going to attract this guy, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he really, real hung up on physical appearance to the point that that's more important than, you know, who you are as a person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he ever said anything like that before that, the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not, not like that, no, not directly to me or anything, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Has he made a comment about other women or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I mean, remember I worked with him for 3 years -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know him well, you know, I know, I mean, I've heard him talk about a lot of women, I've heard various things about dates that he goes on or whatever, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of things would he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he always used to be like, you know, saying how, like he'd date a girl and he'd sleep with her or whatever and then it'd be like over.  And so I never liked him and then I threw that back in his face recently and he said he was always just trying to impress me, just always wanted me to like him or whatever, through the whole time I worked with him, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How would that impress you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, well that's what I said, like that's bad, not good, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he's sort of brag about just having one night stands with women, though, before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But to me it's like, I'm everything, he can't live without me and I'm definitely the person he's going to marry, it's like, he's so sure that I'm like perfect for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  That I'm the only girl that he's ever cared about enough to, you know, more than, you know, one week or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's a little hard to know what, what his true thought are, then, because it sounds like he kind of flip flops at times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.  How long you been going now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since, uh, like January, the beginning of January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> March, April, so 3 1/2 months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.  Has he changed toward you during that time or has he been pretty consistent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, very quickly, like, I'd say the beginning of February, it was when he was all like, you know, you're perfect for me, blah, blah, blah, blah, and we, we're getting married and blah, blah, blah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's pretty fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then since then, how's he been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The same, like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like that.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just thinking, you know, why would he even make a comment like he made to you, though, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even if you saw something in him that you didn't like, maybe, I don't know, maybe he's got a belly or something or his legs are too short or his hair stands up sideways or he wakes up with bad breath or something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, typically people are sort of diplomatic in what they say or how they say it, like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly, tactful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tactful, right, like honey, um, do you think maybe you ought to brush your teeth in the morning when you wake up or, you know, some, or something that's not going to hurt the person's feelings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> First of all and second of all, I mean, usually when people make comments like that, it says a lot more about him than about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it kind of reveals that, I mean are big boobs more important than, than who the person is or what kind, how you feel about them, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's kind of a shallow -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is, isn't it?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Comment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, and for, you know, if I stay with him for the rest of my life, I'm going to feel inadequate or something, some girl walks down the street who's like this, you know, I know he's going to be like, damn -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you could, or you could say, you know, I'm comfortable with my body just the way I am -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if it's, you know, because, you know how big is big enough, do you have to be Dolly Parton, you know, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it's really not about you, [PATIENT NAME], and whether your boobs are big enough, big enough or not, it's really about him and his attitude about women that what's acceptable or not to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, it's, it's like somebody, it's like, you know a guy saying, you know, you're not skinny enough when you're already skinny.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not that you're really not, it's just that's his perception.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I mean, does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It totally does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it really doesn't say anything about you, it says -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something about him and his judgments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right, you're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you can feel comfortable of yourself, it doesn't, you know, those comments are again they're really not, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not affect me too much.  But it's not like I've never thought that either -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, so he just like, confirmed it, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the problem in, in today's society, you know, is that with women's image is that, you know, it's based on things that just aren't real.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, either, you know, the super models who, um, um, I don't know if you read about this, the image, a large percentage of super models are on different kinds of drugs to lose weight -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And a lot of them, you know, a vast majority of them have plastic surgery, you know, boob jobs, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To try to fit this ideal that isn't even realistic -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It isn't the way anybody looks naturally -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so, I mean, does, does every woman need to go out and have breast implants, you know to be okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, and I'm not trying to put down women that make that choice if they want to or if they want to have plastic surgery, but why should women have to do all those things to feel okay about themselves, what's wrong with them just being natural the way they are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're absolutely right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I saw a real interesting television show on TV a while back, it was on one of the cable channels about what makes people attractive in different cultures around the world and what was fascinating was it was the exact opposite in different countries.  Like in this country, historically, being real tan has been considered to be attractive so people go to tanning booths or go to, lay in the sun, in India, people find dark skin to be less appealing so they'll bleach their skin to make it lighter -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or in this country, you know, women being skinny is considered to be attractive, so women, you know, will try to lose weight.  In Africa, when women go out at night, you know, like affairs, they put big padding around their waste and their hips to look bigger -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because women with big butts and big hips are considered to be more attractive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it's the exact opposite of here and on and on like that, they were showing, you know, how in different culture the exact opposite things are considered attractive and so it's really not that there's one ideal, one image that's most attractive, it's just kind of what people are taught to believe is attractive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They talked about how in ancient China, women used to bind their feet, have you heard of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, to make them smaller, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they actually break the bones in their feet to make their feet tiny because the men thought that was so, it was a sexual turn on, it was really attractive, they had these tiny little feet even though those women went through torture -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In literally breaking their bones or feet to do this and so it's really, you know, whatever a culture sort of determines, but it doesn't mean it's real necessarily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if somebody thinks you should be different than you are, it doesn't mean you should be, it just means that's their perception and you don't have to fit it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And hopefully you can find someone, either [NAME OTHER] will come around or you'll find someone who, who loves you just the way you are and doesn't feel like you have to change -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To fit their image.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's just too bad that he didn't have a little more tact in terms -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of keeping his thoughts inside his own brain or, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told him to think before he speaks from now on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good choice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was mad about it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was really mad.  So, you know, like I said, I'm not ever going to forget that, every time I think of him, that's what I'll think of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, what I hope is that you'll think about him and not yourself -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not feel like you're somehow not okay, but that, that sometimes he can say dumb things without thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that maybe he has some judgments that say nothing about you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], this is the real, the real key is to realize that when people judge us for something, it says nothing about us, it says something about them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And their judgment, somebody, somebody come up, could come up to you and say [PATIENT NAME], you're too tall and someone else could come up to you and say [PATIENT NAME], you're too short, now which ones right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Neither one's right, you're just the perfect height you're supposed to be, it's just that they, some people might think you should be taller or shorter than you are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that doesn't say anything about you, it just say something about their judgment -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Someone could come up and say you should have bigger boobs, someone else could say you should have smaller boobs, who's right?  Neither one.  Someone could say you should have blonder hair, you should have less blond hair -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you should have different color eyes, I mean, that, that doesn't say anything about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right, yeah.  It does make sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't have to conform to anybody else's expectations, you know, you can, if you feel good about yourself, then if other people can't accept you the way you are, it's really their problem and I don't mean that in an arrogant stuck up kind of way, but just in a, in the self confident kind of way -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're okay being who you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, makes me kind of angry, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, see, and that, so, I don't even know what to say to him now, you know.  I feel like that should be like a big thing, and like I should just, you know, I don't even know, I don't even know.  Because that matters to me and like I said, it's not going to go away, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't know, and he's like, well some things you can just get over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's talking about you getting over or himself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I told him I'm never going to forget that, ever and he said, well some things you can just get over.  And I said, I don't even know what I said, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, people do stupid things sometimes and, and, uh, you know, I guess it is important to learn forgiveness in a relationship, [LAUGHING], because most people do stupid things and we can learn to forgive them, as long as they don't keep repeating the same stupid mistake over and over again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, I mean, there are degrees of mistakes, too, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, we all say something without thinking at times, you know, we might hurt somebody's feelings without meaning to, um, I'm dealing with this with my 2 kids right now who are, my youngest ones who are [AGE] and [AGE], because my [AGE] just will just say things or do things that really hurts his sister's feelings -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she gets so angry with him and we're teaching her, you know, he's, you know, he's only [AGE], he makes mistakes and you got to be patient with him and forgive him and give him another chance, well then he does it again and she gets frustrated -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, you know, if, if she holds on to that anger at him, she's the one that's really being hurt by it, not him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that worse, [PATIENT NAME], I mean, it's important to you not to feel bad about yourself or about this comment that he made because ultimately you're the one that will suffer, not him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if he keeps doing things like that over and over again, and then, you may want to look at the relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it sounds like this isn't something he's done often, this was like a one time thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And he always does stupid things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, does he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that was like, you know, way up there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was tough thing there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, so does he say other stupid things about you or just about other people or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, other people, uh, like, you know, this is, this is, maybe I'm overreacting about this, I don't know.  We were at this bar like a week ago and we're sitting up at the bar counter, you know, and we're talking and we had like 3 beers which is not that much, you know, um, and, uh, this girl, there was like a girl standing at the register typing something in like right in front of us and this other girl, a bartender comes up and likes smacks her butt, you know, just like a joke, like we're friends or whatever, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he looks over there and he's practically like drooling out the side of his mouth and I was like, right, we were talking about something, I don't remember and he's like sorry, that's a magnet and I was like, I, I don't even know what I said but I was kind of annoyed with him, you know, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Said sorry that's a magnet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, that's a magnet, like he has to look, he has to pay attention to that.  Which might be understandable, I don't know, but I just, with him, it's always like, like I said, I don't think he always means harm by things, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's whether or not I want to put up with this my whole entire life because I know not all guys are like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the thing is, I mean, you know, remember I told you, I don't, I'm hesitant to say boyfriend because then you're at the break up, you, you know, you have a break up instead of just, hey, let's not hang out anymore.  Now, I'm there, now I'm in this position where he's totally in love with me, you know, he's told he's he loves me more than a few times and I've never said it but, you know, he's so sure he wants to marry me, he has all these plans, blah, blah, blah and I'm thinking like no, you know, and now I'm in this place again where I'm going to have to break up with somebody who's totally in love with me and break their heart and there's no clean break there, you can't just say, there, he's not going to say okay and then, you know, I, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I do know what you mean, although [PATIENT NAME], I mean, if you decide to break up with him, it's important you do it because that's what you want, not because to stay together with him because you're going to hurt his feelings, so, you know what I mean, and I don't think you would do that would you, stay with him just because you don't want to hurt his feelings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, uh, I mean that would delay it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's happened in the past, for sure, just because I'm so like tired of this, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So tired of the comments he's making?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, tired of breaking up with -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> People.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let, let me ask you this, I mean, do you still enjoy being with him some of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and is there more good, are there more good times or more bad times with him these days?  Is it 50/50 or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, maybe like 50/50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We have fun together -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, and I could, I could see myself with him, I guess, if I like think about the future or whatever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can see him there, but I can very easily see him not there, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very easily see somebody else in his place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not really attached to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, and that, if that's the way you feel, that's the way you feel, there's nothing wrong or bad about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you were worried last time we talked about, you know, him going away to Alaska 3 months, maybe that's just a normal kind of break point it sounds like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In your relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's June, is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE], I think, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is like 6 weeks away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now the other question I just thought of about that, sometimes if something's hap, coming up that might hurt us, we tend to pull back to avoid being hurt so badly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think that could be happening, too, where part of you wants to pull away from him so that when he does leave -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't hurt so badly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That makes sense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, at the same time, you know, a lot of times like, you know, I feel like I could do better than him, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yes, but maybe that this, uh, break may be just, or the comments he makes may just be helping make it easy for you to break up, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly, exactly -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's kind of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, and, you know, there's nothing wrong with dating different guys to figure out, you know, what you want in life and what you don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it seems like that's what you're doing, I mean, and it takes a long time to get to know someone, um, again I know a lot of people that fall in love real fast and get married real quickly and then really regret it later -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, because they just didn't, you know, after they get to know someone, they find out that that things aren't as good as they thought -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In fact, I know one gentleman who's been married and divorced 3 times, he said the one thing he's learned from his 3 marriages is, he said, you shouldn't marry someone based upon how good the relationship is when it's good, because he said most relationships when they're good are pretty good -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she, you should pick a partner based on how bad it is when it's bad, he said, because some relationships when they get bad are awful and he said you just can't stand to be in them -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But other ones, when they get at their worst, aren't that bad, so, you know, they're, they're tolerable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I thought that was an interesting way -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At looking at relationships but it also kind of makes some, make sense because he was involved in some relationships that were really abusive, the women would just abuse him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he would stay in and stay in because he didn't want to, for a lot of reasons, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm thinking at, at your worst with [NAME OTHER], you know, when he's at his worst, would you want to stay with him at that point or, or no, is it just not something you want to stay in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, probably not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I keep feeling like I could be with somebody who's not like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Someone who would be nicer and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More careful with their words -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tactful -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tactful -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Smarter, I guess -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't really know what I'm doing with him, but yet again, there is just this whole big deal that I'm going to have to deal with now, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, and it sounds like part of the reason you're with him is because you, sometimes, enjoy his company and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, and sometimes he can be very nice to you, it sounds like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and you're working with him which makes it complicated -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if you were to break up now it would be pretty uncomfortable probably, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The next 6 weeks until he leaves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, are you thinking, then, I mean, that maybe you'll break up with him when he leaves, and then he's not coming back to the job, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's not coming back to the job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know, it could be really messed up, I don't even know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's messed up about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, and if you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, he, he, he kept saying, you know, he's not going to go if he would lose me, but I know him, you know, and if he doesn't get this need out of him to go to Alaska and fish, then it's going to pop up later in life, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't want to be in it, so, I don't want, you know, if we do end up together, which I don't know that we will, but, I don't want to be like, you know, with a toddler or something and all of a sudden he wakes up 1 day and says, hey, I'm leaving, I never lived my dream or something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he just needs to get this out of him, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And also it sounds like, um, he said he wouldn't go if he's going, if it means he's going to lose you, but if he's going to lose you, it's not because he's going to Alaska, it's because of the comments he makes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The things he says.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are there other things besides these comments that he makes that cause you to not want to be in a relationship with him?  Or is that enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, that's enough, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are things some people call deal breakers, have you ever heard that term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certain things about another person that you just don't want to put up with or live with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, for some people it's maybe he uses alcohol or drugs too much, some people it's violence or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cheating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people it's cheating, some people it's, you know, there are all different things that can be, that people say I can put up with it to this point, but beyond this, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's different for everybody, I mean, I know people that, you talked about cheating, I know people that say, you know, my partner had an affair and I'll forgive him this one time, but never again and other people say no, one time and they're out of here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, some people say well, you know, he drinks too much, but I'll put up with it as long as, you know, it doesn't cause problems, but, you know, if he gets a DUI then that's it, so people all have different levels of tolerance in relationships.  Do you know what your kind of limits are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, um, cheating is definitely a deal breaker -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once and you're out -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't get over that, I don't think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but just, uh, I don't, I don't know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not the most tolerant person in the world -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So making comments that are hurtful or put downs, maybe could be a deal breaker then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I never say stuff like that to him, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there's a lot of stuff I don't like about him, you know, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure, in any relationship, that's going to be natural.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, we're not going to like everything about ever, you know, the person we're with necessarily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but how people handle that is important, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If they, if they just blurt things out that are hurtful, that's not healthy for the relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't even know what to do about him right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well how, are you guys seeing each other a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like every other night, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So quite a bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We hang out or go out to eat or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And do you enjoy spending time with him when you're together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it sounds like one option would be just to keep seeing him for the next 6 weeks or so until he leaves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you break it with him before he leaves or you could stay together even after  he leaves, see what you think, but it sounds like this is kind of a deal breaker for you, you don't want to stay with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, there are a lot of negatives here, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did I get the meaning that his comments, his leaving for 3 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes I feel like a kid with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In what way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's [AGE], you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I appreciate that very much, there are so many good things about him being older than me, I, I don't know, I mean guys my age, they're just, they're just boys, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but sometimes I really do feel really like, like a kid with him, like it's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it that he treats you like a kid or you just feel the age difference do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just feel the age difference sometimes, I mean, I don't know if I could even think of an example.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, sometimes, yeah, I just think -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is it that just, do you think, [PATIENT NAME], that you're kind of at different stages of life and that he's just lived longer so he's in kind of a different place in his life, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, there are different kind of stages we go through in life where you have people looking for different things and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For example, some people in their early 20s aren't ready to settle to down and get married whereas some people in their early 30s are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For example, I mean, do you feel like if he proposed to you, would you want to get married?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean even, even if he hadn't made these dumb comments, I mean even if he was perfect in every way, a perfect fit -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to get married in, right now -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, whereas he may be at an age in his life where maybe he does, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that could be a difference -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be a deal breaker again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Does he treat you like an equal, do you feel like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think he does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's, you know, chivalrous or whatever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Chivalrous, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's nice like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he doesn't typically put you down and look down on you because you're younger.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not, no, like, no, not by any means.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, and I'm just thinking back to when, to when we started talking a while back about relationships, wanting to work on relationships and trying to figure out, you know, why you leave relationships sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, sometimes there are good reasons to leave relationships too, if it's not working for you or you don't feel like it's, uh, giving you what you want and what I hear you saying is there's some things about this relationship that really aren't giving you what you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not what you're looking for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and then I also hear, though, you feel kind of guilty about ending a relationship, though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And do you know what, what that guilt's about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to break his heart, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe, maybe not, I mean you could, I mean, or, I mean he could have a broken heart because he's, he's not getting what he wants, which is you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or he could say, well, you know, I'm sad or disappointed, but you didn't want me so I guess it's time to move on and he could not have a broken heart -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's kind of up to him in terms of how he reacts -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'm thinking, you know, I think we all get our hearts broken at times in a relationship because we find a relationship that we think is the one we want -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then it doesn't work out -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But sometimes that works out for the best, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you're right.  It's just going to be this whole messy ordeal, I can't just call him up and be like, hey, you know, no more, you know, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why not, what's going to happen, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's not going to say okay, thanks for the time, he's going to, argue with me, he's going to say why, why, why, he's going to say but this will happen and I'll fix it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and I'm just going to have to say no over and over again, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you expect that he's just not just go away gracefully [LAUGHING] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's going to want to continue the relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is not going to be a clean break, by any means.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Woo.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is exactly what I didn't want to get myself into, you know, I keep learning this lesson -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Over and over again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, then how, is there anything that you can do to make it easier on yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  Like what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, do you wait until he's gone?  Until he's in Alaska?  Or until he comes back from Alaska to actually give him officially the notice that you want to break up with him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would that make it easier, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It might, that's one option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I used to think when I was in high school, I was in a similar situation, I had a girlfriend and I went away for the summer for 3 months for a job and when I came back, she broke up with me -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, I was kind of sad and disappointed, but it was okay, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because after 3 months apart, we had kind of grown apart anyway -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, so it wasn't as painful as if I had just been seeing her every day before that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> An option is that maybe after 3 months apart, you kind of grow apart anyway and maybe it's easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's a possibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good point.  You're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so I'm thinking you don't have to break up with him like, you know, today, I mean you can kind of pick the timing that might work best, you see what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does, you're right, because he'll have other things on his mind when he comes back and everything, and new experiences or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it's possible, I mean, I don't know him, so I don't know how he'll react, the other thing, [PATIENT NAME], is if he tries to keep, you know, drawing you in and arguing with you and you don't have to go there either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can say to him, I made up my mind, I just don't want to, it's just over, you know, there's, the things about our relationship that just don't work for me and, you know, I like you as a person, I just don't want to, don't want to date you anymore, don't want to be your girlfriend anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if he keeps going on, you can hang up the phone and you can walk away or do whatever you got to do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, and, if he keeps calling you and bugging you, you can, I mean, do you think he would do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he like a stalker type person, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  But, he'd try to win me back or something, probably.  But I don't think he'd be crazy about it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, and do you think he has any chance of winning you back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Then he can try, but it just isn't working -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can move on with your life and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, it sounds like break up of relationships is hard for you, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And has been in the past, have you had some -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Painful experiences before when you broke up relationships?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what was painful about it, for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just, it was always like I broke their hearts so much, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's like, with, especially with my, my last boyfriend, it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which, what's his name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was the one from Mexico.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he, uh, at, we were together for a year and a half and like, how, you know half a year into it, we were really very, very together, I mean, and everything was very good, you know, and we would talk about like serious stuff like that and I was the first one to say, you know, you know, stuff about, uh, like, you know, I could see having kids with you one day and stuff like that, I was the first 1 to say all that, you know, and then a year later, I break up with him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was the one who put all that stuff in his head in the first place, you know, and he would never even have thought that if I hadn't said that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe, maybe not, you don't know what he was thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, one thing to think about [PATIENT NAME] is, you know, we're each responsible for our own emotions and, you know, nobody's responsible for someone else's feelings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you talked about breaking his heart, I mean, it's really up to him how he reacts, I mean, when my girlfriend broke up with me after 3 months when I was away that summer, I could have been crushed and devastated or I could have said, well, okay, let me pick up the pieces and move on -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it, it's really up to each of us to choose how we react to situations -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I had another girlfriend that broke up and, shew, I was kind of relieved and she didn't break my heart, you know, just kind of, yeah, I could feel, too, the relationship wasn't working -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it was kind of a relief to move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's, it's my responsibility to choose how I react to someone's, um, breaking up with me -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, just like if [NAME OTHER] broke up with you, you know, how would you feel, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd probably be like whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay [LAUGHING] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he wouldn't break your heart, then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you really can't break your heart, I mean, now, if you were madly in love with him and saw him as, you know, the perfect person in your life you'd want to be with forever, and he ended it, you'd be hurt -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, why, because of your desire to be with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not really so much that he's doing it to you, it's really our desires or our feelings to determine how we react.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And my point about that is, it's, it's not your fault if someone's feelings get hurt because you end the relationship with him if it's not working well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, does that make sense at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It does, it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't want you to feel guilty for doing  -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something that is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The reasonable thing to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does make sense, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch him cry, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if it's too hard -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Doesn't hurt any less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and, you know, I know I made this too hard, but you don't have to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, maybe you just, you know, he's a grown man, he's got to figure out how to deal with his feelings on his own, maybe -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and you know, like I said, I had one girlfriend when I was in college that I thought that was the relationship, we talked about getting married, having kids and everything was going fine -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all of a sudden, she just, she broke that off because she was afraid, she became scared and it broke, I, my heart was broken, I was devastated that, you know, this relationship that I thought was going to be forever wasn't and, uh, but we stayed in touch and we were friends, and over the years, I was really glad later that she ended it.  We tried to get back together and it didn't work and I realized it wasn't a good relationship in the long term for some other reasons and so it was really a good thing that she broke it off, because of she hadn't, it probably would have gotten a lot more painful later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so, I mean, you may be doing [NAME OTHER] a favor now by breaking it off instead of, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Dragging it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trying to make it keep going and dragging it out and then realizing it wasn't going to work anyway because there are these things about him that are deal breakers for you that never would have worked.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It totally does -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's how it was with my ex boyfriend, that's why I felt so bad, I felt like I dragged it out because I wanted it to be better -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it never got better, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know, the one thing I've learned about  relationships is you really can't change the other person, they are who they are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if they're, and who they are works for you in a relationship, great, then you've got something that works pretty well, but if, if it doesn't, I mean, a lot of times people think, you know, if I could just change this about him, or just change that, then things would be good, but we can't do that, it doesn't work, we can't change other people and who they are is who they are going to continue to be unless they desire or work at changing themselves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, if [NAME OTHER] wants to change these kind of off the wall comments he makes, if he sees that as a problem, and he's going to address it, that's one think, but if he just says, that's just who I am, take it or leave it, then he's probably not going to change -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For example, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know he said that before, too, he says I am who I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See that's always a sign that, uh, you got to be careful, because it probably indicate he's not very likely to change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not only that, but, I mean, you've been dating for a few months, it could become even more prevalent over time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then is that something that you want to put up with or not.  I know a man who's a severe alcoholic, to the point where his wife has left him, his kids don't want to be around him and he says the same thing, I am who I am, take me or leave me, well, they're leaving him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because he's, you know, he's lost his job because of his drinking, he's got DUIs, you know, he's obnoxious and they're like he's just a horrible alcoholic, but he won't do anything about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he thinks everybody should just put up with him the way he is, well, no, they don't have to put up with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't have to put up with things in your, if relationships that don't work for you either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And yesterday, we went to breakfast, um, and he was telling me his older brother, um, uh, and his, and his older brother's wife are getting divorced, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They just finished the papers or whatever and they have kids together and he's, um, like maybe 6 years older than [NAME OTHER] is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but, he said one of the main reasons is because [NAME OTHER] is not attracted to him anymore, because she's kind of a big girl and by no means is she like really big and she dresses pretty, I've met her a couple of times, you know, and she looks good, she looks nice, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she's a, a bigger girl, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's why he left her.  That's like the main reason, according to [NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, because, because, well this is his justification, because he wanted her to care, at least, which is fair, I guess -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Care about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About how she looks for him which is fair, but at the same time I was like, wow, you know, maybe he should have told her in the beginning, you know, if it's ever like this, then that's my deal breaker, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because now, you know, and she's had, you know 4 kids, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I stood up for her, I defended her because, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that's a tricky one now, because there are things, again, like, I've had people say well, if he, if he loves me, he would accept me just the way I am -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this is from someone who doesn't take care of them self at all, that's, you know, grossly obese, that, uh, doesn't, doesn't, you know, take care of themselves at all in all kinds of ways and you know, I, I disagree with that part, that, I don't think we, you know, if you fell in love with [NAME OTHER] and all of a sudden he just let's himself go and he, you know, sits around and drinks beer all night and develops a big belly and he, you know, doesn't wash his face, doesn't shower, you know, no, I don't think you have to love him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, how, but on the other hand, there are also relationships that can be very superficial, but again, if, you know, if she doesn't look just the way I want her to and if, I mean, I know guys like this, they'll, they'll control what their wives wear, what clothes they're allowed to wear, what kind of makeup they can wear -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if they don't look just exactly the way their husband wants them to, then they're not okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's not healthy either -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's got to be some balance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what I hear you saying is you were standing up for [NAME OTHER] because, you know, she's been through a lot and she's not going to be maybe petite and tiny after 4 kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but it also says that maybe in that family, they, there's a, a strong, um, what am I trying to say, that, that appearance is really important to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And he's very much like his brother -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what worries me, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And when he told me that, I was like, oh, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you get married and have kids and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put on weight, is he going to dump you then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly, that was my first thought, oh, great, that's how that's going to go, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a possibility, it happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, exactly, it does, that's why people have affairs is because they're not attracted to their husband or their wife anymore, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, people don't feel like they're getting their needs met in relationships and then they start looking outside the relationship to get those needs me, whether that's sexual needs, emotional needs, physical needs, whatever kind of need -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and yet, you know, there are other people who are perfectly content in their relationship and it's not the size of the person, I know a man who's married to a woman that's over 300 pounds and he just loves her dearly -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's not about her size, or how she looks, I mean, that's not what, what he loves about her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, so, but it's important, again, that you're finding out what's important to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And to see is that what you're looking for, someone who has those values -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like the answer's probably no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So [PATIENT NAME], you know, even, I don't know if you've ever done this, I know people that have liked even made a list of what kind of characteristics they're looking for in like the ideal boyfriend, mate, husband, whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not that a person has to have every one of those items on the checklist, but it kind of helps them get an idea of what they're looking for so they're more likely to recognize it if they find it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's something to think about, even if you just do it mentally or on paper, whatever, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're going to do that, can you think of some of the characteristics or traits that you would most look for in a guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of things are important to you?  Can you think of just a few of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, somebody who's nice -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And somebody who is dependable -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Reliable, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, caring I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Somebody who's nice to waiters and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So what I hear you talking about already is what kind of person are they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't hear you talking about how big their muscles are or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, or, you know, what color eyes they have, even, and again, there are certain things that are physically attractive to people, you're really talking about what kind of character does he have -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and those things are important because it says a lot about the person -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know the, the bottom line is physical appearances change over time, you know it's, um, people who are maybe gorgeous in their 20s, may in their 30s or 40s not be so attractive, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I just went to  my 30 year high school reunion a couple of years ago, and it was amazing to see how people change over 30 years -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, man, you know, some of the, for the women, the women don't usually get more attractive as they get older, but the guys, you know, they kind of, you know, they got big potbellies -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They lose their hair and, you know, like, if you marry somebody just basically on appearance, your, people are going to be disappointed as they get older because people don't maintain their good looks -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Over time, you know, it's just, that's just nature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, naturally, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Natural aging process.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, I'm just thinking of a friend know who's from India -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And over there, they still have arranged marriages, you know what those are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where the parents pick a partner -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they, the reason they do that is because they think that, in this country, we have such a high divorce rate because we pick people based on falling in love with someone -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then when those feelings sort of, you know, diminish with time, which they do, we don't feel that same infatuation of someone forever, but then a lot of times people get tired of the relationship and go look for another relationship, whereas in India where they have arranged marriages, they really look at character, what kind of person is going to be a good husband or wife for that person, they try to find a good fit, and people have different expectations, they don't expect that they're going to be madly in love with that person all the time, but they look for a good person who's a loving, caring, kind person who will be a good parent, you know, those kind of things and, and their divorce rate is almost 0 over there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think there is something to be said for looking at something besides just physical appearances in a person -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or just, just falling in love and thinking that's going to be what sustains a marriage forever, it won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, there's got to be more to it than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I see so many people who fall in love, and then they get divorced a few years later they think, well, I fell, I fell in love with them but then I fell out of love with them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that was all this relationship was based upon, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It happens a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It definitely does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think it's good that you're getting in your mind the kind of stuff or the characteristics that you're looking for someone who's kind, trustworthy -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those kind of traits.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And would you say, does [NAME OTHER] meet those criteria?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he's kind, he's nice, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so he's nice, is he trustworthy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm not that all, I'm not that trusting of anybody, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not, I don't, uh, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just going to say no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so there's one [LAUGHING] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Black mark against him already then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and that's okay, I mean, that's what you want to find out when you, that's the reason people date other people, or go out is to find out what kind of person is this person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And sometimes you don't know until you're with them a long time, you see them in different situations -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, so, you know, it's kind of like test driving a car, if you don't ever test drive, you don't know how -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How it's going to drive, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And in relationships, you can't just test drive once, you can't go out on one date and get to know the person, it takes months or years sometimes to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To find out and what's this person like in different situations, so, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That sucks, God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, kind of wish we had the culture of arranged marriages over here -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], yeah, in some ways, that would make it easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, before we stop, I didn't get a chance to ask about medications.  Are you doing okay with medications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That Wellbutrin, the only thing about that, it makes me really shaky -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I like it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it gives me energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it, I, I like it, I want to stay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So do you want to stick with it for now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd like to stay with that for now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're too shaky, we can always cut back on the dose, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it too much, or is it tolerable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's tolerable, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so your mood has been pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But not too good, not excessively high?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so so, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, oh, you said you were waking up about every hour without the Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah maybe -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I fall back asleep, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we can kind of see how that goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you appetite and weight stable with the medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The same, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not supposed to be taking trazodone, right, that's a, that's canceled right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we stopped it because you were real tired in the mornings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I am taking the Lamictal still, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the Lamictal -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Depakote still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.  Just making sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, at some point, you know, I think we talked about maybe trying to back off some of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then I'm thinking let's maybe wait a little bit longer if that's okay with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'd like to find the least amount of medicine that works, and, that Depakote, I'm not sure if it's doing anything or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Me either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're take, taking such a small amount of it, I mean, let me ask you this, I mean, do you want to keep taking the Depakote or do you want to try getting off of it because I just got that, uh, prescription refill request about it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let's not refill it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, let's try that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now let me ask you that, because I already faxed it in, are they going to send it to you and bill you for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, I'll ask my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might be able to cancel it and not have to pay for it then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you want to go ahead and try stopping it, see how you feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we might as well, but, you know, the thing is, my dad has been doing mail order for so long, I have like a huge amount of all, the Lamictal -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trazodone and Depakote, I still have a ton of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I was just thinking about saving you the cost of that prescription so maybe if you can cancel it, at least you won't have to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pay for that one, but let's go ahead and stop it then and see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How you do, now if you start having any mood swings, will you call me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you will, because I think the Lamictal will still take care of things -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I just want to make sure things don't get any worse, you know, I want to make sure they keep getting better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Sometimes I forget to even take that one, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're not taking it real regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I try, I do, but sometimes I'll be like, wait, did I take it last night or am I supposed to take it tonight -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you feel like you're able to focus reasonable well, like at work -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so, and are you having much anxiety these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mm, I don't know, I don't, I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't feel real nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't feel real nervous, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think the Wellbutrin is good, I really do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel better with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so let's leave it the way it is for now -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we'll stop the Depakote and see how that work, you can try the half tablets of the Ambien, see if that works for sleep -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If that's not working let me, let me know, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay [PATIENT NAME], good.  Anything else today, do you want to talk about that before we stop?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like you're doing well; just sounds like you have some tough things coming up about relationships -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you know, everyone of these is a learning experience, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think part of what you may learn through this situation is that you're responsible for other people's feelings or emotions.  It's hard to see someone hurting that you care about, but it's also, it's worse to not be honest with them and, you know, string them along and, so, I think the question sounds like, for you now, is just the timing, you know, when, what would best for you, do you think, in terms of if you decide to end the relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm think at the end of Alaska is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, sounds good, so 2 weeks work for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, sounds good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When is that, the, [DATE], [DATE] I think?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, do you want me to give you a card?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, it'd be the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just going to take -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, help yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good meeting with you, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're welcome, take it easy.</p>

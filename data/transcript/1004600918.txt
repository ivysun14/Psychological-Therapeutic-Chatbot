<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. How are you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. So I got the name of someone. Would you like me to go ahead and contact her and find out about her availability? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes because I've been contacting people, and everyone I contact has a wait list so I'm frustrated. It's also a little complicated just because of our insurance and sudden change. I spoke to one woman yesterday and she said I don't take your insurance because that's what we have now so you can pay out-of-pocket. But then I don't even know what our insurance is going to be in August so it kind of complicates things a little bit. [00:01:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well actually I don't know about your in-network benefits. They only give you 36 sessions. So actually I haven't gotten into it because it's not that many sessions, but they've actually stopped paying so I'm just getting your co-pay. I mean it's because you've run out of sessions, but it's not for that many more sessions so I didn't bring it up with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They only gave me 36?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not even a week for year. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. I mean the university gives students 12 sessions a year. I know. Unfortunately for you... I mean I don't want to take up your time but other health insurances can't set session limits, but because universities are private they set their own rules. Anyway so that's... I don't know. I have a feeling... So anyway unfortunately it's not going to cover...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cover anything. [00:02:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should've let you know that. I mean for the purposes of us it's whatever. I think maybe it's like six or so sessions they're not going to cover so I wasn't going to bring it up with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (inaudible at 00:02:16) because some people say that they offer a sliding scale for people who are paying out-of-pocket. So I'll just say that we need to pay out-of-pocket until August. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should've told you that because for our purposes it's not going to... I should've told you that. But once you get—I mean so when will Chris have health insurance? </p>

<p>CLIENT: In August. End of August. He's going to start his job the last week of August so he will then and then we should be all set. But yeah so I've been contacting people. This is actually kind of (inaudible at 00:02:49). I've been contacting people and I brought it up to Chris. I was a little nervous to bring it up to Chris because we talked about it forever ago like the fact that we wanted to go see somebody before we had a baby. And I wasn't sure how he was going to react, what he was going to say, and the thing that I remembered was that... So we had to go to Pre-Cana before we got married which is just like (inaudible at 00:03:26) pass our church. [00:03:28]</p>

<p>Do you know what Pre-Cana is? It's mandated by the church if you want to get married there. So you can either do it over sessions like weekly sessions over a month or something or you can go for a weekend. Actually what it is it's like a weekend retreat with all the other couples who are getting ready to have the church and it's like counseling. You go over all the issues that like people get up and they speak about issues like finances, dealing with loss of family members, children, sexuality, and then they talk about how they deal with it, and then you... They have a packet. It's through the church because it's some church stuff. But then you take the packet and let you go separately and you fill out your answers alone and then you come back together and you discuss them. [00:04:22 ]</p>

<p>And going into it both of us were like oh my God this is going to be so ridiculous. And during the weekend we were like this is great. And we left the weekend thinking that was great. And we really loved it. We felt like we got a lot out of it. We felt like we had already talked about a lot of the things but it was really good to write out a plan if one of our parent's get sick how are we going to handle that. What will we want to do? Would you ever consider having a parent live with you? And basically you write down well I want three kids. I want four. How are we going to deal with that? And talking about those kinds of things was great and we both thought it was great. And so that's kind of how I approached this with him. [00:05:10]</p>

<p>I said, "I looked for a doctor in New Hampshire because I want to have a consultation with somebody before I go to them as my OB and get all that." And so I said, "I made that appointment and along the same lines I've been looking for people for us to go see together." He said, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Well you know we really feel like we got a lot out of Pre-Cana and so we had talked about how going into one huge life change that was really helpful so going into another new huge life change we should do something along the same lines." And I'd really like us to work out our communication issues, and I just think that it would be something that would be really useful." And he got this face on like he didn't agree with it and he's like I don't want to have that conversation, but if its something you really want to do then fine. [00:06:13]</p>

<p>I was like we talked months ago and he's like I don't remember it but fine like if you want to do it I'm fine. So the thing is I don't need him to be thrilled about it. I don't need him to be like yes that sounds lovely because he's just not going to. I just need him to not give me any resistance on it and so I'm just not going to bring it up and don't have an appointment. So that's good. I was a little bit nervous that I was going to get met with some resistance and I think the Pre-Cana if it helped in just that that there was a situation where we found something similar and he saw a benefit and then I can point to that and say we did this, and we liked it, and it was helpful why not just do it again. What's the harm? So I was happy about that reaction. [00:07:19] </p>

<p>And now I just need to nail something down. So that's kind of a relief. It makes me really nervous; really, really nervous to go talk about it and talk about... I feel like I can go to the guys and like we're going to be proactive about when we have a family. And I can say that to him, but deep inside I know that (inaudible at 00:07:53) some problems. And I don't know if I have the guts to say that or do that this early in our marriage without the guise of that of we're starting a family and this is the smart thing to do. I don't think I would say we need to go work these issues... If we were just not going to have a family, I don't know if I would have the balls to do that. [00:08:22] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean this early in your marriage? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like this seems to me... Like I talked about it last time like newlyweds shouldn't have these kinds of problems. They shouldn't have... And I guess I just need to get over that. And I just need to... Like I just feel like we shouldn't be having these huge fights. I always felt like that kind of thing came later because problems in your marriage came later. Like early in your marriage everyone's so doe eyed like googly-eyed over each other and like they can't keep their hands off each other. And I guess we still have that, but we still have huge fights too. And so—I don't know—I guess I struggle with that a little bit or think that it's so early in our marriage why do we... But I just need to get over it because we deal with these problems. It doesn't matter if we're a month into our marriage, two years into our marriage, these are our problems. This is what it is. I have to deal with them now. So I just need to get over it. [00:09:46]</p>

<p>I don't think he sees them as huge marital... I think he just thinks we have fights like every couple has fights. And too a point I feel that way too. I don't know (inaudible at 00:10:10) in college. And I'm not okay with our communication needs. It's just inside fights. Communication outside of arguing is I feel like fine but... (Pause) I think part of it too is that I want him to be seeing somebody, and so I feel like this is the way for me to get him to just talk about his feelings in the moment. It's hard to say something when you're really wrapped up. And I want him to talk about things when he's calm that maybe are bothering him. [00:11:12]</p>

<p>Because a lot of times like when we had that really big fight the weekend of graduation, and we tend to have really big fights when a lot is going on like when he's really stressed, and then I feed off of that, and then I'm really stressed, and so I'm anxious, and I get really upset. So we don't have the tools to just say I'm just spread too thin right now like I can't... You know we don't have those and so that's, I guess, what I want. Then I think if we could go together and hear the other person talk more openly about how they feel before we get to that kind of breaking point, it'll be helpful. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>(Pause) I just felt the need to just explain a little bit. I think I just needed to sort it out for myself is what I want. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like he'd be open to going on his own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it depends. Like I think as far as he sees it his OCD is manageable so I don't really know. I think maybe he did once so maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I think if it was something that it was clear that I really wanted but I feel the same way with him as I feel about every other person in my life like speaking for addicts I guess. I know Chris is not an addict but I feel like it's a similar thing like you shouldn't want to fix yourself just because I want you to fix yourself. [00:13:23]</p>

<p>So yes he should want to go see somebody if you feel like it's going to be better for us if our marriage... I don't... Because I've already been the person who told you, you had to go do that before and I felt it backfire. I felt him say like if I didn't have to go to that stupid thing it wouldn't come up in this. I don't want to tell him he has to go do something again so I'm not. So maybe if we go see somebody together and he feels like that's something that he needs to do on his own (pause) then... I feel like just like I can't ask my dad to get sober because of me. I can't ask Chris to get help for his OCD because of me. To me I just don't see it. [00:14:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think those are different situations. (Pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But neither of those things the person can control. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know about... I mean it sounds like for Chris... I mean you've mentioned his OCD but it seems like what you've talked about more in terms of what effects you is the way he manages his anger. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: People can manage their anger better. That's certainly one of the things that people go to therapy for. [00:15:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I guess I'm hoping that when we go together that's something that we could talk about; that he could talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I want to hear how you feel are similar situations because it seems like in a marriage where you're entering in part because you have needs that you want to have met and there's a particular kind of—I don't know—expectation to that, for you not having explosive fights even if they're intermittent, that seems pretty legitimate to ask that of your partner that you work on that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well and that's kind of what I said that too him but that's why I want us to go see somebody together is because I don't want to have that. And so (pause) I want him to talk about it and—I don't know—to maybe recognize on his own that that's something that he needs to work on. I don't know. [00:16:24]</p>

<p>I can tell him in the moment that he's being out of control and seeming crazy to me, but I'm never going to bring it up again for fear that it will turn into a fight. And so (pause) outside of a fight when we're in a calm place I'm never going to say you losing your temper and yelling at me isn't okay for me and we need to work on that. I'm never going to say that when we're just fine because I don't want to get in a fight. So I want to have a space... I don't know if I finished. I want to have a space where we can go like that's the time when we're supposed to be going and talking about things in our marriage that aren't working. That didn't seem maybe connected. [00:17:29]</p>

<p>I guess I just never thought about asking him to go see somebody for anything other than his OCD because that to me seems like the thing that he needs help with. And then the other things I always seemed to—to me are just things that our marriage needs help with. So yeah, I don't know. Do you have a sense what that is? Because I remember like... [00:18:13]</p>

<p>And I think Chris just also isn't very mature in relationships like he just didn't... If I had been his second, third, or fourth girlfriend... He had never had a girlfriend before me. So I think that another girlfriend would've left him. Maybe not. I don't know. I feel like if he had more experience in relationships he would've learned that these kinds of behaviors just don't fly like people don't... And I put up with it because of whatever reasons. But I think a lot of it comes from it's just inexperience in relationships. [00:19:08]</p>

<p>(Pause) I make a lot of excuses it sounds like. (Pause) I just want it to be as good as it is when it's good all the time. Like it's good most of the time so why can't we just be as... Why can't it... [00:20:10]</p>

<p>(Pause) My cousin who is a year younger than me and got married less than a year ago I found out when I was in Concord (inaudible at 00:20:35) she's pregnant, and I got so jealous. My mom said, "Did you know that Judy's pregnant?" And I was so thrown off by it. It's not like I know all these Judy's. I was like Judy who? I was so thrown by it because she got married—She hasn't even been married a year. And in my mind it's like she's a year younger than me, she got married a year after me, she's behind me. [00:21:01]</p>

<p>And I found out she was pregnant, and I was like oh and the first thing I said was I'm really happy for her. And it was so false I could hear myself being fake about it. And then I said, "I'm pretty jealous." And my mom said, "Yeah I know." "It's okay though." "You'll be pregnant next." And my mom I think is too, but—I don't know—it made me really, really jealous. And then later that night I got into bed and I told Chris about it and I cried. It's not like I can't have a baby. It's not like I'm having miscarriages or even trying to get pregnant really. Anyway it's something... I don't know. I was really jealous. But yeah, it's very exciting for her. [00:22:20]</p>

<p>(Pause) My mom was so like... It's her brother's daughter and she was really judgmental of his reaction to it. It was yeah he didn't even seem excited. He's like not even excited about it. That's weird. And I was like I don't know. It's his first... It's his little girl. Maybe he's just having a weird reaction to it for whatever reason and he's nervous for her or something. And I don't know. I just felt this additional pressure that I had not felt before where I had kind of the baby fever on my own but I didn't know that it was like... Well I kind of guess I... When I had an abortion when I was younger my mom didn't want me to. She wanted me to keep it. And so I knew that she wanted me to have babies obviously, but I didn't feel this from her because she's never talked about it. [00:23:47]</p>

<p>Two summers ago I had to say something... Because I would bring up having kids and my mom would just shut down and she just wouldn't talk about it. And she would act almost cold about it, and it would hurt my feelings, and so I brought it up to her. I said, "What is that?" "When I say something about having kids you just shut down." I read it as her thinking that I was irresponsible and that I was not prepared or too young. I just read it as her not approving. I asked, "What is that?" And she started crying and she said, "I'm just really sad because I know that when you have kids I'm not going to be around." Because at the time our plan was for Chris to finish law school and go right back to California. She said, "It's hard for me because I'm not going to be around, and I'm never going to see them, and I'm not going to see you be a mom." "That's really hard for me." And I didn't realize that. And so since then I've kind of realized it but... [00:24:47]</p>

<p>(Pause) And now she's like who's your doctor, and where are you going to go, and you should go do this, and she was never like that with me. She isn't hovery (sp?) or like interested really in a lot of things, unless it's wrong, that I'm doing. She just kind of like stays in her own little worry nut, but this one's getting a lot of attention, and I guess I kind of like that. I don't like the pressure because that makes me nervous because there's something that I'm really anxious about myself like anxious to have happen. But I like that she's really excited, and interested, and... [00:25:56]</p>

<p>(Pause) I still do... I did it yesterday but I'll call her, or write her an e-mail, or tell her... I guess this is just what kids do with their parents they tell them when they have done something that they're proud of. But I would call her, or e-mail her, or tell her specifically about something running related because it's something that she's interested in. And I know if I do something well in that arena she'll be happy and that's why I go out of my way. Like she wouldn't ask about it. Like yesterday I ran—I've been running health programs to make myself a little faster and so I ran my full run at a 7.0 which was really fitting for me. And so I e-mailed her to tell her and she was really proud, and it was... I don't know if I was really proud of myself but I needed to tell her. [00:27:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) What's making you sad? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that I would love to say I'm proud for myself like on my own (pause) because what I want is to be just like that. Running yesterday was purely motivated by other people. It was the best run I've ever had. I finished in 7.5 and I ran up three hills in between. It was a great run. I felt great about myself. But it was motivated out of Emma saying that... [00:28:22]</p>

<p>So we all had been talking about what we run at just in the group, and Emma was like I run it at 5.5. I was like no you don't Emma. You run faster than a 5.5. I've run with you before. She's like no on the treadmill I always run at a 5.5. She was like why what do you run at? It was like well when I started running I ran at a six and that's all that I shared because I didn't want to share what I currently run at. And she's like really? And I was like well yeah. I mean that's what I started out at. I don't know. And we talked about running at a one incline and so now she goes to the gym and every day she comes home and tells me yeah I ran at a six the whole time. It was really hard but I kept saying to myself—Chris was sitting next to me. Because they know if Jenny can do it I can definitely run at a six the whole time. And she's like I run at a one incline. I'm like that's way harder. [00:29:30]</p>

<p>And so we went into the bedroom after, and I was like I feel like that's blatantly competitive. I was saying you should just run at what you feel comfortable at like don't run it because I run it. Just run it up to whatever speed you want. But her saying directly to me since you did it I was going to do it. And Chris was like it almost sounded like a dig like if Jenny over here can do then I certainly... And I was like I know. That's how I felt like it was a—I almost felt like I was insulted. And she's way taller than me too so maybe she feels like she should be running faster because I'm much shorter. I just read it as if you could do it then I could definitely do it. [00:30:20]</p>

<p>And so my run yesterday... That was the night before. And then yesterday I was like... Because I had been running in the six/seven I was like I'm over this I'm upping it. That was my motivation because—I don't know. But I felt that was motivated just out of me because I would've just like... Had she not said that before I would just have ran at six/seven and just stayed there and just been fine with it. And I guess in life you just need certain things to push you and that pushed me. And what frustrates me, I guess, is that that's what pushed me and then I needed—even though I felt proud of it—when I felt really proud of it was when I told my mom and she was like oh my God. And I told her that I finished at a 7.5 and she said that was pretty much a sprint at that point. She was like... It was only for the last minute also so it's not that great. But she's like that's at my pace, and I had to even qualify that. Well I finished in the last minute. I wanted to finish running fast; sprinting. And she was like that's so awesome, and I didn't feel awesome about it until she said that's awesome. And I wanted to just... [00:31:42]</p>

<p>When I left that run feeling was like Chris and I were on our treadmills together and we run hills. I'd be like all right hill and we'd go together, and we were just chatting a lot. I left that run feeling great about that like he and I had this great time together the two of us. And that's something to feel good about too I guess. That's when I left feeling proud about and then when I told my mom about it I was really proud—I hadn't even realized it like that was a huge accomplishment. I hadn't ever run that fast for a full 30 minutes and I didn't feel proud of it until she was proud of it. [00:32:23]</p>

<p>(Pause) Then I just want to take moments like that for myself because I don't want to keep... It feels so silly to keep trying... I feel like I'm a little kid running home with their A on a quiz like look what I did. And it's like I feel like at 27 I need to tone that down a little bit. I need to just be proud of things for myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You so much want to win her love.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's really pathetic. (Pause) It feels embarrassing. [00:33:02]</p>

<p>I mean she says outright about my siblings that those are things that she's—I mean those are the things that she wants us to improve on (pause) like our fitness and our weight. She said something last time I was home about John. John was in a crappy mood and I said, "Yeah he didn't eat much at dinner." She said, "Oh yeah, he's on a no carb thing." I was like well that's been pretty debunked like just no carbs. It's like I've heard this but not really. He just should be more focused on a well balanced lower calorie diet. She's like whatever I don't care what it is as long as he's doing something on his weight. I was like okay, note to self. She doesn't care what you do even if it's just no matter just as long as you're trying to lose weight. [00:34:11]</p>

<p>I was like I don't know. He doesn't look... I said he didn't look that big right now. She's like he's 215 right now. It's huge. I guess he wears it well because I couldn't tell. I didn't notice that he was that much bigger. And she's like he's 215. She was just focusing on the number. And another thing like I don't know he looks fine and he run ten miles. I don't know. I guess if his doctor's saying but that's not what she was pointing to. </p>

<p>(Pause) John why would you ever tell mom what you weigh? Don't do that. I would never tell mom how much I weighed. [00:35:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she would be critical? </p>

<p>CLIENT: She would never say it. She would never say it out loud. But yeah, she would definitely judge me. It's like a constant thing like oh Jodie (sp?) looks great during this pregnancy. (inaudible at 00:35:24) on her second baby right now and with her first baby and she gained a lot of weight, but it's a point. I was like oh did you see Jodie (sp?) at the race? Yeah, she looks great with this pregnancy. It's just like oh this is this thing. It seems to be (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you described sort of your life being filled with competition. [00:36:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either you're feeling competitive with other people like your cousin who's already pregnant, or other people feeling competitive with you, or other people trying to pit each other against each other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. (Pause) Yeah, I just need some... I don't know. I think that just comes out of an insecurity. I think anybody who is really competitive it's because they're not secure enough in what's happening with themselves. And so with my cousin being pregnant already that's because I have an insecurity about not or that's something that I want, and she has it, and I don't, and I'm jealous. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>And so these all come out of things that I have insecurities about. And so any place that I'm feeling... I guess like with Emma, when I notice her being really competitive with me it's because that's something that she's insecure about. And so it's just harder when that thing that she's insecure about, is competitive about, is something that I'm already insecure about myself. So in those moments I just don't really... Because my urge is to be like actually I run at a six/seven like that's my urge but I don't say it, but I certainly used to. Today it still comes out wherever I'm feeling insecure I guess. [00:38:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like you were urged to want her to know that you're running faster than her. What's the goal and what are you hoping to communicate to her or to yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Well my goal is that I want to be up here. I want to feel better than her I guess. But keeping it to myself I feel better inside. I guess I just try to suppress that need to (pause) say something to her or to other people. Because the only place it gets is getting the other person's feelings hurt. And I guess that's kind of what Emma did. She was kind of hurting my feelings. I felt like I was being insulted a little bit, and I kind of wanted to like—I don't know—like get a dig back I guess. [00:39:16]</p>

<p>But in that moment I was like okay I'm just going to not acknowledge this for right now and just keep listening to her about her and if she needs to say something about me that's for her. And then if I need to talk about it later I'll just talk about it later to Chris and just vent. Because he'll let me vent and be like I know that gets frustrating and that's just Emma and that's just how she is sometimes. And then I give up, and respond about it, and then I'm fine about it afterwards if I can just like wait a minute and say afterwards just vent about it. [00:40:01] </p>

<p>(Pause) Be like when I found out about my cousin being pregnant I had to text her immediately. I had to text her. I'd be like oh my God congratulations. I'm so happy for you. (inaudible at 00:40:24). And it's like I had this need to do something with that energy. I needed to in some way acknowledge or tell her that I'm happy for her because almost by telling her that I'm happy for her it makes it true. And that's not to say that I'm not happy for her. It's just to say that I'm also envious and I think I can be both. [00:41:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she has something that you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Like a little kid with a toy. (Pause) I didn't feel that way about my cousin Jodie who's a year older than me and she's on her second baby now. She had her first baby before I was even engaged and she was engaged and that, and so it didn't feel like I was on that level yet so it didn't effect me. I was happy for her, and I didn't have these same feelings even though I'm closer to her than I am to this particular cousin. And even this baby that she's pregnant with now I didn't feel that way, and I think maybe it's because of her circumstances in life. I think her husband's a chef. They live in her mom's condo and they just... I guess I just don't feel competitive with her I guess is what it comes down to at the end if I'm being totally honest. [00:42:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I guess they don't have things that I'm envious of like I wouldn't want to be living in my mom's condo. I wouldn't want to be... She works in the mornings and he works in the evening, and they have this lifestyle that I am just not—that doesn't appeal to me and I don't want that. And so I guess it's just not a threat. I mean I say that in a way that it sounds like but I guess that's true. I guess it's just like oh that's good. That's good for you like your life doesn't look anything like I would want my life to look like so it just doesn't really bother me. [00:43:09]</p>

<p>My cousin Judy and her husband are married, they own their condo, he's a teacher, and she's a teacher, and they have this life that looks really nice. They have this golden retriever like they have this whole little picture that's really lovely, and appealing, and is something that really appeals to me. And so I guess they have a lot of things that I guess I want for my life. And so when she... And normally that doesn't really bother me but then she got the one thing in the picture that I see in front of me and so that made me jealous. [00:44:04] </p>

<p>(Pause) They seem to be more comfortable. And I think that what's a lot of people our age struggle with is just being more comfortable with doing things on my own time and my own speed. I just want to be more comfortable in what's going on with me. If I don't want to be as concerned with what other people would think that was good, other people would approve of that, or (pause) just okay with it. I stopped weighing myself because it would just piss me off. It just pissed me off. And I'm just trying to focus on other goals like running longer, and faster, or whatever, and have a goal in life. But I don't know. It just was bothering me so I stopped doing it. My clothes fit fine. The doctor says I'm healthy. I'm good with it. I don't know. I just want to be more focused on things that are okay for me I guess. [00:45:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I wanted to talk—sorry—just logistically in terms of getting covered sometimes employers give you a few options in insurance plans so you definitely want the one that gives you out-of-network benefits. That's for sure. It might help cover things. It'll often be called a PPO plan. If you have an option, you want to avoid an HMO plan. That'll give you fewer options. And the other thing is about flex spending. Do you know about that? [00:46:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-uh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So basically for any medical expense you have an option of just putting aside money that doesn't get taxed. So in other words you have money available. It's like if he's at a 25 percent tax rate you'll have that much more money. So it's put aside before it gets taxed and you can use it for medical expenses so it saves you money. So he should definitely set that up too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, flex spending and PPO.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You know you have to sort of use it or lose it kind of thing but they take it out every month, but then you can then use it for any medical expense including therapy so it saves you a lot of money. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's great. Good to know. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. And I'll look into... Actually I have time to give her a call now. I'm going to leave her a message the person whose name I got. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll see you Monday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. See you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Bye-bye. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye. [00:47:19]</p>

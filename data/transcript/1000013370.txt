<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>

 
<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I must say, I'm going to need your help a little bit in this session because I'm a, I'm feeling a little nervous because, you know, it is toward the end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, the second to last session?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I'm, it's like, I'm not sure what my expectations were but I mean I couldn't have possibly expected to change my whole life. Which is too damn well settled. So in some sense I mean I'm disappointed. I'm not a dramatically different person than when I came here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the same time, you know I'm in a pretty good place. With a lot more perspective I would say. And a lot more of a sense of kind of looking (inaudible at 0:01:09.2) or felt awarenesses of what's going on. So it's like there's nothing, you know, I mean how much, it's kind of hard for me to figure out a way to be productive and meaningful and prepared to bring out (inaudible at 0:01:29.4) so it's having a little bit-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to feel prepared to bring to a close.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. I mean there's vastly more to do in terms of where to go with it in my life. But my past issues, my father just called last night to tell me he was getting, he had to cancel what I had looked forward to. A very sentimental weekend. Him and my mother going up to Ithaca to see my son for a visiting weekend. He just feels too frail. To go. So it's the first time that something like this has happened. [0:02:12.6]</p>

<p>And to outward appearances it seems (inaudible at 0:02:13.8) the whole issue of dealing with my parents' increasing frailty. And you know, Jemma says she thinks I have a lot of anger issues about my parents still to work out. So she senses that. So big issues in my life that, you know, the frailty of my parents and how that's all going to play out with me. The Jemma issues. The Jesse issues. The [Madison] (ph) issues. And the Steve issues. There's a million issues. There's a lifetime's worth of issues out there.</p>

<p>At the same time, everything is in -  It's like what happened in my office in the last week. They decided to just like lay off tons of people. So we had like about half the people to do the exact same amount of work. And it looks from minute to minute like we're going to have a nervous breakdown. The people who are remaining. And yet, you know, like my life, it just keeps going on. Somehow it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have so many things you're facing and here you are on the verge of facing them on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yet, and yet, in a weird way it's like nothing is working optimally. And none of these issues are anywhere close to being solved. Or do I feel like, you know, I have a real good handle on them? And yet in some, some perverse way I keep, as the office keeps going, I keep managing one way or the other to get the work out. My life just keeps kind of rolling along and so it's like -  there's a part of me just says, part of me fears that at some point this is all going to explode into some kind of mini crisis. [0:04:18.5]</p>

<p>And at the same time I guess there's a sense of resilience I have. Having the experience of having come back from very, very acute sense of being terribly depressed last summer when I first started seeing you. And kind of just the experience of rising from the ashes there. And just kind of getting it together and keeping everything in perspective. Has armed me with a certain degree of confidence that I seem to be kind of running between the raindrops. And life seems to be proceeding. So in some ways maybe I've developed some kind of coping skills.</p>

<p>I'm trying -  particularly too I would say in my relationships with women. All day today I was involved with a woman, a professional woman, who in the past would have made me, would have had senses of sexual tension and that feeling deprived from not being able to intentionally turn our relationship into, from a work one into a romantic one. And yet I was able to -  you know, more aware and more careful and restrained and were accepting of the fact that we're going to work together. I just enjoy the pleasure of working with a lovely woman and allowing myself not to get too bent of shape, I guess. Too feeling. Too deprived about not having anything more than that. [0:06:14.1]</p>

<p>So I don't know. I guess as I said when I came in here. I'm kind of looking to you a little bit for some guidance. I don't know quite how to wrap things up. I think in a way it also kind of in some way mirrors what's been going on for me at work. In my work. And that I've got this bizarre situation where I'm not getting paid but I have the desk and the chair and the platform of the organization that I'm working with. And I probably should've wrapped this up. This stage of my life. And terminated it and gone on to something else that would have felt - whether I just went off and wondered around the world on my own or threw myself into some other business -  but I (inadversa) (ph) to terminate.</p>

<p>And with Jemma too. You know not an ideal relationship, but one that's just been comfortable. I guess what I'm feeling is just, I'm kind of in this nice comfort zone and holding things together. And nothing is quite as ideal as it would be. The relationship with Jemma. My work. The relationship my parents and everybody. Just kind of goes along. And I'm surviving it all and not unduly depressed or anxious about it. And trying to figure out is there, if I had to do another 30 week program like this, would I start from the beginning and say my real objective is to just completely blow up my present life. Look for a radical change in my lifestyle. And try to do something very more far reaching. [0:08:16.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you were to do therapy again in the future, if you felt the need, you would imagine making an arrangement for a short term therapy again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I might. I think I might. I think it has, I think it's a good, it's not a bad idea. There's a certain I guess security in knowing that it has a beginning, a middle and then dealing with the end. And maybe kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:08:56.6) There's a lot to talk about here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know I think my sense is that you probably hold a lot of feelings about the things that you've raised. Including a lot of feelings about this ending.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you work to keep kind of muted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think you know we could wonder why you're working to keep it muted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's one thing I'll say. And then the other thing I would wonder is what is this security of, for you of something that has a time limit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's kind of out of my control. And what I'm thinking is that sometimes it's kind of a relief. To have things out of my control. To know to that it's not up to me to make a judgment as to when I've had enough therapy. Or haven't had enough therapy. So. [0:10:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would be bad about you having to make that judgment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm lacking in the sense that, as I said, I think it ties into this feeling of there's -  I feel like when I'm working in therapy that the potential I think, that the possibilities of making dramatic life changes are so kind of, are out there for me. So there's maybe a temptation for me to take rash steps to try to do maybe too much. On the idea that I've got this nice package term, either I'm going to take a preset amount of time and do one of two things. Either smooth out some of the wrinkles in my current life which is essentially what I feel I've accomplished in our time together. I'm much less apoplectic. I'm much less sad, depressed. Less thrown by dealing with women.</p>

<p>So I've kind of smoothed out some wrinkles. And pulled that together. And it's not for me to know now whether I've done as much as I could. There's always a sense that there's more, more, more. That I never have done enough. So the fact that it's not within my control to kind of bring it to an end in some ways is just one less thing I have to worry about. It's I just know that I did as much as I could do. And the 30 weeks came and went. And it just ends. And I have to just then kind of go on, cope and decide, you know, take as much as I can from it and go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if it were open ended, I guess I'm still wondering something about that is very unsettling to you as an idea. [0:12:02.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As much as you don't like I think, I think don't like that this is ending -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In the sense it's like my relationship, I think it would be like my relationship with Jemma, my relationship in my work. It's so damn hard because I have the continuing sense, as in so much of my life, this kind of is the cup half full or is it half empty. Is my work in therapy really doing, am I really reaching for the sky and doing far reaching things? Because I have this opportunity now to have some intelligent, lovely person kind of listen to me and help me struggle through all these things to make these changes. So am I doing, could I be doing better? Could I have a different therapist? I guess  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if it were open ended you'd start to think maybe you should have a different therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Should I have a different therapist, or be in a different mode of therapy. I think I'd just be constantly vacillating. Should I be in five day weeks? I'd want analysis. It would be just a constant turmoil in my mind. And so this is a certain freedom from having to worry about that. I've made a commitment to this particular program, to this particular therapist, to this particular relationship. And I don't have to think hard till the end of the therapy what I'm going to do next.</p>

<p>I mean, and then two weeks or three weeks or four weeks when our program is over, I'll have some thoughts and feelings I'm sure about what do I want to do. Do I want to go back and do another 30 week program? Do I want to go into an indefinite program? I'm not sure. But at least that issue was not on the table. I mean I just knew that I was committed to coming here for 30 weeks working through this program. Working with Julie and getting the most out of it. And that was a relief. [0:14:09.7]</p>

<p>Because as I said, juxtaposed to my feelings about the Jemma relationship, it's kind of okay but not great, but not bad. And I'm scared, just deathly scared of saying, geez if I broke off with Jemma, would I get anybody as good. Could I get somebody even better? Could I be -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you have a short term therapy you don't have work that out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have to work that out. It just, it's just one critical judgment that I don't have to have in my mind. I don't have to think about. About the consequences of continuing doing something that I could be doing more often or less often or with somebody different or in a different mode. And it's just something I don't have to think about. And because I'm not, I guess I'm just a little insecure about the, you know, some big decisions I've made. And managing important relationships. You know, it'll be another relationship to manage. I think that may be it. I don't have to manage the relationship with Julie. It's just - -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's guaranteed to end?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's been predetermined. You know, I'm going to come and the relationship between Aidan and Julie is going -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by manage well?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think if it's as a consumer of professional services, if I were engaging an attorney -  I think I told you that in my divorce litigation I had a female attorney that I kind of fell in love with. And I mismanaged that relationship terribly. In terms of how I related to her and how we handled we handled the custody litigation and all of that. Because of the inappropriate feelings that I had for her that could lead to romance. Which it ultimately did. [0:16:16.3]</p>

<p>And it was just badly managed by me. In the sense that, in therapy, particularly as I raised last time I think, working with a woman therapist, I don't trust myself yet. Well enough to know that I would be good at handling the relationship with you. If it were an open ended, indefinite kind of relationship. In that I might, all of these things that I worry about when I deal with women. Do I overlook their shortcomings because I'm so just pleased to be in the presence of an attractive, bright woman just to have that experience by itself?</p>

<p>So that what's going on in the professional life, if she's a lawyer or a therapist or businessperson, becomes secondary because I'm just pleased to be in that relationship. Or secondly, will I turn hostile toward a woman professional that I'm a consumer of her services as a therapist, an attorney or whatever, because I'm not getting what I want? Some kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was struck at how little faith you have that those things could be discussed and worked through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Possibly. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With the end, of the you know, the result being a greater understanding of what all that is about. [0:18:01.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's possible. I just know I've had a lot of bad judgments in handling those relationships. And it just adds a degree of tension I think that I'm hoping to, that's been kind of I think in some ways good for me again not to have it in front. Not to have to deal with it in some ways. So I think it also, there's also a trust factor too. I know that in these relationships between providers of professional services, lawyers, therapists, all kinds of other doctors, bankers, and consumers, there is an innate conflict of interest. That I see myself as a provider of those services. And I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid you'd be exploited.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'd be afraid I'd be exploited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot that you need to protect, you feel a need to protect yourself from. In relationships.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From you need to, you're very worried about being deprived. You're very worried about being exploited. You're very worried about -  Well those are the two things that you said most strongly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those are the things. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess also worried that the other person won't be able to maintain appropriate limits. [0:20:01.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There's that. I mean you've hit it very well. Because like in the relationship with Jemma for example, we went on this very expensive trip to Peru. I just took her the night that I missed the, that we had the misunderstanding about the session. I'd just come back from Peru. Five days, six days in Peru. Cost me a lot of money. And boy, I laid out the lion's share. She made kind of half hearted attempts to pay. And I kind of was then in the uncomfortable position of not really wanting to take her money but not really feeling that I could spend the money on my own. So I kind of felt a little bit exploited. But then you know it was offset by a real genuine sense that Jemma really is not in this relationship just for whatever dinners I can take her to or vacations I can take her on. That she genuinely cares about me and genuinely appreciates the non tangible aspects of the relationship.</p>

<p>So but it's mixed. There's sometimes I just feel, Jesus is Jemma just, if you know if I weren't as generous with Jemma as I tend to be in terms of picking up the vast, vast lion's share of our expenses, how would our relationship be? I don't know. And it's kind of awkward and difficult for me to talk about that with her. And so it's a feeling that comes up a lot. In my relationships with pretty much everybody. You know, am I being exploited? [0:21:56.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that would make a long term therapy relationship pretty frightening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very frightening. Exactly. And I think it's been as I think about it the reason that it's been very hard for me to have long term therapy in the past because I can never quite know when what the therapist is proposing is as much in the therapist's interests as it is in mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's kind of hard to know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And since it, very much of my life I'm just totally struggling, trying to minimize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And again, you have so little faith that that could be sorted out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't quite figured out the tools. I suspect it could be. But I don't know that I'm really well trained in knowing how to sort that out. I mean I know that these are issues that could be sorted out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't imagine that could be sorted out between you and the therapist. Through conversation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's kind of hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you could talk about your concerns about being exploited. Or you could talk about your feeling that what was being said was motivated by something other than concern for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Could be. I guess it's possible. And maybe it's a big issue for me. Maybe larger than I realized. How to really take care of what's important to me and protecting myself against the fear of exploitation. But doing it in the face of, and what I used before with you as kind of gracious way, a way that's tactful, that doesn't seem to [snibble] (ph) in there, to- [0:24:21.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you'd certainly be tangled up in a knot if you couldn't directly express anger. If you thought something was said not in your interests. You'd be tangled up in a knot if you felt you had to somehow in some indirect way, protest or complain. Because then you would never really find out. It's all tangled up. Or wouldn't be able to openly address it. Out of your concern that you're going to make, I mean well use me as an example. Out of concern that you'll alienate me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or make me, you know, not want to talk to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That that's a real bind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It is. I guess it all goes to show that in some ways I'm happier maybe to not look under the carpet. Not really know what dark truths are under there. And to kind of live, in a little bit of a fantasy land. But it's kind of a lack of the just knowing quite how to do it. In a way that doesn't make, doesn't turn off the other person. The person I'm trying to manage the relationship with. By asking the hard questions in a way that gets them to understand where I'm coming from and be empathetic to me. I just am now recognizing how, what an incredibly valuable skill that would be. (inaudible) [0:26:13.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you can't even, I don't know. It's very hard for you to, it's been very hard for you to openly and directly express dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. I am, you know, because I, and again, it's something else that I said earlier. It comes back to being that a lot of, by kind of maintaining this sort of nice guy posture, this sensibility of somebody who's not being too prickly, too demanding, too antagonistic, or confrontational. In some ways it's allowed, by putting off these confrontations, it's kept me, it's kept a lot of relationships alive with me. That might otherwise have really foundered, that I might have really torpedoed.</p>

<p>I think that's, I mean there's a woman today I was working with who I had been very tempted to just tell off very seriously because I thought she wasn't holding up her own. And I didn't. And she really came through. So I got a lot, I guess to maybe some extent maybe what I'm saying, is that again by luck or maybe just by being known as being this nice, non confrontational guy, I have been able to avoid these kind of major confrontations. So. [0:28:14.8]</p>

<p>So we haven't had a real confrontation. And I don't know whether that's worked in my interest or not. But it would've been interesting in retrospect if we had kind of a serious confrontation and how that would have been played out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how about here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's what I mean. Yeah. If I, what I'm saying here, is if there had been a subject that would have, you know, led to a -  we had a little bit of a confrontation at the end of this session a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes I was thinking of that. I thought that was very highly emotional.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I thought it was quite, it was fairly confrontational.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It could've been more. And you know, so it, I guess the lesson is now, again the fact that we have this predetermined 30 week session may have mitigated a little bit the, I mean where you're kind of forced to continue to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. That might've been the end of therapy if it were an open ended treatment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could've been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could've been. Could've been. Both of us coming to a conclusion that it was just too much of a clash or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both of us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who would've come to that conclusion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe I might've come to the conclusion. Maybe you might've come to the conclusion. You might've come to the conclusion that says you know, you're just too frustrating for me to work with. Because just as you kind of in a way were saying, I just have said as much as I'm prepared to say to keep asking you the same thing and we're not getting anywhere. At the end of that session you might've conceivably have said something similar at the next session. [0:30:12.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like, I'm not sure whether that would be, whether you would welcome that or that would be your worst nightmare.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure either. In a way I think too by shying away from or avoiding these confrontations I've, not only have I avoided directly antagonizing, aggravating, saying something maybe tactless or heedless to somebody else, but then I've been immune from their criticism back to me. So it could have led then to Julie saying to Aidan, "Well you know you're a complete idiot or whatever. I just feel I'm wasting my time. You're wasting your money here. So."</p>

<p>I didn't get that back from you. Not that you necessarily would've said it, but I don't know. But I'll, this style I guess that I've adopted in my life tends to insulate me from the chance that I'm going to face that kind of criticism coming back at me. Because I'm not dishing it out to somebody. So it's rare that it comes back to me in that way. Not that I don't have the occasional bantering and stuff. But I haven't really had a nasty altercation, nasty fight with anybody yet. In -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we had a fight. And you wonder whether the relationship, the treatment would've survived if it wasn't going to end anyway. In your mind that was a treatment ending fight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could've been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could've been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could've been. [0:32:06.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And part of you would want it to be a treatment ending fight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And part of you wouldn't? I can't really tell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure either. What I might've done was, and what I'm always tempted to do in my life, is to say let's have a temporary break. Let's, you know what I should probably be doing at work, and maybe what I should be doing with Jemma, and potentially in therapy, is to say, all right, now we've come to a, you know, kind of a nasty confrontation that's making me feel uncomfortable. And I imagine making you feel uncomfortable. Let's go to our separate worlds for X number of days or weeks or whatever. See how it feels to be out of each other's lives for awhile.</p>

<p>And then consider whether to resume our relationship or not. And I've, you know, I've been looking to kind of do that in work. Do that with Jemma. And obviously the consequence of the end of our sessions will force on me the same experience in a few weeks. I mean voluntarily I'll have what in some way what I think potentially is good for me. You know, how does it feel to be out of therapy? How does it feel to be out of - ? So I can kind of, I think what I'm saying is that in the moment -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think where I get myself into trouble is that maybe I'm not as quick and nimble a responder. So in the heat of the moment, I typically am disappointed. I don't have the right response. The right thing to say to kind of get across my real sense of what I want to say to you about where we are in that moment. [0:34:21.9]</p>

<p>Because it's like, it's such a jumble of feelings that I'm kind of nervous about picking one out of the 25 different feelings. So I rather, my style is more deliberative where they all kind of mix around sometimes. And sort it out and then come back to you and say this is how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's as if you're more raw feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As if what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As if you're more raw feelings. Well I think it must leave you feeling incredibly vulnerable. And that you really could be hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah by saying something that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you're too emotional or let -  it must feel very vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm just honestly, as I think about it, I'm unpracticed. At the art of fighting. And I'm unpracticed at the at, and having not particularly good experiences about having major problems with women in my workplace.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is it like that we did have a fight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of a sort.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:46.3) At least anyway, a session with a lot of tension and a feeling of great conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I summed it up, I think I may have summed it up. And just saying it left me in a lot of different ways. Because there's a part of me that very is loathe to want to fight with a woman. Because there's a lot of me that kind of puts bright, attractive women -  I mean a lot of me puts you kind of on a pedestal. [0:36:20.9]</p>

<p>And doesn't really want to tamper with that. So I'm not, I don't want to be a combative way with a woman that's the, because I just kind of fantasize and idealize about women as being so beautiful and rare and what not. I don't want to fight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the other hand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On the other hand though, there's this sense of since I'm being deprived of what I want from all the women in the world, to have, to cuddle with them and what not. So it's then I'm worried that maybe my emotions will get the better of me and I'll be more antagonistic. As a chance to kind of strike back at not getting what I want. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think there must be some connection between the woman on the pedestal and the wish to cut her down to size. For being so depriving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm sure there is. I'm sure there is. And it's because I'm, and that's why I try to, that's why again, so many mixed, conflicted feelings towards women.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so hard. So it's better to just kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to keep your distance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a certain way keep your distance. Either through a, you know, with a short term therapy or with always the doubts in your mind about whoever it is you're involved with. Not that there aren't, you know -  Yeah. Better something short term. Better something that have one foot out of. Because how frightening to have both feet in? You have to contend with such a mix of love and hate. [0:38:22.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. So I shudder to ask the question and -  no I mean that is what it is. Is there - Anything that occurs to you that I should do with that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really wish that I had something to do, that I could tell you. I think there are feelings that need to be felt and tolerated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think with some understanding of where they come from, and with some working through of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where they come from. You mean like early childhood stuff and the mixed, the kind of the whole mixed feelings towards my parents?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you toss that off a little bit. Like oh, yeah, all that early childhood stuff. But I have, I can't help but think that there's some way in which, I mean the (inaudible at 0:39:33.1) that you've had here with me, are strongly, strongly reminiscent of your feelings with your mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. It's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of the impossibility of pleasing her. Of the idea that the only thing that really matters about you is the extent to which you fulfill her agenda.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not you, yourself. That she doesn't really care about you in yourself. But only cares about reflected glory from you. [0:40:06.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The rage about that. The sense of being used.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the impossible bind. Every child loves his mother. It's a terrible bind. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I have that. I appreciate the way you put that. I have that awareness. I'm just more and more trying to focus on having these awarenesses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And as I said last time, or a couple weeks ago, about now as I sit with you, the awarenesses, I'm hoping that out of that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So just now I said something. You said that you appreciated it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how are you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I kind of liked the way that you nicely summed all that up. And it was helpful. It was nice. Nice way that you tied up some of these loose ends. It was good for me to leave, to have a, to leave here tonight with a, I always like to kind of have a sense after each of our sessions as to what the kind of take home message is. And at the same time, as I said at the very beginning, the vast work of kind of coming to grips with these love/hate relations toward my mother, toward so many of the women that I deal with, is some way so beyond. [0:42:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's overwhelming to think about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So overwhelming and incredibly difficult to think about. How to attack those issues.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I would hope that these things take place in smaller pieces and most people have to go over it and over it and over it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it takes a long time. It can take a long time. And what I would hope, one of my hopes for you would be that this, that this period of therapy, this treatment is a piece of your working out some things. Even though I realize that it's not, you know, by no means a complete solution.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's the other big, to accept that it's a piece. To be gratified that at least that piece is under, is in my understanding. And not to be -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I recognize how, you know, we've talked a lot about how hungry you often feel. And that these pieces can get lost very easily in the vastness of (inaudible at 0:43:47.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. That's the struggle that I always have is to take a certain amount of pleasure in the little bits and pieces that I'm able to glean and not to be too thrown by the lack side of the equation. [0:44:12.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I do think that, I guess I would say that if you do decide to be in therapy again, I would recommend that you consider something open ended. That you've done, you've been very determined in this therapy. I realize that it hasn't always been easy for you to be here. And so I see what you're talking about when you talk about resilience. And I think that you've made good use of your time here. You've been very engaged in what's been going on here. But I realize that that's been hard to see. But -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I would advise you to consider something open ended. So that, because I do think that -  in a way because of some of the things that you said that you fear about it. And that to really address those fears, you need to be in that situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And those fears seem to go really to the heart of things. Because we talked about fears about exploitation and deprivation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. And I guess the fear to ask, you think you have a strong opinion to working with a woman or a man is going to make a big difference or - ?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I thought about that. I don't, I'm not sure about that. My guess is these issues would come up regardless. That's my guess. Because they're at the core of things for you. And they'll come up in different ways with a man or a woman, but in some form or another. [0:46:22.2]</p>

<p>You know these are the things that you have been wrestling with that you've made a certain amount of progress here with. And at the same time to acknowledge the whole picture, still will be dealing with in the future.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I ask something very blunt? Do I come off as misogynistic in anyway? Is that the right word? The expression a man who dislikes women or - ?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you're asking me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's a phrase, which I've heard, it described as some men, as misogynistic or misogynist or something like that. A man who betrays an inner -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Inner hatred or -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would it mean to you for me to say yes or to say no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be, and again, I may not be, it might increase, it might make me aware of something that I'm just not seeing. I don't feel, I've described this kind of love/hate relationship that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think it's a mixture. But I'm hoping that I come out on the neutral side about it at least. If not more. But it makes me nervous in my relationships with women whether I'm appearing to be oblivious of the fact. It was one of those guys who just doesn't get it as they said a few years ago. As the kind of guy who doesn't-[0:48:15.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you my thought about your question especially as we have to stop. Which is I have to think that there's some anxieties that have been touched off by this conversation. And you're feeling worried about my attitude towards you. And you're asking me to reassure you that I maintain, that I continue to have an attitude of care and concern towards you. And that you haven't destroyed that. That's my thought about what you just said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what would make you that worried?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I see that. Except that I can see that you are enough of a nurturing, healing kind of person, that I think that even if you felt, I don't think I've ever doubted that there is overall a sense of desire to be helpful to me. No matter how ugly or venomous a person I might seem. I think your thing in life is to help people in therapy. So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My perspective would be if you have a lot of hateful feelings toward women that that can be looked at and understood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My question is, does that -  are you going to give me any -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to tell you I'm not so concerned about you present yourself vis-�-vis; I don't know how to respond to your question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not an, can you give me some comfort and say that it doesn't seem to a preponderant side of my personality or my style of operating. I don't come across as obviously a woman hating kind of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know how to answer that. Sorry. I really don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I think I accept that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just don't know how to answer that question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we don't have time to talk more about it unfortunately.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. All right. Well thank you very much. Let's see. The next Thursday is the fifth. Yes. Yeah. That's great. Okay. [0:50:45.4] [end of audio]</p>

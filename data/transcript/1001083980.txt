<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Again, no identifiers, so they don't know who I am or who you are.  Um, I saw you, [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your weight had dropped 85 pounds -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At that point.  Um, you were feeling good, your mood was good, your energy was good, you were not exercising, your appetite was fine, you were sleeping well, your self esteem was fine.  You were not suicidal, you're not helpless or hopeless.  Your concentration was better with the Ritalin, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yes, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were on the Ritalin, you're getting pleasure normally and you thought that in the setting of your mood problems, you were in decent remission.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With the combination of 600 of Trazodone and Serzone, 600 of Neurontin, 5 of Ritalin, Ativan as needed and 300 of Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Correct?  Okay.  These three and a half months, how've you been?  What is happening?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yknow, I, I was doing very well with the mood and, but I was also doing well as far as [INAUDIBLE], yknow, getting up and walking around.  The weight loss was helping me with mobility and so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you doing rehab?  You're, uh -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yeah, yeah -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Specific exercises.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> PT and such.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see.  Up until when?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Up until, let's see, when did this happen.  In, uh, I think it all came up in February.  Pretty soon, after, yeah, that's right.  All of a sudden, my left hip started bleeding severely and I went to the hosp, I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he did a [INAUDIBLE] surgery -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].  And ever since then, we've been trying to get that wound to heal, which it will not heal.  And he started to think, he told me two weeks ago, that it can't because it's caused by a broken bone inside that's trying to poke out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, more than one broken bone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, it's an exposed wound now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And, they, he wanted me to get orthopedic surgery.  I went to see an orthopedist and she told me she agrees and she thinks I should have the surgery.  It's a very big surgery, she called it, on [INAUDIBLE] to put splints around those spots to try and keep those bones back together, and plates around them to push them back together.  I had that kind of surgery before oddly enough because I, I, that was my [INAUDIBLE], and uh, that my, my right forearm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mean wrap it, wrap it up and hope that the immobilization allows healing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did that make it better?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that works pretty well with my arm, but I think, I don't know.  Um, between the [INAUDIBLE].  Um, it's, she told me that my chances of having a successful operation were seventy five on the good side and twenty five on the not good side, which is not great odds.  And -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it depends if you're depressed about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Seventy five is not terrible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not terrible odds, but, yknow, I, I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How bad has it been?   Yknow, bad, how bad it's been.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's where, I didn't actually [INAUDIBLE] because I was too afraid, but I know this kind of thing can result in amputation, you know, of the foot, and I'm so terrified of that.  I don't think that they'll do that surgery just right away, yknow.  I'd get another chance to try to heal it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so, let me just, um, summarize.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've had severe medical problems.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Over these few months.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your mood been like in general?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It has not been horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, despite these problems, your head's been above water. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That means most of the time, you're not sad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Scared is a different thing.  But yeah, not sad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not sad and you're anxious about your medical condition.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Appropriately.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you stay anxious all day, every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I can get my mind on something else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've been able to break through the cycle?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, you're not obsessional about the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Medical problems.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I can think about politics or music or something for a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, uh, I, if we have time, I'll ask you what your thoughts are about politics.  Are you irritable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's history.  You don't want to do that - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you irritable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yes, I have episodes of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When do you get like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, oh, like I went to a lecture this morning and there was ladies around me chattering and talking and I couldn't hear so that made me, yknow, I think people would generally irritated by that sort of thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you say something to them or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  I didn't.  And then I thought, I might want to [INAUDIBLE] so I, but it was, yknow, making me -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is your fuse shorter than it has been in the past, or it's about the way it was?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, it's, I, it's [INAUDIBLE] calm about that kind of stuff.  I think it's shortened a little bit.  It's not terrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not anxiety? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, it's, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just intolerance.  Regular old intolerance.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, yes, mild ticked off.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  You getting along okay with your sister?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yes, we're friends.  We've both been a little low and, so, we keep asking each other are you all right?  Are you all right?  You okay?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is she sad much of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yes.  She seems that way to me.  She hasn't said it outright.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She can give me a call if she wants - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, how's your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's been a little bit too good - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You gaining or losing weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I gained some.  But, I'm going back to the, uh, uh, lap band doctor next week to - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sleeping okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yeah, I'm sleeping pretty well.  I, I  have [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, that means what? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That means -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You wake up in the middle, and you stay up, or do you wake up and get back to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't go to sleep.  Maybe about [INAUDIBLE].  Once I go to sleep, I'm good until the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so it's early insomnia.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, um, how many nights of the week is that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three, maybe [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  So half the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, three to four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And could it be hours that you can't get to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, I mean I go to bed at eleven.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What time do you take the Ritalin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take it in the morning, at, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> First thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> First thing, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Wellbutrin also?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, Wellbutrin at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why do you take the Wellbutrin at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's how I was instructed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's probably why you're uh -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, no, of course not.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wellbutrin is a medicine for the morning.  In fact, when you look at the chemical structure of Wellbutrin, it looks just like speed.  It looks just like amphetamine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It gives you energy.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, my gosh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In fact, I'm surprised that it's not every night that you can't get to sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll switch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  And something like Serzone is sedating, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's keep an eye on your, someone checks your liver function every now and then.  You go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They do routine blood.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I probably do, somebody - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, Serzone had that problem with liver.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which is why no one uses it anymore, but the risk of the liver toxin problem is so remote like one in hundreds of thousands.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's really not, do you buy lottery tickets?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  Matter of fact, uh, it's something like that, huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's like winning the lottery.  But, uh, so Serzone got a bad rap, but for a patient like you, it's actually a very nice medicine.  It's good antianxiety, it helps you sleep and it's good for you.  Um, do you think the Neurontin is helping your pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'm really convinced of that because the neuropathy pain, if I miss a couple of doses of Neurontin, I start to feel it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You take only 600?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I might even be down to 400.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The weight loss helps with the neuropathy thing, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I've been able to actually cut it down.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your self esteem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, weak, um, yknow -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fair.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have weak moments.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, fair.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you're no good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel like I've made so many mistakes in my life that the only thing that's constant is -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] your space.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, things to do with weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need water or something?  Are you okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  You know, water would help, I think, I've got a, I don't smoke or anything, but I have that cough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here you go.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were telling me about your self esteem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  The worst part of it is that they have told me to stay off my feet.  You know, I had gotten it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which, right, yeah.  And by getting on to your feet, you're starting, you're entering reality again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I really was, I had a lot of optimism and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When did they tell you to stay off your feet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, after -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In February, or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> After in, mainly three weeks ago.  After February, they were letting me, yknow, assuming I was gonna heal and letting me walk a little bit, but after the last two doctors, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said my foot is so soft and brittle, fragile right now that I really should not walk.  So, I'm in, in a wheelchair all the time, including in the apartment, you're trying to cook with, yknow, from a wheelchair.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's trying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's really kind of awful.  And that gets me down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> However, you're a very adaptable person.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I try.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, yknow, it's not good, but this is what you're stuck with, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, yeah.  And I've been in a wheelchair to go outside for years, so, maybe, it's not that, it's trying to do it, you know, inside.  It's, I never, I haven't really ever had this before, but I can't stand up to, yknow, food shop or - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, when do they think, uh, you'll be able to stand up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, they haven't really given me an estimate because that's the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not so horrible with the weather being bad, but now that the weather's starting to change -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I, uh, wanna, I wanna -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We want you out there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We want you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I do want to.  I mean, I've gone to some movies lately, I want to go to museums and that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were saying you made mistakes.  What do you mean mistakes?  What kind of mistakes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, health mistakes.  Diabetes.  Letting my diabetes get out of hand, like that.  That's the main thing that makes me feel a little bit like, oh, it's my fault.  And it's not exactly my fault.  I have a big genetic predisposition to diabetes but, on the other hand, I did not do a lot of things I could have - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, if you had the weight surgery earlier -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did intend it but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If they [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It helped me a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It would've made a big difference.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because your sugars would've been far easier to control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  I would've been, yknow, I think I'm among, yknow, I mean, the first five years since I've gotten it, as soon as I found out about it and I would have earlier, it's [INAUDIBLE].  I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's all right, I'll -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope it's not a bill collector.  Oh, no, I'm not any good with these things.  Ah, there.  Hello?  [NAME OTHER], hi.  Oh, [NAME OTHER], hi.  I'm yeah, I'm with a doc, I'm actually in a doctor's appointment right now, but can I call you back?  Are you at work?  The usual stat?  Okay .  I'll call you back later if you're free later.  Okay, thanks.  Um-hum.  Bye.  Unexpected old friend.  That's not terrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, all right.  So, uh, and you said you feel a little guilty about -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About my terrible consequences.  I've got all kinds of diabetes side effects and I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you ruminate?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you ruminate over these things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there a way you found you can break the rumination and the obsession?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, just to try to keep it from getting started, yknow.  Once it gets started, it can get a grip on me.  [INAUDIBLE].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever used cognitive techniques for, uh, yknow, people with obsessive compulsive disorder get similar types of, um, they get into these loops that they can't break.  For example, I have a contamination fear, I touch the knob, I feel like I've got some kind of germs in there, I go and wash my hands.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And yet, that -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you can still feel -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I can still feel it, so I wash again and you wash fifty times.  And there are very, um, specific techniques for recognizing that you're in the loop and then breaking out of the loop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that'd be a good thing to know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever had any psychotherapy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been to like a therapist.  A top therapy lady, but she never suggested this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's a book, you are a bit obsessional, aren't you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm a little, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You get stuck.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I can.  I can get very stuck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it wastes a lot of time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's a book I read -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes.  It's not so bad lately, but sometimes, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's nice to just have the techniques anyway.  The book's called Brain Lock.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay, great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll write it down for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll order it from Amazon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's by Schwartz.  And patients just seem to do well with it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You won't see yourself exactly because it's mostly about OCD.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if you just think of what they talk about in that book -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About as obsessions and ways to break out of obsessions it would probably help you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To function a little better.  Um, do you have any suicidal thinking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven't had that.  I want to survive all of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, seventy five to twenty five.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, some hopelessness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yeah.  About, about, yknow, at this point, I might just [INAUDIBLE] completely with my foot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you easily distracted?  Able to read?  Able to concentrate?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had some trouble with that.  I've had a lot of trouble with reading, partly, partly [INAUDIBLE], but, partly distraction.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A bit ADD, it's, you know - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I think I have got that tend, amazing that I was a [DEIDENTIFIED] for my whole career with ADD, but I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.  It's, uh, I'm pretty sure you do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's not a disease.  It's just, it's a different way of thinking and it's, uh, often people with it are quite creative.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  I have trouble concentrating when I'm with other people.  Getting myself to listen to what they say instead of getting off [INAUDIBLE] or something, I find my head is full of my obsessions.  George Bush is it, by the way.  If it makes any difference what you're obsessing about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You think about him a lot?  You think about him a lot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Too bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I know.  It's a rough - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's kind of a waste of time, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing obsessing about him is gonna do.  Um, the Ritalin, both the Ritalin and the Wellbutrin should help the focus.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think they do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Ritalin might help.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Ritalin definitely helps.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I need to sit down and do a task.  I know the difference between trying to do it with and without Ritalin, with is much better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, uh, the Wellbutrin, you might not be aware of because you take it at night. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Once you take it in the morning, you'll probably find that the ADD, this distraction, is much better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that would be great, yknow, I need this Brain Lock book to get me off of George Bush sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, so that's your obsession.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yeah.  That's it.  I casually call it an obsession, all the time. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why do you think about him so much?  What are your thoughts?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, because I believe in habeas corpus and I'm afraid we've lost all our civil liberties and won't get them back and that we're gonna go to war with Iran and, you know, same thing as a lot of other people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, as you say, that's not something I can do anything about.  Um, so just thinking about it all day long is not constructive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, it's not.  I guess you could write letters and support, yknow, your causes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I don't actually do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just waste your time thinking - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I do read books and listen to talk radio which is, yknow, that's very heavy for me.  Uh, uh, I listen to, sometimes just normal NPR, but there's the left wing ranters like Air America and I get real wrapped up with them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who do you like?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, oh, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Do you listen to any of the right wingers?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Never, I, that would be dangerous. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, make you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes I have -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It would agitate you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On my shows, yeah.  Just to agitate me.  It works, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, um, I think I'm okay with Wellbutrin for a while.  But I actually have Ritalin -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You take 300 XL, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, uh, and you have enough Serzone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I do.  I have [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have enough Neurontin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you using any Ativan?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, yeah, I have lately a few times.  I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have enough of it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I, uh, could use some more.  I'm winding down.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think I've gotten a new, [NAME OTHER] must have some.  I get, yknow -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's she need?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lorazepam.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I'll just write you a big dose, then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She knows the dose she's on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  And I don't use it very much at all.  She doesn't use it very much either.  She's just out - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Ritalin, uh, you're on the 5s.  How many of the 5s do you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, um, one in the morning and occasionally one at noon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about we say 5 a day just so we get it all on there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, that would make me very - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> These are a hassle to refill.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, great, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Ativan, I'll write you the 0.5, is that the dose you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And also I'll also write, uh, 5 a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yay.  It's not, you know, this kind of drug it's not a dependency problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, not at all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I think I might consistently want to do, yknow, seven a.m. and eleven a.m.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, in fact, um, when they let you be more active -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll increase the Ritalin because it's a terrific medicine for getting you moving.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And doing whatever rehab you need.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, right now, my problem is trying to not move and that's a bad agenda.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, all right, well, the good news is, despite what's going on in your medical life, you're doing pretty well.  Above all -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you know, I, I actually agree.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just have a problem with a lot of things, I mean, everybody ends up with problems sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see, though, you've had such a rough couple of years, you deserve some luck.  I wish I could write a prescription for some luck.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that would be, I really am due.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know you are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For some luck, I really, seriously am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I hope things go the right way.  Yknow, I mean, if things go well, within a month or so, they'll have you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Working on getting - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Working on getting back up and out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, once they can do something to protect those fragile bones -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In the meantime, um, they're in danger all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  All right, take care.  Call me if there's any problem at all, all right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you again for the case. Particularly when I'm coming in here, I tend to use that one because I find I knock it around a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things were getting knocked around and I want to be a little safer, but at home and stuff sometimes (inaudible at 00:16.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no problem. I'm glad that I could help. (pause) Oh gosh. This weekend is quite literally the best and worst weekend I've had in 10 years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just sounds weird, I know. I had to go home for a funeral for somebody that we know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although the coroner has not said this, we know that she killed herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They got an undetermined cause so that she could get buried properly. Many, many, many people from my classmates were there. Most of the people of the fraternity I was involved with. (pause)</p>

<p>[01:10.1]</p>

<p>It was fantastic to see everybody, and we did throw her a really really amazing wake. I was not the person, by the way—- there was somebody who ended up passed out in the bottom of a drained pool that did not belong to anybody we know. So it's like to that level of—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I am first of all convinced that I am not 22 anymore. But at the same time, I am disturbed how much my friends, although they seem like they don't do that that much, that they were able to recover so darn fast. However, you know—- I went down with a couple of friends. One, I just found out someone I knew really really well back in undergrad actually lives in the Square.</p>

<p>[02:03.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we've sort of—- Jerry and I are definitely going to get together, and I'm going to meet his wife and kid and that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That was really hard for him because the girl that passed away, she was his first serious girlfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In fact, this was the funeral of the ex-boyfriends too. There were lots of them there, because she dated a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hers?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, hers, yeah. All of hers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to yours, I meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no actually I ran into a couple of them but not in Brooklyn. And then my friend who's near us came, and I'd forgotten completely that she was both the best and the worst influence on me in the world. We were nicknamed Sid and Nancy at one point. (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of—- it's really kind of really screwed up. (laughter) Because what happens is if you get the two of us together, sometimes we will do things that we think are absolutely freaking hilarious, but sort of border on—- like you'd have to be somewhat schizophrenic to actually think it's funny. Yeah. So, not really, but a little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>[03:12.3]</p>

<p>I was shocked to find that, like I said, people to me—- I immediately picked up the rhythm of it, but I just didn't expect people were really looking to party that strongly. Like she came to the wake with booze in her purse. That seems a little bit wild to me. And then she's like "Well, I'm not actually planning to drink it. I doing this because I know that she would have approved." I'm like "What?" She's like "But she would've loved that concept, even if nobody drank it." So it was very intense. I can't believe that my liver is actually still alive. I'm not a binge drinker normally, but it just sort of happened. The bad news is that everything revolving around actually putting her to rest was horrifyingly bad. Yeah.</p>

<p>[04:04.1]</p>

<p>And pretty much all of us have been pretty emotionally wrecked by it, especially at the funeral, the fact that they couldn't get her husband to let go of the coffin to take it out of the church. Yeah. That was pretty bad. (pause) So now it was very good to get it all out, but like I said it was very very upsetting to see. The good news is that, not that I actually would ever—- like I said, even at my lowest point I never really felt I could kill myself because I think it's a terribly cruel thing to do family. I know now absolutely that it's a terribly cruel thing to do to family. I think that Mike was actually even more so affected although he didn't know her as well as I did, him being sort of tertiary to this. </p>

<p>[05:06.7]</p>

<p>I mean, he was part of the social group but the reason why he was in the social group was because he was dating me, because I was a member of this fraternity and Mike was not. He was given bids but he didn't. So they actually call him their brother-in-law which is really sweet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But he was really torn apart by this because of seeing how devastating the whole thing is. So that was—- oh gosh, yeah. That was a lot. It was a really lot. (pause) There's—- I don't even know how to explain it all. Like I said, it's very complicated, the whole thing too, because it's not only just losing her because I hadn't seen her in a long time actually, though I've kept up with her husband a little bit more.</p>

<p>[06:08.6]</p>

<p>It's also like—- all of us talked about why this is so complicated. One, there's that part. And then two, there's that part of the empathy of "Oh my God, if this happened to me I have no idea what I'd do." And it's taking care of [inaudible] that's going to be really really hard to do. (pause) It's just a lot. </p>

<p>Like I said, it's very complicated. The grief is really complicated because it isn't just her loss, it's the re-thinking of a lot of things, you know? Re-thinking of like what—- (pause) If you were in the situation in either direction, how would you feel about certain things and what you would want and all that. You know what I mean? Like a lot of stuff like that. (pause)</p>

<p>[07:15.9]</p>

<p>You know, there just—- (pause) Like I said, I have a lot of guilt about not getting in touch with her. Not because I think it would've changed the outcome. I don't believe that. I do wish I still did though, just to have the experience. (pause) You know, that kind of stuff. A lot of regrets, but a lot of really good times. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is he doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Terribly. I mean, I still have—- I should probably explain to you. His real name isn't actually Ace. He is—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It's because he's a pilot]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's now a commander.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>[08:10.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's a highly-decorated war veteran and (inaudible). He was called Ace because of Top Gun and because he taught at Top Gun and like all that stuff, yeah. So we call him Ace. That and there's too many Richards in the world to remember the names of. </p>

<p>But he's in terrible terrible shape. I mean, when we saw him he hadn't eaten. So the worst part was on Saturday night—- the funeral was on Sunday—- and on Saturday night at approximately 4:00 a.m. after we've already closed the bar and had some extremely bad hi-jinks, one of the other females that had been involved in this—- Ruby (sp?)—- said "You know what? We need to sit down right now, and we're going to set up a rotation schedule of who is going to get into contact with him when." I'm like "This is a really bad time to be doing this." And she's like "No, no, no. I'm calling a meeting." And I'm like (noise). But we are going to set something up.</p>

<p>[09:07.5]</p>

<p>I just feel like a lot of us—- I care very much for Ruby (sp?) and Buzz. Yes, he's a surgeon. Again, another Richard, so we named him Buzz. I care very much for them. I do realize that half the people know what happened. In fact, her parents don't know what happened. So I really felt like the discussion of what actually happened is not what we should discuss right now, you know what I mean? It's not for public consumption. </p>

<p>She is a nurse. He is a surgeon and based upon the (inaudible at 09:51.2) death, she's like "Yeah, this doesn't look right." I'm like "Yeah, this is not the time for us to discuss that it doesn't look right." She's like "Nobody accidentally dies with that much albuterol in their system." I'm like "Yes, I know, but again this is what you have happen when you have way too much to drink and you're not used to this kind of thing." So we have a lot of—-</p>

<p>[10:08.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what did happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know the exact details. I do know that she overdosed on tremendous—- she also was a nurse, so she also knew enough about it. She overdosed on enough albuterol to stop her lungs and she knew that would be a very quick, painless death. Only someone who worked in the medical field, who worked in the field of trauma, would have access to—- I mean, although she had—- like my inhaler won't have enough albuterol in it. It's absolutely 100 percent true. And you couldn't inhale enough to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's—- yeah. And the thing is, it's devastating because I don't think that anybody knew that she was that depressed. In fact, to be honest, I didn't know she was that depressed. Mike was shocked to find out that she liked him. (laughter) Not liked him like a boyfriend.</p>

<p>[11:06.4]</p>

<p>He thought—- she was one of those people that in certain times when she was feeling defensive about things, she became very withdrawn because she felt really overwhelmed. She was from the University, all the time with all these scientists and although she dated just about everybody in the house, all of us saw her as a peer. I mean, we saw her doing organic chemistry. </p>

<p>Maybe it's not exactly the same thing, but we saw her as a person who saw what her talent was and she was applying it. She saw it as—- I don't think she kept coming back for it and dated a lot of people—- "I'm not as good." And from what I understand from people who were much closer to her, that is probably part of the outcome of what happened, that she's never felt like she was that good. I think that was terrible. </p>

<p>She's one of many of us who suffered from infertility, but she never knew because—- and this is one thing we did decide to talk about—- is the fact that nobody wants to talk about it. And so the fact is that she probably never knew that a good one-third of us can't have kids. Probably between a quarter and third of us. You know, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>[12:21.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have no idea. In fact, once we went and compared notes, we're starting to really wonder if there was asbestos in a certain area or what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're really confused by most of this. We actually sat down and put down the statistics of every single thing about the weekend. Everything from how many people to how many degrees to how many calories consumed, like how much alcohol. We had this huge by-the-numbers thing that we ran up, trying to figure—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you guys were scientists.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah we are. Like how many BTUs if lit on fire this alcohol was. Yeah, we were scientists. That kind of thing. And just to make it that much worse, we have all evolved to the point where we have access to the ability to make ourselves extremely sick if we want to.</p>

<p>[13:19.8]</p>

<p>I mean, I would never think it's acceptable to show up at a party with IV bags of saline and things like that for afterwards, so that you—- I mean, knowing that you could be that sick, so that you could look okay for—- that to me just doesn't—- And from what I understand, this is not standard operating procedure, but they thought this through. </p>

<p>They're like "I'm going to have this amazing bender and chances are I'm going to be sick to death, so I'm going to come in and I'm going to make sure I have enough this, this and this for everybody who needs it to get saline." That's really kind of screwed up. (laughter) You know, it's like now that all of us have different things that we have access to, it's really not so good. We did, you know—- yeah. I cannot believe that we did not raze the town. </p>

<p>[14:13.0]</p>

<p>There's this tiny little town in west of where she grew up --we didn't burn down the town or get thrown out of the town with the kind of the crap that we did. But apparently—- and the thing is, her parents were thrilled. They didn't know about everything, but they thought it was the greatest thing ever, and I thought that was kind of weird because my parents would not approve if this happened to me. I mean, they would be okay with a wake. They would not be okay with a bunch of people setting potassium metal on fire in a pyre for her and stuff. Not like a real pyre, but like a symbolic thing. Like they would never be okay with it. They would never be okay with more than 100 bottles of alcohol. They would never be okay with that. But her parents were really just tickled by this concept, which is kind of weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [They must be in a state as well].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think they were just pleased to know that there is somebody that felt that, because we came in from all over the place to do this. They are just completely devastated. </p>

<p>[15:17.0]</p>

<p>Her father is terminally ill already, so the reason they were able to do funeral plans—- the funeral plans themselves were a lot more flexible because they had actually already pre-paid for his funeral. So the biggest thing was getting the body back. So this is like—- yeah.</p>

<p>So like her dad has maybe got a few months to live. So this was just not—- and almost all of us have gotten married, but either we have a whole bunch of kids or no kids at all. We decided to all be kind of somewhat—- like I said, we agreed to be a little bit more candid about that kind of stuff because it's not something you usually talk about. People don't talk about it.</p>

<p>[16:15.5]</p>

<p>When we realized at least that this could be a contributing factor to her feeling so down and so alone, we decided that we are going to talk about it with each other, which was good. That kind of thing. For being a bunch of scientists, in many ways we're also more in touch with our emotions than most. (pause)</p>

<p>It was impressive to see some of the things that people wrote and did. People did some movies, did some things just in general as tributes so the family would have something. (pause) Beyond what I really—- I mean, although it's a bunch of guys, I knew they were all sentimental but I didn't think they were this sentimental. It's a lot to parse through.</p>

<p>[17:16.5]</p>

<p>The biggest thing that we sort of walked away from this with is that almost all of us have not been keeping in touch, and we need to do it more often. And so we need to—- especially the few people that I did tell, I became myself again. Maybe a little bit too much myself, maybe almost like I was trying to catch up on 10 years of back personality again because I don't talk through literally—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must have been a pretty nice thing.</p>

<p>CILENT: Yeah, I think I may have scared some people though with being too enthusiastic about talking to people. But I did explain to a couple of people, like Jerry, who was like "How in the world have I not run into you?" I'm like "Well, I go to work and I haven't been out for recreational purposes except three times in the past two years." He's like "You're kidding," and I'm like "No."</p>

<p>[18:13.4]</p>

<p>I think that that really shocked people to see me do that. So I think that just being honest about not really having it, really being able to do the things that I want to do—- I have to be sort of careful about this because these people still see Mike as, like I said, a brother-in-law. I do not want to share too much because they are way too protective of me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you don't want to share things about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Things about—- I mean, I can talk about him being depressed or that his parents are assholes, but if I talk about his addiction, they would totally turn on him. I've seen this happen where it's like something bad happens and they will totally turn on it. They feel like they're protecting their people. This is their little sister.</p>

<p>[19:11.5]</p>

<p>Although it's not always wanted, it's always there. But it is really great, it was terrible, it was overwhelming, especially because I had—- literally the funeral was at 3:00 p.m., it's a 12-hour drive, I had to be at work at 9:00 a.m. the next day. I mean, I made it off 90 at the turnpike around here at about 6:45 to go to work at 9:00. That was extremely intense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday, yeah. (pause) I couldn't make it through the whole day. It was more because of the fact that I've had this sort of quasi-infection for a couple of weeks now, and I've been doing this thing where I'll do some antibiotics maybe now, and I just started that. </p>

<p>[20:13.1]</p>

<p>If I let myself, I'll get really sick. I'm really not that sick, but I feel like if I go out and aggravate it, it gets worse. And trust me, staying up all night to drive, that car was definitely aggravating it. Even in shifts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It doesn't sound like you were especially kind to your body over this weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to talk to my friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't seen them in forever. (pause) There were some concerns about everyone seeing what happened to me in terms of my physical body, but I was pretty good about handling it. Because some of them don't have the most tact in the world, but what they were trying to say was "Oh my God, you used to be so beautiful. What happened to you?" That's really what friends say, like a nice version of, as opposed to—- which is still kind of insulting a little bit. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[21:16.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. I mean, it sounds like it's well-meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You've doubled your weight. You look very different." You know what I mean? Everything I have. "I am concerned. You look completely different." That kind of thing. It is what it is. But I felt like at no point because of—- I have always felt like in certain ways, because of the way I look, sometimes that I am not welcome in certain social circles, and I never felt that way. They definitely weren't that shallow at all, which is good. (pause) </p>

<p>[22:13.0]</p>

<p>I also really felt like I had a lot of anxiety going in there, having to answer questions about what I've been up to lately. Luckily most everybody, as soon as they figured out that I've been very sick, didn't really turn on the pressure of "Okay, so why haven't you done anything with your life because we all have." They were very very kind about everything, you know? It was really reassuring too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (pause) Sounds like a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean it's a school where what you make of yourself is really what counts. (pause) They didn't make me feel bad about that, you know? (pause) Which is good.</p>

<p>[23:19.2]</p>

<p>The description of—- (chuckles) and they're not very good at finding anything original to say about anybody. So the whole thing of "This is Debra. Back in the day she was Richard in a dress." I'm like "Thanks." I mean, it's very flattering, I think. (chuckles) (pause) I'm really glad I went though. I'm really glad. I don't think I could handle that kind of lifestyle for long. I mean, the thing is, it was also an emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure. It sounds like it was intense.</p>

<p>[24:11.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really intense. It was intense in every aspect. We all stayed in the same hotel. We all did this, we all did that. (pause) I was a little bit worried and surprised about how easily I could be led into impulsivity in terms of things that may or may not be a good idea. Not that much. One would think that at my age I would say no. (chuckles) But that's okay, I guess. As long as it doesn't happen again, it's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I can't believe I'm actually owning up to this. Okay, so we really wanted to play beer pong, but we had no pong table because this was not our house. So we found a nearby reunion at the same hotel and stole one of the tables.</p>

<p>[25:17.8]</p>

<p>That is not the kind of the thing that I would normally do on a regular basis. (laughter) We put it back. The funny thing is, I didn't even play beer pong. I don't like beer. The point is like "Hey Debra, come here. I need you to distract these people while I steal this table." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Nobody has said anything like that to you in a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. (chuckles) (pause) No one said anything like that to me in a really long time. (pause) If I were able to write down all of the crap that we got ourselves into, it would not sound real. However, there's unfortunately videotape and picture evidence of such.</p>

<p>[26:20.6]</p>

<p>So, it's true, yeah. And like I said, at least I did not end up being passed out at the bottom of an empty pool. (laughter) Which I have no idea how that happened. But I had a really great time. I don't want to do it next weekend. I don't even want to do it the rest of this year. But it was really good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One aspect that sounded to me like it mattered a lot was really feeling part of something in a community like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that it sounds like—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really felt like—- the thing is that I could be myself. We spent a lot of time telling old stories, and I'm not entirely certain if I could feel that way—- I mean, even if I got a group of friends again together, I don't think I'll have that kind of relationship. It's a very different one. (pause)</p>

<p>[27:23.5]</p>

<p>It was really good. I really felt like—- and like I said, I had a lot of anxiety going to this, you know. I don't look the way I used to. I'm not as smart as I used to be. I haven't really done that much with my life. And they all treated me like I was still Richard in a dress. So, you know, it was nice being deferred to. It was nice being treated like a lady in all situations. (pause) It was nice to be wanted, you know? </p>

<p>I was afraid, and I still have a little bit of fear that perhaps I overdid it because I was happy about being wanted but being a little too aggressive in terms of being too gracious, being too this, being too that. But I think everyone gets it that I have been sort of bottled up for a long time and I was just like "Oh my God, human contact, so I'm going to talk a lot."</p>

<p>[28:21.8]</p>

<p>And I don't talk that much in my job or my life. I mean, I do but not like that much. (pause) There was a tiny bit of drama about somebody's second wife who decided that she detests me, but I'm not going to let that really bother me that much. (pause) That's where I got the pause about whether or not you should—- she said "You need to think really long and hard about how you present yourself to the world because you look like a hot mess." I was told this at like 3:00 a.m. I was like "Okay, thanks for the tip." But it's very easy to be very—- and maybe I'm justifying this, but I was being myself and I was being silly. I mean, everybody kind of insulted each other and you took your licks and that's how it was.</p>

<p>[29:24.7]</p>

<p>So like—- okay, I should probably explain how this happened. So her husband was talking about how they have these trees that transmit—- he said something like "Where I am, there's these trees that transmit cell phone signals." I'm like "Yeah, in the rest of the world, we call those repeaters." And that's apparently—- the fact that we were being like that to her husband I think got her very pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. But that's just sort of the way you joke around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "The rest of the world calls those repeaters," yeah. Or just other things like that. The thing is she was very sensitive about that, but that's—- this is the conversation that we had, and you take it as much as you give it to all this stuff. So she's the second wife of somebody that we also still know, and she felt like she was really concerned about the way people treated her husband.</p>

<p>[30:24.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like she sort of didn't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the best part is she's like "Yeah, I'm from the [inaudible] Office " and this and that. She's like "I've probably already read your file." I'm like "Thanks. That was just a conversation killer." Like I'm sure you haven't, but she was really trying to establish herself as like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the Auditor General?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're actually someone who audits government organizations, so that's kind of bullshit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she was very much trying to—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She was working pretty hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- establish her position in the community. The thing is, she doesn't have to. She's family now. [The first-place family too], but she's family now. That's just what it is, but she has to be able to accept that—- she's not in second place. It's just another part of the whole system, you know?</p>

<p>[31:27.1]</p>

<p>And that's the way it's been with a couple of people that have had more non-traditional families. You just have to be that way. We've joked around about who got who in the divorce or whatever. You can't do that. That's just not the way it works with us. That was a little bit worrisome. </p>

<p>But that was possibly the only bit of drama, and I'm really kind of proud of myself that I didn't get as upset as I could have about it. I did. I mean, I've been thinking long and hard that I may have been more annoying than I should have been. Like I could've probably been a little bit more polite and kind about things, but that's just not the way it is. This is a fraternity house, you know? There's not a whole lot of polite and kind here. This is the school that Real Genius was based upon. So there's going to be some real screwed up things.</p>

<p>[32:27.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, these are your college friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we're college friends. But I'm hoping to get that worked out, but we'll see. But aside from that, I really feel like I walked away from this feeling a lot more loved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fantastic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one of the better ways to feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did feel a lot of despair because I feel for my friend, and I felt really sad that I didn't know her as well as I thought I did. I wish I'd known more that she was hurting inside. Not because I could've done anything to change it, but I think that it would've changed a lot of how I would've made decisions, you know? I would've made it a point, like when Ace was out on carriers, going out to visit her. Something like that.</p>

<p>[33:29.1]</p>

<p>But I can't have too many regrets. They're just pinges, nothing like "Oh my God, if only I'd done this, this wouldn't have—-" but I don't feel like that. I don't have that kind of power in her life. And when all is said and done, really nobody does. (pause) </p>

<p>But I guess in certain ways I feel like, walking away from this, I want to make sure that if there are people in my life that feel—- like I'm trying to at least notice if I am making people in my life feel that they are stupid or—- and I don't think it was really me—- but trying to make sure that I don't feel like making someone feel excluded. It is really important to me because I really, until two weeks ago, had no idea. I'm a big believer, even though I'm a scientist, there are all kinds of nerds. There are Shakespeare nerds and there are rock nerds, and when it came to sick babies, she held her own. That's something to be impressed about. That's amazing. </p>

<p>[34:37.7]</p>

<p>I wouldn't think it was anything less than astounding, you know? Especially when they were talking about at the funeral how much she spent with babies less than 25 weeks old, in terms of gestation time. (pause) You know, how she wrote a lot of things that were protocols that went into being used around the world for this or for that, and I'm really proud of her. She's dead, but I'm really proud of her. I had no idea. I mean, I knew she worked with babies and I knew that she saved their lives, but I had no idea that she had done so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she [contributed so much].</p>

<p>[35:24.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that she really raised the standard of care for babies born that early. That's just freaking amazing. (pause) So that's pretty much what I've—- like I said, it's been on my mind lately. A lot. Unfortunately it's really chaotic. I feel like there's this maelstrom of feelings. (pause) I think I feel that at least some of them—- because before I left, I decided I was never going to let Mike's family make me feel terrible again. I think I even fielded the questions when people asked about it pretty well. (pause)</p>

<p>[36:29.1]</p>

<p>I'm going to get better at it. (pause) But it's just good to be around my family. It sounds weird, but being an only child, you're always looking for relationships with others in terms of sibling relationships. And, you know, this is one of—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also my impression is that, at least when you said it, it sounds like you were sort of an scientist from the time you were five.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess I'm imagining why you had (inaudible at 37:13.2), it was really in college.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really where I became a person and really had the chance. I mean, Bryant and I, we're very very close. He's a scientist too now with NASA. I'm so proud. </p>

<p>[37:31.3]</p>

<p>But I mean, that was really the only person in my life that I was that close with and felt like they understood me. It wasn't until basically I got on the campus of school and, although there is a lot of non-science and scientist-y people there, there is still such a culture of that that, you know, the phrase of something like "That's just within the margin of error" in terms of something—- like parking spaces—- "That's still within a 10 percent margin of error, it's fine"—- and everyone will laugh. It's enough of that kind of thing that you could feel comfortable being yourself. (pause) That's really where I became who I am. (pause)</p>

<p>[38:28.6]</p>

<p>It was just really nice to see it again. (pause) It was also nice to know that the people who loved and cared about me still do, even when I don't have the things that I think really made me awesome. Well, they probably didn't see as much of the intellect being gone. (pause) The things that made me, me. (pause) It was nice. It's very easy to think about "Okay, well, the reason why she's always invited to this is because of this," you know? (pause) And that's not really true. (pause) It's really nice to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally. (pause)</p>

<p>[39:41.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I said, just lots and lots of stuff—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You haven't had as many reminders as you should've in the last few years]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't. And I know that, although we were all going to try to keep in touch, it's not going to be easy. But I think that it is, at the very least, this has been a big boost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was also a really big drain on me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I may very well be in trouble for not making it through the day yesterday. I had started to get pretty sick. It's hard to play this game at work because they don't want you there sick, they don't really want you out either. What they really want you to be is perfect. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[40:38.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like I'm hacking up phlegm and I'm starting to lose my voice—- it's still coming and going a little bit. It's always awkward to me also when I come in after everyone knows I've been gone doing something, and I'll be like—- to me in my head it's like "Yeah, if I were more responsible, I would be able to go to work and be able to stay all day" and all that stuff. So I have a little bit of guilt about that. (pause) But it's not the same thing as I went on a bender with my friends just because it's Wednesday and that's why, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't call—- it wasn't like I had to go home because I was hung over. It's like I have to go home because I've been pushing my body too much, and my immune system went down again and I got sick again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you also had a funeral to go to. </p>

<p>[41:36.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think I am going to try to get down—- I saw my parents only very briefly, mostly just to have them take care of the dog. It's just like right now I'm having some trouble getting down everything in terms of figuring out how to go back and forth without a car and all this stuff, and she's just not getting the attention she needs. So we just decided that if my parents are okay with taking care of her until Thanksgiving—- they're pretty thrilled about it actually, which is kind of weird. They're like "Yeah, we've got our grand-dog visiting." I'm like "Okay. Sure." It was really hard for me because I'm really into animals and so it's hard to have Merlin [ph] gone, but at the same time I know it's the best thing for her because she doesn't need to be left alone for long periods of time.</p>

<p>[42:37.0]</p>

<p>She doesn't need to be out in the cold because we're supposed to get snow eventually. I need to figure out how to get her out without—- she's only three feet. She's a dachshund. She's only that tall. So when there's snow, it's kind of complicated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to finish up for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow, yes. And hopefully the elevator will be back in service because going upstairs was not easy today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You do know the elevator doesn't work, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That must be a real problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's better on the way down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somebody is supposed to be working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully soon. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

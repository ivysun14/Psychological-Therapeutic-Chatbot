<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) What I've been thinking about, ever since it happened today, is, uhm, a conference I had with parents of a boy.  And I al—, I think I'm, I was more upset by this conference and, and I don't know, I felt more helpless at it and I certainly felt very nervous during it and, uhm, just sort of incapacitated during it in a way that I rarely feel that strongly.  And it just occurred to me now that, uhm, it must have something to do with the fact that the boy's father's attitude was very hostile and defensive.  And it wasn't just that he was finding it hard to, well, understand what the position of the school is toward his son and there's really no need for him to be that hostile since the boy isn't doing badly, it's more sort of an emotional problem that he has had and he's been having therapy.  But everything, everything should be going along fine.  And it, and he's just so defensive about his position as what they're doing to him.  So his technique was to immediately attack me and start asking me why did I do this, what did I mean by that.  And I knew right from the start I should keep things in the conference general and, uhm, sort of not answer him in the way he was asking me because by answering him, I'd play his game.  And, and then that was just what I did.  I just, I don't know, I just felt, well, completely powerless.  And so I suppose I, I, I'm upset partly because he was making me feel in a way that, rationally, I knew there was no need for me to feel.  And then he was making me, or I was responding in a way that was exactly the opposite to the way I wanted to respond.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And the reason I think I'm more upset by this one is partly because my supervisor was there during the conference.  And she backed me up and agreed with me the way things went and just generally gave me support.  And it's the kind of support that generally would help me feel that there was no reason for me to keep thinking about it and feel upset, since I knew she approved of what had happened.  And this is the first time I've had a conference with a hostile father.  I've had just a few conferences with fathers before and they've, but they've always been pleasant ones.  And that's why I think it must have something to do with the fact that the father was there and my reacting to him, rather than just to the general situation that the parents had a different view of things than the school.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you surprised?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Not really but it didn't occur to me until just now that that was what was happening.  I kept thinking, after the conference or even during it, that the reason I was upset was that the parents just couldn't hear what we were trying to say to them.  (Pause) And I'm further, I think I'm further upset by something he did which I don't understand even now.  Because uhm, I think the boy has had some emotional problem but as, as far as the school is concerned, uhm, although the school didn't really want to accept him, they, they were hesitant to and it was only because the parents really pushed it that they did, uhm, the boy is, right now, performing alright.  And he's improving in his relationship with the other boys in the class so that just from what's happening at school, I can't see why the parents would be terribly concerned.  And it would be more their concern, I should think it would be more, uhm, what should be done because of the therapy he's having.  Or, well, I don't really, I've never had this experience either, of having a child who has gone to therapy but I just don't understand quite the way their attitude is taking.  And before, even before we had the conference today, the father made an appointment with the headmaster at the school.  And he didn't even know then what we were going to talk about.  So I, I don't know, unless he just didn't like the report that was written on the boy, that I wrote on the boy.  I can't under—, otherwise understand why he would have made this appointment ahead of time, before he even knew how things would go during the conference.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And this is another case where there's such a discrepancy between what I know and what I feel.  Because the whole way this father performed in just the fact that the boy has the problems he has, would suggest that the father is in some way very insecure.  And, uhm, if I had been at all confident I could have very easily handled the s—, not, well, not very easily but I wouldn't have taken things personally and I wouldn't have fallen into the kind of trap that he, he was laying for me.  And yet, still, I was feeling very defensive in return and feeling that he was the more powerful one and that probably he was right.  Or, I mean, know—, I knew that I didn't think he was right but just somehow I felt I had to answer to him, I guess that's it.</p>

<p>(5-minute silence) I was just wondering, too, uhm, aside from the fact that the conference started out making me feel I had to justify, well, just taking the report, which they began with, things that I had said in it.  Because they kept saying, "Well, why did you say this?"  Or, "What do you mean by that?"  Uhm, there were 1 or 2 things that I had decided I did want to say to the parents during the conference, which really directly involved sort of the attitude that they had toward their child and the kind of standards that they were teaching him to have for himself.  And I always find this very hard to say to a parent because some, because sometimes I'm probably thinking, well, how do I really know, myself, anyway.  And, well, I don't know, it's just such a personal thing for a parent, that I much prefer sort of skirting around it and not really saying it.  And I knew, in this case, I'd have to say it fairly simply and generally but directly.  And just somehow, again, I think I could have done it with just the boy's mother but the fact that his father was there too, I, I just kept avoiding bringing it up until finally I had to.  And then I just couldn't think of a way to put it so I could say it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was it you wanted to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, just mainly that the boy is a child and he can't decide everything for himself.  They, they often will let him decide what he's going to do and, uhm, who he's going to be with and, and they are constantly saying how they like him to be masculine and mature.  And just from the way he's behaved and from what they've said, I've gotten the impression that they expect a lot from him.  Or, if he says that he wants to do this or that, they take it on as literal, on the, or the superficial value without realizing that often the boy is returning what they expect from him or like to have him be.  And, uhm, I suppose I don't really know how to get at it so I wasn't too clear on how to say it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>The reason this is, was sort of an issue too is because, uhm, in the fall, uhm, his mother indicated that this boy was going to walk home alone.  And for this age boy it's never been, I don't think any boy at that age had walked home alone before.  So I had to ask my supervisor what the school's reaction would be.  And it became an issue because the mother became defensive that the boy had wanted to and they had worked it out very carefully.  And I had felt, since then, when the boy started walking home alone, he used to hang around a lot and just look very wistful.  And whenever she'd pick him up he'd always look extremely pleased, when he first saw her.  Although, I guess, to her he'd always say, "Why did you come?"  And act displeased.  So it just seemed to me that if she would just be a little bit stronger in what she thought was right and not listen to him all the time, it might be better.  And then there'd been an issue over his saying he didn't want to play with other boys.  And yet, in the classroom, he's extremely conscious of other boys and he'll much prefer to leave any activity just to socialize.  And she finally said one time, that she thought that she had maybe listened to him to much and that if she just helped him to overcome whatever fears he had about playing with other boys outside of school, then he always had a good time.  And this was a very new attitude on her part.  But she doesn't really put all this together.  And I wanted to make some general comment on what might help him so that he wouldn't be asked to make decisions he's not ready yet to make for himself.  But I think I was afraid of saying anything.  Despite the fact that I didn't really know how to say it, I was afraid to because somehow or other, implied in this, is a criticism of the parents.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, from all that you say, it sounds as though you must feel quite critical of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't, I think it's defensive on my part, that I'm feeling this critical.  Because I, I think if they hadn't been so defensive, if they'd somehow just been more open to, when they asked the school for suggestions, if they'd been more open to them, because they did come to me first, asking, then, uhm, I don't think I'd be so critical.</p>

<p>ANALYST: My point is not that you're too critical or not critical enough, it's that I think that that frightens you, when you get critical or feel it, you know, because you're afraid it'll get out of hand.  And therefore, you have to be very cautious.  (Pause) From what you describe, it's hard to imagine that, if you let yourself feel what you're inclined to, you must have been very angry with the father today.  But you describe as mostly having felt defensive but, ah, it seems to me this implies that you would, if you weren't afraid to, been very angry with him for behaving that way you describe.  And I think you, when, when you describe feeling defensive, it seems to me it must be that you are afraid of, in control of your own feelings, that you have to keep them very much in check and be very cautious and careful, as you described.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And right now, all I can think when you say this, is that I just had such an overwhelming fea—, feeling of being powerless.</p>

<p>ANALYST: To control the anger that, if you didn't squelch.  It's very striking that you don't mention that you were mad at him, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I hadn't thought of it.  Really, I thought only in terms of — well, mad at him only because he was making me feel so defensive.  But I suppose because what right would I have had to be mad at him unless he did something to me first.  So that's why I'm thinking of it that way.  (Pause) But I'm, when you say that, I'm not sure what I was afraid I'd do if I didn't control my anger.  (Pause) Well, I suppose unless it would be that, without the fear, then I would lose control of myself and say things that wouldn't be acceptable for me to say as a teacher.</p>

<p>ANALYST: For example?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.  (Laughs) Well, just sort of stop, well, I want to say faking it.  I don't know, he just, (sighs) I just felt the whole time he was being so false and, and putting importance on things that really weren't really important and that he didn't really think were important but that was his way to attack the situation.  And (pause) well, in fact I did make a comment that I made under stress but, uhm, I don't think I would have if I had had more control.  Because at one point they were asking about their son's writing and, uhm, again, they felt I hadn't assessed it properly, that he didn't write as well as he could and I hadn't indicated this in the report.  And, ah, they asked to see samples.  And one of the samples, ah, happened to be a story he'd written and the children had been given a choice of writing about a pet they have or one they used to have or one they would like to have.  And this boy wrote, "My pet used to be a vulture."  And when, when his father read this, I've never seen such a look of shock on a parent's face.  I know sometimes parents can't stand to think of their children sort of going towards things they consider violent or horrible like that.  But this father's face just was unbelievable and I felt I had to say something because he, he just looked like he couldn't handle this.  And so I said, "Well, he was just using his imagination."  (Laughs) Which was obvious.  And, ah, then my supervisor tried to make a joke of it and saying something that, "Would you think they really had a vulture at home?"  Or something, I don't know.  But anyway, the father was just still in a state.  He just couldn't stand this.  And uhm, so I said, "But he looked so shocked, that's why I said that."  (Laughs) And again I was saying it because I felt I had to defend myself on something that was kind of obvious and stupid to have said.  But, and I couldn't carry the joke because I was too involved in the whole thing.  But, in a way, I was implying, again, a criticism on the father by saying that.  And, ah, then the father's reaction was, "Well, the vulture's me."  Which I guess was why he was so upset by it to start with.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I th—, I keep thinking, too, when I think about this conference, of the fact that, even though my supervisor and I agreed on what should be covered and, and how, well, not how to say it, that's the thing that bothered me.  But, I don't know, we talked about it beforehand and I could talk to her about it and, and I felt I was making myself clear but during the conference, although I could judge the situations and understand what was happening, I somehow couldn't pull things together or put things into words.  And it made me feel as stupid as if I couldn't even judge the situations.  And so then I began thinking, when my supervisor was talking, well, I should be able to, I should have been able to put it into those words or see it in that way.  So it was combination of feeling angry at the parents, mainly the father, and feeling angry at myself.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you saying now you felt angry at him because I said so or because you did, in fact, feel it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, no, I felt it because I, well, I just can't quite see it the way you said it but I know I did feel angry at him.  (Silence) If I'm really honest, I think I said at, that, about being angry at them mainly because you had said that, regardless of how I felt.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Afraid of me too?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Excuse me?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you afraid of me too?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I just somehow can't answer that.  Because it's almost like I don't let myself look at it in that way so — (silence) I almost make a separation, I don't quite understand what it is I do.  But I can readily think I'm afraid of what you might think of me.  But somehow it seems different from just saying I'm afraid of you because if I say it that way, that directly, then it doesn't make sense.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about this sort of roundabout way that I think.  Because it does seem if I'm afraid of what you think of me, then I am afraid of you.  Or, if I was feeling very defensive toward the father today, that I always feel angry at anyone who makes me feel that defensive, so I was angry at him.  And, and then, in thinking how I think to myself in this roundabout way, made me connect it to, how so often I have so much trouble when I'm talking to other people saying something directly or, when I write, writing something directly.  (Pause) It's almost as if I literally and figuratively can't face things directly, or people directly.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>It made me think of the, uhm, well, I guess I was thinking in terms of, if I had more courage or confidence, both, I could look at people, look at people in the eye or look at a situation directly and, well, I just began thinking of how I so often have to be encouraged or supported or praised or whatever.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know, recently you have talked about another man that you spent a lot of your life with, who made you angry and scared you and frightened you, made you feel powerless and defensive and forced you to react in ways you didn't know or didn't want to and with whom you have a lot of trouble talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Again, I can know that the comparison is very true between the 2 situations, living with my father and then how I reacted today, but I don't feel the association.  I don't know, something could, I could be looking on somebody else's life when I compare the 2.  (Pause) And what I think I'm finding out is that, no matter how frustrating it is when I know something that doesn't do me any good, it doesn't have any meaning for me unless the feelings I have can correspond with what I know.  If they don't, then I might as well not know what I know.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, it's been about 3 months, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, and your mom just, you know, called and told me a week or so ago that you'd stopped your medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was not happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So what led you to decide to stop the medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, um, well, first the main reason is because they weren't making me feel too good.  Like I was getting sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of sick would you mean, like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I would throw up whenever I took them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know which one it was or could you tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause you took it together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And when did that start, do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, May, this is May right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably in mid Aprilish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe a month or a little bit longer ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how long did that go on for before you stopped the pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, I stopped taking them about 2 or 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so like, I was taking them in the morning whenever, like before we met last time, and I don't remember if I told you that they were making me feel sick.  I don't remember if I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think so then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, but I then tried taking them at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'd be okay until about like an hour after I took them and then I'd start feeling sick.  Cause when I took them in the morning—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt sick the rest of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so, so taking them morning or night, either way, you'd still get nauseous after taking the medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And taking them with food, did that help at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you stopped them and then did the nausea and vomiting go away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember about how long it took, was it like the next day you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was the next day, it was the day I stopped taking them I started feeling better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I kind of wanted like, I don't know, it'd be really hard for me to remember to take them all the time at college because my mom was always having to remind me to take them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I think it'd just be better if I kind of learned to deal with it.  But I've actually been doing pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been off of them for the past, you know, last few weeks of school and I've done better, well, pretty good on my tests and things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I mean I haven't dropped scores, some of them are higher than normal, some of them are just regular.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  And how's your mood been overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Off the medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Been okay?  I've had a few breakdowns but that's just because I'm kind of scared to go to college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, where you going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's right.  Okay.  And when you say you'd had a few breakdowns, do you mean like where you get depressed or where you cry cause you're scared or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just start bawling my eyes out.  And my dad sits there he's like what is the problem.  I'm just scared, just leave me alone.  But we end up talking about it and I get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just start thinking about everything that I want to do this summer and things that I have to do and trips that we're going on.  It's just like I don't have enough time.  I'm not going to make it in college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I'll do okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So it's, um, most of it if you think about college, going to college, that you have the breakdowns and start crying, not at other times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just college stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I was gonna say, that sounds like a normal fear.  It's just change, I mean, it's a big step.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure you'll do fine, but it's still, it's scary sometimes.  Now what about your sleep, are you sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I go to sleep, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have trouble getting to sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just hang out with my friends a lot and don't go to bed until really, really late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you still working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At [DEIDENTIFIED] still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How many hours a week are you working, about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, for the past 2 or 3 weeks I've cut my hours down to about 18 hours—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just because school was ending and I had to, yknow, make sure my grades are up and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, I'm starting to up my hours.  I'll probably take on about 30, 35 hours over the summer, try to work close to full time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we're going to Puerto Rico  on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, the [DATE] next week you're going, to Puerto Rico, for how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I believe we come back on the [DATE], we're going for about 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, have you ever been there before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I haven't either.  It's supposed to be pretty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm excited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's a family trip?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  We're going on a graduation cruise for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we get back from the cruise and I believe we're staying in Puerto Rico for 2 or 3 days just to kind of hang out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds cool.  Well, good, that sounds excellent.  Um, what about your appetite, has it been stable or increased or decreased?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's increased a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know if your weight's changing or is it staying the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've actually gained weight since I got off the meds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I believe it's about 6 pounds.  Like it differs every time I weigh myself, but the average so far has been about 6 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how much are you weighing usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, right now I'm, right now I'm between 100 and 104.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Depending on the day and what I'm wearing, what I'm eating, that kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I used to weigh 94.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So getting off the meds has helped you gain a little weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh, how's your energy level during the day, do you have enough, too much, not enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I get the proper sleep, I have, you know, perfect energy.  If I don't get enough sleep, I'm tired, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, sure.  And, [PATIENT NAME], do you feel like you're worrying a lot about things or do you just get a little nervous as you think about college?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just nervous whenever I think about college and not having enough time with my friends over the summer before I leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I really don't worry that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know what you want to study at college?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I want to be a teacher.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That sounds good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you able to have fun, if you go out with friends now, do you enjoy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If we do something, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of my friends, just like, let's just sit here and do nothing.  That's not fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about, are you having any suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm loving life right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Now how's your concentration or focus off the medicine?  Are you able to focus okay or is it difficult?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm able to pay attention and listen to what people are saying, but I fidget a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my parents are seeing that and they always call me on it.  But I always know what they're saying.  I can always repeat it back to them perfectly.  I just, I fidget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Does it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And once in a while I get off topic, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now does the fidgeting bother you at all or does it more just something your parents notice and say something to you about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something they notice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've always fidgeted since I can remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think now I might fidget a little more than I used to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think that they're kind of imagining part of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So it's not so bad that you have to get up and move around, you can't sit still in class or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my dad'll be talking to me and I'll start like playing with my hair, you know, or playing with my rings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they're like stop fidgeting, you're not listening, it's like but I am.  And I'll repeat exactly what they say back to me and they're like well, that's right.  You're just fidgeting, stop it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it bothers them more than it does you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, what about, do you feel like you're impatient, like is it hard to wait in line at the store or can you sit and wait til?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can sit and wait.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm very relaxed right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I really don't feel a change off the medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you feel okay off of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And just so you know, what your mother told me she may have already told you this, she felt that you were more emotionally up and down and not as focused off the medicine, was she said.  She told you that too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I've explained to her, you know, that I'm just, I'm really nervous about going to college.  And my dad understands that.  My dad and I sat down and talked about it today.  And he understands that, you know, I'm just nervous about going to college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and the key, [PATIENT NAME], is, um, it's how you feel.  In other words, if, if you have some nervousness about going to college, that's normal.  If it starts to interfere with your ability function, you know, if you can't go to work or you get distracted at work, where you can't do your job, then it's okay if you want to try to go back on some medicine, you can.  If you want to stay off of it and you're able to function fine, that's okay too.  It's really your decision at this point.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't really had any problems.  I mean, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  It sounds like you prefer to stay off the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, if over the summer if I see that I have a problem somewhere I would definitely come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And be like, yknow, we need to try something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's an important thing to know that, be aware of is whether it's over the summer if you're struggling or if you get to college and it's really hard to stay focused or you're not doing as well as you think you could or should be doing, you know, don't hesitate to get some help, whether it's me or someone up there, you know, someone that, um, you can see just to get you back on medicine if you feel like, you know, things aren't going as well as they could, cause there's some kids that go off to college and it's not because of intelligence but maybe because they get depressed or they have ADHD and they can't stay focused, they're not able to perform as well as they'd like to and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have to struggle if that's an issue.  If you do fine at school, you don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel I've actually done okay.  Um, I had a paper due the last week of school and I did it, I wrote it after I was off my med and I got like a 97% on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was one of the highest in the class.  And I felt I did pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, excellent.  Okay so, it sounds like you're functioning well off the medicine.  Work is going fine at school, your work at [DEIDENTIFIED] is going okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your parents are a little bothered by your fidgeting and you notice some ups and downs, but you're not falling apart or getting depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's not like I used to be.  Like I used to either have a lot of energy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or be very angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean right now my only ups and downs are, you know, am I nervous about going to college, am I nervous about not seeing my friends enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, let's see how it goes then.  Let's, if you want to stay off the medicine, we can do that.  And, um, let's make a note here that you stopped them.  And if you were to decide that you wanted to go back on the medicines, we wouldn't put you back, I wouldn't put you back on the same doses.  We start you at a lower dose and then see if that was enough.  And if it wasn't, we could increase it again, but we'd have to increase kind of slowly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Would there perhaps be another medicine that I might be able to try if I decided to try it again?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, there are other medicines you can take too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just to see if they would make me feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yes.  Especially the nausea.  I mean, we would want to find something that doesn't give you nausea because that's no good to take the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just made my stomach feel really weird and like I couldn't eat all day and I felt like if I could eat, like I'd get really, really sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  I don't know which one of the medicines was doing that.  Strattera sometimes can, Lexapro sometimes can.  So what we would probably is start you on one medicine and see if that worked.  And if you didn't get the nausea, if we added in the other medicine and you got the nausea we'd know that was the one that did it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So yeah, so if you feel like you do want to consider going back on medication, definitely we would try to find something that does not cause you to have an upset stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, good.  Um, what else?  Is there anything else going on that you wanted to talk about today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not with me.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you still seeing [NAME OTHER] too or did you stop?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once in a while.  I don't see him that much cause I'm actually doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I go [INAUDIBLE] quite a bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now the other thing to be aware of, um, just for future reference is if your mood swings start coming back and getting worse, you don't want to wait too long to get some help because for some people they can continue to get worse over time and it can really interfere with, you know, their school or their life even.  I hope that doesn't happen to you, [PATIENT NAME], but that's just something to be aware of.  If that happens don't hesitate to ask somebody for some help with it, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if you, my hope is you go to school, you know, you'll have normal ups and downs like all college students do, you'll do well in school, you'll love it, you'll get out and you'll be a wonderful teacher.  You know, and you may never need medicine.  But I'll also tell you that there are teachers around that are on medications cause they have significant mood swings if they don't take them.  And if they take the medicine, they do fine.  And also with ADHD there are people that struggle off medicines and do fine with it and there are teachers that I've treated over, again, in this district, they're not on medications and do just fine.  So the key is to find what works for you.  And if it works for you to be off medicine, great, but if it's not working, please get some help so you don't have to struggle, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So good.  Anything else you can think of that we didn't talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I can think of.  Not for me anyways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You're feeling like you're doing pretty well.  Your brother's struggling, but you're doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's not doing very well.  Although I got a phone call today, I believe he's failing three classes, he has a D in one class, and a C in another.  Yeah, not too good.  So I'm doing pretty good.  All my grades are A's and B's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Graduating on Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Congratulations.  You know, and really at this point in life that's all you can be responsible for is yourself.  You know, you can't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be responsible for your brother.  He's got to learn to figure it out for himself and figure out where to be successful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So hopefully he will.  He's a good kid.  So hopefully he'll figure it out.  Sometimes people just, you know, everybody goes through their struggles in life at different times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, hopefully people learn from their struggles.  If they do, they get stronger and do better in life.  So hopefully he'll learn from these hard times too.  All right.  Good.  In that case, um, I'm just thinking there are 2 options.  Either you don't need to come back and see me again if you don't want to, but you can call if you need to, or some, you can set up an appointment like late summer before you go off to college and check in.  What would be your preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably just to check in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to set up an appointment to check in to me, or to call?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we can set an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe just check in just to make sure things are going well before you leave for college?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know when you're going to be leaving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I believe I have to be down there [DATE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For like moving in and registration and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you'll probably go down—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something like the [DATE] or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So early August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds fine.  Well, let's see here.  The [DATE] is a Wednesday, so maybe the week of [DATE] do you think maybe, [DATE] through the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that should work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just not on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my mom's birthday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, we don't do that then.  And do you have a preference for morning or afternoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doesn't matter really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll just throw out some times then.  If we could meet on the [DATE] at either 9:30 or 1:00, either of those would work, or 4:30, or 9:30, 1:00, or 4:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We'll do 9:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just so I get that done, so my dad's not like, you're wasting your entire day.  My dad's been asking me for 2 weeks, when are you going to go to [PHYSICIAN NAME], when are you going to go see him?  I go see him right before I graduate, calm down, dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know why he was wondering?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he wants me to talk to you about my meds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, your folks may encourage you to go back on them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, you know, they may feel that you do better on them.  At this point, [PATIENT NAME], I think it's really gotta be your call because like you said, you're going to be going off to college and your parents aren't going to be there to tell you to take your medicines or you're going to have to take them, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have a few activities like school wise, like reading [INAUDIBLE] and everything, and I mean, I get that done over the summer and if I struggle with it, like paying attention to it and getting it done and stuff, then I'll probably go back on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But at least this way I have a tester for, you know, trying to get some schoolwork done and if I can do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds reasonable.  And this is probably the best time to find out, over the summer, because if you struggle, it's easier to do something about it now than once you're in college and you've fallen, you know, several weeks behind.  Then it's tough to catch up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, um, yeah, so even if before [DATE] if you feel like you're struggling you can always call me and we can always meet and sit down and talk about things and again if you are struggling we may just try either, we have several options we can talk about to find something that'll work, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, excellent.  There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  Good.  Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Welcome.  Congratulations on graduation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have a good time at the ceremony.  Where's it going to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's at the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know where that is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  All right, see you later.  Uh—huh, bye—bye.</p>

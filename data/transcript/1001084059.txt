<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  What's new, anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let's see, I picked up my papers today for the next step in my divorce which is, we have a meeting like in November.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it like a mediation meeting or is it -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's what they call it -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Although we're not really mediating, I mean we're already pretty decided but I guess [NAME OTHER] will do it by conference call.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  Because he'll be back, he'll be out in Kansas but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it kind of a formality you have to go through?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it is and our papers were just stamped that they were filed [DEIDENTIFIED], so I can't call until after [DATE] because now I have to wait for ninety days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you actually filed for divorce already.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what are these papers for?  Do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well it's just the papers that have been filed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh I understand.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess, I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I understand.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I not sure how that all works.  I'm going through a paralegal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just go where I need to go and be where I need to be.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Turn in the papers I need to turn in but I think it's on it's way, so it's, actually I thought it would be over sooner but I didn't realize the ninety days starts then, I guess I thought it started.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It'll probably, it looks like it'll be in the New Year before it's finalized.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay but things are moving forward the way you want them to still?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It feels right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And [NAME OTHER] is still in agreement pretty much with what you're -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think he's upset with me because I had forgot this family cabin we have, you know, at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My dad, a number of, many years ago, he's a lawyer so he made it into a corporation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I didn't even think about that as property because being a corporation, all the kids, we all own like nine shares.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not very much but, anyway, because of that, and I had forgot to put that on the papers.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so my brother, who is also a lawyer, called and asked me one day if I had done anything about that and I said, you know, I hadn't even thought of it because I always just think of it as a family cabin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And not as a corporation, so I had to send a paper back to [NAME OTHER] and have him initial it, so when he sent it back to me, you know, he sent this note that, you know, was kind of snippy and had the key to the cabin taped to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did he own shares in the corporation too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well no but see, you know, anything that you acquire as a gift or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> During the marriage.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> During the marriage, it eventually could come back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you got that after you were married the corporation formed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this was, you know, within the last, I don't know, fifteen to twenty years or so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So because of that, I mean he might think that down the road, he could think that, okay, I'm going to give my shares to [NAME OTHER] our one and only but then he might think well since [NAME OTHER] is getting that, I'm going to give mine to my nieces and nephews.  Well, then it opens up two other people and we really want to keep it family so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure, so was he in agreement with giving the shares back to you or something or what did you ask for?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I just said that I was going to take it hundred percent is all, you know, on the paperwork they say who's going to take what and are you splitting fifty, fifty or, you know, how you're doing it.  You know, he gave me the time share so I'm taking that at a hundred percent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So that's what I'm doing with this but he was not so happy and I haven't heard from him since then, that was a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh,  okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, oh well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had told him, a way long time ago, you know, I mean he is going to miss going there but I had told him, you know, he can still go there, he can still be there, you know, he'll be going with [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, he can meet [NAME OTHER] up there but I don't know, he can't just up and go like he would like.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  Well and I think through divorces sometimes people do get -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Angry or hurt feelings or whatever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When it comes out, so maybe this is some of that that's coming out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right but I think too, I was telling a friend of mine, you know, he was calling a lot this summer and what not, well see he hasn't been calling or emailing as much and I think part of that is because he's back in school now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I know, you know, he's got papers to grade, he's advising the paper, I know he's busy with school because I know how that goes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I think part of it is he's just busy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it sounds like</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's going okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're okay with the way things are?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I'm okay with everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well good.  So your spirits have been holding up pretty well?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah they have.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get kind of frustrated at work sometimes because it's still a lot of extra, you know, I keep, I mean I do keep checking the job lines but I want to keep my options open.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any good new opportunities.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not posted yet but I know of one that's coming up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where will it be?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's close.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, very close.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's something you'd be interested in?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Depending on the pay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it has to be better than what I'm getting now so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would hope so.  Does [DEIDENTIFIED] pay better just as a general rule?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Actually, [DEIDENTIFIED] is known for not paying very well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't, but I don't know, this would be for a branch manager position and the director just put a bug in my ear about it because I know the director of [DEIDENTIFIED], we go to the same meetings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she knew that I was looking and she said there may be an opening coming up.  She said it's not posted yet but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know whether I should tell you where it is or not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh it doesn't matter to me, that wouldn't, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it seems like when I tell people then it, I'm probably superstitious</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh then don't tell me.  I just hope if it's a good job you get it, I don't care where it is.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I would hope if I did get it, it was because of my, you know, my qualities, not because I know [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But she did put a bug in my ear about it but it's at the old [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I don't even know where that is.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do you know where [DEIDENTIFIED] is?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sort of.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's right on the corner, right across from the, if you're going west.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You go past that little park.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I didn't know there was a [DEIDENTIFIED] over there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's the park and then there's, well there's [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The statues, it's at that little street.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When you get in right at it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In fact, I'm going over there at five thirty because they're having, they've been closed for six months because they've done a major renovation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What does that mean, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was built by [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Back in the late, well early nineteen hundreds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I've lived in [DEIDENTIFIED] my whole life and never even knew there was a [DEIDENTIFIED] there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, I'll be darned.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And mine is a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And see we're trying to get it expanded and renovated -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Preserved but they're actually doing it over there.  The [DEIDENTIFIED], that's one thing they have is money for all kinds of good stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Aren't you part of [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED] is, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that here in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they've got a branch over in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I mean they do a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So she did tell me that was, she said just keep checking, she said they haven't decided for sure what they're going to do but it sounded like the manager was either going to another branch or there was going to be some kind of change.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well good, so it'd be close to.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I wouldn't have to move.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It would be very close.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and then once you're in that district, maybe you'd be more in line for other positions if you wanted other positions that might be higher paying or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh-huh, because they do move people around.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, often times people hire from within so, well, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And there's another one, actually in [DEIDENTIFIED] right now that is available but I kind of decided, well I don't know, I might still apply for it.  I don't know that it's going to pay all that much more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But even a little bit would help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, every bit helps.  Well good, so there's some new opportunities coming along, the divorce is proceeding forward, mood's pretty good, sleeping okay at night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I am except for the last, last night.  I woke up, I got up this morning at like four thirty.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then there was one night, last Wednesday, what is it about Wednesday, I woke up real early like that too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But the day before one of my, my children's program director turned in her resignation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I figured that was it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That would explain it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So now I have to go through that process.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, all my staff is part time so that's very difficult.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To find qualified people who want to work for nothing and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Part time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and have a lot of stuff, you know, responsibilities.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well are you holding up in terms of your energy level during the day, are you doing okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And appetite and weight pretty stable?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And do you feel like you're focusing pretty well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, so there's some stress but you're handling it pretty well it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so.  There's a day or two in there where I'm like, God what am I doing.  Not about the divorce but just, it's really, most of my stress comes from the job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I did, I'm just taking this out because I want to make sure I talk to you about it</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my board knows this, at the last board meeting I told them, I said I want everybody to know that my staff is extremely stressed out or no, I said, everybody in the [DEIDENTIFIED] is very stressed out including myself, I told them that and see they are trying to get a raise for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They are trying.  I don't know what's going to happen with that.  I don't have my, we've just gotten into the budget process and they're going to, the night that I have a work session with city council, I'll do my part just for the [DEIDENTIFIED] budget and then when I'm finished, I'm going to leave and then they're going to talk to them about it but, you know, one of the things I'm putting in for is another full time person so there's somebody else there full time besides me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I told them, I said I'm not doing the things that you hired me to do, I just told them flat out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you just don't have the time to do them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  I said I don't, I don't have time to write grants or even look for them, write grants, you know, I have to take a lot of desk time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because we don't have enough people to cover.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And those people have things that they need to do.  I said you know programs, things that happen [DEIDENTIFIED], they don't just happen right then, you have to plan, you have to make calls, you have to get out flyers, you have to make stuff, you have to get it all ready, if it happens at four o'clock you have to get it ready from three to four or three thirty to four.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I said those things don't just happen so, you know, those people need to be off the desk sometime.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To do that stuff and they're only part time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's kind of a vicious circle.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I think that's where my stress comes from.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, it sounds like you're trying to find ways to manage the stress whether it's get more help or move somewhere else where you have more resources.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds very reasonable.  What about medication, any problems with any of the medicines?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I tried to get this renewed, you know -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which one is it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is all I have left but I had cut them down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which one is that, the Lamictal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We call it Zoloft but it's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sertraline.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I thought you had stopped that one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I had cut down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, oh, but you hadn't stopped it yet.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well what I had done was I cut them all in half and I don't know, I guess I started with a full thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I think, wasn't I down to one already.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see, I have back in May that you were going to cut back by half a week and then stop it but you cut back more slowly than that, yeah, because last July you were on 50.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is a half</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One whole.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which is a half a tablet.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is 50 a half a tablet?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they should be 100 mg tablets.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think, if that's what you were getting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> These are, well see there was sixty of them in here so they lasted me forever</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It says take two tablets, where does it say how many mg?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It should be right after the name, Sertraline, then it should say probably 100 mg</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, 100's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so I had, I don't know, I guess I had really gotten down and then at one point I cut them all in half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Do you feel like you want to stay on the half tablet or do you want to try going off?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know, does this help with the focusing more than the others?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not necessarily.  It's an antidepressant that can help boost energy a little bit.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This one?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but it also can interfere with sleep sometimes a little bit, not usually at the low dose you're on though.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes it reduces anxiety a little bit and helps with stress tolerance a little bit so if you feel like this isn't a good time to be going off it, we can just stay with the dose you're on if you're feeling pretty good.   If you feel like you want to try and get off, excuse me, we could see how it goes without it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I think I want to get into the New Year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's perfectly all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can just call in more refills for you then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, will they be at the 100's then?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We can -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then I'd just cut them in half again.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to or do you want to switch to the 50's so you don't have to cut them?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, well let's just do the 50's then.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll call it in as a new prescription.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay and see there were like sixty of these, so if I went down to cutting them in half, they would last me a hundred and twenty days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It seems like, anyway.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they last a long time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway, I did get the other two refilled and then this one, I guess because it does say [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I was going to say, it probably just expired then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So let's just stay, I'll switch you over to the 50's, then you don't have to cut them, you just take one a day.  And you're still taking the one Lamictal and the two Effexor?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm looking at my notes here, yeah, it is two Effexor right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And what, tell me again, what, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Lamictal is the mood stabilizer that's supposed to keep you out of mania and also help with some of the depression.  The Effexor is an antidepressant antianxiety medication that should keep you from slipping into depression.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, [NAME OTHER] had a really hard time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> With?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With getting off his Effexor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It can be hard to get off of for some people.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, I was reading that article out there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Some people have dizziness, emotional fluctuations, thinking problems.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Electrical zap sensations for like a week or two sometimes.  There are ways that we're learning to try to make that better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like cutting back very slowly and sometimes putting people on Prozac or another medicine that increases serotonin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes that will reduce the side effects or the withdrawal effects.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or discontinuation they call it but it's like withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, some people can have a bumpy road getting off of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So if at some point you'd want to get off of it, let me know, we'll just have to do it very carefully.  You don't want to just stop it cold turkey.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, I know that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In fact, once in a while, I forget to take my medicine and by the next morning I'm, or even like that night, I know I've forgotten it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, most people.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I get a headache.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Real fast or I wake up with a headache.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And sure enough I've missed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it doesn't take very long to know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, it leaves your system very quickly, so usually within a day people can feel it. [PATIENT NAME], I just realized too, with the Zoloft, do you want me to write you out a prescription or call it in, I can do either one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't matter.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I guess, why don't you go ahead and call it in.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If you don't mind.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure, are you still using the [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, actually [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Has become a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I should have brought that number.  Oh, actually I have it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  If you do that's great but we can look it up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh rats, I left my phone in the car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.  It's [DEIDENTIFIED], what street is it on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It used to be called -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or it's a [DEIDENTIFIED] now.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a [DEIDENTIFIED], it's on [DEIDENTIFIED] where the big [DEIDENTIFIED] is now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I'll look it up and find it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I pay like thirty, I think thirty one and something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's fine.  So it sounds like the medicines are working okay right now, just leave them alone, get you through the -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> End of the year, any transitions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that makes good sense and maybe the stress at work will calm down once either you get a raise and some help or you get another position.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then the divorce will be finalized, hopefully, soon after the first of the year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That you'll have some closure too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I looked into, I mean I've been looking into maybe getting or subbing as a substitute over at the [DEIDENTIFIED] or even in the [DEIDENTIFIED] system.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But the problem is I don't know if I can work seven days a week. I mean they'd probably want me on the weekend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or nights.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That'd be -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to avoid doing that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I understand, yeah, the burnout will be the hard part, I think you need the breaks.  Well, anything else that I haven't asked you about that you think is important that we didn't talk about today?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I was going to ask you a personal question or maybe you can't answer it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, what's the question?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Have you ever been divorced?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You have.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I've been through a divorce.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, did you do it yourself or -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, we used attorneys.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Did you have to go get a lawyer?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we used attorneys.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just because we didn't know how to do it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And figured we wanted to make sure we did everything right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Well, you probably had your kids.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Had kids.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that makes a big difference.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so I know people that have done it on their own without attorneys.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I didn't have an attorney but the paralegal I think has been really helpful, I just hope, you know, we didn't have, I mean [NAME OTHER] is old enough to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm kind of concerned that he might be going into a mania stage</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure.  He's been looking or a job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that'll be something to keep a close eye on because sometimes when people are, usually when people go into mania, they don't know they're in mania and that can really create problems so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, he's doing that thing where he's staying up to two and three in the morning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I haven't seen him for a while but [NAME OTHER], you know, [NAME OTHER]'s father, [NAME OTHER]'s father in law that was up there with him in [DEIDENTIFIED], he said he's gained about 30 pounds probably.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because he just eats constantly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And usually mania people lose weight because they can't sleep, they don't eat.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With the mania?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Usually and their mind is going a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're very talkative; they're very active, so often people actually lose weight.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now, he's gotten very lethargic.  He just, he plays video games all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I wonder if he's depressed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that might be -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because sometimes when people get depressed, they gain weight, they don't do as much.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They can't sleep sometimes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He won't go and he knows what he needs to do and I don't know, I don't know how to help him or talk to him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, one thing you could think about is if you want to just go up and like take him out for lunch or something and just check in with him to see, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but what do I say.  I don't want to say the wrong thing but I want him to, you know, he says he's trying to find a job and I know he goes to the library and uses their computer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But he's, from what [NAME OTHER] says, he sits around and plays video games a lot, I mean hours, stays up late and he knows he needs to be on the light/dark therapy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So he won't do that and he's not going to the gym anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME], you can go up and tell him, you know, you're concerned that he might be depressed and you've been there, you know what it feels like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And if he is, you just want him to get some help.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well he sees a doctor, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] up there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't, do you know if he's talking to him regularly or how often he sees him?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think once a month and he has gone, I know a couple times, and see he's only been back up there since August, the first part of August but I know he's gone a couple of times to this bipolar support group.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good, so he's doing some things to get some help at least.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And there's one fellow there that's, I guess he's an older gentleman, what he thinks is old, maybe my age, I don't know, but he's a musician too and he's bipolar but he seems to have done real well and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good, you know, by just going up, if you decide, whether it's on the phone or whether it's in person, just let him know that you're concerned about him and there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't do any harm by letting him know you care about him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're just wondering how he's doing -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And support him so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he has sent me emails, he's [DEIDENTIFIED] places he's been interested in.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know if he's setting his sights too high.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean the clients these people have are unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, I just, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you know, probably the best thing you can do is just stay in contact with him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Whether it's going up and having lunch or take him out or just even the phone to stay in contact.  You'll get a sense probably then of how he's doing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, he doesn't answer his phone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He has a cell phone and he doesn't answer it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You may have to call [NAME OTHER] and ask.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then he doesn't, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ask her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I could do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or ask her to talk to him and relay a message and, you know, just go up and see him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I wanted to get up there pretty quick.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's probably good.  Well, should we set up another appointment in about, well let's see, when do you want to check in?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't bring my book in either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to tentatively give you an appointment and you can check and see if it works?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, do you want to check in, this is October, sometime in January or February?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't need to come till then?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We can go two or three months if you want.  I mean if you want to check in sooner we can but I think you're doing pretty good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, let's go January.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now, what happens with the insurance does that kick in, in the New Year?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see, who's your insurance?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I know they said originally I could have twelve visits.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they said twelve visits, let me see if they put a, it's [DEIDENTIFIED] Plan huh?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that just like twelve visits any time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think there was an expiration date on that but I'll double check and find out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, not that I need to come twelve times before the end of the year</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think with most of these plans, I'm not as familiar with this one so I'll check with them, but usually it either carries over or they'll just give you a new twelve for the new year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll check, I have [NAME OTHER] to make sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So do you want to aim for, did you say January?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And later in the day is best for you, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see, I've got either Monday the [DATE] at four thirty as an option is that good or I can I give you something else?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that sounds okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's try that and if it doesn't work just call me and we'll -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know I will.  I've had to do that the last three months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know but I don't like doing that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, things come up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  Did you ever read that [NAME OTHER] book I gave you?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A long time ago I remember looking at it.  I don't know if I have it here or at home.  I think it's at home.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was looking at the bipolar child, is that a new one?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's an older one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is, because we have a new one at the library.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think that's an older copy, it may have been updated since I got that one. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good seeing you, you're welcome.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take care.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See you, have a good Halloween.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You do the same.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or good holidays, I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're all coming.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh wait, did you give me the card?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think so.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh you did, I put it in my pocket.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take care, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bye bye.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Bye bye.</p>

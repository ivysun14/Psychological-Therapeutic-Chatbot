<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Is that new?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The picture?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I've never looked over there before. (pause for .08 seconds) So, I got the scoop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, Jeremy is on the HMO. It would cost $2000 a year to join his HMO. It would cost $4000 for both of us to switch —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: to PPO, and we're not going to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, if you won't take the HMO, starting in January then it is not worth my joining his insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. [00:00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, however, it still might be worth my joining his insurance if I want to continue seeing someone that's not you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I've just been in a flurry of activity with the Health Insurance people -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: sort of seeing how far I can push them and saying the words 'mental health parity' and seeing if anyone cares. So far no one cares. But I just got a call back from the patient advocate who might have something to say or not. I also called the case manager at the Mental Health department.</p>

<p>So I might—I don't know if the case manager is the right person to call because I certainly am not in crisis. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but (pause for .03 seconds) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the reason why they always call is because I heard back from my psychiatrist, who I haven't seen in a while and don't really plan to see in a while, but I informed her of this issue. She recommended, she said, "See if Ethan will be, like basically change his things, his policies. Call this patient advocate. Call member services, and you probably won't be able to see a therapist at the university more often than twice a month."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:03:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was sort of the information that I wanted to get from her cause if she was like, "Oh well, actually it's like in the summertime things are slow but now that the school year has started, you could see someone once a week." And then my decision would be just to see, find someone at school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But all this brings up the question of like, what is the role of therapy? And why should I continue after our next five visits? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause for .04 seconds) I got pretty scared last night when it was clear that we would not switch to the PPO. Jeremy was sort of—we were both in a very tough position because Jeremy does not want to switch to the PPO for various reasons; for his own health insurance and the way he has it set up. [00:04:08]</p>

<p>And the cost of the—I mean it's like if you're willing to pay $2000, why aren't you willing to pay $4000? (pause for .03 seconds) But, um, sort of we had to draw the line somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was upsetting because like he was uncomfortable sort of making this financial call when the thing at stake seems so much more important -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and I was upset because (pause for .05 seconds) it seemed—it just was kind of scary to think about not coming here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you also upset with me? [00:05:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a little bit annoyed that it came up a while ago that I could join Jeremy's health insurance and that that would provide continuity. Now it seems like there's some distinction between the HMO and the PPO for you, and that didn't come up earlier, so that's, I mean, that's just a logistical -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: thing that would've been nice to know earlier, but I don't think I would've changed anything. Um, (pause for .05 seconds) I'm not upset with you. I think it's—I think everybody should be able to have therapy forever in an unlimited way, so in a sense it's kind of like, "Ethan, you aren't making this possible."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Do your duty for society." But, um, you have to do what you have to do. It's your job. It's your profession. So, um, yeah that's fine. And if we were in a position to pay out of pocket then I think I would, cause I do think it's worth it. [00:06:18]</p>

<p>But I also think I just like it and maybe it's going to be fine to stop and (pause for .04 seconds) miss something that I like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Yeah, you know, you mentioned being afraid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was pretty scary. I got—it passed—it wasn't something that I felt out of control over, but it was like, "Okay. I have my things and I'm starting to learn how to work within this new structure with these new bumps and like the new feelings, and I'm depending on the things to sort of anchor me." So like if I remove one of the anchors—it just seems premature. [00:07:26]</p>

<p>(pause for .04 seconds) Well, (pause for .07 seconds) I don't know if premature is the right word. Maybe it just seems like, "Oh well, it's starting to—it feels like it's starting to work so -" That doesn't mean that if something changes that it won't continue to work, but it does mean that like I will have to change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I lost you a bit there. It is starting to work—[00:08:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like things are, my new things are starting to work for me —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, or I'm starting to work for them, or sort of remove one of the new—one of the anchors feels like there's just going to have to be some changes. That's scary. And it's not as scary as removing meditation, for example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do you smile?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause for .12 seconds) ah, I guess because I—it's a comparison I've made myself. [00:08:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah, so if someone were like, "You can no longer meditate." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "Your health insurance doesn't allow you to meditate," that would be (pause for .05 seconds) like somehow taking away something much, much more serious and intrinsic. So, yeah, so I guess I'm sort of in the trouble-shooting phase.</p>

<p>I have until December 3rd to decide to go on Jeremy's health insurance so I think I'm going to see, just see how it goes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. (pause for .21 seconds) I'm seeing if there's anything else I can think of—I mean, I don't know if I explained what it was about the HMO and the PPO that are different; like, why I could do one but not the other. [00:10:10] </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, do you want me to explain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, um, I've been a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider since 2003 and as of January 1st, I've decided to no longer to be a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause for .04 seconds) like, a, a lot of their reimbursements are low and um, like, um, sort of with all of my experience—I've also done almost all of the of psycholitic training at this point, and pretty much all my colleagues that are kind of where I'm at are (pause for .03 seconds) off of all insurance plans, and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm. Seeing rich people. [00:11:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What? Seeing rich people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're only seeing rich people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, maybe—I don't know. A lot of them are charging like a couple of hundred bucks an hour or more, and like I don't really want to do that. But I sort of felt like it's got to a point where, um—there are also some things that I really don't like about dealing with the Blue Cross HMO, although those in and of themselves were not the reasons to stop doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, whereas the PPO offers (inaudible at 00:11:51) network benefits so, you know, once I'm off their HMO panel then PPO will still cover for anybody (ph) -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: they don't cover (inaudible at 00:12:03) so that's what that (inaudible at 00:12:06)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause for .07 seconds) I guess, ah, to me in any case, five visits does not feel like a lot to have left so (pause for .04 seconds) um, (pause for .04 seconds) let me think of some sort of plan that would work for at least extending things a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah, I'm not saying that because I think you're fragile and it's like you need this to not stop (ph). It's not like that. It's just like, you know, if you decide to stop it doesn't feel like quite enough time to—I don't know—it just feels a little short-changed. [00:13:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. Let's put some thought to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we are, we can pay out of pocket a little bit for a teeny little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's another thing we discussed last night and that was actually when I got upset. I suggested that it was a temporary solution and Jeremy was very uncomfortable saying this but he needed to say it, he said, "I'm only saying this once and I'm very uncomfortable saying it: but I'm uncomfortable with paying that much."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ah, that just means I'm uncomfortable with it, and once I pursued it a little further it was quite clear that he was, that it was okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that sort of was a new thing for us—which is like making a decision that one person's uncomfortable with. [00:14:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Um —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I noticed that I didn't ask—so the first thing that the psychiatrist said was ask Ethan and I don't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that I feel comfortable. Like I just, I just didn't ask you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well I will offer—I will, um, (pause for .08 seconds) I'll come up with some sort of offer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: to take you back (ph). Um, let me think a bit. Um -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine. We can come back to it. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's all that's really been on my mind today. (laughs) Um, let's see if there's (pause for .20 seconds) um, I just thought of when I pointed out that I didn't ask you, it reminded me of like how, like why didn't I ask you? And I think (pause for .05 seconds) I've been tempted to ask a lot of times in the past, like am I special in some way? [00:16:06]</p>

<p>But I've just like wondered it, and I think it would make me uncomfortable if you actually said that I was and that asking you to change your -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: whatever would actually be sort of being violating that boundary, which is the one-way sort of (pause for .04 seconds) one-way relationship boundary that I've come to appreciate or just accept.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, what—I mean, I understand the question but first what's the one-way relationship boundary? [00:16:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, where like I sort of pay you money and you offer your services, and it's objective and um, (pause for .04 seconds) like I don't make an impact on your life but you make an impact on my life; which may not be true but that's at least—like I can't, I don't know that it's true or not cause you don't really talk to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Um, and so you sort of default to assuming you don't or wouldn't make an impact.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I default to assuming that you wouldn't show it or say it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But by, you know, cutting me a break or doing something that you wouldn't normally do for another patient would, um, reveal—I don't know—would give you an opportunity to like show it or say it. [00:18:12]</p>

<p>But also that could be totally untrue and it could just be like you're, like that's part of you offering your services. You're just making sure there's an appropriate, um, (pause for .04 seconds) like end or you know, that you're doing a good job at whatever it is. </p>

<p>Like I see that actually it could have nothing to do with me, but it just made me think of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do want to know but I'm not going to ask you because, ah, —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? Sorry, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ah, yeah I think that's something that I've often known about people, is like how I'm special to them. And that's a nice thing to know. [00:19:17]</p>

<p>(pause for .06 seconds) But there are plenty of people like about whom I don't actually care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .05 seconds) So—I don't know—it's a little blurry here.</p>

<p>(pause from [00:19:41] to [00:20:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think one thing Jeremy observed about me really early on was that I don't respect rules a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, (pause for .06 seconds) what was—what was going to come up at that point? I think eating in the library; returning library books late; um, staying like 15 minutes past when the library closing bell closed—why do all of these things have to do with the library? (laughs) [00:21:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, (pause for .05 seconds) and then I actually exactly what I'm doing with this health insurance thing, which is like, "Well maybe the patient advocate person will really think I'm great, or really hear me, and see how actually this is an unreasonable policy." Like, sort of ridiculous things like that that I, um, think that I have some chance at changing because of my interpersonal, ah, whatever, skill or charm or just the fact that I'm a person asking another person something. </p>

<p>And Jeremy viewed that as actually being kind of, um, that I was kind of trying to be a rebel or was a rebel and didn't respect the fact that this is the policy and why am I bothering someone about how they should change it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .08 seconds) But I always, like—I don't know—that's just my instinct, to speak to a person and have them like try to reach some kind of personal dynamic over whatever the situation is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And often when you do that, people do change things for you if they have the capacity or if they have the authority. So this is a situation in which I would probably do that, but actually it doesn't really feel like it respects—like actually that's completely against the point in this relationship, at least to me. [00:23:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or it wouldn't work. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I think—yes, I guess a good reason not to ask is that it seems there's no good answer, well not good answer; but you worry that the answer you'd get would be disconcerting either way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, yeah. It's like you would say, "No, sorry," or you would say, "Yeah," and then I would say, "Why?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause for .04 seconds) also I don't want to put you in a weird position, and I think that's a pretty strong thing in my mind too. Okay, like I can put the insurance lady in a weird position -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:24:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .05 seconds) cause like probably she doesn't even have the authority to do anything —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and she's an evil insurance lady.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she's just a lady and she probably just like knows the rules and can tell me either way and can't change them, but I can like ask her—I don't know—I was just asking for clarification in this case.</p>

<p>But you make up the rules so (pause for .07 seconds) ah, and I guess like I know you so I don't want to be a jerk. And I guess I'm satisfied too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like: this is nice and it's okay that it will end. (pause for .10 seconds) Sure I guess I'm feeling pretty complex about this. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suppose so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .04 seconds) But it doesn't feel negative, it just feels uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um, (pause for .57 seconds) I guess, um, (pause for .12 seconds) there's ah something in there that I'm not quite putting my finger on, to do with (pause for .05 seconds)—I mean, you did sort of volunteer why you didn't ask. [00:27:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: which -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I feel very dis-inhibited here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's very little that crosses my mind that I don't share when I'm here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well where I was going was more like; your having volunteered that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: gives us an opportunity to take up, ah, what you're wondering about, worried about, wanting around asking; although there's something about asking itself that seemed too risky. [00:28:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying you shouldn't have asked but I guess there's a worry that I would've, sort of, just responded, like that somehow there wasn't—you wound up making room for the question to kind of just be a question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I was an object or something to look over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But I guess you were worried that if you just asked it if it would kind of turn into an interaction in a way, (pause for .05 seconds) and a scary one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Whereas observing the question feels pretty natural. [00:29:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like I was like wondering all the bike ride like, "Should I ask or should I not ask?" It occurred to me just then that, "Wait a minute—I just said that Dr. Perkins said to ask Ethan," and I don't want to do that. I haven't done it yet and I'm not going to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in a sense it was just me observing it, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: but I could've done with that thought—what I could've done with that thought is just ask but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah. (pause for .25 seconds) So what aren't you putting your finger on? [00:30:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause for .08 seconds) something about ah, (pause for .13 seconds) I guess it's maybe like a worry in a few different ways about me, like whether I would sort of react hurtfully or whether I would feel pushed in a way that I didn't like or that wasn't appropriate. [00:31:09]</p>

<p>Um, (pause for .13 seconds) -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and like what you might think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .07 seconds) Like this is one of those moments where Jeremy would be like, "This is what the rule is and you have to like leave it at that, and don't bother anyone about it." So I think I would feel like I was going against that if I tried to change the rule. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. I'm not aware that there's anything you could say or ask that would be against a rule. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, wait right -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: do I answer or not? Do this, that or the other thing. But —</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing that I would ask is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Ethan, why don't you take the HMO? Why don't you change your whole decision?" And that would be going against, um, you know respect for rules which is something that—or respect for your decision, respect for the fact that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because in my mind, that would be a fine thing for you to ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it would, um, we could learn some things from it about what was going on with you or, you know, a few different things that you wanted from me. [00:33:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I don't have a clear, um, I think I feel pretty mixed about it. On one hand, I do respect just the way that things are and it feels grown-up to do so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To bring back the theme of doing grown-up things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's one of the things, one of the grown-up things I can handle—but on the other hand, I—you know, it seems like it's sort of not in service of mankind to not accept the HMO. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like not in service of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. You know, like, (pause for .09 seconds) um, our interests are in conflict there. [00:34:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop, actually, right now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On that point, I guess. Um, so I'll see you next week on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And if it seems relevant to you—it probably would—I'll let you know before then about, if I can offer some flexibility on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you. [00:34:46]</p>

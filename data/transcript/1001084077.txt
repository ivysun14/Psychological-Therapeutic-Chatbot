<p><b>PT:</b> It's been a while</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, if you're doing well</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm kind of doing well</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just a little</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, back in September, everything lifted, no pain</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No [INAUDIBLE], normal sleep, your mood was good, your appetite and energy were fine, you were not suicidal, you were not helpless or hopeless, your concentration was good, you were getting pleasure, you gained a little weight, then you went off meds for two or three weeks and you relapsed, you got chest pain.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm off it again</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You went off again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think, well I didn't [INAUDIBLE] because I know when you started me it was like small doses and I didn't know, so I've been waiting.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so anyway, you went off, you relapsed, some panicky things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so then I put you back on it, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You did go back on it in September.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how long did you stay on it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was September?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DATE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Three months ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you stayed on it.  Oh, actually it was oh six.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So a year and three months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, it was more than a month, I was like, I've been off for like the last -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's been a long time since -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm like what is thinking, September.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, September oh six, okay, all right, so you've got to fill me in on your life too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Before we do this, how have you been in this year and three months?  What has happened to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh wow, a lot has happened since last September.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So tell me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm a senior now.  I have, well this summer was crazy, I almost didn't become a senior because of grades because I was out last fall, I didn't get any grades for my semester because I had a staph infection, I think I remember telling you about that.  I was in the hospital for a while, three weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That was the year before, that was oh six.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That was that summer.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this was last year, yeah, last fall and then come this year, all those grades hadn't been in so it was like really crazy, I had summer school, I finished up all my classes so I could get all my grades and become a senior because they were telling me I'm not going to be able to graduate, I had like crazy teachers and then like I started to get, I went to work in California for two weeks, finished finals</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you were, and back in September in the context of this, you went back on the Zoloft?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you've been on the Zoloft for three months, six months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, somewhere in between there, I don't remember.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For about six months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so let's say until, through the winter.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, through last Christmas you were doing okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You had no panic attacks?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No depression?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and your life was in disarray a little bit?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, oh, I'd been like crazy, everything, because I'm one of those people when like something happens, something like bad, like bad luck, everything else falls.  I'm one of the people that get a whole lot of bad luck all at once, so like last -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, it's just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're a magnet for it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I am, I really am and then, let's see, so I had like my staph infection, then I was back in the hospital three weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you get a staph infection?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was from a pair of shoes and it was a resistant staph infection, so they were like talking about amputation and everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Really bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was in the hospital for a week and then I was on bed rest for two weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Amputation?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because it was already in my blood stream.  I had red lines wrapping around my whole leg.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so you got cellulitis.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bruises everywhere.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was horrible.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was all puffy and red?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh my foot, yeah, it started, it was right there, I just had a little scrape.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it was, they called it MRSA?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yes, and then they, like they had me on Vancomycin five times a day, they wouldn't let me fall asleep when I was on it, so at like four o'clock in the morning I had a nurse keeping me awake because they were afraid if I'd fall asleep I would go into a coma because the dose was so strong.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then the medication I was on in pill form after that, kind of, one of the side effects was amnesia so I was going back to school, three weeks I had missed right in a row and then I couldn't remember anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it's like.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not a good time to study.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my school is like really struck, it's a private school and I'm going for graphic design so I didn't get to turn in a portfolio which means.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But they've got to realize that you were -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two of my teachers dropped me, they said, excuse or not, three weeks is too much, I feel, for you to catch back on because we're only allowed to miss three classes or we get an F.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They don't mess around.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they really don't, so then I kind of just did my spring year, well, I kept all my incompletes, I didn't have time to fix those because I was trying to stay -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, so you still had exams to take or you had papers to put in</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I had a lot, I had exams, I just kind of left all that alone and I kind of continued, instead of trying to do those three weeks, I mean there's no way you could even catch up in a week because when I was currently trying to do the work for five classes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I just kind of blew all that off and put it on the side and tried to stay focused with what I was doing, then I went home for the winter.  I worked on a lot of homework there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is a year ago?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh, last Christmas and I went home and worked on a lot of homework then and then I started the spring and we don't have a long Christmas break so it's just like a week and a half, so then I did all my spring work and then I had to drop a class in the spring.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So then you came back from home.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You started back into classes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Into my spring year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You left, you tried to push out of your mind all the incompletes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you took all your classes and you got through them?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we're graded on a semester basis so fall semester I had all incompletes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Finished, right, but spring semester.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Spring semester I was back in the hospital because I had appendicitis.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had, it was just like a horrible virus I had and I couldn't eat anything so I was on a liquid diet, everything through an IV.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For how long, how long did that knock you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That was just like twenty four hours but I had missed three days before because I was so sick.  I couldn't even hold down ice cubes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then, so I missed just a week there but I was already like still trying to do stuff from the previous, so I dropped one class because I was working too, so I just had too much on my plate so I dropped one class and then I finished my spring, I had all good grades in my spring and then summer came along, I had a two week break, I went home.  My grandfather got diagnosed with Alzheimer's and that's been really hard on the whole family, we're really close with them and, let's see, what else happened.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so at this point you were trying not to think about the incompletes?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you made it through spring with no problem.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how was your, you had stopped your Zoloft?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> At this point.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was just so busy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How was your mood at that point, were you getting depressed at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little, I think I was just more aggravated; I was just to the point where I felt like I couldn't do it anyway so why try?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any phobias, did any phobias come up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not then -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you percolated along okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Despite -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, despite everything I'd gone through, yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have the boyfriend yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we were just starting so I was really happy then actually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we had just started dating.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Got through the summer</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Got through the summer, me and my best friend who I lived with, my roommate, decided that we weren't going to live together since it was our senior year, we both had thesis and we both had serious boyfriends, so we wanted to, our lease was coming up in September so we had talked about, literally, we didn't talk about this till like July, the end of July we decided, we just kind of, she sprung it on me that, you know, she kind of, she got really weird and started like laying down rules, like house rules, my boyfriend could only come over three times a week and we were good friends so I just kind of, just to keep peace, just kind of went along with it and but we never fought.  We had like a little disagreement here and there but for the most part, it's really hard to live with your friends and we did a really good job at it, so I figured moving, we'd already lived together for two years, it's probably a good point.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So where did you move?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I moved to [DEIDENTIFIED] and since then I've been a wreck.  I live on [DEIDENTIFIED] in between [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your address?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], apartment?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh and then, let's see.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your telephone number the same?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't know my house number.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your cell is not the [DEIDENTIFIED] number?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], and the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's all right, I'll just cross it out here.  Okay, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So then I went to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You moved to the [DEIDENTIFIED], why did you move to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I really like it up there, there's a lot of restaurants.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's nice, neighborly.  I was really tired of the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But where's is your school, on [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, between [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I figured I would only have one more year and basically like I was going to have to get an apartment where, and when I get a job, you know, I'm willing to go wherever in the city.  I didn't want to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Since I was on my last year of school, I was like okay, I'm not going to revolve where I live around where my school is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because it's my last year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can manage it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You want to revolve it around where you want to live.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so you want to live up - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I live by myself now which -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did you find, a studio or one bedroom?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A studio, a studio, a small studio but it's really nice.  It's a brand new, it was just completely gut renovated so everything is brand new in it -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you find it, did you need a broker?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Craig's list but I did use a broker at fifteen percent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much do you pay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 2200, oh no, that's not even the worst of it, let's just say I got subpoenaed and I'm going to court now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been everything from bedbugs to our landlord did everything illegally?  I've never met him so, the last certificate of occupancy was in nineteen forty two.  They started knocking down our foundation.  We have no floor in our basement and we don't even have a buzzer system yet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's really like, they just did everything illegally and with the wrong permits, replaced our boiler without permission.  The city department of buildings came over, they thought our building was collapsed; it was a class A, number one priority building in the city.  They came, took picture, cameras, people, then I wasn't staying there for a while.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going to court against the landlord?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, actually buildings is making us testify against, yeah, the landlord, buildings is suing, the city is suing the landlord.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you still have to pay rent?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, they were making us pay rent, two hundred, we didn't have an electric bill because they hadn't gotten the meters fixed so we were having to pay two hundred each a month for electric.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we were basically paying for the workers and their machines because they're still adding on floor which they didn't get a permit to do that for in a section.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, what a nightmare.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who needs that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they're like knocking out a wall in our basement and the building was built in nineteen hundred.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they're like the building could come falling down because it's just like all these little Mexican guys like working on the buildings but they're great, I love them, they're the best and I have a mice problem, I've probably caught like nineteen already in my apartment.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then like the people above me, they're dishwasher pipes backed up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does your family down in [DEIDENTIFIED] know this?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh my God, my parents would go crazy.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They sent their little girl up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And mom was like [INAUDIBLE], my dad's like where do you [INAUDIBLE].  I found the place [INAUDIBLE] but it's really nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it a one year lease?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I'm allowed to get out because it turns out the lease isn't even legal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I feel like I've been through so much already, why leave now, like the city is going to be on top of them and they're going to have to get everything right, so I figure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you got through the summer.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You moved to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That was really hard because I was finishing finals and I literally had two days to pack my stuff up in my apartment because I was going to California, so I found an apartment the day before I left for California.  I had been looking for two weeks and I finally found one, I go to California.  I come back and I have two days until I had movers come.  My mom was coming up, flying up when I got back from California, get my stuff and move it.  I've spoke to my roommate once since, it's my best friend, she just kind of, I don't know, she's just, she's kind of different but we've still always been best friends and she just never</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Best friends since you got to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh, yeah, we met my freshman year and then we lived together</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That must be upsetting</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's been really upsetting, you know, I don't have a lot of friends as it is in the city, it's kind of hard, and then she was supposed to come see my apartment, you know, I was all psyched, it's my best friend and if she moved out first I would have been so excited to go see her apartment.  She hasn't even seen my apartment.  She said she was going to come see it and then we made plans for a weekend for her to come see it, Sunday night I hadn't heard from her at all and I think she sent me a text message saying like her and her mom were too busy looking for her apartment, she's really sorry they didn't get to see it, she's going to come over that week and her mom is coming back.  Well then I get like a message from one of our mutual friends on line, he like sent me an IM, he was like hey what are you doing, [NAME OTHER] and her mom just left my new apartment in [DEIDENTIFIED] to come see it and I'm like what a liar, you know, I'm like oh that's shady, I just live like across the way, I just live on the [DEIDENTIFIED] because she's on [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm like all right and then I ran into her at school and she's like I'm going to call you tonight, oh my God, I miss you, never heard from her, she never returned my calls.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What a shame.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So yeah, we haven't even talked since.  She hasn't seen my apartment, I haven't seen her new place and we had a lot of issues there because I think I told you I dated a guy in my building and he was like psycho, we had to get the cops involved, then with her because he hated her.  She's dating his identical twin brother.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now, still?  Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're a magnet for drama aren't you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I hate, I hate drama, I'm not a dramatic girl, in relationships I never stay with, like if I date somebody and I know that they like to argue and fight, I'm out before it begins.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So tell me about the current relationship, what's his name?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> His name is [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How old is he?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's [AGE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's he do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He actually graduated from the school I go to but he graduated in oh three.  He does, he's a producer, an independent producer, so it's nice, we're both in the same field but we're not, we don't do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So we help each other out a lot, we kind of work together a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it a good relationship?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we spend a lot of time, I mean we've had our ups and downs, we've had a lot of downs but we're getting over them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why do you have a lot of downs?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He lied to me three times already, like big lies.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did he lie about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Once he lied to me about his ex girlfriend.  Well, in the beginning of our relationship, he had lived with this girl, they were together for like four years and he like lied to me, just like little things, like she called him once and I saw that it was her calling, she called his like cell phone twice and called his house phone and I saw it and we were like ready to go to bed and then I, he said, oh [NAME OTHER] keeps calling me and [NAME OTHER] is his guy friend and I'm like, and then like two days later I was like look, I know that was [NAME OTHER] calling you and then, that was just like a stupid lie and then New Years came around and I flew up from Texas so  I could -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> New Years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Last year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I flew up from Texas so I could spend New Years with him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then after New Years, then his friend came and spent it with us but it was like me and [NAME OTHER] were doing New Years together and his friend came along with us, like I flew up here for New Years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then his ex girlfriend called him and then he was on the phone and he like walked out, he thought I was sleeping and I was, I coincidently like happened to wake up in the middle of his phone conversation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he's like oh I didn't do anything, just hung out, you know, [NAME OTHER] came up and we spent, me and [NAME OTHER] and some friends spent New Years together and I'm like you asshole, like I flew up for him.  He was like, well I just didn't want to hurt her, then literally like a month later she calls and she's dating a guy and she's like we're not allowed to be friends, we can't talk anymore, so that was the end of my problem there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like at least somebody had the guts to do that and then something, I don't know, I guess I was kind of being like overbearing I guess and talking about pictures and he said that he didn't keep any letters.  I found a lot of emails, like one day I was just screwing around and like all these emails popped up and like once I started reading them, I couldn't stop and they were like emails from like her to him, like just stupid things, like he told me they never said I love you till like after a year and there was like email, it was like I can't believe we only been together three months and we're so in love and I'm like why would he lie about all this stuff, so it was like little things like that started happening and then he made a reference.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's all, with all the lies in relation to this -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It used to be and then like another one was he was out with his friends and he was drinking and he told me he was going home, he was in a cab on his way home, then I called back, his friend accidentally answered his phone and I could hear that they were in a club.  I mean, he's not like a shady guy, like he's a really nice guy, he's not a liar, I mean obviously he is because he's lied but he was just an idiot, he's just stupid.  He's really not out to hurt me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like it's your inclination to cut him some slack.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's your inclination to, you know, cut him some slack and, you know, give him room.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well then we broke up and then his mother, of course, said stuff and I think she said that, knowing it's going to effect him, and like she said stuff, like are you leading her on and at this point, we're already saying I love you, we're already in a serious relationship, and she said that to him for Lord knows why and then he starts thinking, I'm like [INAUDIBLE], and all this stuff so then he breaks up with me, tells me he's not in love with me and then three days later talks to his dad who likes me and then was like, I guess I was just looking for answers that don't, that technically maybe they aren't there and I was just thinking am I going to spend a future with you.  I was like you don't have to know these things, like just kind of -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let's wrap it up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a lot of issues there but we're at a good place right now, you know, we work on things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In the last couple months, what's your anxiety level been like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm afraid to sleep at my apartment.  I had a roach.  I have a phobia of roaches, a huge phobia and this is like [INAUDIBLE], she kind of laughs but she's like, I know it's not funny but I've become, my second week to live in my new apartment, and I didn't have, I haven't had a lot of room to breathe like since the whole school thing, I mean I went to summer school literally the week summer school ended, my new fall semester started so like I've been wanting to go home and spend time with my grandfather.  I hear stories about him falling and he's been in and out of the hospital and it's been really hard and it's just like I can't breathe, like I need, I've always had a summer, like four months to like kind of spend and I didn't have that and I think that's really taken a toll on me and, let's see, so my second week living in my apartment, with my building -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This was in September?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, they, no actually August.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I got my apartment [DATE] and just had two apartments for a month and a half and slowly, I don't know, just because it was like there and I wanted it and all this stuff and they gave me like the first months free or something, maybe not, I don't know, and so it was my second week living there, my mom had just left, we got all moved in.  I mean literally it was like I had been living there months -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they had my window cracked because we were running my cable through my window because they didn't have the cable running through the walls yet -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my bed is up against the window and I'm sleeping and I am terrified of roaches, like to the point where, my dad is very afraid of them too or used to be, I don't know, and like if I see, I can't even look at them or I like hyperventilate and have a panic attack and cry and whatever.  I'm sleeping in the middle of the night and my fire escape is right behind my window too and I was always kind of paranoid because there's like no bars and my window wouldn't lock and stuff -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I see, I wake up, something is going across my forehead -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I wake up and I go like this and I'm like so delirious when I wake up and I'm not a morning person at all and I'm like what is that, it's like, it's four thirty in the morning and I'm like what the heck and then I see a shadow and I think that someone is on my fire escape so I'm like oh my God, so I'm going to be really still so I can look, so I start looking and all the sudden I see and the roach is on my pillow right here, so it was all the roach the whole time, so I, I mean -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's gross even for those of us who are not afraid.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This isn't even a little roach, this is the biggest roach I've ever seen in [DEIDENTIFIED], it was like four and a half inches long, it was huge and I automatically can't breath.  I grab my cell phone, I'm at the end of my bed, I don't know why I didn't get off, normally I would scream across the room but I think I was still a little out of it -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then I saw it walking across my pillow, like it's silhouette and stuff, so I freaked out.  I'm literally in my underwear and T shirt on the phone with my boyfriend, wanting to get in a cab like that.  He's like you can't go outside in your underwear, you have to put pants on and I'm like, my, wear I keep all my jeans is right next to my bed so I would have to walk by my bed and I can't do that.  I mean we have flying roaches in Texas and that's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They fly in [DEIDENTIFIED] and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They don't really fly up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I saw on fly in my boyfriends -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It flew up from his trashcan.  They fly, them things fly -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not as much as down in Texas.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they fly at you, you run in circles, they'll fly in circles.  So I'm, at this point, can't breathe, I'm panicking, I've broken out in hives everywhere and he's like trying to calm me down and I finally, and this is like the first day of school, so the next morning, and I grab a pair of slacks from my closet and leave and I can't, like I cannot go in my apartment until I see that it is dead.  Like my parents used to do that, like one time my mom planted a fake, like not fake, it was like she found a dead one in the garage.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because me and my sister weren't sleeping upstairs and she's like oh look, I found it, two weeks later we see it come out again, so I can't sleep at all in my apartment and this has been months and my mom is like this is ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, we're paying for your apartment.  Since this August.  I slept there, regardless, there's also been a lot of stuff going on with my apartment, like mice and I had leakage coming from my ceiling one day, so I mean there's been a lot going on but I can't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So where do you sleep most nights?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My boyfriends but if he's with me, I sleep fine.  If he's at my apartment, I think knowing, and my mom as well, if my mom was there or I had friend come up and she was there, I slept fine but when I'm by myself, I don't know, I don't know what that is.  I'm one of those people that -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's called a phobia.  How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I have an appetite.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you gaining or losing weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I lost 12 pounds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have no idea, I think I've just been stressed.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've been depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, stressed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But have you been depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been a little unhappy lately.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you cry?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I'm very, I have very bad PMS.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How frequently do you cry?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well mostly when I fight with my boyfriend I cry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's normal.  If you do sleep -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But other than that, I don't cry -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When you do get to sleep, do you sleep okay, let's say if you're at his place?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I can sleep till noon, I can sleep till one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your tendency is to oversleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, now I've been oversleeping but I usually go to sleep at like three in the morning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your energy kind of low?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your energy is normal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you exercising?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, never, that hasn't changed, that's still the same.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel suicidal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Life's not worth living?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to concentrate okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your self esteem?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is, you don't feel like you're no good or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to get pleasure normally, enjoy things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you like doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you get, what do you do that gives you pleasure?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Doing graphic design stuff, things like that, like what I do, what I'm going to school for -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You like the work -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It engages you and charges you up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  School work, not so much but when it's something that I'm really, like a project I really like or that I choose or the thought, like when I think about like, you know, getting a job and things like that, I really, you know, I look forward to that -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's exciting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anything else?  Do you watch TV, read.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I watch TV a lot, I'm a big fan of television.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you read at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I read.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anything else for fun?  So you get normal robust pleasure, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get belly laughs and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I play with my dog and joke around with people -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you and your boyfriend have fun times?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're okay, fluid in that way, so you're not generally depressed or flat -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No. For a while there, I think was I was generally unhappy for a while.  I think I had -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When was that, September, October?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I think -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then it lifted?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and things are getting better, like I'm slowly being able to trust him now and things like that have really, I mean literally he's like my best friend too because, you know, after -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you lost your other one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and like I have another good friend named [NAME OTHER] but she, her family is in Jersey so she goes home like every weekend and she's, her boyfriend is her whole life and like in January I'm going to see my best friend from high school.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now remember I gave you the Ativan for as needed anxiety.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you used it at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm afraid, this is going to sound ridiculous, people will scare me, like people, like the whole roach thing, I have not seen one roach in my apartment since.  They have sealed everything.  They drilled a whole in my frame to run the cable through. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's also those electric buzzer things that keep roaches away, did you ever see those?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They don't work and mice too, no, they don't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They don't work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mice go and walk right by it and they do it in front of me, I'm like what are you, people think I'm crazy, people think I'm crazy, I like yell at mice, I 'm like, I like throw things across the room to scare them because they piss me off and like I'll talk to my dog and I have a bag, it looks just like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you had experts come in and see you lit up and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If you want to call them experts.  They builder refused to get experts for two weeks and then we had bedbugs and then they finally had to get a certified exterminator in there to do it and I don't know, they, I mean, and then we have flood lights and I'm afraid that maybe they're coming from, I'm afraid that maybe they're coming from the flood lights and there's one right above my bed -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what kind of, with holes in it -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it's, and then like my kitchen was not sealed up good at all and they sealed that all up -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't leave food out or anything -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't and then I have an overflow like drain in between my toilet and my tub, it's in the back, I've duct taped that thing, it was so scary in there, I don't care, crazy or not crazy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're hermetic, you're hermetically sealed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like for a while I used to like plug stop the drains.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, and you've not seen a roach since -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's legitimate to suspect that there are no roaches there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I can't do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't let it go.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I sleep with a flashlight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or with the lights on which I used to not be able to fall asleep unless it was pitch black.  I have not slept once in pitch black by myself at all. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And why won't you use the Ativan?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm afraid that if I use the Ativan and there's a roach, I'm not going to wake up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it'll crawl inside.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then I read an article in the [DEIDENTIFIED] about them going into your ears and stuff, so half the time I sleep like this, I do, I sleep with something, like a blanket or something over my ears, I'm like a freak.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is totally nuts, this is really nuts.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I can't help it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to, we've got to get you out of this thing, this is no good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My mom is like maybe you need to switch apartments, like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm like, I don't want to [INAUDIBLE] and that gets me more upset.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, we need to fix your brain, we need to fix your brain, your brain is not in a good place right now and you can't stay this way.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Hello?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is someone out there?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who, where?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm downstairs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hold on.  Yeah, hi -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Hi, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's all right.  Come around this way.  Usually we have a secretary but we're, we're waiting for them to show.  What's your name?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [NAME OTHER].  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're welcome.  Sorry.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you're not, listen, there's the new kind of medicine where a patient gets to do everything and then there's the old kind of medicine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Where I like pet them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's old medicine where you just do what the doctor says -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You just have to do what I say.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just do what I say and we'll get you better, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There was a roach yesterday and then the other thing I want to talk about, I tell you, they're after me.  That same day, I go home, I go to [NAME OTHER]'s house in between classes because I'm not going to my apartment and finally I call my super and I'm like look, somebody needs to be at the building and go [INAUDIBLE].  My apartment is not big at all, I will not go there until I know that this roach is gone, I want to see it and he's like okay, no problem, my landlord, my super, I mean, and he laughs at me.  I love my super, so they were already working on the building anyway.  So I get on the bus to go uptown and I'm sitting there, it's like packed and I feel something on my leg and I'm like what the hell and I think it's a mosquito.  I'm sitting there and I feel it.  Finally I go like this and it is a roach, a little one and it runs off and I freak out.  People look at me and I'm like there was a roach and all the girls are freaking out and I'm like I'm sorry, the only reason I'm like this is because I woke up this morning at four o'clock and a big roach crawled across my forehead and they're like oh my God, they're like go to the front of the bus, you don't need to be back here with these roaches, you've had a hard day and then I literally got home, I didn't even walk in my door, I wouldn't even unlock it -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Enough, enough, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get worked up about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to be driving yourself crazy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I am -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're definitely driving your boyfriend crazy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're going to lose it if you don't wrap it tighter.  This is not you at your best.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to just act as if, we know you have this crazy phobia, you've got to act as if you don't, you've got to just play act as if you don't.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I don't talk about it ever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But what I'm going to do for you and you have to take my medicine, you have to, okay, so during the day we'll put you on an SSRI, Zoloft or Prozac, or Paxil.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Whichever one you want and what that's going to do, it's going to raise the threshold for this anxious state, so it's, you're still going to be a nut about, about the roaches but not as much, it's going to take some of the juice out of this -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Can I get hypnotized where I just get over it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's one way.  Let's first do this and then if this doesn't work as well as we need it to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's lots of psychotherapies because this is, phobias actually aren't that hard to cure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're not that hard to cure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been like this my whole life.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They have virtual reality and I mean, have you heard of virtual reality.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Something like they put you in a room with them or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, they put you in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you pretend that you're in a room.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, you can see, I mean they have them and you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I can't do that, with roaches.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but they're not in there, you know, it's a computer generated image.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Still, I think I would probably die.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You probably would.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd have a heart attack.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But what they do is they teach you to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Be calm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Reduce your anxious response and if you can reduce that anxious response and not escape.  See, what the phobia makes you do is escape the stimulus.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you escape, if you run away from it, you strengthen the phobia, you make it more intense.  If you can stay with the feared stimulus and not escape, calm yourself down without escaping, it goes away, the phobia goes away.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't even look at them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know, well, you do a one to ten and a one would be being in the same building that a roach is in and a ten would be having a roach crawling on your face -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had that.  Of all the people, it happened to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know and it's a shame.  I don't have much.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two roaches in one day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would be grossed out by that and I don't -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My dad, is it genetics, my grandmother told me my dad -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He used to, like my mom's mom and my dad used to spend the night over there when he would work all the time and he would call and make my mom go in the bathroom and look all around the bathroom before he would go in, in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, I know you think you won't wake up if there's a roach, I promise you, you will, no matter how much medicine we give you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your system is so wired, so, you know, fight or flight reaction.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you heard of that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's so adrenergic charged up that there's no amount of sedative we can give you that would make you sleep through it, so don't worry about it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But take your antianxiety medicine every night.  Do you have Ativan still?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have a prescription [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] just wrote me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You must take it every night and which antidepressant are you on, it doesn't matter which?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess Zoloft since I have some.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to use Zoloft?  We can try a different one, maybe something else will work better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to try something different?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's try Lexapro.  Have you heard of Lexapro?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's kind of the hot new one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, there we go.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's kind of, you know, and I can give you a bunch of it and we'll get you going.  You'll be much, you won't be cured.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The only way to cure is through behavior therapy but you can at least ninety percent better.  I'm going for ninety percent better. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And with the mice, I save their lives, I get the glue traps, seriously, I take the glue traps outside and I put oil on it, baby oil and then I get a glass of water and I rinse them off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You free them, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do, I'm a nut, what can I say, I like [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Here's the plan, number one, every, she gave you Ativan?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Every night, Ativan.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anywhere from 0.5 to 2 mg, somewhere in that range.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's only an eight hour drug so you won't be groggy in the morning, it'll be fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I need it for tomorrow, I'm flying.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And under tongue, that's you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Under tongue if in panic, okay, that would be during the day, if you're in a panic state, put it under your tongue, it'll dissolve, boom.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's gone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I knew that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you done it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Number two is Lexapro 10 mg times one week, then 20 mg.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Other than that, school is doing great now.  I'm going home, I have a long break, they gave me an extra week, or everyone an extra week on the break.  I'm excited.  My boyfriend is coming Saturday.  I'm going to see plenty of roaches in Texas, I just know it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're going down tomorrow?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This will help you sleep on the plane, you know, the Ativan will help you sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, I can't even think about when I was on Ativan ever since I've been seeing you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a lifesaver.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It really is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For people with anxiety disorders it's, you know, a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It really is.  Once I get on the plane, I used to like, like couldn't breathe, like my whole chest would like just get tight every time I hit turbulence or take off, I'd just sit there and get all hot and now I'm like oh -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They have great virtual reality for flying phobias too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm fine with the Ativan.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because I tried it out, I don't have it but I have a friend who does the virtual, so you put it on and you see the ground crew, you feel, and the chair starts to shake as if you're on a plane.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well now I can watch, like now I look out the window.  I used to refuse to sit on window seats and now I like look out and I'm like, I'm at such an ease that even if the plane did crash I feel like I would be in a nice state of mind, I'd be like okay, well, you know, this sucks, whatever, like it really makes me at that ease where I would be okay with anything happening.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't sign those two X's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let's get to work.  I saw you on November 8th.  That's when you said your mood had lifted.  You were, uh, still, mood has lifted some, still having mood, getting overwhelmed, helpless, sad, some crying, lots of anxiety, irritable, self esteem okay, kinda low, appetite good, gaining weight, 5 pounds [INAUDIBLE].  We felt you were not in good shape and we increased the Vivactil. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You think that helped?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We started Vivactil that was the first time on Vivactil.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're aware that adding a tricyclic to an MAOI inhibitor is very dangerous, but we do it slowly, carefully, and looks like you've been fine with it.  Right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Usually they teach us that you're allowed to go the other direction, so I think I explained this the last time.  You're supposed to start with the Vivactil and then add the MAO, but getting you off the Parnate, waiting 2weeks, starting Vivactil, and then starting Parnate would have been ridiculous.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You wouldn't have been able to do it.  So a lot of us kind of cheat a little bit and we slowly, slowly, slowly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that the one that we went from 5mg to 20mg?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Vivactil, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That I had increased, we increased it gradually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Very slowly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you think it's helped?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think every other week you did it, 1 a week, something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Normally you go 10mg and then a few days later 20.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But in this case we did 5 -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 5 </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And inched our way up to 20.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So and do you think at each increment you started feeling a little bit better?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That's good news.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm feeling good, yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So your mood lifted fully?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Yknow, someone who's already on that much Parnate, there aren't that many options.  I don't want to make you feel bad.  How was Christmas?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Christmas was good.  I, uh, think I, uh, wore myself down, yknow, with the, I was anticipating just, yknow, I, I can't look at the whole picture.  Remember, once you told me that.  Don't look at the whole picture.  Take one thing at a time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get knocked on.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I got my cards written and then I wrapped gifts and I was really busy.  And, uh, every year I say I'm not going to do this, yknow, what I do with my family.  Yknow, last year was the only year I didn't buy a hundred gifts 'cause we took them to Disneyworld.  And next year we're going to do something similar.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's a nicer gift, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Than spending a thousand dollars on nonspecifics.  Things they could have bought for themselves really, yknow.  But just in one area I kind of feel I get very, very sad and feel like I'm not dealing with it as well as I was.  Um, yknow, since [NAME OTHER] had his prostate surgery, he's basically impotent, and I can live with it most of the time and then sometimes I feel like it interferes with our life.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Has he tried Viagra?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's tried everything.  See, don't forget, he had stomach surgery.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, ah, let's get back on track.  It's her sense that her mood has lifted some.  Do you agree?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> A little bit.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just a little bit?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right, little bit more than a little.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, when I, when I saw her last time she was really very heavy, she was, yknow, dragging.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's much better than that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's better than that.  She's not all the way there, but she's better than that.  When did you hit the 20 of Vivactil?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um, I'd say 2 weeks ago.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And we only had 5s so I gave her 4 of those.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Have you seen an improvement at each increase of the Vivactil?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I would say yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So Vivactil seems to be working?  As I was explaining, it's very complicated to use it with the Parnate, but in this slow way, we can get away with cheating on the rules.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, all right.  So your mood has lifted with the Vivactil.  How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sleeping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Has your self esteem left?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is?  You feel guilty?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just once in a while when I get in this mood with [NAME OTHER], yknow, about our sexual problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you guys fight about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We don't fight about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you're upset about the lack of sexual intimacy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I thought I can, I think I can handle the lack of sexual activity, but it's like he's drawn away from in a, um, personal, um, encounter that we had with each other.  We were always very close, always hugging and kissing, and now I think he stays away from me.  That's my feeling.  Not to arouse me or, yknow.  I think it has to do with -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause that puts too much pressure on if you get aroused?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But there's plenty one can do without strong erection.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you done those things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, do you have sexual activity without focusing -</p>
<p><b>PY:</b> On occasion.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On erectile function?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On occasion, yeah, on occasion, right?  [NAME OTHER] doesn't like to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I can talk about it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it as upsetting to you as it is to her?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I would say probably.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you're more stiff upper lip, uh, you don't really want to go there.  But, ah, is what she's saying true, that you, ah, push her away a little bit 'cause you don't want to have to deal with what might happen?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's what she perceives.  I don't feel as if I'm doing that.  Um, many times I won't be as, ah, as intimate as she'd like as far as lovey dovey goes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you were always like that or are you not like that now more?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm saying I was never wholly, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was never your style?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we had more of a relationship that I find we're quieter now.  We're not as close as we were.  And that bothers me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you think, you think that reduction in physical intimacy has, has made your emotional intimacy a little low?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do you agree or not?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I agree on her part, yeah. Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, now that it's out there on the table why don't you guys, ah, yknow, try to, yknow, now that it can be acknowledged.  And maybe you're even doing it unconsciously without realizing you're doing it.  Maybe it's 'cause there are levels and levels and levels she makes, yknow, any kind of even nice overture and you're already going uh-oh, if this keeps going then, yknow, it'll wind up in an uncomfortable -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I attempt to make an overture and then she puts a, yknow, proviso on it, why can't you do this first or why do I have to do, rather than just starting and getting amorous and leaving it at that without saying -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> What we hadn't done in the past.  Yknow, all of a sudden you're ready to get active and all of a sudden there's, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have to forget the past.  You really do.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nerves have been cut, nerves have been cut, right?  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you have surgery related erectile problems.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And have you talked to the urologist about implants and I mean all of the?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  I would have no problem with it, but I think she would have a problem with it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> With you getting implant?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just one more surgery he'd have to undergo.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But it's not a major surgery.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That would be up to, he would have to decide that on his own.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you don't want to be responsible.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen, up until then, those are great surgeries, by the way, but up until that point, tomorrow, there are things, yknow, a man can ejaculate without an erection, right?  You know that, right?  People can have intimacy such as people who know and love each other as long as you've guys known and love each other, there can be plenty of intimacy, but what the sex therapists tell us is you cannot focus on the penis.  You've got to just ignore it and have sexual intimacy no matter what happens.  And if you can both agree to kind of bracket erections and [INAUDIBLE] things can be fine.  And there are other ways for you to have an orgasm, there are ways for him to have an orgasm.  You don't have to be so focused.  If you focus on him getting an erection and it's a setup for disappointment, right?  And if you have enough disappointments, it's almost traumatizes to the man.  Right?  It's not a good feeling.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Especially when you used to have good capacity and has lost capacity it's really very tough.  So you can't go there.  You can't focus on it.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Agreed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Agreed.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I agree.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you both tend to agree to those ground rules then there's nothing stopping you from any level of intimacy and caressing and, and  orgasm.  There's nothing, nothing that should stop you, except of course medication makes it hard to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Besides that, yknow, Viagra, all that, didn't work?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Tried every everything, nothing worked.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you had no erection?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, in the beginning, believe it or not, when, after I first had the operation, uh, yknow, some of these things would assist, even at one point I had been part of a research project - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Study. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, and that was utilizing a needle into the penis.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Well, that works.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And that worked.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b>  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But now it doesn't work.  It's like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's unusual that that doesn't work.  You've been back to the urologist?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so what did he say about it not working?  You don't know what he said?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But the next step is an implant.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  They said, yeah, it'd be unique, it'd be different, but it wouldn't bother me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We just thought that he'd been through enough. [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He has but this would be a vote in kind of in favor of your relationship and your intimacy as he would go, he would go through this -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the 2 of you.  I, yknow, I see it as a good sign.  It's very routine stuff.  It's not - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not dangerous.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess it's something we could talk about.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Talk about it [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I know him.  He's a good guy.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He's excellent.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know his wife.  His wife's great.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes, yes, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nice people.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Nice family.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He was wonderful when [NAME OTHER] had his surgery he would call us at home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We developed a nice relationship.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was the wife there, does she work with him anymore?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  But they do wonderful work.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he took this position in [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They were well thought of.  Yknow, that's my research, by the way, is ah -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the Viagra and the erectile dysfunction.  Has someone checked your testosterone level?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um, not lately.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One reason why the, ah, the Viagra and those things wouldn't work, and if it's low, we get success using it together -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b>  Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Giving people testosterone along with Viagra, so at least before we go that next step, at least let someone check your -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Testosterone level.  Do you get any erection in the morning; do you wake up with any erection?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um, you mean when I have to urinate, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Waking up in the morning?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Some days more than others.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they could check that, but I wouldn't, um, be against moving along, though, 'cause you have each other, you value your sex life, and here -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We always had a very, very good relationship, sexually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, so that should allow you then to have a decent sex life without focus on the penis.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It really should.  There's plenty you can do sexually and erotically without having to go there.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, he can ejaculate without an erection, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I didn't know that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Why doesn't she know that?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I can't.  When you say ejaculate.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's soft, soft.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm thinking of um [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no, but it'll come out.  You'll have an orgasm.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't have any prostate.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, you won't get the fluid.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, no, the only thing you'll get is, you won't get the fluid but you'll get, I mean an orgasm.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah. An orgasm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, an orgasm without an erection.  And so there's, and they get a semi-erection, so there's, there's things to do that could be gratifying to both of you, especially it sounds like this is something that's on your mind, right?  This is something that's bothering you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it bothers me, yeah.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At the beginning, yknow, over the years I think it's become more so now as we've gotten older and, yknow, you think how many.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Probably the last year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, in the last year or so I'm thinking a problem more on my part, yknow.  But I think a step that we can take is also go to the urologist together.  We've never done that, yknow, so that she can, she'd be able to help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that okay with you?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She lets you come to her shrink.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So but you guys really, I agree with you, it's important to both of you that you have each other, and everything else, yknow, it fails, you have each other and you have this intimacy and you don't have to give up on this intimacy.  I think you're right to fight for this intimacy because if you let him decide he'd let it, yknow -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Go away, not 'cause he wants to it's just, it's just -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But just it's, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just one less thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's just easier to just let it go away.  I think you're good to fight for this.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To fight for this.  All right, let's talk about your mental health though.  Your appetite and sleep are fine now.  You're not suicidal in any way?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel helpless or hopeless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, just, yknow, it's so hard for me to like do a whole thing like prepare a whole meal.  I'll try to make salad, set the table, but I can't do everything.  And I don't know why I can't reach that point where I can do the whole thing.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You're getting overwhelmed, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm overwhelmed.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's always been this way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it doesn't make sense.  You know people outside of you know you're very capable and resourceful and you can do everything.  And yet, yet she's a classic case of being one's own worst enemy, right?  Hm. You think you can't do things that you really can.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Even if I'm shopping, I could be, yknow, in the food store shopping and it's like all of a sudden I've had enough.  I get this feeling where that's it, I have to get out of here, I can't do any more.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's a feeling that comes from within me.  It absorbs me, yknow, it, it paralyzes me almost.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Almost like a -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> An anxiety attack.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, it's like an anxiety attack.  It's like a seizure sort of, it's like an emotional getting into a tizzy.  An internal tizzy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you have to just, but, yknow, you adapt to it by setting limits, finishing what you're doing, and getting out of the situation.  That's the best you could do.  I don't know that you'd be better off to, ah, to be miserable to continue doing what you're doing.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  And I don't know if it relates to your mood problem either.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You just always seem to, now you've always had this, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean, yknow, I raised three children basically.  I traveled a lot and I was always good, right, [NAME OTHER], with entertaining and -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> In the beginning, yeah.  We're talking about the last 10, 12 years now.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I started in my depression.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Close to15 years.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] little bit, it makes you less, um, capable.  It's one of the worst parts of depression.  It's just, yknow -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I did great this Christmas.  Usually [NAME OTHER] helps me with the Christmas cards.  This year he didn't.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, she managed.  My job was strictly putting the stamps on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't even have to lick them anymore.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, putting stamps on and sealing them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He used to help me write them.  I did all the wrapping.  I did, yknow, all the shopping a lot of times.  He would have to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have everyone over to your place for dinner?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I had -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah we did. Christmas day. [INAUDIBLE].Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Thanksgiving.  But I did have friends, I had 16 people over with [NAME OTHER] and what he could do and what I could do, and we entertained a nice party.  I haven't done that in a while.  So that's encouraging.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so your mood had been lifting already by then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So things started to get better soon after starting the Vivactil?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I would say.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It, it moved you in the right direction?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's actually at it's, there's seasonal related depression that's at its worst at Christmas, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The days' the very shortest.  Yknow, there's a light sets off depression.  The short days set off depression.  So we would have anticipated it getting worse -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Through Christmas, but it sounds like you turned it around.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you need more Vivactil?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think for now maybe we can just stay on this -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Stay on this dose?  What's your energy level like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think my energy level is better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well Vivactil should give a bit of a jumpstart.  Are you exercising?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's where I'm; I've got to get into some kind of exercise.  In fact, the therapist yesterday, I go to therapy 3 times a week 'cause of my legs, and I'm going to have the injections in my back on Friday 'cause my legs are so bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are they injecting, what are they injecting?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, cortisone.  And then if the cortisone takes, if the pain is alleviated by the cortisone, then they go in and they burn off the end of that nerve.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have shooting pains down your leg?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> What is the cortisone's mixture?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, the cortisone and novocaine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They know the medicines you're on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They bring a list with me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the Parnate especially, just tell them, this, you can't take; there are certain things they cannot give you -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because of the MAO inhibitor.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, epinephrine, sometimes they use epinephrine in some of the shots, they can't use it.  But have them check everything.  Just look it up online -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where it interacts with the Parnate.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's probably not a big deal because, um, it doesn't get into your system as much.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're just putting it into the joint -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Into the space, so it's not a very big concern.  But whoever's administering anything should be aware, don't let this scare you, but just in, in settings where if you have to go under, if they have to do anything, everyone should be aware of what you're taking.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not going to happen, but just make sure they're aware.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And they can call me if there's any questions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, all right, so do we like the Topamax?  Have we gotten anything from it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, am I on Topamax?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We, uh -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I thought we stopped the Topamax.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I thought we restarted it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I used to take at night with the Abilify?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's the one for um, for ah -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Diet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For diet, to reduce appetite.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, you put her on this other thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The Glucophage.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The Glucophage, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you take that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You think its helping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit.  I don't think it's -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She takes it twice a day, morning and night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now I started the Vivactil in, no, in September.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Vivactil.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Like one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, the little pills.  Then only last in November we raised -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I think you said use it 1 for 2 weeks, 2 for 2 weeks, 3 for 3 weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  But she did start it in September, right?  It could have been, I have here very low dose in -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, just the one pill.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In September, but then we push it u in November to 20.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, gradually pushed it up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And 20 seems a decent dose now?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, but I only have the 5s.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, well, I think you're getting the 10s.  But the Topamax we stopped last time and we traded for Glucophage.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's increased, I mean, could that be increased?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your dose now?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I know its 1 pill.  I don't know the exact dose.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can take one and a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One and a half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, see if it works better.  I mean, have you been checking your weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't lost any?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I fluctuate, I fluctuate 2 pounds up, 2 pounds down, 2 pounds up, 2 pounds down.  I've been watching what I eat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you think we're getting something from Glucophage or no?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't really think so to be honest with you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You would see more of a, after 2 months, yknow, 2 pounds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See more of a weight loss?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's the medication I'm on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It could be.  Yknow, all these medicines could, actually the Vivactil could. I mean at some point we want to back off on all the stuff 'cause losing weight's important - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, it's a part of your back problem.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So probably exercising is -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is better.  The therapist yesterday said not to get a treadmill, to do the bicycle. I have to bicycle [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why, why a bicycle rather than a treadmill?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because she said of my back, you tend to bend walking on the treadmill.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You lean forward, you tend to lean forward.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, putting a lot of pressure on my legs which wouldn't be good right now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think a treadmill's the easiest thing to do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  We were going to go out and buy one.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I find when I go to the gym, 20 minutes of cardiovascular much easier on my body than a bike then the treadmill.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think both, I can't tell a difference.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> With me of course there's the oxygen level in the legs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> From the heart.  That's what causes them pain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's what I found.  Yknow, the treadmill, which is what I try to tell her, you getting pains in your legs, normally the treadmill is going to be more of a, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, we have the bike [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We don't have a bike.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Even 5 minutes, 5 minutes, watching TV, and then go up to 6.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's set up right in the bedroom.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just like you, I hate exercise.  It took me forever just to, the bare minimum, but you've gotta do something.  We all do. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And especially you're now having trouble from it, right?  Your back pain -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Will be so much better without, and probably your energy level too - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Would be improved.  So try one and a half of the Glucophage, </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But probably we're not going to make much headway until we get you off some of these medicines.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do find that my cravings aren't as, I can control my craving better and I don't eat as much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the Glucophage will stabilize your blood sugar so that probably should affect some of your craving.  The Abilify 10, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it seems to be the right medicine for you, 110 on the Parnate, um, 40 twice a day of the Ritalin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Long acting right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 800, 400, 400 on the Neurontin, </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And 20 of Vivactil.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now when I go for this procedure Friday I'm going early in the morning, like 7:30, I shouldn't take any of my medication that morning, right, until I come home?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, correct.  Yeah, don't take any of it.  When are you getting home?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They said it's about an hour procedure and then.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You need prescriptions?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The, ah, Ritalin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ritalin?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah. An the Vivactil.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the Vivactil at the bigger dose?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  And the Ritalin, yknow, 1 for this month and 1 for next month.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I so wish we could get you off some of this stuff.  When we try you crash.  Yknow, we've kind of proved every piece of this content, we really we've tried to get rid of each one of them.  And within a week you call me saying something's off.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, even one time we said, all right, even we know you're going to call and say something's off, tolerate it anyway, but even then we couldn't do it, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, last month you gave me, um, some 5 mg of the Abili, Abilify, right, try them because -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You mean reducing them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Try to reduce it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Can I do that, maybe do 1 night 10mg and 1 night 5?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you do on off, right, that 5, 10, 5, 10 'cause that's essentially going to 7.5.  If things go okay, then do all 5s.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  We'll trickle down, yknow, I don't want you on Abilify for forever.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I really don't.  I don't want on any med forever.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you've got to live a life, right, you've got to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, you need to be a wife, a mother, I mean, you need to engage on the weekends, pleasure, have some energy, yknow, you can't, we can't leave you -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't, yknow, the times [INAUDIBLE] anything, I mean, it's, I can't even imagine being off the [INAUDIBLE], living in hell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's what life was like before we started all this stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She was really, she was -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't get out of bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were non-functional.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] used to give me a bath.  And all Dr., all he kept doing is, he would try one of the new medicines, then switch to another new medicine, I would see him, I'm seeing him at what 2 or 3 times a month.  I mean, I was completely [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's tough.  I have a few people like you. Yknow, some people just have bad luck.  They get such a rip roaring version of this condition.  Most people come in with mild, yknow, sad, you want to give them Prozac and they're fine. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The doctors differ based on what side of the room they're on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to tell you as a patient.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The interest is, your interest level is way beyond this.  I mean it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, I, I don't know, yknow, I'm sure there are good people on that side of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sure there are, but I went to a few of them and [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You went to 3 of them.  Finally, we're lucky we found you.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We got [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen, uh, it's a delight to treat you, but I'm still frustrated I can't get you off these medicines.  Yeah, usually you get people on them, they get better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, when I feel like this, I feel like, yeah, I could start [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well let's try this. Lt's see how you make out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's try this, let's try the Abilify first.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Maybe one less [INAUDIBLE] next time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Go to 10, and [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  The last ones, the ones you can stay on forever are Ritalin, yknow, things, yknow, energy stuff, but hey you can stay on it.  It's these other ones that might cause you some weight gain and some potential problems we'd like to.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Neurontin. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow your head's above water.  You're being a good wife, a good mother, you're getting pleasure from your life, yknow, you're in the game.  You're in the game despite being on a million meds and having gained the weight from them, you're in the game, so mostly things are okay.  Uh, Ritalin 40, long acting, 2 a day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) At first, I was just thinking about, uhm, seeing Dr. BBB today, and I think I'd, well, I'd been looking forward to going since last time.  And I, I guess I'd hoped he'd tell me something more specific, like, you'll go into labor at such and such a time.  And I also hoped he'd say it would be very soon.  Because I, I was just feeling, I think I felt sort of, I don't know, disappointed, even though everything he said was good, and that he, he said I was still the same and everything.  I was ready, and, and, every thing seemed to be just the way it should be.  And, I mean, he indicated no problems.  But he also said it could be anytime from now until several weeks.  And I, I think that's where I was disappointed, because I kept hoping he'd well, I don't know, I think I — I think maybe what I want is to — well it almost seems like, m—, even before you cancelled, I was thinking about wanting to go into labor sometime the end of this week.  But now it seems like I connect it with that, too, as if I want to go into labor before, right around the time when you won't be here. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well how so?  Why is that?  Why do you think? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, I don't know, I mean this sort of, (Sigh) well it seems like I, I'd had the feeling of I'd be doing something special, so I wouldn't miss not coming, or something like that.  (Sniff, Pause) B—, w—, well, it's not really that, either.  It's more that I don't, I don't know if I've imagined what I think you'll be doing, but you'll be doing something else, in any case, something special, in the sense that you weren't going to be here.  And, uhm, so I suppose in that way, then I'd be feeling, well, I'm doing something special, too.  And, (Sniff) as if having a baby would be a way to get my mind off it, or something like that.  (Sigh) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: What would I be doing? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, somehow I'm not sure if this is really what I'm well, I feel as if I'm not going to let myself think anything else.  But, what comes to my mind is what I would be doing if I were going somewhere over Thanksgiving.  And that would be, you'd be with your family, going somewhere.  I mean, I don't, i, it's sort of uh, uh, uh, I mean, any other time I guess I would imagine you were going on a business kind of thing, a conference or something like that.  And this time I don't.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>But then I, it just, I just start thinking that (Sigh) well, no matter what I could imagine, even if I started imagining things the way I did when you weren't here in the fall, and I began imagining your having a new wife and being home making love to her, and all that.  In a way, I think sometimes when I sort of just think in terms of well, you're on a business trip or something, as if that's going to make it better.  But really the, it seems like, no matter what I think, the feeling I have is that I'm not part of it.  I'm being left out.  And so in a way, it doesn't seem, I mean, I won't let myself think other things, usually.  But in a way, it doesn't seem to matter.  I still have the same feeling.  (Sniff, 3-minute silence)</p> 
 
<p>It seems so odd that, I, I, I, I, don't know if I was thinking anything more, except just sort of feeling left out.  And then, the next thought I'm aware of having was thinking about part of an orange that's at home.  That MSCZ's been, had used over the weekend for a drink that he made.  And, I was just thinking, I'd like to eat the rest of the orange.  But then I was thinking, well maybe MSCZ will want it.  Sometimes after he has made a drink that he gets something special like an orange, then he'll keep having a little of it during the week.  And so I, I don't know why I'd think about eating an orange.  (Sniff) </p>
 
<p>I mean, I wouldn't be so g—, I remember once before, I thought of something I was surprised at.  I wouldn't have been surprised at thinking about food, but it seems surprising what I, what food I thought of.  And I don't remember what it was.  But th, that's the feeling I have now.  (Pause, Sniff) The only other thing I'm wondering about when I want food, is, is, it often is either food that (Clears throat), I mean, it's kind of forbidden food in the sense that it's fattening and not nutritious.  So, it's something that one would not eat very much of, or very often.  And, and uh, I was just thinking that at this point in the year, I don't usually buy oranges.  And actually, I don't buy them that much anyway.  And then the fact that MSCZ might still want this orange, makes it sort of special and something that maybe I can't have.  And I'm wondering if that's why I thought of it.  (Sniff, Pause) </p>
 
<p>And then I thought of, uhm, last night I had 2 dreams that I'm aware of.  And the second one I had is, is more vague now.  And actually, the first one's vaguer than it was when I first woke up.  Because, I mean it sticks in my mind because it involves something to do with, uhm, shooting, that makes me think that at some point I had a dream similar to this, where I was go—, uh, uh, except I think this one's a little different.  But in any case, I don't remember why there was shooting and, and except that at some point, I stepped out for whoever in the dream I identified with.  And just sort of stood in view of everyone, and, and shot at whoever was the enemy.  And then the dream sort of kept having, fluctuating on the ending, but it seemed pretty clear that I was going to be shot, myself.  (Sniff) And somehow I had the feeling that I stepped out to shoot s,, so somebody else wouldn't; so some man wouldn't. </p>
 
<p>And — but then when I woke up, what struck me was, uhm, I had to get up to go to the bathroom, and I had — the dream just sort of lingered.  And even though I knew there'd be nobody in the living room, which you have to pass through to get to the bathroom.  I still had this feeling that I was ki—, getting up and leaving the bed.  I was going out to face something and it might be dangerous, or something like that.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And then in the second dream, I can't remember the details of it, but I think uhm, th—, well, I was just sort of struck at the difference between the two.  Because I think in that one, uh, th, there was another man again, and I don't know whether I just was feeling an attraction for him and felt there was hope of it being returned, or something.  Or whether there was actually a relationship between us, but it w—, but it was that kind of a thing, rather than (Clears throat), I don't know, a more violent one, like the first one had been.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>I don't know, I was (Clears throat) just wondering, because it's, more details about the 2 dreams than seem to come to my mind.  But then, I was just wondering well, what did yesterday possibly have to do with it?  And for a minute I couldn't remember yesterday.  But then I remembered it was, I was thinking mostly about how I felt about the baby over the weekend, and how I felt about my mother when she was pregnant, or at least I think she was.  And must have had a connection.  And (Clears throat) I don't know, I just had this feeling that, that, the first dream of shooting and then being shot at, had something to do with my way of being defensive and yet feeling very vulnerable.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, what danger do you feel you are facing, or having to face?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, what comes to my mind immediately is something that I haven't really thought about.  And it, in a way it's puzzling, because it's my baby.  But, I don't know, it almost seems like maybe I'm feeling the danger is that the baby is going to replace me.  And well I have, I, I know I have worried about that sometimes, connected with MSCZ.  I haven't lately, but (Clears throat) I don't know, now it seems to be more vague than just with MSCZ.  It just seems sort of, I won't be important and the baby will be, is really it.  And yet i—, i—, the feeling is not at all, this is my child.  It's simply that it's almost like I'm a sibling with it, and the baby's going to replace me.  (3-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>And I was (Clears throat) just sort of thinking about what I just said, in connection with the feeling I had over the weekend of wanting to hurt the baby.  And sort of well, I don't know, in a way I think it was almost, rip it out of me.  And there was no feeling that I'd be hurting myself, or that I had any connection with it, or uhm, I don't know, I mean, it seems as if the baby were completely separate and the cause of something.  Even, I don't know if I were thinking it was actually sort of maliciously doing something, but it was still to blame. </p>

<p>And (Sniff) I don't know, it, it, well I don't know why it disturbs me, but in feeling that way, feeling so separate and (Clears throat) well, and then competitive with it.  But I keep thinking at other times, I feel not at all separate.  I mean, I, I feel as if i—, I'm one person and the baby's something else.  But I don't feel separate.  And I enjoy the feeling of, I mean I can feel the baby, feel the baby's back and the baby's bottom, and the baby's legs a little bit.  And I uhm, imagine it being born and holding it, and that type of thing.  And its, I don't know whether I imagine it as some kind of a toy or if I am really just feeling like a mother.  But I, well I don't know, maybe it's disturbing me because I think these other feelings are so unmotherly.  (3-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Well I stopped, because I was, I, I wasn't sure, maybe I'm feeling a who—, several ways about this.  But, I was about to say, and then I was, it seemed I was feeling so unmotherly toward the baby.  And then my next thought was, and what does that mean I'll want to do to it, or how will I be as a mother?  Or, won't I be able to be a mother?  And, if I have these feelings which would make it very difficult, anyway, and would make it sort of a — I wouldn't be a mother in the way I want to be, in any case.  I could maybe do the things physically, so the baby was alright.  But, I wouldn't be feeling the way I wanted.  And I don't know, but then sometimes, or, or, just the fear of this feeling sometimes of wanting to hurt the baby, being so resentful, maybe I'd, well I'm sure I'd do something psychologically.  And I'm not sure if I might not even do something physically to hurt the baby.  And that seems sort of a horrible thought. </p>
 
<p>But then, I don't know, beyond that, it seems like, I mean, that's still being concerned about the baby.  And (stomach growls) another feeling I have, is that I don't want to be concerned about the baby.  I just want to be concerned about myself.  And that part of this feeling is the baby is making things worse for me.  So I don't want it to be there.  (Silence)</p>

<p> <p>ANALYST: It occurs to me now, that there's also a question of why you feel uhm,  you want to keep these things to yourself, here.  Why do you want to think them silently? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I've had a feeling today. It's been, I, I, have found it hard to say any of these things and (Clears throat) I haven't had the feeling it's hard because I don't want you to know, so much as somehow it's been hard for me to co—, almost concentrate enough so that I can put it into words.  And I, I just have the feeling that what I want to do is not put it into words.  And then maybe it will go away, or something like that.  And, and, then I can get on to thinking about other things, or so— (Clears throat, Pause) </p>
 
<p>Because uh, th, then this came to my mind too, and it must have something to do with it, (Clears throat) that even though I'm coming here for 3 days out of 5 this week, I still have had, I think, this feeling (Clears throat) of it being a very short week.  And then there's going to be an abrupt change, in, in that I won't be coming, and you won't be here.  And I don't quite feel that way if I've cancelled.  So it must be because you have said you won't be here, and so I suppose I'm wondering if maybe I'm sort of trying to prepare myself for not coming, by not thinking things ahead, or something like that.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:  Well, that sort of comes back, doesn't it, to your, this feeling that you are going to be left out?  That you're going to be replaced, that you're all alone, that you're losing something who's very important to you.  And you blame it on the baby.  You've been talking about a number of things that seem to me to indicate, that that was indeed the very way you felt uhm, at the time your mother was pregnant with MLWZ.  You're curious about what's in the closet; curious about your father's penis.  And what does he do with his penis, and what must be the connection between that and your mother having the baby?  Was there any connection?  How did she get the baby?  And how close they were, how you see yourself sort of in the dark hallway, looking at the closed door, shut out, all alone, away from the three of them.  And you're describing some feelings that sound very much like that, now. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, that's what I keep finding.  I hadn't thought of it quite the way you've put it, but I mean it's still essentially what keeps troubling me.  That maybe I'm being too rational about it, but I keep thinking that I'm one of the ones that's part of it this time.  Because I'm the one with the baby.  And, and I still do feel this way.  (Pause) Well, it just makes me think again of what I said (Clears throat), I guess yesterday, (Clears throat) when I connected the feeling toward the baby that I had over the weekend, with your cancelling and (Sniff) saying the baby didn't do what I had wanted it to do.  And I'd hoped or maybe thought that having a baby would do. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Which is what? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Make me feel part of things, or somehow, not feel left out, anyway, and threatened and (Sigh, Pause) alone, I guess.  (Pause) And, and I also think of (Clears throat) not only am I the one carrying the baby and yet I can, I still feel these feelings that do seem similar to when I was small and maybe even felt them about FNA, I don't know.  But, MSCZ's been, I mean he couldn't be nicer.  I mean, he hasn't really changed that much, but on the other hand, I couldn't ask for more.  And I, I, I, it almost feels like if he were my father I'd be perfectly delighted.  Although, now I don't think, I mean, it's one of those things where now if my father were acting like that, I wouldn't want it, I don't think.  But, I mean, the fact that MSCZ's being the way he is, doesn't seem to mean anything to me.  I mean, it does sometimes, but I can still feel this way.  I guess that's what I mean.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>And I suppose another feeling that comes with feeling the baby has disappointed me, and that I can feel this way, even though now I'm finally pregnant and had anticipated that everything would change, or something like that.  I mean, that I can still feel afraid and alone and left out.  And then, I f—, I, I, I think over the weekend I was feeling, I mean, there seemed to be several levels of my feeling.  And one was just sort of an irrational and wanting to hurt the baby.  Another was feeling disappointed that it wasn't doing what I wanted, and now I was stuck with it.  There was no escape.  And now I was going to have the responsibility, the unpleasant side of the responsibility of having a child that didn't answer what I wanted.  And (Sigh) I suppose then that leaves the question too, that if the baby didn't do it, which I'd always thought it would, what will?  Or will anything?</p> 
 
<p>And (Sniff, Stomach growls, Pause) I just, I mean this is part of what I said earlier.  I just thought again about the first dream, when I was standing in the doorway shooting first.  And then, eventually being shot and thinking it wa—, and connecting it with my feeling so defensive and — defensive because I was feeling really very vulnerable.  And it just made me think of how I used to so often pick fights with my father, first.  I mean he would always get the best of me, because he was my father and bigger and stronger, and everything.  But, still I would start a lot of fights. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Of course, there was another time, you know, when you were in the doorway.  And using a stick that could have been to shoot something, and then getting shot with it.  Meaning, as though you were using the stick to make yourself pregnant, but instead it injured you.  (Pause)  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: What that makes me think is that, I ask, really and it makes me think of a question (Clears throat), was it possible I didn't think I was going to be hurt, doing what I did?  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up. </p>

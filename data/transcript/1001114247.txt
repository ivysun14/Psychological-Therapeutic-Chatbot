<P>Cognitive behavioral therapy with children builds on behavioral therapy techniques while working to modify a child’s thoughts and feelings. In this session, Dr. Masek adapts his therapy model to a mother-child dyad, helping Mom learn strategies for managing her young daughter’s back talk and tantrums. Dr. Masek conducts a focused behavioral assessment to identify the issues that have sparked the young girl’s negative acting out.</P>

<P>Dr. Bruce Masek: First off, let me say thank you, Mom and Nicole, for coming today. I guess you’re going to get to stay up a little bit later tonight, huh? Yeah. Cool, huh? Well, what time’s your bedtime?</P>

<P>Nicole: Nine.</P>

<P>Masek: Nine! That’s pretty good. How’d you get that out of Mom? Nine o’clock, huh? Well, we’ll have to talk about that. All right. So you know what we’re going to do today?</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: Nicole.</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: We’re going to talk about some things that are going on at home that maybe aren’t such good things.</P>

<P>Nicole: At school?</P>

<P>Masek: Well, maybe school, too. But we’re also, I want to also hear about things that are going on at home and at school that are good things. I want to hear some things that maybe aren’t so good. That’s kind of why you came. But also, let’s talk about some of the good things you’re doing, too. Okay?</P>

<P>Nicole: Right now?</P>

<P>Masek: Well, we’ll start. I’ll tell you what we’re going to start with.</P>

<P>If it’s all right with you, I’m going to ask Mom about some of those things maybe at home that aren’t so good. That we could fix. Okay? Do you know what Mom might be talking about?</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: What kinds of problems are we having at home? Or would you prefer Mom tell us?</P>

<P>Nicole: I want her to do it.</P>

<P>Masek: Her? Your mom? Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: Okay. Well, Nicole is very rebellious. She…</P>

<P>Masek: Do you know what that means?</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: Rebellious.</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: You don’t know what that means. Mom will explain. Go ahead, Mom.</P>

<P>Mom: When she’s asked to do something or when she knows she needs to get something done, she avoids doing it. There’s always "But this, but this…"</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, so she offers excuses instead of just ignoring you?</P>

<P>Mom: Right. Right. At least I—</P>

<P>Masek: Or does she do both?</P>

<P>Mom: She’ll do both.</P>

<P>Usually she starts out ignoring me and then there’s usually an explanation why she can’t brush her teeth yet, why she can’t go to bed, why she can’t get ready for school. Then she usually ends up being late for school or not going to school at all because she’s too late.</P>

<P>We have tried the, I’ve tried the "1-2-3," you know, like 1… If I get to number 3, this is what’s going to happen.</P>

<P>Masek: You read the book, I presume.</P>

<P>Mom: Yes, I have. It’s a good book, and it worked, worked well with my son.</P>

<P>Masek: Temperaments can be different amongst kids.</P>

<P>Mom: Yes, I’m finding that out.</P>

<P>Masek: So what works for one doesn’t sometimes work for the other. Okay. But I’m glad you read, read and, you know, keep trying, so. All right, so you tried that.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. And she’s very bossy. If she doesn’t…</P>

<P>Masek: To who?</P>

<P>Mom: To everyone.</P>

<P>Masek: Anybody she can boss. Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. Right. If she doesn’t get her way, then she’ll do the "wah-wah." We call it the "wah-wah," where she does outburst of crying.</P>

<P>Masek: Could I hear a little "wah-wah?"</P>

<P>No. You don’t want to give me a good "wah-wah?" All right.</P>

<P>Mom: And it’s very, it’s very ear-piercing, and then it gets very frustrating for me because I’m, okay, I’m at my last, you know, I don’t know what to do next. I’m stuck, and usually she ends up winning. And then, like I said, she usually doesn’t go to school or, you know, I end up upset.</P>

<P>Masek: When Nicole doesn’t go to school, what are the consequences for you? Is it, would that, are you working during the day?</P>

<P>Mom: Yes.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay, so now what do we do?</P>

<P>Mom: Okay, that’s… Okay, Nicole’s with my parents. I drop them off.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. All right, so…</P>

<P>Mom: So then she’s giving my parents a hard time, and then they call me at work, and then I have to try to talk her into going into school.</P>

<P>Masek: School. But you’re already at work, and you really are handicapped. It’s like at least one hand tied behind your back because you’re at work.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. So I want to nip this ahead of time.</P>

<P>Masek: So she’s got, yeah, she’s got it by the tail right now.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. And then when she gets home from school, it’s a big fight for her to get her settled down.</P>

<P>Get her to eat her snack and start doing her homework. It’s a constant battle, and then she’s gets mad and she’ll throw things and throw a fit. And she was very good. Now she just started doing this since her brother’s come out of therapy. Her brother’s in therapy, too.</P>

<P>Masek: Do you know what your brother is in therapy for?</P>

<P>Nicole: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Masek: What kinds of things was your brother doing?</P>

<P>Nicole: Doing bad stuff.</P>

<P>Masek: Bad stuff. Is some of the stuff that he was doing, some of the stuff you’re doing? Oh. So you admit, huh?</P>

<P>Nicole: He’s hit me.</P>

<P>Masek: And do you hit him back? Okay. Was your brother refusing to cooperate with Mom and help her at times? Are you doing some of that, too? Was your brother sometimes not, refusing to go to school? Not wanting to go to school?</P>

<P>Nicole: Sometimes.</P>

<P>Masek: Sometimes.</P>

<P>Nicole: When he’s at school, he comes home.</P>

<P>Masek: So he was getting in trouble at school?</P>
<P><BR>Nicole: Yeah, he throws up.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, he threw up. Because he was sick or because he has a talent? I’m just teasing. Does he, does he, was he sick at school? Was he getting sick? Was he? Was he?</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. There’s, there’s a lot of construction going on at their school right now.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, really.</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. The fumes…</P>

<P>Masek: So are they renovating an old building?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Mom: Well, actually, they’re soundproofing the school because of the airport, and so they had all the windows out and all the, they had the air-to-air air conditioning.</P>

<P>Masek: Which airport are we talking about?</P>

<P>Mom: Midway Airport.</P>

<P>Masek: Midway, okay.</P>

<P>Nicole: And there’s paint.</P>

<P>Masek: I grew up, I grew up here.</P>

<P>Mom: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Masek: West, 20 miles west of Chicago.</P>

<P>Mom: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Nicole: And it smells like paint, and that’s how you get sick.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, okay. Yeah, that isn’t a pretty smell. Are you in that same school? Does the smell bother you? You’re stronger?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: With smells at least? So it’s Nicole’s turn. After being your saintly little daughter.</P>

<P>Mom: Mm-hmm. And it’s harder to deal with her because everything that worked with him is not working with her. So I feel like I’m starting over again.</P>
<P><BR>Masek: It’s also emotionally draining. You worked so hard with your son to get him to a better place. Thought you could just kind of coast a little bit, and then, yeah.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah, I thought this would be easy. It would be [inaudible].</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. That’s the tough part for parents. It can happen many different ways. A common way is when one of the, your son or daughter, is sick medically with some chronic illness. The other siblings seem to rally and be wonderful as you go back and forth to the hospital and all kinds of tests, and then suddenly, when things look like they’re getting better and there’s stability in the illness, boom. This isn’t much different is it?</P>

<P>Mom: No.</P>

<P>Masek: From that situation? No. No. So what are we going to do about this?</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: First off …</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: … tell me some good things that are going on at home. Give me something good that’s going on at home.</P>

<P>Nicole: Sometimes I’m good.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. What do you do to be good?</P>

<P>Nicole: Plays with my brother.</P>

<P>Masek: You lay with your brother. You talk with him and…</P>

<P>Nicole: …play with him.</P>

<P>Masek: And play with him. And do you—I’m sorry. Yeah, so you play with him and you play nicely with each other? I mean, there are no arguments? Oh, that’s very nice.</P>

<P>Nicole: Josh comes over, there’s our… We get to be bad again.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, okay. So sometimes it can be really good, you and your brother playing together, but maybe not with Josh there.</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>

<P>Nicole: Matt’s cry—Matt’s friend’s across the street.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. I figured he must live somewhere in the neighborhood. Okay.</P>

<P>I bet sometimes you’re a good listener at home. When Mom tells you to do something, you do do it? Give me an example of something where you were a good listener.</P>

<P>Nicole: I do my homework.</P>

<P>Masek: And are we getting our homework done? Is she getting it done?</P>

<P>Mom: Well, sometimes she’s fine. But probably 90 percent. It’s a struggle.</P>

<P>Masek: Do you have any idea what’s up with that 10 percent that she’s fine? Do you, is it, can you tell when she comes home from school that it’s going to be fine? Does she give you any clues that there’s, she’s okay, in a good mood, I guess. Or…</P>

<P>Mom: Just a different willingness. She’ll come home and she’ll just, "Okay, let’s do the homework." Or…</P>

<P>Masek: So she sort of comes home with a bounce in her step or…</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: But you just never know when that’s going to happen.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>
<P><BR>Mom: Exactly. And then there’s times where I’ll be doing chores around the house, and she’ll want to join in. You know, I mean, so she is, you know, there are times when she’s very helpful and I don’t even have to ask her.</P>

<P>Masek: Things with your son are better.</P>

<P>Mom: Yes.</P>

<P>Masek: But are you still having to put a lot of time in with him?</P>

<P>Mom: Yes.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. Is it possible that she’s still feeling the effects of that attention differential?</P>

<P>Mom: I think that’s what it is.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: Because I did notice—he’s in Cub Scouts now, and she’s in Brownies—and I do notice, like if I have to do something with him, you know, with the Cub Scouts, she wants to get involved. And so I’ve been trying to get her involved with doing things with the Cub Scouts, but there are certain times where girls aren’t allowed.</P>

<P>Masek: Right.</P>

<P>Mom: So that’s where it gets a little hard and vice versa. When I have to do something with her, he gets angry. So I’m trying to…</P>

<P>Masek: You’re trapped right now. Right. Yeah. And it’s…</P>
<P><BR>Mom: Right. But I try to give, you know, equal time and we do things together, you know, like us three together, you know, and…</P>

<P>Masek: There are just so many hours in the day, though.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: And you’re working full time.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: And I suppose the equivalent of Cub Scouts would be Brownies, but is she too young still?</P>

<P>Mom: She’s in Brownies.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, she’s in Brownies. Okay. All right.</P>

<P>Mom: But there’s a lot more involvement with the Cub Scouts. I’m a den mother for the Cub Scouts, too, so there’s a lot of time.</P>


<P>I do, she is at our meetings every week but, unfortunately, I have to focus with the boys at that time.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. On the Cubs. Is it okay that Mom’s a den mother? Is that okay? No, it’s not? Why? What’s wrong with that? Tell me about it.</P>

<P>Nicole: I don’t want her to.</P>

<P>Masek: Really? You don’t like all the kids coming over, all those Cub Scouts coming over? Okay. Did you ever tell Mom that before? Has she mentioned that to you?</P>

<P>Mom: No.</P>

<P>Masek: That’s interesting. Do you think it, does it make Matt happy that Mom’s a den mother? I think it’s a wonderful thing Mom’s doing. It’s hard for adults to give up that kind of time. It’s wonderful, but you don’t particularly like it. Would you want Mom to be a—What’s the equivalent? I have two sons. Brownie Mom?</P>

<P>Mom: I think it’s like a leader, like a …</P>

<P>Masek: A Brownie leader. Yeah.</P>

<P>Mom: … a Brownie leader.</P>

<P>Masek: Would you want Mom to be a Brownie leader instead? Oh, okay. So it would be okay for her to be a Brownie leader for you but not a den mother for Matt? Or should we just have Mom get no sleep and she could be both?</P>

<P>Nicole: Both.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. Okay. So we got that one settled. We’ll just, Mom, you’ll just give up sleep for now. Yes. Yeah. No problem.</P>

<P>Bedtime is 9:00, huh? Are you sure about that?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: What time do you think it should be? I can tell you I know what time it should be for you.</P>

<P>Nicole: Nine.</P>

<P>Masek: You’re not going to like what I’m going to say.</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: It should be 8:00. You need a lot of sleep. Nicole, you really do. My guess is if it’s 9:00, it can drag out to later.</P>

<P>Mom: Oh, yeah. She’s Miss Insomnia Queen.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah, okay.</P>

<P>Mom: It’s hard for her to settle down.</P>

<P>Masek: Is this new? Or has this always been the case?</P>

<P>Mom: It’s pretty much always been the case with her. My son, also.</P>

<P>Masek: So it is…I might take that back. It’s possible she has different sleep requirements, although it’s difficult for a parent to accommodate that because there’s a certain time of the night where you need your peace and quiet, your space. And if you’ve got her running around, "So, Mom, what are we going to do next?" Yeah, it’s, it’s exasperating.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah, and she won’t go to sleep alone, either.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay, so how, what is…What is the sleep arrangement?</P>

<P>Mom: I have, usually I either have to sleep with her or I have to sit with her until she falls asleep.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: She’s afraid of the dark, she says. So I have a nightlight on for her, and that’s not enough. So I left like a fan on for her so she has a little noise; that’s still not enough. She says she’s afraid. And I don’t know why. There’s no reason to be afraid.</P>

<P>Masek: What, what…Do you sleep in your own room?</P>

<P>No. You’re sleeping with Mom.</P>

<P>Nicole: I sleep with Matthew or Mom.</P>

<P>Mom: She’s got to have someone with her whether it be her brother or me.</P>

<P>Masek: So what’s, if it’s in the room with her brother, what is the, a bunk bed arrangement or what?</P>

<P>Mom: There’s two separate beds.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. Does this noise and light bother Matthew? Or is he one of these that he’s dead to the world inside of…</P>

<P>Mom: No. He’s dead to the world.</P>
<P><BR>Masek: Oh, that’s, thank goodness for that.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: And he goes to sleep on time, between 8:00 and 8:30, and that’s every day, even on the weekends.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>

<P>Mom: And he gets plenty of rest.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay.</P>

<P>Nicole: Yesterday, I went right to sleep at 8:00.</P>

<P>Masek: You went right to sleep at 8:00. That’s unusual, though.</P>

<P>Mom: Very unusual. She actually fell asleep on the way here. See, she don’t get enough sleep. She’s…And I think that’s a lot of her problem with her irritability and the way she acts, too, is she’s not getting enough rest.</P>

<P>Masek: You’re probably right, although it’s hard to know exactly how it comes out as mood changes in kids, but there’s no question. I mean, I think as a culture we don’t get enough sleep. It’s what’s being suggested to us at least by studies and public health policy, but I don’t think kids do get enough sleep. And you could be right: irritability for her.</P>

<P>Plus, Nicole wants some more of Mom’s attention because—she wasn’t keeping score consciously—but somewhere subconsciously she was keeping account of how much attention you had to give Matt, particularly through his hard times, the very hardest of times. And so she’s looking for you to even the score, and it’s not practical, and there’s no real way to do it, so I think some of this behavior is coming out as well.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Then you also have your parents mixed in. And I bet you, between you and your parents, she doesn’t get a consistent message.</P>

<P>Mom: I agree with that, yeah. Because I know I deal with her differently than they do. They’re a little more easy going with her, so she knows what she can get, what strings to pull to get away with over there.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. That’s a common situation, by the way.</P>

<P>Mom: I think she does it, like you said, because I was giving Matthew more attention, she’ll purposely do that in the morning so my mom will have to call me. "Oh, she’ll call Mom. Mom will get my attention then." That’s what I’m starting to think because she never, I mean, all last year, not a problem with school at all, then all of the sudden, Matthew’s better now and everything’s going smoothly, then all of a sudden she don’t want to go to school.</P>

<P>Masek: When, Nicole, when you’re in school, is it an okay place to be? Do you like it? Like your teacher? What’s his or her name?</P>

<P>Nicole: Miss Collin.</P>

<P>Masek: Miss Collin. And she’s an okay person? Okay. And you’ve got some friends at school?</P>

<P>So it’s an okay place to be? And you’re learning stuff, probably learning to read now. Do you read already? Are you learning? And writing letters and numbers? Good stuff.</P>

<P>Okay. So it’s not like we’re consciously avoiding this place, you know, as being, but for some reason in the morning, she just maybe could be just real tired. Also knows that Mom—Grandma and Grandpa are a soft touch. Or at least they put up a front in the beginning but are easily blown over. All right.</P>

<P>And you know, like a lot of kids even though they like school, it’s pretty comfortable here. So why not just hang here?</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. How many days of school did we miss so far this year? Do you have any idea?</P>

<P>Mom: Just two.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay, that’s good.</P>

<P>Mom: But I, but it’s, it’s, it’s an everyday fight. I’m just very concerned.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah, you’re worried that it could, yeah, yeah. It could really become a pattern.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: But yeah, certainly the school’s not calling and saying, "Where is she?"</P>

<P>Mom: Right. No.</P>

<P>Masek: But we need to prevent that from happening, that’s for sure.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: No, that’s a realistic concern. And what about her sleep? You’re doing some, you know, the afraid thing is…could be borne of all kinds of things. Are, do you ever think about what you’re afraid of, Nicole? Are you sure you’re afraid?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: You’re sure.</P>

<P>Nicole: Afraid of the dark.</P>

<P>Masek: The dark. But Mom said she’s got a nightlight. Right? So there’s some, there’s some light in the room. What’s, what’s, what’s in the dark? If you’re in the dark, suppose the lights went off right now here and the three of us had to sit here in the dark, would there be anything to be afraid of?</P>

<P>Nicole: We’ll be scared.</P>

<P>Masek: It would be scary, you think? It’d be kind of a shock if they suddenly went off, in the beginning.</P>

<P>Whoops. I’ll get that.</P>

<P>But, then what if we just all quietly kept talking? Do you think we’d be afraid for very long after? If we just sat here and talked even though it was the dark? We’d be wondering when the lights might come on, but… Okay. So you’re afraid of the dark. Are you afraid of anything else? How about big hairy dogs? Do you like dogs? What’s your favorite animal?</P>

<P>Nicole: Cats</P>

<P>Masek: Cats. Cats.</P>

<P>Nicole: I like the whole animals. I like all the animals.</P>

<P>Masek: You like all animals. Do you know what kind of a doctor takes care of animals?</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: Have you ever heard this term, veterinarian, a vet? Yeah. A vet. A vet takes care of animals. Maybe you could be a vet someday.</P>

<P>Nicole: We have a cat and now he’s gone.</P>

<P>Masek: What happened to the cat?</P>

<P>Mom: Well, it was a stray cat. And…</P>

<P>Masek: It came by for a visit.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. I’m allergic, so I said, "Well, let’s keep him in the garage." And then he stayed for about three days and disappeared.</P>

<P>Masek: He moved on. There’s lots of cats like that. They just go to families for awhile, get fed, get taken care of and they move on. Mom’s allergic to cats, but you weren’t allergic? You didn’t sneeze and your eyes get all watery or anything? But Mom’s did, huh?</P>

<P>Mom: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Masek: Mm-hmm. Have you known that? You’ve been allergic, that you’ve been…</P>

<P>Mom: Oh, yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Your whole life?</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Is it just, is it cats, dogs? Is it fur?</P>

<P>Mom: Cats and horses.</P>

<P>Masek: Oh, okay. So it’s the dander, probably, huh?</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Nicole: I’m allergic to dogs.</P>

<P>Masek: You’re allergic to dogs, huh? Is your brother allergic to anything?</P>

<P>Mom: He’s allergic to cats.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. So gee willikers, what kind of pet could we have at home?</P>

<P>Mom: Well, we have a dog, and we have a gerbil.</P>

<P>Nicole: And a mouse.</P>

<P>Mom: A mouse. Gerbil.</P>

<P>Masek: A gerbil. So if you’re allergic to dogs, how is it that you can have a dog at home?</P>

<P>Nicole: I’m allergic to his fur.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. But you can’t… What’s his name?</P>

<P>Nicole: Lucy.</P>

<P>Masek: He’s she. Lucy?</P>

<P>Nicole: Lucy.</P>

<P>Mom: Lucy.</P>

<P>Masek: Lucy. It’s a she.</P>

<P>Nicole: And Shadow died.</P>

<P>Mom: That’s Grandma’s dog.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. So let me ask you something, Nicole, when you’ve been a bad girl… You know something? There’s no such thing as a bad girl.</P>

<P>Nicole: Why?</P>

<P>Masek: Good question. There are no bad girls and bad boys. Sometimes you do some bad things, not nice things. But you’re not a bad girl. Did you know that? You’re a good girl who sometimes doesn’t do the right thing. Or nice things. Or even occasionally do some bad things. When you have done some bad things, what does Mom do?</P>

<P>Nicole: She, she, she yells at me.</P>

<P>Masek: Yells at you. And do you stop doing that stuff? Do you? Okay. And when you’re doing good things, nice things, and Mom’s around, what does she do?</P>

<P>Nicole: She sits on the couch.</P>

<P>Mom: Well, usually when she’s drawing her pictures, I have to sit and watch. And then she, I get a collection of pictures like within an hour, she’ll draw like 10 or 15, and we rate them on a scale of "excellent" or "beautiful."</P>

<P>Masek: So in other words, Mom tells you that you do some nice things. When you do nice things, she said, probably says, "Nicole, this is beautiful. This is excellent. This is..." What’s that say?</P>

<P>Mom: Beautiful.</P>

<P>Masek: Beautiful.</P>

<P>She tells you when you’re doing good things, doing a good job. And reminds you that you’re a good girl, right?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Do you ever tell Mom that she’s a good mom? Do you?</P>

<P>Mom: She does.</P>

<P>Masek: What do you say?</P>

<P>Nicole: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Mom: You usually call me "Princess."</P>

<P>Masek: Because, because Mom has been, done something really good. Extra special good. Like what? What would be something that Mom would do that you would call her Princess for her?</P>

<P>Nicole: Because I love her.</P>

<P>Masek: Because you love her. Of course, you love her. Mom loves you. But she probably did something that would get you to call her Princess. What could she do? Would she make you your favorite meal or favorite dessert or something? Would that mean, mean you might call her Princess?</P>

<P>Or would she do something special for you? Buy a special…</P>

<P>Nicole: Toy.</P>

<P>Masek: I love that sweatshirt. I like that. Did your mom buy that for you?</P>

<P>Nicole: No.</P>

<P>Masek: Who bought it for you?</P>

<P>Nicole: My grandma, and this is her grandma’s shirt and she gave it to me.</P>

<P>Masek: But when Mom helps you do something, is that when she might be called Princess?</P>

<P>Nicole: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. Now when Matt is a good brother, when he’s being a good brother, what do you say to him? Do you ever say, "Gee, Matt, you’re, you’re a good brother."</P>

<P>Nicole: I play with him.</P>

<P>Masek: You play with him. That’s your way of showing him that you love him. Uh-oh. Did I just say something? You love your brother? Good. You looked a little funny there for a second.</P>

<P>All right. So what do you think we can do to get back to that nice place we were last year?</P>

<P>It sounds to me like you and Mom were in a very nice place last year. You got along really well.</P>

<P>Nicole: Wisconsin Dells.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay, let’s, let’s all head up there right now. The Wisconsin Dells. I vaguely remember that, growing up as a kid here. All right.</P>

<P>Now, I’m talking about when you two were really getting along well, helping each other, and you were cooperating with Mom and, while she was, really had to work very hard to help Matt out. Why…don’t you want to go back to that nice time when you two were just getting along so much better? You don’t want to go back to that? What do you want to do?</P>

<P>Nicole: I want to go back… I don’t know.</P>

<P>Masek: You don’t know.</P>

<P>Well, that’s a good answer. Yeah, it’s not clear what it is we have to do here. We’ve still got some work to do with Matt. I mean, we’re seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, but we’re not out of there.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. And this was sort of unexpected, so more than likely, you were just, maybe even going into panic mode, thinking, "Wait a minute. Here’s my rock, my stability, and what’s she doing to me?"</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. Right. That’s exactly what it was. She was kind of like a peace of mind for me when I’d come home from all this. I could talk to, you know, her and I can, we always, we still can, we’re like best buds, you know. But she was always willing to share information with me, and I just wish it was that way again. But she’s…</P>

<P>Masek: It’s a good thought. Is it possible that when you, you know, which was okay as a parent, leaning a little bit on Nicole to help you diffuse your mind from Matt, that that communication is not as frequent or as concentrated as it was or as emotional as it was, and maybe she’s missing some of that. Sort of, yeah.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. That’s…</P>

<P>Masek: Did you like to sit down and talk with Mom at times? Have those nice chats? You miss those? No? Would you like to have another one? Let me ask it a different way. Would you like to have a nice, would you like to have a little chat with Mom every day? Talk about things that are happening at school and that are happening at Mom’s job? And, I guess, Matt wouldn’t be around for those, would he? It would just be special time for you and Mom. That would be nice, wouldn’t it?</P>

<P>Nicole: He plays his PlayStation.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. There is a, there is…</P>

<P>Mom: We used to, her and I used to go out to the restaurant together. We’d have our private day together, and we haven’t had one of those in a long time. Well, I mean…</P>

<P>Masek: Well, there’s my first prescription, is you two need to arrange a private day like that, a nice restaurant trip. Don’t you think that would be nice? You tell, I bet you miss that. Wouldn’t it be nice to go and do that again? Yeah.</P>

<P>Maybe just getting back to some of the basics that actually worked. I don’t necessarily see this system as broken and needing fixing. I just think you got a little derailed a bit, but the system is up and running. Just got to get up, back on the tracks a bit.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: And sometimes that happens. There’s a letdown with parents when they’re going through a hard time with one of their children, there’s this letdown when you get a little bit, a little bit better. Or maybe a lot better, then the letdown can be bigger, actually, in that situation. And you sort of rock back and you forget that you had other things going …</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: … that were very important.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: A possibility. That’s…</P>

<P>Mom: And I didn’t even think that would have bothered her, but, and now that she mentioned it…</P>

<P>Masek: At her age, lunch with Mom could be, could have meant the moon.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. ‘Cause I know it would have meant a lot, you know…</P>

<P>Masek: So you’re bound and determined—I’m sorry to interrupt—you’re bound and determined… Do me a favor: don’t eat this, okay?</P>

<P>Nicole: I’m not.</P>

<P>Masek: It probably did mean a lot to her. You’re absolutely right.</P>

<P>Nicole: Why don’t you keep it off?</P>

<P>Masek: I don’t know. You know why? I think it does something to make the sound smoother when it goes into the microphone.</P>

<P>So listen, I just fixed up something for you. Did you hear what I, I did? You didn’t hear? Mom, Mom picked up on it right away.</P>

<P>Mom: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Masek: You know, you’ve got a smart mom. You’re pretty lucky. She picked up on it right away.</P>

<P>There was these times you used to, you and Mom used to go out together, and you haven’t done that in a long time. Mom, Mom’s thinking you ought to do it again. I think it’s a great idea. See what happens when you can just talk for a little bit? You can figure out things.</P>

<P>Now what can you figure out to help Mom out? You can play with Matt, and play nice with him. That certainly helps. You can do your homework. You can do that. Come home in a good—</P>

<P>Nicole: I help her clean.</P>

<P>Masek: I love to hear that. I love to hear that. Because cleaning the house is hard work. That’s terrific of you. Helping clean. You play with Matt and keep him happy. Plus, it’s probably fun, too, when it goes nice, doesn’t it?</P>

<P>Then you can come home and get that homework done. You know what way, if you get it done right away you have time to draw pictures. Probably have time to read some more stories. I don’t know how we’re going to do this bedtime thing. I haven’t quite got a beat on that. I wonder if Nicole is one of these youngsters temperamentally who just requires less sleep. There isn’t, you know…</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: The great American dream is that, you know, youngsters from ages about 5 to 10 should be getting 11 or 12 hours of sleep a night. I think that’s more myth than reality, in truth, but that’s the wisdom, right? But she probably is not one of those people anyway, and her sleep requirement is something less, but it doesn’t tend to fit in with what time you have. So ultimately, down the road, when I am working with families, I suggest that we try to program …</P>

<P>… the youngster who truly, biologically needs less sleep to be able to take care of themselves at a point in the night, and as long as they’re doing quiet activities on their own, allowing the rest of the family to do their thing—hey. You can’t fight Mother Nature. You know, they’re, they’re not sleepy. They’re not tired. You can’t force sleep. We know that for sure, but at least they’re doing something, quiet activities, non-arousing and non-intrusive.</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: She’s a little young but I mean that I think that it’s possible. She may be one of those youngsters just born to be a… an eight or eight-hour max, or nine hour, but she needs a solid nine hours and then she doesn’t wake up so irritable.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. Once she’s asleep, she stays asleep. So we don’t have arousals in the, at night?</P>

<P>Mom: No. No. Not at all.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. Okay. Now what determines whether Nicole is in your bed or sleeping in her own bed?</P>

<P>Mom: Well, she always, she always sleeps in her bed. I don’t let her in my bed.</P>

<P>Masek: Good.</P>

<P>Mom: That’s one rule I have.</P>

<P>Masek: Excellent. Excellent. That’s an important rule, right? Everybody sleeps the best in their own beds. It’s the healthiest way to sleep.</P>

<P>Nicole: Sometimes I sleep by my mom but in the floor.</P>

<P>Masek: So then the rule is if she brings a blanket and a pillow…</P>

<P>Mom: Right.</P>

<P>Masek: Phew, that can’t be comfortable.</P>

<P>Mom: Or we’ll sleep on the couches downstairs. She’ll get one couch. I’ll get the other.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. The best place is for everybody to be in their beds. That’s when your body gets the best rest. Okay. So it really is a problem of getting her comfortable, settled in.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. Once she’s asleep, though, she’s fine. And once she feels comfortable, like if I’m there or her brother—sometimes her brother’s not good enough in the same room. It’s got to be Mom or…</P>

<P>Nicole: She puts the TV on.</P>

<P>Masek: You know what we may be able to cultivate in Nicole is when she’s reading, gets to be reading, that could be her way to provide herself with a little company and self-soothing and comforting, is read and let it take her... And probably TV… I would steer clear of that as a soporific, a sleep-inducer, because it can, you know, the way TV runs, it can just as easily trigger an adrenaline release in her, and she doesn’t need it.</P>

<P>Mom: No. She doesn’t.</P>

<P>Masek: So a fan. Noise, yeah, white noise is good. And it, it certainly is, lots of kids, I mean, right now you can get white noise generators for under $20 because it’s such a common problem these days. But fans do fine.</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah.</P>

<P>Masek: But sometimes you need Mom there, right? Mom, it isn’t good enough for Mom to just come in, kiss you good night.</P>

<P>Yeah, I think we just, just a little bit longer, if we can get her, yeah, you’re learning to read now in school, right? Okay. You need to go to school every day, right? Right? Well, I’m glad you agree with me. It’s very important, school, because that’s where you’re going to learn to do all those good things like read. Do arithmetic. And make friends, more friends even. Okay.</P>

<P>So Mom’s going to work back up some of the special time for you and her, and I would like you two to go home and practice giving each other compliments. Do you know what a compliment is?</P>

<P>I paid you a compliment a little while ago when I said, "I really like that sweatshirt. It’s very pretty."</P>

<P>Nicole: I [inaudible]</P>

<P>Masek: That’s a compliment.</P>

<P>Nicole: It’s a cat, too.</P>

<P>Masek: Yeah. And didn’t you pay Mom a compliment earlier? Didn’t you say something nice about Mom? What did you say?</P>

<P>Nicole: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Masek: Well, I think you said something along the lines—not quite exactly like this—Mom’s a pretty good cook, isn’t she? Yeah. Mom’s a good housekeeper. She knows how to keep a clean house, and you help her.</P>

<P>Nicole: She gives me cheese fries.</P>

<P>Masek: Cheese fries, okay. Yes. Gourmet cheese fries.</P>

<P>Nicole: But she didn’t make them.</P>

<P>Masek: Okay. So Mom’s a good cook.</P>

<P>Mom’s a good mom. I paid Mom a compliment when I said, "You know, you’ve got a smart mom." Compliments. Those are nice, to say nice things about someone to them. So saying nice things to each other. Could you two practice that, working on that? I know you do it. But could you try to work a little more on saying nice things to each other? I know you do. And I bet you, you have a whole bunch of nice things that you say to each other that sometimes you just forget to say. Bet that would help. Because you’re two nice people, aren’t you? Yeah. Yeah, you are.</P>

<P>All right. So is there, listen, I’m going to give you one chance to say anything that’s on your mind right now.</P>

<P>Anything you want to say that we didn’t cover? Sure you don’t even want to mention sometimes you’re brother’s probably a stinker? Is he? Does he make you mad? Okay. I’ll give you that. Do you think you make him mad sometimes? Yeah. Okay. That’s normal. You know, that’s normal.</P>

<P>Mom? We got everything. We got things on the table here, you think?</P>

<P>Mom: Yeah. I think so. I think it helped a lot because, you know, you brought up a couple points where I just didn’t realize maybe those moments together alone, you know, like you said, things…</P>

<P>Masek: You just never know in her little mind how important they might have been. Because she’s thinking all the time.</P>

<P>Mom: Right. Right. And I know it was important, because she’d always go out of her way to, you know, put on a dress and put all the jewelry on. "We’ve got to go to the fancy restaurant, Mom." And then we would just sit there, you know, for an hour or so, just the two of us.</P>

<P>Masek: Just talk and, yeah. Cool.</P>

<P>Mom: And it’s something I actually miss and didn’t even realize how long it’s been since the two of us done that.</P>

<P>Masek: Boy, you’re going to have fun pretty soon. I’ve got a feeling. It’s going to do something, you two are going to do something very special together.</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Masek: It’s a surprise Mom will do. It’s going to be with Mom.</P>

<P>Nicole: What?</P>

<P>Mom: I don’t know. Maybe we’ll go to the mall and go to the restaurant. Shopping. Pick out a nice dress or something. We haven’t done that in a long time, either.</P>

<P>Her and I used, you know, like her Christmas dress, we’d go alone together and she’d pick it out, you know.</P>

<P>Nicole: I want to pick a Halloween dress.</P>

<P>Masek: Cool. Because it happens to be October.</P>

<P>Mom: Yes.</P>

<P>Masek: Very cool. All right. Well, thank you so much for coming. You were just perfect. And you know what, you left your little mike ball on this time at the end.</P>

<P>Thank you, Mom. It was great.</P>

<P>Mom: Thank you very much.</P>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is crazed out there, raining. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Raining?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you mind if I have watermelon? I have not eaten hardly at all. I could not get a cab at all. I just like heard from the job. Their priority is hiring this registrar but he keeps giving me this insider information like, "Oh I have not seen anyone since you and keep calling me if you do not hear from me by the end of the week." It just feels so positive, you know, but I do not want to get my hopes up. Yeah. It just feels really good. Like I did something the other day, that this guy that I work for every now and then, maybe like every couple of months, it just does not pay that well, he [0:00:59.9] pays like $12 per hour. But doing this construction work and the day that I was supposed to go to work I just like woke up and I called him. Like I was calling in sick but I just told him that I cannot go on working this way or working for this wage or whatever, you know. This is what I charge, you know, doing free lance outside of the gallery. I get paid $20 per hour. I am like 34 years old, if I was 22 just first moved to the city, it would be different and it was just more about a self esteem thing or something. I just could not do it, even though I needed the money Jules. I just thought, knowing what [0:01:55.3] </p>

<p>the job entailed, like in terms of really hard labor. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you called him up and said all of these things? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just said I cannot. I am sorry. You know the night before I thought I could. It just did not occur to me. I just like woke up that morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What happened when you woke up? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sunday. It was Sunday and I had to be there at 8:00 and I just woke up and I just got this kick in the head of sense or something you know. I sort of feel guilty like letting him down but then I thought if I called in sick it would have been the same thing. It felt good. Even though I needed the money. It was only $200.00 to $300.00 for a couple of days work working like 12 hours. He does not even charge overtime or anything but yet I know like bills these people a lot of money. In terms of [0:03:00.6] him being the subcontractor. It was almost like this sigh of relief like I had the guts to do it even though I needed the money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Standing up for yourself in someway. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel when I say something like that? I had to I do not know. Sometimes I have the impression that when I say kind of maybe touches something but it sort of misses the mark or </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when you said I was standing up for myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I feel that. Like I felt that when I was on the phone with this guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look I am interested in what happens for you when I for example, when I say that. [0:04:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it is more of a reinforcement. Like I guess that I am hearing it from someone else. I have heard exactly what you have said. Not literally what you have said but on the same plateau from some friends of mine. It is like, yeah, you know, it is like, it is true. If you were like young and had just moved to the city and you needed the money. In a way I sort of feel that I am contradicting myself in the sense that. I guess the guilt involved, I should say, is that I do need the money but yet I just could not do it. You know. I would have felt worse going there and working really hard and knowing the people that I would have been working with. Oh god, they just like bring [0:05:04.0] </p>

<p>me down mentally. It just felt good. I felt like I was moving forward, even though it sort of I guess, technically sort of put me back a bit in terms of the dollar signs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is not my priority right now. Even though it sort of should be. I ended up getting work through my boss, Jed. That has been his building up in Acme. So I am working for him hopefully for the next couple of weeks refurbishing this hallway. It is going to be really fun. I am on my own. He pays me exactly what I ask for and also too, it is interesting, he is so much fun outside of the gallery. [0:06:03.8] </p>

<p>You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which person is this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The control freak. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. So you experience him differently outside of the </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is a nice break. It is outside of that environment. It is just more about us just hanging out and working. I am pretty much there by myself. I am just there on the weekends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like in some way that you are identifying for yourself what you really want and what you are willing to take with it. You would like to be able to choose even if it is a sacrifice on one level it seems like it is a gain on another level. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. Like this afternoon within the half hour [0:07:02.4] before I came here, I called Geoffrey's Gallery and spoke to the woman. Even that was just so positive. Even if I do not get the job, it was just her attitude on the phone. The way she respected me and it was really nice. You know. It sort of gave me hope. Even though if it does not realize itself through that venue, it gave me hope that there is stuff out there. It might not happen for a long time if I do not get this job. I have been pretty positive about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there is something nice about the personal contact that you have with her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really just somehow, automatically, feel connected to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if the job panes out or it does not there is a sense that you feel a genuine meaningful interaction with her. [0:08:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I know that if I did not get the job and I showed up at the gallery to see a show that it would totally fine to interact with her. I think I have to keep telling myself that. Stuff like that is not about me, it is about them in terms of them making decisions. In terms, like I do not get the job, it is not because of me. I do have the qualifications. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any your experience of telling yourself this is in part because you sometimes feel to put the own upon yourself and so you are trying to. I am trying to understand. So you are telling yourself, someway of trying to reinforce that [0:09:05.8] </p>

<p>to yourself that it would be about them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is their value judgment. It is not about me. It is about them making their own decisions for what they want. It has nothing to do with my qualifications or my know how to do the job. I know I can. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you feel real secure about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Absolutely. So if I could only sort of extend that into when it comes to my other professional life, when it comes to my art making. That is a bit more critical. We have not really dove into that one yet. That is a sensitive one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But so the parallel would be so you could feel as confident about your abilities so that other people's judgments were about them and not necessarily a reflection of your work. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever heard of this thing called Saturn's turn where [0:10:00.0] everyone apparently it is like a cycle that happens every 28 years in someone's life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saturn's return? Yeah, I know something. I have heard of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was talking to someone about that. Quite a few people actually the other day. I sort of when I look back on the calendar and how it can happen to anyone. I can happen like when you are two months old or for the first time it can happen when you are 40. It is not a graphic 28 years. When I look at my resume like my professional artist resume and I look through my journal. I was doing that the other night actually. I keep all of my calendars for the year like mainly a work calendar but sometimes I put personal things in them. I was looking at them and that sort of made sense. Like my [0:11:11.4] </p>

<p>interest in a lot of things and just what I have been talking to people about the Saturn returns. Somehow I wonder if that is what I am going through in a way. Totally open.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well help me a little bit to understand how it is meaningful to you. I mean what does it</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just sort of made a lot of sense to me. Like in how people were talking about, "Oh yeah I had like a really tough two and a half years like this happened, that happened, but then there would be like this one thing that was really incredible but for the most part it was a real downer. When I look back sort of at my own life and how the last couple of years have been pretty non-existent in terms of my professional [0:12:00.2] </p>

<p>life as an artist, my whole enthusiasm. And like being involved with Danny and being totally consumed with him for that year and really losing a lot of my identity. Not through him but I lost a lot of myself. I was totally consumed with him. I do not regret that because I needed to do that. When I look at my non activity over the last couple of years in terms of my art practice and my goings on in the art world, that seems to put into perspective that is what I am going through. It seems to make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I still want to do a bit more reading about this because I really do not know anything about it. When I heard about this the other day and it just sort of clicked into me, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about it struck a string. [0:13:02.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So I am very curious about it. I guess </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel to have kind of a something that in some way explains or gives a meaning to? I sounds like it is kind of what your experience is part of the connection to it that it seems to flesh out your experience or give it another dimension in someway. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt good. It sort of felt like I had a sigh of relief. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe you are not going through this all alone. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was talking to this one woman yesterday and the women who actually graduated from me in music school ten years ago in Toronto and she walks into the venue, we had a very quick visit. She was talking about the Saturn returns and she said, "Oh yeah I have to keep telling myself it is just that." "It is just that." [0:14:00.4] </p>

<p>It will pass. You know. Just like hearing people talk about those experiences. It sort of eases me. It gives me hope again that it will pass. You know. Well I should just try to patient and just like these little incidences like having the interview at Pace and the possibility of that. That whole new thing. I really think that is the key. I need a real physical symbolic break in my life right now. I think that is it. That will pull me out. I think a lot of it is going to be the job thing if anything else. [0:15:00.6] </p>

<p>Well I do not know where. I guess I would like, I guess you would have to read some astrological books to find out about that. I assume. Do you know anything about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know that it is certainly part of astrology. Something about the movement of the planets with turning, the positions. I would imagine you could read up on it. How does this whole job prospect which feels like a big, at least potentially, a big transformational opportunity. How does that and the other things that you are talking about fit in with doing therapy and what you </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it is all connected. It is all connected. Like this is like a [0:16:00.5] break. This is part of it. I think this was the first thing that, the first step. I think like the job is definitely like another step. This was definitely the foundation in terms of reinventing myself. That is what it is all about. It is all about reinventing myself I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it fits in with an overall picture.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It is very important to me. I ran into this woman last night at some woman who Danny was staying with before he moved into his new apartment. His birthday is next week. I have not spoken to him since. Did I talk about that? [0:17:04.5] The incident where I called him up at the store?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have not spoken to him since then and Lucy was telling me last night that he just apparently talks about me all the time. He will not call me. He does not even like call me about his birthday party plans. That is a hard one with me. I do not know what to do. I want to go and I want to get him a present and the whole like kitten caboodle because that is just me, you know. I do that for my friends. Then like this other side of me this annoying sort of like pinch or something is telling me that I [0:18:03.6] should avoid it. I should really, not to hurt him, but I think it is more about me. I think I really have to figure out is it going to benefit me? Is it going to help me? It is not about how it affects him or how it makes him feel if I show up or do not show up. I sort of hate thinking about it that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why. Because I feel like I am hurting his feelings. And yet, he has hurt mine so many times, you know. It is not like I sort of have this revenge tactic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is interesting I just thought, it seems like there is a bit of a [0:18:57.0] parallel in terms of you opting out of this job. Just in the sense of being less concerned about what the other person will think and (inaudible at 0:19:13.4) what you do but taking care of yourself. It sounds to me that there is a little bit of a conflict in terms of that may somewhat feel selfish. I am not sure what. If there is a little it is a new experience for you in some way in that there is some slight discomfort. You said you feel that you are not quite sure how you feel about thinking in this way vis-�-vis. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It is funny. After I ran into Lucy on the street I perceived that was late in the evening. I immediately went to a bar and got a bit drunk last night. Total escape. After I heard that, she did not even say that much, but just the fact that she just said it. {0:20:00.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which part of it was particularly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that she told me that he like thinks about me and talks about me all the time. Yeah. You know I would never know that. I do not assume that. I went home last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was crying last night when I went home. I was almost like god dammit, he is still doing it. He is still not talking to me. In a symbolic sense you know. He still cannot say it in my face. It made me think about, I think I was talking about it, I must have spoke about it last week in terms of me making that phone call and the reasons behind that. Him like always sort of flirting in my face that he has been aroused or caroused by other individuals and how I have never done that to him and that whole thing. [:21:08.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like you experience in any way willing to talk about his other interests, but when it comes to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Please do not talk about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what happens? I would be interested to know what happens for you sometimes because I have experienced this on a couple of occasions when I am saying something I am not always sure if it is comfortable for you to listen. I do not know. You tell me. Do you have a sense of what you experience when I offer some perspective I have on something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um. I know what you are asking me but I do not know how to answer it. It happens to me a lot. People will just be talking to me and I will just [0:22:04.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I know that you mentioned it before that is why I think it is one of the things that we should particularly focus on is looking at those things in here and that will give us </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like what am I feeling at that time? I really do not know. I really do not know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean do you have a sense of what that not knowing or. Well let's take it back to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, is it just kind of like you tune out? Is there just a sense that things can go away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I have sense that you then sort of tune back in and then you are kind of disoriented. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What did you say? Yeah. Yeah. I do not know. It is like when [0:23:04.7] that happens; sometimes I am aware of it when it happens and sometimes I am not. Yeah. Sometimes I will be talking and I will just start to drift off into some other place. There will be like a certain word or clause that will pull me back into the conversation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it is interesting because I do myself have had the experience that you create this kind of a world to yourself over there. I remember some time early on in our meetings that you said something about not wanting to feel that you are talking to a chair. And yet, sometimes I have the experience maybe that almost feeling like the chair. Then I sometimes feel like it is hard to get in there. [0:24:00.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Into me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not mean that 100 percent of the time. But there are certain instances where I have the sense that it is a very self-contained experience that you are having and that I am not sure that I will have enough experience like you said tuning out or just not sure that I am making a connection when I start to say something. I think it is worth kind of noting. Wondering what you are, if you have any sense of that yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do I have any sense of it when it happens or do I pick up on that? Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Like I guess I sometimes feel the same thing with you that it is almost like what I am saying is just passing through you. I feel that sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you are not getting something back from me? [0:25:01.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I, not that I am not getting something back from you or not that I expect to get something back from you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what would it be like if you did want something back from me? It seems like you are very quick to say that that is not what you want. You do not want anything back. Is there some judgment you would place on that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I do not expect. I have always sort of had. I guess I have grown up with this sense that you cannot expect things from people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would maybe be hoping for too much? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. I do not know if I would put it in those words. But sometimes when I speak or talk when I am here, I feel the same thing sometimes. Like it is just going right through you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As though it is not having an impact? [0:26:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I think oh well this is like video taped and maybe Jules does not have to really pay attention right now because she has the choice of watching this video tape.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I might do something behind the scenes somehow rather than in the moment? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (laughter) Well not necessarily that but you know what I am saying. Oh you can just sort of like, I guess I do sometimes feel some of that. You just sort of might sit here and not really pay attention in the moment when I am here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is that upsetting? How does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it has not been upsetting yet. It is more of an observation. That I have sort of felt sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I have noticed that. We are talking about complimentary things. I have noticed that you do not ask particularly. Are you here or are you in the beyond.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Am I here right now? (laughter) [0:27:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Are you here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I am really tired today. I do not ask for things? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that sometimes I am not sure what you want from me. In other words,</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not really know. I know that I have told you once that I do want interaction with you and I do get that from you. In terms of specific things, I do not know what I expect or want from you. Then I do think about it though, in the weeks between coming here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would welcome it if you wanted to share some of those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I do not. Well it is just like oh gosh, is Jules going to help me or is she going to put me, not in the right direction, but sort of maybe will I at least sort of accomplish one thing by coming here? There has been times when I sort of [0:28:07.0] feel like, not that it is a waste of time, but I just think those benefits in therapy probably take a really long time to achieve. You cannot really. I do not expect to have them right away. I guess that is my impatientness that sometimes I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It almost sounds to me that you do not even allow yourself to experience the impatience, that you almost immediately tell yourself, I cannot expect too much too soon.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So get over it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The benefits will evolve over time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always had that outlook. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not questioning that per say, but I am noticing that in [0:29:01.9] one way it prevents you from coming in and saying, "Listen, I am not sure this is helping me." I wonder what that might be like for you to question me or express some doubts or to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have not really thought of it like that before. I probably will now though but I have not really thought about it. It is like over the weekend, I was pretty wrapped up in thinking about this job and also too I have started to date a couple of [0:29:59.3] guys as well. I have been like, that has sort of all the sudden appeared in front of me. There was one point in this weekend; I think it was Saturday night. Yeah it was Saturday night because I was suppose to work for Jed Saturday and then I was supposed to work for Mason on Sunday. The one that I called. I sort of felt really lonely that evening but sort of the same time I have having these really binary feelings lately. These really opposing, not opposing, but you know what I mean like binary? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of contradictory?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know like I am feeling really happy yet really empty. It is really confusing. [0:31:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that thought come to you. We were talking about stuff that was going on here and then sort of a story or something came to you (inaudible at 0:31:19.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know how I started to talk about that. I do not even know. What was I saying? Oh, Saturday. I do not even know how I got onto that. Oh, I am spacing out right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think that is from? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um. Me being exhausted today because I was up early working. [0:31:58.0] I really had to force myself to come here today. I almost like called in sick. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you kind of felt like calling in sick. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Contagious (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well maybe it is some of that that is not really doing it for me and you know giving me what I need.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess today I really thought it would have really been. I guess I was feeling today on my way here, that I really had to rush to get here and I thought maybe every two weeks as opposed to every week. I really felt like oh this is a bit much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that? What does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just did not feel. I guess I did not feel the need to come here today or I did not want to come here. I just like finished work. I just really wanted [0:32:59.3] to go home. It is raining outside. I just really wanted to have that down time from like 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. in the day. I really hate this sort of like non-time for me. That in between day and night. I just hate it. Then with the rain, I just wanted to like go home and sleep for four hours. I tend to feel that a lot. I tend to it is like I sometimes feel really tired sometimes but then I have been having a lot of sleep deprivation lately. You know like not having like a really sound sleep. I cannot remember the last sound sleep that I have had. I think that is why over the last couple of nights I have got out and had a bit too many drinks, and not pass out, but it sort of forces me to sleep. I go [0:34:02.9] out and have a few shots of whiskey. I tend to sleep better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are having trouble falling asleep?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well or staying asleep. It seems very common to wake up every hour or not really be sound asleep. Like be awake but the eyes are closed. Tossing and turning. That is another reason why I am tired today. I did not have that last night or I did have it last night. I could not get to sleep at all. I do not know if I is just like stress related, thinking about the job, the landlord thing, Danny. Last night I was upset with Danny. It has been hard. I do not want to take medication. I do not want [0:35:05.1] </p>

<p>to buy the pills and do that. But sometimes it will be like three days in a row where I have not had a sound sleep and it is so frustrating. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how are you feeling about being in here aside from feeling tired? You did not feel like coming per say, but you are here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well once I am here it is ok. The actual act of getting here, like putting myself in the chair, that was pretty hard. But once I am here, we seem to talk about this every now and then; the first 15 minutes are always tough for me I think. I just cannot seem to get over that that oh god I have to start the conversation. [0:35:57.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think that is part of what my experience is that my sense is that you have to feel like you have to be busy over there in some way. To the extent that</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, if I just want to not say a thing for five minutes, I get extremely nervous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that nervousness about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is because I feel like I have to perform. Not for you but more about I think perform for myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is why I am here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that not to say something would be somehow not fulfilling</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am not saying that. I am saying that it is a very uncomfortable situation. Because you are here looking at me and I am not saying anything [0:37:05.7]</p>

<p>and I am like god, oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well in some ways that involves me</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that is why I blank out sometimes because it is almost like an unconscious sort of way of letting me relax or zoning out. I do not know if that could be contributed to that. That might be interesting to talk about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well so what we are saying is that there is a bit of anxiety fueling your talking or your need to come up with the next topic. I sometimes have that sense that the spaces in between thoughts are kind of uncomfortable. Rather than looking to me for a response or asking me about something, my sense is that you feel like it is up [0:38:05.1] to you to keep things moving, as though you are kind of responsible for our movement in here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said before that it is characteristic of you to not expect or want to expect things back. I cannot remember how you put it exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I do not expect things from people or but yeah I do too. Like I expected a lot from Danny but he did not give it to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: These expectations. Did you articulate these things to Danny? or these things that [0:39:00.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It makes me think about when I was telling things like, "Oh, does this bother you when I do this?" He would always say, "No." Then when it came right down to it, he totally detested it. Things like showing up at a place where he would be there with his friends and I just felt like I needed to see him and I would drop by. I always asked him that. "Does that bother you?" Am I invading? Am I pushing? Am I overextending or however you want to put it. I made it perfectly clear to him. "Oh no." "Oh no."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see there you were asking him about his (inaudible at 0:39:53.00) and his needs but not yours. [0:40:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would tell him that I liked doing that. I needed to see you that is why I came here. Then I would ask him, "Does that bother you?" Yeah. He could not stand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in some way you experienced, you got a double message there that when you put out your needs, that at one level he would say, "That is fine.", but you had a sense of</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. I see you are labeling it. You are terminizing it in a different way than I have always thought about it. My needs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel? Does it feel somehow that I am distorting it somehow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of yeah. Yeah. Like it is, not that you are concocting it, but it is almost like you are, not that I am being cynical, but being very academic. Sort of [0:41:06.2] like putting my situation into a very academic notebook or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it somehow does not feel personal? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I am really responding to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like I am fitting it into some category of some kind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in some ways it feels like a nothing remark. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I finally have realized that I have a lot of anger with him, with Danny and I do not want to have that. I do not know how to get rid of it. Dating these other men has helped me and when I look back at how I was at that time in my life, like last year, god it is going to be so different the second time around. [0:42:08.3]</p>

<p>Except for my friend Pat ran into Danny the other day. Like tonight I have a date and I am going to this place in Rock City. By best friend, neighbor, Pat went to visit Danny at the store and said, "We should like go out for a drink sometime." He says, "Well you know, maybe we could do something Wednesday or whatever." Danny is extremely flaky. He will say something or he will make arrangements to do something and that day will come along and he will not follow through or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I interrupt here just for a second? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:42:57.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am sort of curios as to what kind of transpires. First of all I find myself caught in a dilemma sometimes because verses what I wanted to point out, it that it seems to me another instance when we were talking about some dynamic that goes on between us, you were telling me that something did not feel quite comfortable with how I was responding to you and we were beginning to explore that, and then you sort of went off into the story about Danny. My dilemma is that the stories are often very interesting and I can be seduced into following you into those stories. But I am also aware that there is another level of what is going on and that is that my sense is that you are leaving a conversation where we are talking about something that is going on between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, and I change the subject or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Then I wanted to bring your attention to that. If you [0:44:00.6] have any sense of what happens for you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels weird. I feel uncomfortable when that happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which when we are working</p>

<p>PATIENT: When the actual act of the change is going through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is when it feels uncomfortable. I wonder what moves you in that direction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. I do not know if I just have a short attention span or just like I get bored or trying to cram a lot of things in the hour or as opposed to saying just focusing on one iota. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think about that sometimes. I have to talk about this, and then talk about this, and then talk about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to talk about the new job possible project. I have got to talk a little bit about Danny. I have like my ten minutes of Danny and my 20 minutes of the new job. I have my seven minutes of Alison or whatever. [0:44:58.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe my directing our attention sometimes to what is going on between us feels a bit like a detour or simply not something you banked on dealing with. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking about it. Dealing with what we are talking about. Yeah. That never really occurred to me that that would go on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, does it feel...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strange?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange or how does it feel? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It does not feel strange. Almost just feels a bit too clich�. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just the whole underlying dynamics of the therapist and the patient or the client or whatever. It is just a bit too. Maybe I am just like falling, since this is my first time in therapy, my whole rendering have been mediated in terms of what [0:46:00.3]</p>

<p>therapy is. So when I hear about or try to talk about that, it just seems a bit redundant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you try to tell</p>

<p>PATIENT: About our relationship. As if we have one right now which I do not think we do. It almost seems to like be, not that I find it to be this suspicious hypnosis, almost trying to provoke it into something provocative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like in someway that it feels manipulative in someway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I would not say that. I would not say manipulative. I would say it is just a means of you sharing something on your side of the table. Like something that you can throw out in terms of the discussion or whatever. I do not find it manipulative. [0:46:57.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I guess you said the words, I am being pushed or I am just trying to put it together in what way is it a clich�. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In terms of like Hollywood. Mediated. The representation that I have seen and witnessed between a therapist and a client has been in the cinema, on television, in books.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So somehow in this moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is like yeah like you </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are playing out something and it does not feel like it is really real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does not feel real. No. No. I does not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any sense how it could feel more real? I mean is it the way in which I point out something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. I had not really thought about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe you could give it some thought. I certainly do not want to engage in. I think it is interesting to thing about why it does feel kind of [0:48:07.7] unreal to you and to maybe I think </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well first of all this room is not that appealing for one. Ok. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would rather sit in the car?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that. It is just a bit too claustrophobic for me sometimes. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little sterile. It is probably not. In other words, what you are saying is that it is not as conducive to feeling </p>

<p>PATIENT: I almost thought, oh god, why can't I go and like have when I was coming here and I was tired I thought oh it would have been really nice to lay down today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talk about clich�s. A couch</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Exactly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if you want to pull up a chair and stretch out that is not. I mean that is the kind of thing that if something. There is an example of just a [0:49:04.6] thought maybe you thought it was beyond the realm of possibility. Like that might have felt comfortable to you. So maybe in the way that we can</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could not even believe that I had to question myself about bringing the watermelon in here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there might be some rule against it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like it was not like that. I thought it was ridiculous to think about that. I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have the thought and then you kind of critique it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think those are the things for us to explore. This is your therapy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If there things that feel uncomfortable or the way that I am [0:49:59.8] missing the mark, there maybe something that we can do to make it feel more authentic to you. You need to have a back and forth kind of thing to establish to get that going. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I just felt like we just closed the session right now. It is almost like I do not know what else to talk about. That seemed to really close it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it feel like it closed in a positive way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just like ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or did it kind of feel like alright I will humor her and say ok. (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not that. [0:51:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am left with a sense that you are not entirely sure of what this means to talk about, the interaction between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know what it means. I know what you are trying to say or I do hear what you are. I am listening to what you are saying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. Tell me what you are feeling beneath it all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Beneath what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you are hearing it. What is that expression? It looks like you are a little pissed off at me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um. People say that a lot. No. I mean I am hearing what you are saying. It does make sense. I just did not expect to go into that when I was here or during my time or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel like I have taken up some of your time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It was just something that. I can see the relativeness in it but [0:52:01.8]</p>

<p>I did not expect that to go on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel for something, you did not expect it and it happened and what does it do for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does not really do anything. I do not really feel any. To be honest with you it is almost like this is this week's topic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there is something kind of again almost clinical about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It does not seem like it think it should naturally evolve or something as opposed to </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is unnaturally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But you have to bring me up. Someone has to start the conversation about anything. Maybe I just did not think that that would go on or we would talk [0:53:08.6]</p>

<p>about that for a while yet. After we had established our own interaction without discussing it. I guess that is what I am</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe this is the way out of establishing it</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe. I guess I still sort of think it might be slightly premature.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think one of the things that I am pointing out, and I think we are both kind of saying the same thing from different angles in a way, is that maybe it does not feel like there is always a connection there. I think that is the topic. I think that is what I am pointing to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What that we do not connect sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That in certain instances, I think that we are maybe kind of going past each other, not making an impact, not feeling heard, that kind of thing. I [0:54:09.7] think that is the relationship. So to let that go without commentary</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. I see what you are saying now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe would do a disservice to us both. I think primarily I am interested in what is going on for you with that, but I know, that in particular you said to me, that you did not want to feel like you were talking to a chair. Sometimes because I feel like a chair I want to do that with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do I make you feel that way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not feel like you are doing something to me. I feel like, this is something that I pointed out before, sometimes you will get into this sort of self-contained space of telling stories. Like I said it is very seductive. I can follow along and play a rather passive role, listening, and hearing, but I do not always feel invited to. [0:55:03.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: To participate?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To participate. It is not that I feel in any way actively shut out if you see what I mean. I mean it feels very friendly and I do not feel out in outer space or anything, but sometimes I do not feel that the windows are small sometimes for me to jump in and to sort of be a part of it. That is why I questioned you if this in someway the sense that you are feeling that it is your job to do all the work. To ask me for something in someway maybe feels total strange. Maybe that had something to do with your kind of staying over there rather than pulling for me of an interaction. [0:56:01.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well definitely I would not. Oh gosh, I would not have thought of it in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have some other way of thinking about it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I did not even really occur to me to think about it. That dynamic. Sort of like passing each other sometimes. I thought about it in the sense that I have picked up on it. That feeling of missing each other sometimes, but never really questioned it or how I would answer it. It would be. Oh, that would just [0:57:01.5] relieve itself over time. Getting more comfortable with one another but to sort of talk about now did not really concern me. I did not really give it much thought. Now I wonder if, my gosh, am I going to be even more self conscious now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it make you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know if it makes me more nervous or what but I am definitely going to be aware of it more. I know I will be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know how that is going to make me react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that what I said was critical or judgmental? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Not at all. Just observant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering if that was</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Just observant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. [0:57:58.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because people have said that to me in more subtle ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Than I came at and clobbered you with things. (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is going to be interesting to see how that changes things or if I will change in terms of dialog.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alrighty. I have some cash for you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh that is right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have like. I was going to pay like $130.00 for four visits. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it $130.00? $120.00</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh $120.00. Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder with my health insurance. I am probably just going to make one claim when this whole thing is over. I do not want to have to deal with that in terms of the forms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can double check with them on that. I do not really know. </p>

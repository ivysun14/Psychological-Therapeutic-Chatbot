<p>THERAPIST: March 4th, Interview 10.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Loss my preoccupation just between Monday and today sort of stopped thinking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:00:51.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, within the past sort of been getting close to him, getting</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting sort of near what I thought well I can't do anything about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just thinks to me well, you know, if I'm going again in a few days that was like sort of around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But between, between Monday, Monday and today I didn't think of it at all last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Just as if those kind of thoughts just evaporated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Disappeared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it ah almost ah as though I couldn't about I mean almost as if I could have forgotten about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, you know, except as unlike last night I thought oh tomorrow I go there, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Says I haven't been (inaudible 0:01:48.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your reaction to a thought like that tomorrow I'm going again but an anxious feeling or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, no just before kind of an anxious feeling. (0:02:09.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was constantly thinking well, you know, Thursday I'm going and then it's only two days and then it's only one day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gut was anxious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Afraid and worried about what was going to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just, you know, that you're going to (inaudible 0:02:23.7) or whatever can't say anything suppose to walk in and sit down (inaudible 0:02:29.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, just sort of ah well I'm, I'm not afraid of, of me, you know, ah something psychic damage or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But just, just sort of afraid of what you're going to think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, or what, you know, what's going to become of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. So well what is going to happen what is she going to think I'm just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know I think what I'm worried about is like the impression I'm making, you know, ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Progress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm, I'm not so much worried about ah about what you think about what I say I'm more worried about what you think about me constantly looking out the window or approximately like looking at the flowers or that sort of thing. Or me not having anything to say or maybe I'll the lack of depths to what I say. I'm more worried about what you think about those sort of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then what you think about what I say, you know, like the impression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like thinking except to say worrying about what attitude I'm thinking of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, perhaps.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it doesn't really fit though. (0:04:04.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, no it's not really an attitude just the way it's more like the impression you get of my behavior, you know, like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. But what would be range of alternatives on that I don't I, I understand what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I could think what kinds of things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what you think having me sitting here staring out the window while I'm talking about I'm not, not having anything to say just it would just sort of be a negative impression. Whereas if I think it's I somehow feel I'm expected to have something to say something to say then be able to discuss it with you or something and then you have a positive impression. Because I would sort of be doing the thing I was expected to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I still really feel that I'm expected to do (inaudible 0:04:57.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. As if you're not thinking good client and that's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It hasn't crossed that absolutely has not crossed my mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well I, I, I don't think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can say that I don't think there is any such thing as a bad client, you know, I don't believe that but yeah ah, you know, regardless of what I do I don't think you would say that I'm a bad client.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just sort of just the fact that I'm doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah the fact that it's done makes it relevant so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know, I, I don't I don't really believe that there is any such thing as a bad client.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I sometimes feel that I might be one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like saying okay conceptually you can deal with that and you can say conceptually it's an irrelevant concept, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Except there is some kind of hook into you because in some way you responding because it is better then your concept. (0:06:17.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when you think about just like that, you know, okay maybe when you put aside the things that (inaudible 0:06:29.6) theoretically irrelevant concept.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, theoretically non sensible (inaudible 0:06:36.6) uhm but you just think about what it would mean like if you don't judge it that way what does it mean? What if I did think that? Or what if you think that I do? What does that do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't think that no think about it for awhile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll probably get I'll probably get some fumes if I try it because I guess the question but I don't really know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Can you think of it like what is your immediate reaction to that, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's my fault, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you think I'm a bad client it's my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Meaning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For being one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Meaning that you're to blame could do something different then you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or I should be doing something different. Or I should be concentrating more or something. (0:08:05.4)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling kind of guilty about the way you're acting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's guilt. Ah, it sort of a self doubt or something. I don't know it's getting harder to put my finger on something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just as we have been talking at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no just what we were saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when I first came here I really I felt like I belonged to it and ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Meaning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt that I had some fear problems, you know, (inaudible 0:08:55.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:08:57.5) and then at times I doubted that, you know, and I really doubted the, you know, you don't belong here because you're not basically (inaudible 0:09:09.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now ah I don't know completely I just can't, can't really say one way or the other I can't. I don't I don't feel like ah I'm sure of anything any more that I've known ah about myself I'm just sort of sort of accepting it as it comes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not (inaudible 0:09:45.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, (0:10:04.5) I don't know just sort of doing things at my own speed and not (inaudible 0:10:10.9), not seeing through the forest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and, and I'm not really sure if this is good but I'm not sure whether it's good or bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This new way of, of, of letting yourself set your own pace.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's comfortable compared to ah compared to where I was at before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't quite know what's going to bring the future. I may, I may it may get me farther and farther behind whatever behind is and ah like we get farther and farther away from everything (inaudible 0:10:59.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. To say as if to say well it's a comfortable state to be in this leg but (inaudible 0:11:07.4) how I want, you know, it's comfortable to be in it but what's going to come of it ah separate from it feels to be just doing that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, you know, I'm not sure of the future.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. And wondering if the ax is going to fall if you keep on this way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. Looking for a (inaudible 0:11:27.6) I would say and I've got to be willing to take it like if the ax did fall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I don't know I don't really feel like it yeah it is going to be quite as fatal if not just involve a chain besides (inaudible 0:11:55.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. (0:12:00.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then again it might ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. But your since of it is that it's not going to that even if something bad happens it's not going to be as terrible as you had imagined before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might be as terrible but ah I don't think I'll feel it as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. It won't affect you as terrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it could physically and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it would seem like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind. Ah, then some days I would in the future I might sort of all of a sudden realize how it has affected physically and might make me (inaudible 0:12:44.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:12:45.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're worried kind a about a thing that could happen which is like, like nothing (inaudible 0:12:53.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Terrible state.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. You know, so I can't say ah it's, it's more pleasant to be just sort of accepting things sort of floating along and that was to be fighting everything but ah it's more pleasant but you can't I can't really say that it gets better after (inaudible 0:13:31.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know how, how everything is going to add up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. Could you go as far as to say you have your doubts (inaudible 0:13:40.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really think that I have my doubts it's such a relief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know not to</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (0:14:00.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to feel all tense and.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:14:03.8) on anything (inaudible 0:14:05.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So (inaudible 0:14:07.3) I really have my doubts I don't know if I, I, I think I tend to really doubt that is, you know, a good permanent solution.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but there is a whole element then of really relief, you know, just like, like really being rid of a burden in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like these other things you're telling me I guess is more of once you say that you want to put on qualifier, you know, and put the things you are sure about that and aren't sure how big a thing it is. But at the same time it's very much there uhm that thing about it it's being a really good state to be in now whatever the issue implications are. (0:15:00.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sort of make a (inaudible 0:15:01.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well basically ah </p>

<p>PATIENT: Something sort of reminds me about myself and being here, you know, the fact that I'm I don't know (inaudible 0:15:11.8) concentrating on what you're saying and keep it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's happening instead?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I just, just sort of the same thing my attention is (inaudible 0:15:11.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when we were at that time we were here, you know, (inaudible 0:15:34.3) got caught and everything like that and ah I just couldn't concentrate on anything it's almost as if I'm looking for an excuse to, to relax and to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To if I'm concentrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean concentrating doesn't come easy with all these of having to kind a grab onto yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. To keep from being distracted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This isn't a isn't an involving way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, at times at times involving way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At times it is not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It's, it's, it's ah it's sort of that I'm afraid to get into it I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because of if I do any strange I just don't know what it is and so I'm sort of hesitant to throw myself at large.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. You really want to keep your distance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ah I don't know what you call it uhm yeah it's like keeping my distance keeping control of myself or ah restraining myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because if you would like to get into that but you say better be careful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then knowing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I would but ah, you know, I feel like it's a touchy area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Touchy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't think that we talking about it and I do afraid to talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah the way things are now I avoid them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Well I'm not going to ask you what they are but I don't really understand what you uhm what you mean by touchy is that like embarrassing type talk about it. (0:18:00.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I may be embarrassed yeah. Ah, that's how I well the whole reason I'm here is sort of everything I talk about here is, you know, is personal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But they provide I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More intimate to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really intimate kind of things I don't (inaudible 0:18:00.9) and some of them maybe afraid to, to sort of think about and maybe realize that you have been deluding yourself and.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very sensitivity are these things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Ah, you know, it's, it's that I, I think it probably would it would probably be valuable to talk about them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ah at present not the sort of thing I</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have ever talked to anybody about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah it's hard to know how to start when you don't have anything to compare it to and, you know, like having a therapist and, you know, relatively close to my age as opposed to ah something I, I didn't I wasn't really expecting anything but I probably would have been like most comfortable with ah with some 50 year old man or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. On the grounds of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To ah (inaudible 0:19:39.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like he has seen more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, it's just like </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has seen more of life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of ideas the idea that I was sort of idea of therapist (inaudible 0:19:50.9) ah it seem to I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you feel like you're in the hands of an expert.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps ah (0:20:03.6) and ah I don't know being in the, you know, opposite sex and we're close to the same age and it's almost you kind of dunked it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dunked it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well (inaudible 0:20:20.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you're someone running around and talking to people about things that they're ashamed of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or more specifically you don't you're not around talking to girls who are just a couple of years different then you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well women any, any woman. And ah people your own, you know, you're approximately your age. So it's not like girl, girls approximately it's, it's women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, period.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And contemporaries.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether it's an older.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah and some contemporaries they all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now how come do you think that is more embarrassing with those people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, why I think it's more embarrassing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I mean is it that it's more embarrassing in terms for some reason or they seem more involved, you know, like what is it about the 50 year old guy </p>

<p>PATIENT: The 50 year old guy</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes him instead </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes it seem more viable to talk about those things with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was a kid and pretty much even before I came to the University like up until I was 18 or so 17 or 18 ah women a housewife and men are professional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Quite often and ah, ah I mean like the only idea I would have of anyone ah and a therapist or anything like that would just naturally be a man who has been in it for 30 years or something. (0:22:09.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. So it's (inaudible 0:22:14.3) this idea of a woman my age changed that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, (inaudible 0:22:22.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unexpected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not going to say unexpected it just more likely ah I had</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just not thing it just doesn't fit with what I thought it was going to be is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, ah my one of my memories the last two times that just like waiting for people younger then he was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At times it first bothered me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were (inaudible 0:22:50.4). Or, or how come it did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How come what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come that fits I mean </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that, that how I, you know, really wasn't entirely surprised if (inaudible 0:23:05.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Send me a therapist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who wasn't 50 years old and a male.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ah anything thing the thing about why I would be (inaudible 0:23:25.6) ah a woman therapist is ah like some of these problems may be with women and some of these things ah, you know, sort of nature ah, you know, there, there are always things that you don't talk about in mixed company. I mean like if you have a dinner table there's a bunch of men together, you know, it would be pretty much anything (0:23:59.7) but eventually women would have to put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether, whether I agree or not with, with the idea of something to talk about in mixed groups.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. You aren't use to talking to women about that kind of thing it's like it's almost like it's not a matter of what, what you think or not it's like saying well it's like breaking a convention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and, and doing something you just haven't done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you don't know how to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know you don't know how you don't know if you can talk that same way it doesn't seem as you should just talk that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if you talk the same way I don't know it might ah I don't know a lot of women around who I would defend, you know. Like my boss, you know, my mother or anything like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like raising the dial for proprietary, kind of event take that kind of event.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, no in the same sense that ah, you know, mixed dinner party, you know, like adults talk about certain things something like that ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the grounds that are impolite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so not that I really believe it but I mean that's what my boss and my mother believe and how do I know you don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum, think that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's ah I figured you're probably not but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, my first reaction is to say well you have to be careful with any women (inaudible 0:25:54.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if so</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if so</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any women would be offended by </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah do anything about it which you are offended.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being offended. (0:26:02.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you can </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you </p>

<p>PATIENT: Outside of being fired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you would be embarrassed to offend me? How come not to say</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm embarrassed to offend anyone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. Well how come? Okay I mean (inaudible 0:26:22.5) yeah how come? When I say well talk to them if they are going to be offended by this their</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm sort of expecting some sort of help here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and ah by, by if I offend you right in your area maybe you could tell me something that, you know, I sort of trusting you in this and ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's a very touchy kind of trust like you have to do a lot of stuff to maintain it right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm trust I'm trust, trusting you more or less no, no basis, you know, I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you were to </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have any reason to ah to expect that you're always going to ah, ah do what's best for me sort of, you know, say what's best for me and if except that I just sort of have a trust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I were to go and ah and offend you or something like that you're pissed off, you know, ah you might not give an indication of it, you could always ah, you know, give bad advice for those things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On purpose?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, if you got mad at me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I offended you, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, it's a possibility when you're dealing with</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like</p>

<p>PATIENT: People.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I just wanted to clear had, had what you got.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why if that's what you say then like if you offend me I've got a certain kind of tolerant in your eyes and I could kind a take revenge without you even knowing that. (0:28:05.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I would become aware of it after you did it so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe I wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum. But is that the kind of kind of general idea like you got to be careful because she could get back at me. She could hurt me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, ah either, either that or, or just that ah she would refuse to help so. You know, you might stop trying to be helpful rather than like deliberate try, trying to be ah, ah the bad or something you just might stop trying so if I offended you really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm, I'm sure (inaudible 0:29:03.8), you know, therapist get your therapist keep going (inaudible 0:29:09.9). Ah, for some reason I really didn't like the client.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah, you know, like ah, ah, you know, like even though you're trying to help just people better themselves or something ah I imagine that there are certain personalities that, you know, turn you off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this could probably be other who could work with it. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see what I'm saying I would I would think and ah I don't I don't want to do anything to ah that would ah, ah make me into one of those, you know, someone whose personality you really didn't like, like (inaudible 0:30:15.6), you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, it is sort of the same thing when I when I tell you that I ah that I sometimes worry about your impressions, you know, that's fine I don't, I don't want you to like just think (inaudible 0:30:31.5) or I'll be glad when he's gone over with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everything like that because I, you know, don't like if personality in the way but to (inaudible 0:30:41.8) I could ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because those things would all mean you want to </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, ah if something doesn't need to know who we trust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:31:10.1). Uhm</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well are you always (inaudible 0:31:27.8) that must put in a rather difficult predicament a lot of the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That, I mean you really must not feel like you can just say more because that this other thing you've got to keep in mind where you won't get any help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, ah I, I, I don't think so (0:32:00.7). You know, I don't think it's I don't I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. It's not as bold as that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know exactly what how bad you thinking of this but I don't think it's as bad as your certain to make it sound because these are like just broad areas that I'm just not like working. Like I'm over on the left hand side of the brain these are on the right hand side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe someday they will get over to the right hand side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is that how is that going to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm not thinking about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What could we do that could that you aren't thinking about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like to get over there I just figure ah, you know, if I feel good enough without this, you know, come far enough ah and ah, you know, I could ah could end up over there or alternative means of getting me over there was if I become desperate enough with one of these things but ah, you know, these problems. You know, while they are present they're not real like pressing, desperate things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are more well ah I think that they are necessary to make for a (inaudible 0:33:30.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ah I mean for someone to know me as well as I know me is what I'm saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, no one will ever know me as well as I do probably is what you're saying except the.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well comment that I mean more, when I'm more complete that is how could you (0:34:06.3) can you think of ways or anything that would make you more comfortable or deal with some of those issues without like with me and the kind of person I am, you know, as a being almost a contemporary and, and woman and how could that and you're kind of, you know, discomfort yourself are the things are ways that we can deal with that or anything that you think could change that or help with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's pretty much a matter of time, you know, just, just a matter of time. Don't know how long the time is but ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I really don't see anyway around it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:34:54.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's just a matter of getting use to this relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well even maybe more then getting use to it, you know, ah, ah, ah it, it would require ah the development of a real good relationship as, as opposed to like non-business</p>

<p>(inaudible 0:35:34.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's about your I think it's your tenth but I may have counted wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah a tenth right because that's ah Thursday. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So ah well that should pretty well find but it really isn't, you know, and ah, you know, while, while you're getting to know me from me talking to you I'm also getting to know you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah (0:36:04.8) the only the only way I see us of getting into or ever being able to talk to these without being driven to me would be of desperation. It would just ah, you know, it has got to develop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has just got a matter of time and everything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And getting, you know, more, more use to, to saying things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either, either that or (inaudible 0:36:36.7) come just myself but ah, you know, ah there is more to be gained by talking about the same thing as is by learning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the and the the think are like that. I could convince myself that nothing bad has really happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But to talk but I'm not sure, I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be in the denying from everything that you feel to do that right (inaudible 0:37:16.3). At this stage if you were to convince yourself of that it would mean kind of shove aside some qualms you have about that course of action.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, uh-hum. And ah I don't know I think it would be sort of questionable to ah to uhm to do something that I feel is not sure about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Just seem like doing violence to your own ah reactions. (0:38:00.9) Force yourself I think. Yeah. Exactly. I believe really shoving those things aside and just forcing yourself to do something you don't particularly want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't see how (inaudible 0:38:17.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, you know, to sort of set things back you can make me very (inaudible 0:38:25.9) ah I, you know, just don't really see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, what to gain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unfortunately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of ah the way you don't try and push me, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm if I'm reluctant don't want to do the same things to myself because ah sort of because I think that ah that you think I should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That wouldn't be much better then ah then you doing it yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Better in the sense it wouldn't be much better in the sense of what it would still really bother you? No point to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, no it don't really bother me but just all of a sudden it, it ah might make me use that for something like just the fact that ah that your presence made me feel that I shouldn't feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. Kind a wash it out and have to feel like (inaudible 0:39:59.1) talk about these things just because it's (inaudible 0:40:08.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that some kind of question. Wonder when I, you know, don't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know in, in a way talking about it like we have as far as like the problem as feelings go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Worked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I'm making a big thing about not talking about them rather than just yeah, yeah I'm talking about them and go on and talk about something else. Just making this big like thing of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it make it worse for you do you think it makes more </p>

<p> (inaudible 0:40:54.6) or what? What is sad about talking about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, actually in a way it's sort of ah maybe ah is, is revealing that come close to (inaudible 0:41:25.1) but I attempts to talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just, just the fact that ah that I can talk about before I don't talk about these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really getting lost. As far as that, you know, getting lost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just lost.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to tell you what you're talking about or is it like you want to say lets drop the discussion. (0:42:06.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, at this point just drop it. Yeah, I'm not yeah drop it what's the point in going any farther like this then what I was talking about (inaudible 0:42:25.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it seem like it was (inaudible 0:42:28.3) to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just the last thing might have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe not (inaudible 0:42:37.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it was like let me just ask one thing is it like thinking ah maybe I made a mistake by even telling her that I care about this, this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible 0:42:49.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's uhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the mistake?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I ticked her off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah generally ticked off just ah you're probably aware of things like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, most people probably have, you know, ah feelings about things ah about these sort of things and, you know, like and the fact that, you know, like I say very conspicuous by their absenteeism when people don't talk about them I suppose, I don't know. Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That part no I mean certainly people are sensitive about what they want to talk about and feel more positive about something that has been over it I don't think I personally don't go through any kind of problems where, where I say oh so and so isn't talking about x therefore anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, but, but uhm I guess that general point isn't so much an issue it's whether, whether you're interesting about tipping me off about you as more exclusively. (0:44:09.8)</p>

<p> And what would something that would be bad about that I'm not clear on what, what would be bad about that. Like what would I do with that, that</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can imagine would happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ah, ah now you know I have more well now you know I'm hiding something and ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know is that how you see it? I don't see that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As something that I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in a sense that I'm avoiding talking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not I'm not hiding anything but ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.(0:45:02.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ah I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I explicitly know that there is that there is things that you don't want, want to speak about here in the (inaudible 0:45:20.1) right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know whether that is so bad any more.</p>

<p> Ah, ah, you know, like I said you're not like most the immediate pressing problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But they, they just sort of ah, you know, sort of complete the picture of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like I have these problems that I that I have sort of talked about ah (0:46:02.6) ah, you know, like they could all be solved pretty much without going into these other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But these other things somehow might make it easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For you or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not the correct the counsel isn't really on that like one on the one hand you said to yourself well I don't need to deal with any of that I can deal with these things separate from that it doesn't go these things over here don't really matter, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet there is a way in which they do seem to matter to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do seem important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's a problem </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:46:49.0)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do have some (inaudible 0:46:52.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not really just to say oh or you can't say oh they don't matter period.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they, they don't ah I don't know what they are, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, but do you have a sense of how you reacted and that whole packet it seems when I'm talking to you like instead of just you do seem to have a sense anyway of, of what of what goes into of what you're not wanting to talk about things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I have a sense </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you said (0:47:59.8) oh you decide what, what's in that package and I was saying well yeah but you still there's, there's what is in that package and then there is kind of a separate thing to what we've been talking about like what you how you feel about that package how you feel about talking about that package here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just best to say that uhm anything I said about the (inaudible 0:48:28.1) I don't have realized are things that I have already talked about and if I said I don't I don't even know why I said it to you because I don't know whether it's the truth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like about the various problems I have and the ones I have and.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of a sudden yeah I think it's</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is more like </p>

<p>PATIENT: Garbage and I just said it because ah I don't know (inaudible 0:49:00.4) like trying </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're trying to put it together and that isn't that isn't the way it turns out that's not the solution but like they still those pieces and it seems like some kind of argument anyway you needed between like, you know, very loosely and I don't know really what, what specifics are and, you know, in a way, you know, not wanting to talk about this stuff were some of the reasons that we (inaudible 0:49:33.1) in life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or else maybe some other reasons that you haven't quite gotten to but (inaudible 0:49:37.9). You know, I really wanted to sit back on that and not and some kind of and on the other hand there is some kind of pressure to talk about those things or there is something someway that you do want (inaudible 0:49:55.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, yeah. I try I don't know (inaudible 0:50:04.2). I acknowledge the fact that I have sort of been avoiding you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah I also my, my notation that's ah being ah anything like that I mean I'm suppose to, to avoid things if I can whatever you want to call it and ah, you know, for those, those reasons for that reason I sort of feel like I should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no I'm just sort of getting a that's all I need is to during parts of this discussion this discussion ah I had this I, I left the whole thing like get blown out of proportion in my mind so that the things I was saying would bore on like it's inflated view of the manager (inaudible 0:51:15.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: May</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, you know, I just started thinking about these other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they fill my whole mind and for that to assume the most important thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And therefore I said things ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which gave them greater importance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum, like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: An example, like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that gave it greater importance then you think it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I tried to link it up with, with the other things and ah I talked about well at one point I was saying about the degree ah the length that I went to explaining why I didn't talk about things (0:52:10.0) made them, you know, like really revealed the true ah importance of those things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. And now you're saying well maybe, maybe that's not the.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just maybe it's just the thing that there was something in my mind at the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so and became so large then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Those, those things I'm not talking about aren't all like say the thinking not talking about aren't all of you. Not all of you are concerned that you have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not, not all. It's more like I don't, don't wish that you get the idea that ah that comparable and magnitude of other things. Ah, because ah there are actually probably quite a bit smaller and I just sort of elaborated allowed my mind to it's like they were important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don't I don't I just don't understand about all in your mind and you think they're important. I don't</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I understand that you don't want me to get the impression (0:54:02.3) that, that the things you aren't talking about are uhm the only things that really bother you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you're also saying something about what happened in the course of this talk and that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I'm not clear of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More, more than they are not the only things that bother me they are ah actually these sort of things are less important or smaller.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something like that. Then it does they're more side issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:54:47.1). And that during the course of talking this afternoon ah I sort of filled up my mind with these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And excluded the others and didn't think about the others. (0:55:01.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pushed them all away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As if I didn't have them and so all I as left was ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just sort of an awareness of all these, these side issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Like you</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so they seems like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very prominent and</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible 0:55:19.4) issues it's liked having turned your, your head from, you know, all the way all here </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything, everything in the room is really around you right? Well, your head is over here and it seems you have tossed that up until now and then you kind of turned your head the other stuff is all there and now you're reporting on just what's over here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want me to think is that like, like the experience of what it was like it's such a change in focus that you report that it's like attending to completely different aspects of what's going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well such a change in focus but everything that has been in the dark a portion or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. (0:56:01.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it wasn't like having the true picture of everything in its proper </p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Setting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like just all this stuff over here was much magnified.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was all what is in that picture.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't they have sort of things where, where people are deprived of, of color or something like and when they see colors I don't know they are not true or something, they are not true colors or ah I'm trying to think of an analogy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it won't work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what's the thing that you're trying to analogy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just, just the fact that ah I'm looking at a different thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. You're looking at a different thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why when you're so use to looking at something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're so use to one thing</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And trying to help you </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it like takes you over almost. Takes you over it's own it's kind of overwhelming though and kind of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just looks so much bigger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to think of well ah you might say that</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you have been</p>

<p>PATIENT: If (inaudible 0:57:15.0) look at yourself (inaudible 0:57:17.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you have gone into the big city blindfolded and ripped off the blindfold and then look in front of you (inaudible 0:57:23.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would probably much bigger then it does to someone who has lived in New York all their life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum, uh-hum. It's like being I see so it's like another analogy to it might be say you were in uhm dim light all the time so you take two different people one has been in dim light all the time and the other one has been in this kind of light all the time then you both put them out in the hall one is going to see the whole staff and one is going to see the </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, until they advise </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's almost like your, your experience you have been in one kind of room </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. (0:58:01.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your own big problems that, that you have been talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:58:05.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you turn your and looking at them and you turn your attention to where the illumination is really different and everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is just overwhelming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's pretty good. Well it was interesting talking about the </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, sort of reason why I feel like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's a think like that and that's ah I don't want to call it education but it is anything less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You learned something from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I learned something from that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you learn.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just sort of what was said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I sort of like </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing you were asking though yeah like you were asking out of those reasons only you didn't really recognize that those were the reasons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean I have been acting out of those in the past.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I never analyzed them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like discovering something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where as before I just thought well ah I do have something (inaudible 0:59:19.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With a 50 year old man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. Of course</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like saying it was a course and now you understand that that there are some reasons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I even I never said anything I have also certain part of the time, you know, like I, I came in for sort of a pretty good more reasons why I (inaudible 0:59:42.6) deal with the contemporary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Regardless of sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are those things you don't want, want to speak about or is that something that just wasn't a an open thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:59:54.9). Yeah, just never got around to it, you know (1:00:07.0). We did alright with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there is interesting to see anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. So you found out the things you told and not some others that are kind a neat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. And it's also plus you were saying ah about, about being just not being (inaudible 1:00:32.6), just sometimes it wasn't, you know, like when I was talking about (inaudible 1:00:36.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ah how easy and deceptive depends on for how much I get into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like it can be (inaudible 1:00:50.6) it won't be engrossing if I let it (inaudible 1:00:56.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. But is that to say this kind of thing did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah also very badly getting, getting ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of like until you get into something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like oh no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, why I don't talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 1:01:18.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. You had to think about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, talking (inaudible 1:01:24.3). Until until you actually get started it's kind </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not very engrossing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we could have a few pleasantries if you think that would help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think that would, would make a difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no just because I have already noticed it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it might it might have it might have been nice, you know, in the beginning to the just sort of like fall into it, you know, (inaudible 1:02:04.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all of a sudden you find yourself talking about that might have been alright but ah I'm sort of use to it the other way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I would recognize the pleasantry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the only thing about it is, you know, I don't know about this just falling into like that I mean you kind a I, I can't decide it's like in a way not even well okay talk about the right in the middle then there is never a transition that noticed so you have to wait to gain.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't think there is no circus. I mean like</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I doubt, doubt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We can talk about the weather and how terrible it was to go in from the weather to like (inaudible 1:02:50.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, some sort of a class and all of a sudden there is a terrible the teacher was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About how the terrible the school is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun, well it's a viable </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the sort of thing I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, it might not be</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if that would be easier for you I mean, you know, I mean not (inaudible 1:03:10.2) but if it's easy for you to do something to just start talking on that kind of level and move yourself into and talk like that, that's even.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think it would be at this point no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I would like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To make yourself talk like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible 1:03:30.7) it more like walk in and get down to business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it seems to me a little less tricky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not as many </p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of a deception (inaudible 1:03:40.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You think it's a social call but it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. I see like saying okay lets just be up front it's not a social call.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, again, there are no identifiers.  They don't know who you are or who I am.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Transcribing that is lengthy.  Transcribing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny, I mean, some sections are—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they must be very professional.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've done a few where I think, wow, that's, you know, it's, I mean, some intense stuff happens in a shrink's office.  Hey, you see what happened in the news?  This, uh, the [DEIDENTIFIED], the therapist got, yesterday or the day before, a patient came in and killed the therapist.  East, about [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A patient came and killed the therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Look, it's front page of today's [DEIDENTIFIED].  Here's the guy.  You can take the paper after.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's spreading like wildfire through the shrink team, the [DEIDENTIFIED] shrink community.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was a brutal murder, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's his name?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the therapist was a woman and then he also, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, the therapist was a woman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hurt the psychiatrist who was there too, came in to help her, some [AGE] psychiatrist, who we all kind of know.  And he was, he's in critical condition.  You know, you think things like this happen more, you know, with the amount of therapy that goes on in the city, you never hear about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Almost like a bomb in Israel or something, you know, it's a rare event, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I agree with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's big news when it happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, yeah, you would expect that it would happen more often.  I mean, something, some incidence, you know.  Something really scary and some people are unstable I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I saw you [DATE].  Your mood was much better.  Remember, you had relapsed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just before that.  Your mood was far better on Effexor 150, your mood was okay.  You weren't especially sad or anxious or irritable, you were getting pleasure.  But there was a flatness too.  And we decided to raise it.  Is that correct or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we stayed on 150.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But we talked about it.  I have a question mark here, raise to 225, so we did not go up to 225?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you've been on, how have you been?  I mean, now I haven't seen you through Thanksgiving, Christmas, I mean, through the whole season, so kind of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Finally, I called this week and I was hoping that you could see me because I said, well, I don't want to go another month or two also because I needed medication and the whole thing, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So well inch me through.  So it's really five months.  So how did fall go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, generally speaking I have been okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood's been fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of the time you're not sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most of the time I'm not sad.  Let's take it one by one and I need to think a little bit about which one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Much of the time, and remember when we're talking about mood disorders, we're not really talking about mood.  We're supposed to feel mood, right?  Life happens, you feel things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something, you know, something happens you get sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I'm not [INAUDIBLE] other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something happens you get anxious.  A mood disorder is when the regulation of those moods is off, and so the switch gets stuck in a mood.  Something happens legitimately we get sad, but it's that you can't dig out of the sadness or you can't dig out of the anxiety.  That's what I get concerned about.  And arbitrarily we give it two weeks of sadness before we start calling it a depressive episode.  And you need more than just sadness, you need sleep, appetite, concentration, self esteem, energy level, thoughts of death, moving, so, you know, you've been through these episodes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think by now I can sort between one or the other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the switch is not stuck.  That's good, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So generally you're not sad, you're not anxious, you're not irritable.  Correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your appetite is normal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you getting, you're losing weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, pretty much within the plus/minus 5 pounds that we all swing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, especially in wintertime, you know, it's kind of a hibernation mode.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  It really went up a little bit during wintertime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The shorter days are tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does your mood flatten a little bit with the shorter days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not this year.  Some years it has and I guess we talked about it, but not this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Um, in the beginning of the night you're able to sleep, you get to sleep, you stay asleep, you wake up when you need to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  That's why I take the Klonopin though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, so, I mean, there is some [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your nighttime dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One mg and that's been for years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It basically stays there.  Sometimes I have taken another one during the day, um, for, you know, because I am anxious or something.  But I would call that an occasional, um, event.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll call that PRN, as needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that, since you cannot give me the [INAUDIBLE] to do it, sometimes I do it but it's not, it's not often really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eh, it's good to have around the house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, it's not like, like I feel I need it the other day or something, you know.  I have it, by no means I can stay on a 2 mg dose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so your sleep is okay.  Your energy is decent, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  The energy is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're exercising?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel helpless or hopeless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it hard to concentrate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you able to get pleasure normally?  Enjoy things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of things you been enjoying, piano?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  I've not been able to play a whole lot.  I have been very busy doing other things, but yes, yeah, I enjoy, you know, I was thinking about that today.  I enjoy things like, um, going to my gym or listening to music or, um, read the paper, or listening to NPR, things like that.  You know, it's just small very pleasurable things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So you're getting rich, robust enjoyment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That has been fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So now we've got our data out of the way.  How are you with your life, what's going on?  And I want to hear about your love life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] date tonight but I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, we have our group of guys in the office, we haven't seen each other for a while so we say, well, let's all get together one night and we just pick, happened to pick tonight.  Obviously no one cares, you know.  I just realize that no one really cares.  So it shows what happens, you know, most of us it's an irrelevant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  I mean, and same here, unless [INAUDIBLE] joking with a friend that we're going to go to dinner, the problem is sometimes finding places today because they do have, jump into these package deals and, you know, they dress up the menu a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean for Valentine's, like New Year's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, charge more.  But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the flowers are quite expensive, quite pricey.  Well, do you have a girlfriend these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what happened?  There was someone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That never went anywhere.  But that was a while ago.  Yeah, six months, about that, I don't know.  No, it just, no, nobody has really like identified, no, it just hasn't happened.  Fortunately I'm very open to it, I would like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a friend that I hang out with, um, but no more than hang out.  We just, we are sort of neighbors and we go up to the, and she calls me a lot and I call her a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is like [AGE], very young looking, very beautiful woman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's age appropriate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  I mean, she's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she cute?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very beautiful.  Very beautiful.  This one is really very beautiful.  At the same time we both have like friends like, you know, I don't care if she flirts with somebody else or vice versa, I know about her friends and her lovers or whatever.  And the feeling's kind of mutual.  We kind of, we even took a trip together.  She went to Columbia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was there and she said can I go one week, and I said of course.  It's kind of a companion but it doesn't go beyond that.  So the more romantic part is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you stay in a hotel together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  We stayed in the same bed together one night because that first night I worked, there wasn't a room with two beds.  And we made love once.  And it was consensual.  I mean, it was, and it was nice.  But it was never repeated so far.  It's a very strange relationship that we've got.  It's like we really care for each other but she's very noncommittal you would say.  And, uh, not somebody, I mean, she's got a lot of [INAUDIBLE].  It's not like I'm really interested in a relationship with her either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you in love with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No, I think I feel a lot of affection for her, but I wouldn't call that love.  No, really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're very compatible with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, at the, going out [INAUDIBLE] a little, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's her name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her name is [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I don't care last names.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we're compatible to kind of go out and that's about it.  And life is a little bit messy and it's not a person that I probably would feel comfortable being with all the time.  She just, she drinks a lot and you know how much, what is my relationships with the drinks I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She drinks every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A couple of cocktails every day without any problem.  She has a job that's very cozy.  She has like a little spa in the village and like they do laser hair removal and more like for women not for men.  That pays very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She owns it.  [NAME OTHER] makes a fair amount of money.  She can make $1000 in a day easily.  So she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know going to school all those years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She must be a good business person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If she owns it or runs it, no one's handing over money like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very shrewd, very shrewd.  So [NAME OTHER] works from like say three to seven and then the rest is her time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just administratively?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she actually sees people.  A lot of them, she keeps a very hands on approach to it, but she has assistants at the spa.  She does well with little effort.  And that's where the story stops so basically she has a lot of [INAUDIBLE] concept, she has no problem in saying let's go out to dinner and, you know, she can very well stay up until one or two and on a daily basis that's difficult to sustain for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does she live nearby?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she lives like ten blocks away.  So it's kind of a convenient neighbor and fun and, you know, the kind of person you can call at eleven and say are you busy, let's go out for a drink or something and she will say of course I'll be there in a second or vice versa.  It's a fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she's that kind of friend.  And I imagine that if either of you got very in touch with someone else—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing would happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would see it coming and want—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just close the door for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's very popular, she's very beautiful, of course she gets a lot of hits, so to speak.  I couldn't care less.  I couldn't care less.  Really.  So that shows me that I'm not really in love with her.  Nor would I be comfortable because, um, [NAME OTHER] is not exactly a homemaker in the basic sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's a bit of a lush, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Need to be careful.  If she's not alcoholic yet, she's on the way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  She says she's not, when we have talked about kids she says, oh I'm still drinking, you know, she loves it.  Whereas I always say, [NAME OTHER], maybe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She Irish?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she's [INAUDIBLE].  I think that's her [INAUDIBLE] qualification, so I think that Slavic defaults.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Robust.  Robust [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, she's not robust for some reason, but she could be normal.  She's not a frail person.  She's not fighter either or anything like that.  She's actually very beautiful.  But she's more in the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stout.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she can take, she's very strong and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably drink me under the table.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She could probably drink me under the table.  She can probably really drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] drinks easily without much trouble.  Um, doesn't mean that it doesn't do her any damage, you know.  I'm sure she, you know, she doesn't feel well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So your love life is not where you'd like it.  That'll turn around for you.  You're an attractive guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  That's a good assessment.  I miss having somebody, you know, like a more of a romantic flavor kind of thing, but it's not something that it's, that preoccupies me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, um, how's the work going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The work is going well.  It's going to be two months now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you going there everyday, to the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, actually I'm doing most of the time from home.  Um, unless—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's the same company that kind of latched on to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, uh, now we have a little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you still an independent consultant to them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do you go through the temp company?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I contracted right through, directly with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's more or less forty hour week?  I mean, it's a forty hour week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it reaches that, the idea is that it was going to be twenty but there has been so much work, between twenty and thirty.  There have been a lot of work.  We are working on a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're able to make twenty to thirty hours what you normally would with a forty hour week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have much more control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you have to buy your own health and that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  That, I take care of that on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And tax time you have to pay both sides, right?  You have to pay employer and employee stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I, no, I don't think I am double taxed if that's what you mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, it's not really double tax, but if you're self employed, do they just give you a check and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they don't withhold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't withhold, yeah, so when it comes tax time you're going to be responsible for the full, it's 8%.  Whatever the Social Security is, I know this 'cause I do this, you have to be responsible for both sides of it.  Usually it's shared between employer and employee.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, correct.  Correct.  Usually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It gets called employment tax, but it's essentially Social Security.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What you mean is that when you are fully employed with somebody that somebody pays part of your tax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They pay, pay half of the Social Security tax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they value that into your salary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe, but don't forget you're going to get hit with a big tax bill based on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You pay estimated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Quarterly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You pay estimated, so you're paying it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We estimate [INAUDIBLE] and I estimate the money, but I don't send them equal payments because my salary is like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's boom and bust, yeah, yeah.  They allow if it doesn't meet threshold, you know, you're allowed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was careful.  The last check was pretty much trying to meet their needs 'cause they want 80% of the taxes that you owe at the end of the year.  I think it's 90, but they are a little bit lax about it.  So if I would owe anything, I would owe the 20% that they haven't received for it.  Although, you know, but of course you try to be very careful in a situation like mine is to try to claim as much expenses as you can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Supposed to have zero income at the end.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hope you have a corporation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do, and I keep every receipt, uh, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Expense out the wazoo.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] everything away.  And medical is a little difficult isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true, but I still have, since I'm not [INAUDIBLE] I still have her insurance plan and my insurance is ridiculously cheap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is employed with a university.  They have Blue Cross Blue Shied for $22.00 a month each person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I choose my own doctors that I want.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's one of those old contracts, the reason why some states may be broke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, this is really out of, I used to pay $11 and this is [INAUDIBLE] insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Outrageous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  It's ridiculous, that's why some people are in trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you ever going to lose that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In theory no, because two things.  We wrote it down, she wrote it down in the last form that we did, he will, he's entitled to keep insurance as long as I want, even if we are divorced.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  As long as she works for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, as long as she works for them.  And as long as she wants, yes.  'Cause she may want to remarry.  Number two, she just wrote me a note that in the state of [DEIDENTIFIED] now where she lives or [DEIDENTIFIED], one of the two, where she works, it's official, like you can keep it forever.  If it's written in your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  So they protect like spouses that have, you know, whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like if I had agreed to give her $1000 a month for life because, you know, I want to be nice to her.  And she wants to, I mean for her, it doesn't cost her anything.  I send her a check every year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know what that kind of coverage would cost you at $500 a month easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I expect that if I go in to my own insurance it would be five hundred to a thousand a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, the other kill in [DEIDENTIFIED] it's two or three times higher than anyplace else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [DEIDENTIFIED] must be much cheaper so if you ever had to do it, you'd want an address not in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.  Uh, [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, I have, I'm ready eventually.  I thought I was going to lose it once the divorce came through, and no, apparently not.  No, it's a great deal.  It's a great deal.  I mean, it's a great deal for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And for you it gives you the freedom to be an independent contractor.  You know, that's often what tips the balance for many people, losing medical, but also big companies get much cheaper medical.  Individuals get reamed.  When, you know, I when you have to buy your own medical it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] for some kind of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus you're not with a group.  But even with a group, even with a large group if you had to pay a COBRA or something it would be three, four, five hundred a month.  As an individual it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  This is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially [INAUDIBLE] it's criminal what they charge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just subsidizing, you know, people in their eighties and nineties in the last two months of their lives.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, it's a complex system, right?  Without saying much.  Um, yeah, my fee's so low that sometimes we both forget about it.  I mean, like I forget to give her or I send her a big check and I say this covers a year.  Used to be eleven dollars a month.  It went up to twenty two, I know that much, for the individual, for each one of the two.  That's nothing.  And this is, um, a plan that [INAUDIBLE] book this thick, which of course in a case like yours I don't use that, but for a cold or something of course I can.  Or you go to your [INAUDIBLE] and they reimburse you a very decent rate, like seventy, eighty percent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Like these bills you send in to them and they reimburse?  That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they don't reimburse the whole thing by any means, you know that, but they reimburse at least sixty percent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have some multipliers are like if they allowable blah blah blah, and then you end up at 50, 60%.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it was a good move for you to be an independent contractor.  It gives you freedom and lets you work less.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] [DEIDENTIFIED] more and your interests and all that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I still want to, I still want to move into the city, move to [DEIDENTIFIED], which I think is kind of re—entering the orbit, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are prices coming down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, but I'm not looking right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would rent or buy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I was kind of gearing to buy, but I actually don't want to buy at this point.  I mean, I want to [INAUDIBLE], the whole thing.  I really love economics and all that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hard to get mortgages these days.  They've tightened up [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true, although I probably wouldn't have a problem there.  I still am a little bit uneasy with the value of the properties now.  I think if I wait six months or something I will see a little bit clearer what's going on.  I mean, the [INAUDIBLE] effect of this is huge.  It's reaching re—insurers, you know, and [INAUDIBLE] and the [INAUDIBLE] companies that insure like bond, it's huge.  It's huge.  And I think we, it's not only the sub prime people any longer.  And [INAUDIBLE] it's not going to affect [DEIDENTIFIED], it may, may not, but I may be able, if I wait a little bit, to kind of [INAUDIBLE] of the market that maybe, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll find someone who's desperate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, in any case I think it's a bit confusing now, the whole picture.  I mean, it's not like I'm being cheap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I agree, it wouldn't be the time to make a move.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of the worst time.  I mean, we always say it's bad because everybody always says it's bad for one or another reason.  But this is one time where it's, I'm not sure, I haven't really [INAUDIBLE] about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, well, it strikes me that you're in pretty good shape mood wise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You tell me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to, and I have touched on this several times with you.  I go back and forth with it, but this is something I want your [INAUDIBLE] and okay.  Um, the only thing that never goes well with me is this if I drink and have medication together.  It just doesn't go well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially Effexor.  Effexor is not the best friend of alcohol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let me tell you.  It has, the next day is both emotionally difficult and even physically difficult like, you know, the chest feels, you know, [INAUDIBLE] or I can't single handedly attribute that to alcohol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, it's the interaction.  If you really needed to drink, we'd switch you to something different from Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why can't you just drink in moderation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's true.  That's true.  I mean, and that brings me, you know, when I have exceeded my quota so to speak as I say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is your quota?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would say two or three drinks at the most with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you get more intoxicated than you would without the Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, two or three drinks is not going to do anything for me.  I mean, if I have them at twelve o'clock at night and I get up at six I would feel it.  The problem is that, you know, I live alone and I normally live alone at home, but I sleep a lot.  So if I wanted a more social [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even a girlfriend or a family or something.  [INAUDIBLE].  But here alone—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just pour another drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who cares?  I mean, you're having a good time and the show is good, you just, I have to be careful with that because it comes with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many nights a week do you drink?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm really watching it now.  To the point that if you asked me now I would say one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One night a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's my voice mail.  It's a little bit sissy.  I can see this little bubble comes up tells me who's calling and, uh, and when they leave a voice mail it goes onto the system, I just click it and the voice, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It goes as a file?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As a file, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a wav file.  And what is your [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, Verizon, but this is called Verizon [INAUDIBLE].  And then as the calls come in, here are all the incoming calls.  And so as they come in I right click and I put the person's name in and then it kind of saves all the names of everyone who calls me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A caller ID panel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fantastic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so I don't have to listen for a phone number or anything, I just call them right back.  And we get the bubble, the balloon, in real time, as the call's coming in.  So often [INAUDIBLE] 'cause I see who it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's good when you're traveling, when you're not, you know, it's good when you have just the computer and nothing else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As opposed to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sitting in an office.  I mean, if you're sitting in the office and the call comes in you can listen to the voice mail.  But here you don't need the phone or anything, you listen to voice mail through the computer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Through the computer, yeah.  One of my clients like that, it goes as an e—mail to my e—mail account.  So when you're traveling, what do you have with you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a mobile.  I travel a lot.  So it's good, it works out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean, [INAUDIBLE].  The technology on the mobile device, I went to Sony yesterday and I saw these computers like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, smaller and smaller.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very expensive.  They are trying to reach [INAUDIBLE] between the real size of a laptop and the real mobile device.  You know, doesn't really have [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two more years and they'll get there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But anyways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The alcohol issue.  If it really is important to you, we can switch you from Effexor to something else that you'd be able to drink better with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is it the Effexor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Effexor just does not mesh well with alcohol.  It's always been Effexor.  We could switch you over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your ejaculation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Great.  I don't have a lot of chance to try it with somebody else, but, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you're alone you're fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I wouldn't think it's out of order.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, look, so the voice mail just came in.  I just click on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So you can play it.  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, I'm playing what she just left just now.  This lady may be better if she left a voice mail with the doctor that she's seeing, but she's leaving a voice mail on another doctor's thing.  That's a little more information [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, that's fantastic.  I mean, I have something similar but [INAUDIBLE].  The only thing I have is that if somebody leaves a message in my work phone, it goes as an e—mail to my e—mail account.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.  So you live and breathe your e—mail, and so then, you know, it's always that one place where you're always, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I had a Blackberry, I lost it, and I'm getting another one.  I was able to do everything from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I mean I can—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You click on the wav file, you hear the voice mail they left you, don't have to call in to put in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For that particular line.  I mean, somebody just called my cellular phone, it's the same library, so the message will be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, those things have advantage.  I had a [INAUDIBLE] I had it for a month, then I lost it in a car.  Going back to the Effexor, um, now this is something to think about.  I mean, I'm very afraid of, you know, the Effexor has worked so well, but I would, we need to try something else.  The one thing that I have been, I get very overworked.  I have been a little bit like racy and the Effexor always pumps me up a lot.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Racy, high energy, racing thoughts, talking too much?  Manicy type?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I would say that I'm not managing myself at the best pace is perhaps the best way to describe it.  Like the pressure gets to me in a way that, you know, I lose the full ability, not the ability, to like create some sequentializing, say, to like really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get a little disorganized?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get a little racy and disorganized, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And on those nights do you sleep well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I sleep very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sleep normally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's one of the things I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you talk too much, do you get grandiose or elated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but sometimes I may, I wish I had a more reflective pose before, posture before certain issues rather than the degree of involvement that I take, and I attribute that directly to a poor reaction to the pressure basically.  I don't think I have lost the ability, I just think that I'm poorly reacting to the pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, now, remember your Effexor dose is lower than we had had you on for many years.  Right, you were on 225 forever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mm, I don't know.  I think we are pretty much reaching the point of which one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on 225 from March '06 until, yeah, March '07 so you were on 225 for a year and doing well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we lower it to 150.  I think on the account of [INAUDIBLE].  Now, I have not exactly, you know, I'm very afraid of, um, and I don't think you are thinking, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Always been Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's always been Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always been Effexor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, never, you know, I think we have the luxury to try something different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  What is out there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the two that are most Effexor like are Paxil and, uh, Cymbalta.  Generic.  For you, given your side effect profile and your interest, Paxil may be a better medicine.  You may have some sexual side effects, but probably no more or less than the Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And how do you, how do we build up, what is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can give you a cross table, go off one and onto the other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd be easy enough.  I mean, the time to do a change like this is when you're doing well, not when you're active, when you're doing well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From the point of view, my only complaint is that thing with the alcohol, and I'm not advocating a solution so that I can drink alcohol.  I'm just, I'm just passing by you the fact that, um, it seems problematic, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If that's the only problem I would suggest you just not drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that has been my solution really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this organization or whatever you're describing may be a little that we're not quite closing the deal with the Effexor and maybe we'll get more out of something different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you are, if you think a change could be, you know, warranted, why not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so.  I think so.  So let's, um, so we'll stop the Effexor and we'll begin Paxil, okay?  And I'll get you up to an equivalent dose, about equivalent to the 150.  With low dose you shouldn't have much sexual side effects.  And you shouldn't have the problem with alcohol.  Hopefully not.  Um, okay, let me write things out.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:05.2) you know why did I need somebody (inaudible at 0:00:09.7) you know. Go to Canada for the whole summer.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Who would that be?

</p><p>PATIENT: Mike Davis. I've never known whether he's telling me the truth or if it's something new that I haven't heard about yet "(chuckles)". Do you know anything (inaudible at 0:00:27.4)?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:31.4) whale [a homegrown] (ph) tooth.

</p><p>PATIENT: [I have no idea.] (ph). I know [I had plans] (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Probably have to give it back.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know I thought of the kids (inaudible at 0:00:56.8) realize they've been so many more places than I have that I kind of defer to their judgment "(chuckles)" sometimes. A whale tooth, okay, it's a whale tooth.

</p><p>Well, do you have anything you want to tell me "(chuckles)"?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you like (inaudible at 0:01:44.6)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I was really upset yesterday, and the day before because Jim was just ignoring me. He wouldn't talk; he wouldn't sleep in the same bed. And it just... it really kind of angered me. And now it's just like something a three year old would do. And one night I... I mean it didn't occur to me until Tuesday night when I got into bed and he got out of bed that this was what he was doing. And it really infuriated me because he was acting like a spoiled child. He just wouldn't talk and I didn't even know I'd done anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You hadn't known (ph) that anything was wrong at all.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I knew that he was obviously displeasured over something but I didn't know why. 0:03:06.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't know that (ph) anything was you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I presumed, I mean everything he gets mad about has to do with me but I figured that maybe he should say, "You really bug me and I wish you would cut it out," whatever it was. And it turned out it was the same old thing. And I had no idea that I had done anything in bed that had upset him. And then he said last night that it really doesn't have to be anything very (ph) significant, just any little thing will set him off. And so this time he decided to be moderately cool, and just bitter and hostile. And that really doesn't work very well either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't work very well?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's just very hard to be... I thought he was not doing a very good job of being moderately cool because he was just so obvious about it. When he got out of bed and I said, "You know if you want to go sleep on the couch that's just dandy." And then he said that I was not an empathetic person and I really... I guess I'm really not. I can't imagine how he must feel.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like how do you... feel (ph) in bed is like a mystery to you really?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I... no, not that. It's just how really sick he must be to go through this charade. I think that my first instinct is when you're still a kid and maybe a good spanking would shape him up "(chuckles)". And I really can't put myself in his place and the best thing to do in that case is to just shut up and listen.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, all you can do... it sounds like all you can do is sort of look at him and feel like he's awful immature.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I thought, "The old boy is cracking up." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really going off the deep end. 0:06:02.9

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes I really did. Really I think I can take hostile behavior much better than just being ignored. He would get up from every meal we had and rush out of the house. And it was like he wouldn't even say goodbye to anybody. I mean he wasn't only cool to me it was to the kids too. Come in after everybody's asleep, or come in and take his paper and not say a word. That's really harder to live with than somebody hollering at you. 

</p><p>He straightened out and maybe it'll last for a month or [three even] (ph) but it's just never going to be right if he's going to do this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's not like you say, like he's going to do it... like he may be in remission for a couple of months but it's going to happen again.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can see it always happens.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean he said, "Well my only problem is (inaudible at 0:07:21.8)." That's another thing; I just can't believe that maybe that would be such a big problem if he didn't have other problems that went before it. But then I'm not allowed to say that I have to sit there and say... not make any comment at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that you can't defend yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I mean like I gave [in to him] (ph) for about 30 minutes last night trying to make him see my side of it. And that was... like he'll sit there and listen and that's what he did, he listened but then there wasn't any conversation at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:27.8) he really wasn't listening.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't really know about that. I couldn't talk to him about his hang-ups because then I wasn't just listening I was talking and saying, "Oh that's ridiculous." I know after he said, "That's not exactly what you say to a person." But then I try to say, "I'm not a trained person at all." I don't why if... I'm not just going to sit there; I need a zipper for my mouth. 0:09:07.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When he starts talking you feel really pulled to respond when you shouldn't.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yes. If he's trying to tell me about how he feels, I really... I just can't swallow it. Only instead of going along with it I say, "I just can't swallow that." That's wrong, that's not the way to work your problems out. To not talk to somebody for three days, it's just so dumb (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You're really] (ph) just likely to shake him and tell him that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I did but I really... and even now sitting here I'm going, "I'll try to be different and I won't contradict everything he says." But it never occurred to me that all he wanted was somebody to sit there and listen to him; I thought it was going to be a two-way conversation. And he's right too when he says that if somebody's doing something differently than I do it I say, "Wow, isn't that dumb," or (inaudible at 0:10:43.2). That's really a silly way to do that. That's like anybody that's different than me, I really can't put myself in their place or even just ignore them and say that's the way they do that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sort of have a judgment of everything that's different than you'd do it; a negative judgment.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What is it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's always negative but if I do, probably I remark more about things that are different that I [would call] (ph)...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Dumb?

</p><p>PATIENT: Dumb. 

</p><p>And he said that I like to talk about people, if they're doing something - dumb. And I do and I don't know why. 0:11:50.3

</p><p>I don't think I do anymore than average, whatever that is, or like anymore than anybody else around.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're not like abnormally...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not really care (ph). I guess it's like I don't really care that much "(chuckles)" maybe.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you cared more you'd be cattier (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)" I even take note of what they were doing. I don't think since I've been here that I've really... maybe nobody's doing anything wrong according to me. But I still... I do make a mental note. This woman sent her child to nursery school the other day when he really was sick and I thought that probably wasn't the right thing to do. But I didn't run around and tell it. I didn't meet (ph) anybody [to tell] (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:13:46.0) you just made a negative judgment to yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I mean he obviously didn't feel well and I thought maybe it was more important that she stayed home with the child than go to work. But I don't know really I might do the same thing, I'm so anxious to get my kids out of the house.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So who are you to judge (ph) her?

</p><p>PATIENT: No why should... or am I doing it because when I do that same thing I'll say to myself, "Well she did and nobody said anything."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So giving yourself an excuse ahead of time.

</p><p>PATIENT: And a lot of the things I have said about people I've turned around and done the same thing knowing it was wrong.

</p><p>You know that would really be nice to not think anything bad about people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you not (inaudible at 0:15:37.1) and run them down in your mind?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>Sometimes I think I really sure do know a lot of (inaudible at 0:15:54.8).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could stop thinking them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, just a kind of acceptance whatever they are "(chuckles)".

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:21.3)

</p><p>PATIENT: Loonies, if they are, okay.

</p><p>Maybe it's... I don't have anything else to say too. And some of it is kind of funny but it is derogatory but still in all when you say it people laugh 0:16:52.9

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're saying it's sort of like you're a thing, it's like it fills a void. Like if you didn't... you couldn't have [be carving it] (ph) and critical of other...

</p><p>PATIENT: Right but it isn't even that. It's like I want to tell it because it is funny and there are lots of other things that I could say to whomever I'm talking to. There's always something that maybe they'd be more interested in even but I really do get kind of a charge out of sharing "(chuckles)" sharing (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:48.8) it gives you pleasure.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But you know I don't like those kinds of women and I'm one of them. I guess maybe you never think you're quite as vicious as the next.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But (ph) you have a sneaking suspicion that you are?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>No I don't. I don't think I'm vicious. But I do think I talk too much about other people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes but I thought there was somebody you know that you didn't like and the way he talked about other people. I mean [maybe not that you're] (ph) vicious but...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I mean yes, yes. Just like... even the fact that you're talking about people whether it's vicious or, I mean unless you say, "Wow they're really great people," and let it go at that. I mean if you're going to point out these little things that maybe nobody else has noticed and then they're not missing anything if they don't know. Or if they hang around and maybe they'll find it out and nobody has to tell them and why point it out if they can escape it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So they're like looking on the darker side? 0:19:39.0

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I guess it's kind of like when (ph) my mother was telling about all of these people in her hometown, or my hometown, running around etc... And she said, "Well do you want to hear about it if they weren't doing anything like that?" It's an old habit I got from my mother I guess "(chuckles)". 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Who are you?] (ph) Are you saying to me that's how I'm interesting to other people? Because (ph) that's the kind of thing that's interesting to other people.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know. They all seem to listen so obviously it is interesting to them. I'm thinking like most of them... excuse me I don't know any scandals so the kinds of things that I would tell or repeat would not... they don't make any difference.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're not really important to anybody.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. They're just humorous little incidents that happen to other people. If I'm going to do that I probably should develop a knack for telling jokes "(chuckles)".

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's on the same level, its entertainment and you might as well entertain humorously instead of derogatorily.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm trying to think now of what I say. Yes, I guess it is, it's funny but it's still kind of (inaudible at 0:22:07.7) to people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's funny but at somebody else's expense.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I'm trying to think of the last thing I said.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's funny but it's not funny.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I guess that... I mean it may be funny to me and whoever's listening but to that person it probably wouldn't be too funny, no.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel sort of guilty when you think about the other person.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 0:22:37.5

</p><p>Well not only do I like to tell those things I like to hear them too. I guess it kind of brings people down to my level then if I hear something bad about them, I mean like...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sort of gives them flaws (inaudible at 0:24:22.3) [deal with them] (ph) in some way.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes like they're no better than I am.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:24:34.9) they're bad like I am; they're flawed like I am.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know what I think it really is, is just a habit. Because I don't even think of myself as being stupid or uninteresting anymore but it's just something that you just can't turn off "(chuckles)". You've done it for years and years.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's just sort of automatic. 0:25:12.2

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes and you don't even stop and think about it. I mean you think about the really... there's always the story about a child starting a rumor about a teacher or the janitor in every workers (ph) life, or every once in a while. And like you I think that is really horrid but I mean I'm doing the same thing even if it's true, it still doesn't need to be said.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: True or not it's like the unnecessary gossip monger and you could be hurting somebody gratuitiously (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: You really have to put yourself in other peoples places and I guess maybe that's something [we coined] (ph). It doesn't occur to me at the time I'm telling this that somebody could tell something about me that would be even humorous "(chuckles)" that I've done but still I wouldn't... I don't want it around.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You don't notice] (ph) how hurtful you're being?

</p><p>PATIENT: You just don't really stop and think about it; bringing sunshine into everyone's life at the expense of someone.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feeling kind of valued at the expense of someone in telling the story to entertain everyone [ph). Then all of a sudden it's [starting to] (ph) shift for you [in the terms of you could be] (ph) (inaudible at 0:27:42.6).

</p><p>PATIENT: Actually the last things I've said have been told directly to me and I've just... well it still isn't very important, but it's the truth I just repeat it like she said to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean, that isn't so bad or what? 0:28:15.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I guess this person didn't... she didn't really realize how goofy it sounds. No that really wasn't bad, she was telling about how she got her apartment all fixed up because her husband was a medical student. And she went to the [discount shop] (ph), I mean she went to a gynecologist at Billings (ph) and she just said she was going to pull strings if she had to, she told us (inaudible at 0:29:22.2). That really... to the rest of the students around there they really sound like bad news because all of them in our building, you would expect, they're all working on their PhD's and they all could be called doctors when they're through. So when she got the rest of (inaudible at 0:29:51.2) and somebody asked me, "How did she get that done?" Her painting and I told them that. "(Chuckles)" Maybe if I hadn't of told them what kind of a (inaudible at 0:30:10.8). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [What do you say?] (ph) (inaudible at 0:30:15.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: Let them make up their own minds. It was so funny to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You could have told it snidely (ph) or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well when you have a smile on your face and you say that's it "(chuckles)" it kind of...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Turns the knife over] (ph). 0:30:41.1

</p><p>PATIENT: ...maybe they wouldn't have thought it was so... although one of the girls standing with me and she brought it up "(chuckles)". And I didn't know I thought maybe they had something going that we didn't have. I mean that's kind of beside the point. I will do that, I will, yes. Now I'm going to go home and feel like a rag.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You come in feeling alright and leave feeling lousy?

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)" that's the affect (ph) you have.

</p><p>I kind of think I don't feel bad enough about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really shouldn't feel Chas cent (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: And make it a point from now on not to do that but I don't think I feel that badly about it "(chuckles)".

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You should feel (inaudible at 0:33:09.3). Is that what you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: [I don't think] (ph) whether I really should or not. Well, I should hope so. I sure wouldn't tell me anything. 0:33:47.0

</p><p>COUNSELOR: With a person like you as a friend right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, unless I said this, is a secret or don't mention this or something. But she was very proud of it and I thought, "Well I wouldn't (ph) publicize that." "(Chuckles)"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you were really sort of annoyed with her.

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And sort of wanted to [chew her] (ph) in or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well she's really cute. I do have a real feeling about this girl who was pregnant and made such a big thing out of it, and everybody else in the building moved in by themselves. She's got her stepmother over there working her fat little buns off because this babe can't clean, she can't do anything. And I said to Jim, "Look it really is kind of disgusting, I moved with a 12 month old baby and I was pregnant and I didn't have any help." And he said, "Well, you weren't as lucky as her." And I guess that is kind of an envy but I think that I would have been too, I mean I think that I needed the help more than she did but I still wouldn't go around... I usually would say I work hard, or not even say it but let everybody around see that I work too and that I'm not crippled because I'm pregnant.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes but you heard (ph) envy as her being treated like a helpless princess.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, like a princess, I guess. I don't know what it... I feel disgusted that this little chickie can't do anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Also like she's some kind of (inaudible at 0:35:56.8).

</p><p>PATIENT: She's a little phony.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She still has her hands, and step mom and dad too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like she's going to get everything that she wants. She wants a 90 dollar baby crib and somebody will give you one. They're really going to be tough to live next door to "(chuckles)" because there's going to be packages coming in all the time. But it does kind of get to you when you have hamburger for the fourth night in a row and they're getting something that they really don't need. It's just her little whim.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Little bitch. 0:36:44.6

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)". I don't know though, it is kind of disgusting but I really am... like I laugh at her more than... it seems like she's immature or something and she thinks that she's the only one that's ever had a baby. And the whole family thinks she's the only one, and here her husband is, this big medical student, go get a book and read it "(chuckles)". I just think they're kind of silly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you kind of look down on her she's such a naive chickie.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what she really is she's got a good thing going I guess. But I couldn't even do that, I just wasn't raised that way, it was - don't do it. I mean when my mom and dad came down the first time we moved, or the second time we moved, and I felt a little silly about her helping me. I was pregnant and I was up on the family (ph) washing mats. I wouldn't let my mother get up there "(chuckles)" she's got her own feelings (inaudible at 0:38:15.3).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean to you? That you're better than she is?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I guess I probably would do the same thing. it's kind of... I guess I'm just jealous like nobody thought that I couldn't do... or not that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes but you're saying you wouldn't let your mother up there if she wanted to get up there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well she didn't say, "I want to get up there." She told me to get down and nobody would have done it. I don't know whether she would have climbed up. Well, I don't know, she probably would have said it didn't need doing and it probably didn't. Maybe it would be best to just not even think about her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of put it out of your mind entirely. Put her out of your mind entirely. 0:39:32.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes I think I'll allow myself a secret giggle "(chuckles)" when she comes up with some real goodies. I just won't repeat them, just smother my laughter and go on. But it's like everything I see her do it really is... I mean it's really obvious that she's a young girl and she will probably change and be the, I hate to say normal or like the rest of us "(chuckles)". 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying something like she's not... the way she is, isn't some sort of permanent result of her character but (inaudible at 0:40:33.0).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know but once my neighbor said to Veronica (ph), "Oh it's going to be so nice when you have the baby all of the children will come up." And Veronica (ph) says to me, "Well she doesn't need to think any of the kids are coming in to look at my baby," or "Touch my baby," or "Throw my baby around." It's just so silly because no mother lets their children go up and drag a new baby around. What she meant was the kids will want to come in, look at the baby, touch the baby. They're not going to gouge his eyes out; I mean I just thought that was really a silly thing for her to say. And after she has one of her own and gets a little attachment to it then she will change, you can't help it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She'll grow up in time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I guess she will. But while she's a young lady she is kind of silly "(chuckles)".

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So (inaudible at 0:41:49.9).

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)" yes. Alright (ph) and there are probably millions of her running around and I don't know that I ever was one of those.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?

</p><p>PATIENT: It does make me feel very pleased. I don't have a nervous first child I think because I think I wasn't...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Naive?

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't know what to do with them but the doctor just said, "You take home, you change their pinch (ph), you feed them, you love them, that's it, nothing more." And I just kind of took his word for it and she came out of it alright. 0:42:36.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:42:39.5) sounds like you [give yourself] (ph) being sensible and this gal's sort of flighty and naive.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes but I guess if her stepmother is going to do these things for her then she's going to be like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's being coddled.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes but they make it like she might as well take advantage of it because sooner or later she's going to have that baby and her stepmother is just not going to be around. But then she said, "I just feel so good having you over here and you've raised your children." Oh goodie! "(Chuckles)" that's all I need.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [A daycare workers] (ph) (inaudible at 0:43:34.5)

</p><p>PATIENT: To tell her what... I mean like you don't know what's wrong with her child. It's just got to be your own practically before you really can tell their cries and what's the matter with them. I just don't... I'm beginning to sound like I just don't like to get involved with people (ph). And I used to be, I used to love that, "Wow they came to me for advice." And now it's just, "Do your own thing."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're (ph) all the experts sort of pulled (ph) for you over the years.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's when you begin to realize that you really don't know. And I don't want to take responsibility, I mean if it's a simple little thing fine but if it's something a doctor should look at, I won't even know probably.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you could be... you could do damage without knowing it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, well I mean what do you do if it's just a different little child and I mean I hope to God I'm not around it all the time so I really know it. Well, I'll let her do her own...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:45:01.5).

</p><p>PATIENT: I just... you know she can come in and ask me but I'm not going to know anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're going to play dumb you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well if I know, I mean I'm just not going to present myself as an expert just because I have two children. It might have been luck that they got raised and they didn't have any disease or anything. Get a copy of Dr. Spock and go to it. I mean everybody else has to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So (inaudible at 0:45:35.2) asking you whatever (ph). 0:45:43.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I'd send them down to Jodie "(chuckles)".

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Send them down to Jessica (sp?).

</p><p>PATIENT: If I could. (inaudible at 0:45:54.1) is a medical student too she's got books around there. She didn't get her house painted though. She didn't know what to do I guess.

</p><p>I don't want to get off on a tangent here (ph) because after it's all said and done it's really not very important.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel about it (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I've talked a lot about something that's not really important, I don't feel that maybe it's even going to, in the future, be very important to me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling like you wasted your time on it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Like she's going to be a neighbor that you borrow eggs from but she's a person I don't want to get involved with anyway. You'll never believe why - because she likes to talk about people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like people to talk about you.

</p><p>PATIENT: "(Chuckles)". I mean it's a different way of talking about people, like I could say anything and she believes the worst immediately. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So like she'll do that to you do you mean? Like talk about you...?

</p><p>PATIENT: I just don't want to spend an afternoon talking about people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I see.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean if it's something funny that happened to... you know and you spend two minutes on it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's sort of (inaudible at 0:48:26.1).

</p><p>PATIENT: To spend a whole day...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Catting (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes and you can tell who is and who isn't and she is but I don't want to be around her a lot.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That leaves you feeling sort of dirty or something. 0:48:40.4

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's really kind of hard, I mean here you have this gullible thing and each thing you say she's going to just think the sky is falling, it's hard to turn that off [or turn it down] (ph). And I could see why it's (inaudible at 0:48:56.6) really sitting around, or ripping people up and pretty soon you're going to run out of that, you run out of people. And then you start looking at each other. She'll go home and say, "Wow, she sure likes to talk about people." And I'll say the same thing and you know "(chuckles)" it's [a bad forum] (ph).

</p><p>It gets cold in here.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would it be possible to switch you to two o'clock rather than three? Or is that hard?

</p><p>PATIENT: No it's not. Jim (inaudible at 0:51:32.6) he's going to have his Tuesday and Thursday class, afternoon classes (inaudible at 0:51:41.0) or other days (inaudible at 0:51:43.7).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, you owe me half a (inaudible at 0:51:44.6).

</p><p>PATIENT: Two.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Two times, no. 0:51:46.6

</p><p>PATIENT: Two books, not one. Two (inaudible at 0:51:59.5).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You said he had Tuesday and Thursday afternoon classes, I could see you on one of them, Tuesday and Wednesday, would that be helpful?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, 11?

</p><p>PATIENT: [What time?] (ph) It's really hard when you have (inaudible at 0:52:29.1) three different times to have babysitters because they don't know, I mean I don't know half the time who's supposed to be coming in "(chuckles)". So 11 o'clock on Tuesday.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes with that... would 10 o'clock be better for you? I could switch it to 10 if it would be helpful (ph). It's up to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yes that would be a good time (inaudible at 0:52:53.1). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: See you.

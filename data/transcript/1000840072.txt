<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>Hardy 1: Well, thank you for coming in, and I assume that since you were willing to come in that you had some bug you're wrestling with or concern that I'm sure you want to talk about. I was just wondering if you would give me some sense of what that is.</p>

<p>Phil 1: What that is today?</p>

<p>Hardy 2: Yes.</p>

<p>Phil 2: I don't know, uh, just my relationship with my wife has been fairly intense so to speak lately. She, I need to give a little background. We're both in a 12 step program, and we went to a conference up in Madison, Wisconsin this past weekend, and she kind of got the awakening that she wasn't really working a good program or, you know, living the steps or whatever you want to call it, and she, I picked her up from work, and she dropped me off here, and then she went on her way today, but like everything I was saying, no matter what it was, like was either too loud or too this or too that. It just wasn't quite acceptable for her. Like anything I said it seemed like would you stop, you know, and it was like getting frustrated without saying too much back. So that was kind of something that was a little unnerving today.</p>

<p>Hardy 3: Now is this a part of your, you know, normal dynamic, or was today . . .</p>

<p>Phil 3: Um, not to this extent, let me put it that way. Sometimes like after, she is a teacher, so she has a fairly intense day, and then if I'm loud or intense, she usually asks me to tone it down a little bit, and then you know, but today she was argumentative today and wanted to get in an argument, and I didn't really want to so, that's, I just was keeping quiet, and in the act of keeping quiet, I was like missing questions and stuff like that. Like she would ask me some questions, and I wouldn't answer and then that would irritate her. It seemed like it was a fairly irritable situation today, and I don't know. She actually went to her therapist today after she dropped me off, so it was nice to be able to come here and share with somebody something.</p>

<p>Hardy 4: Do you ever go to her therapist with her?</p>

<p>Phil 4: We used to. We used to live in Madison, and she went to therapy and then I started going to therapy while we were engaged, and then we did some couples' therapy with both therapists, but this is a new therapist for her here, and I haven't even met her yet.</p>

<p>Hardy 5: And how long have you been married?</p>

<p>Phil 5: A little over a year and a half.</p>

<p>Hardy 6: And this bickering you sort of referred to it, how long has that been with the two of you?</p>

<p>Phil 6: It has probably been with us longer than we've been married. I mean it built up, it's a, we use it as a means of communication sometimes, and it doesn't, I don't know how healthy it is, but it usually doesn't get out of hand, but today I felt like it was invading on some of my rights to speak or you know, I felt like it would have been better if I wasn't in the car, but I needed to get here, so. You know, she goes through these phases and she'll talk to whoever she needs to talk to, you know, whether it's a friend, sponsor, therapist or whatever. And she knows what
she has to do. She just feels like she's in a "bad spot" and has to start living spiritual concepts or you know just living a better type life so she can get out of, like she's down here, and she wants to get back up to normal at least you know.</p>

<p>Hardy 7: And where are you in that continuum?</p>

<p>Phil 7: Geez, I think I'm doing alright. I had a bunch of good news all at once, so I was kind of riding high. That doesn't mean I was like spiritually centered, but I was doing fairly well I think, and you know, I could, some aspects I could improve.</p>

<p>Hardy 8: And what are those?</p>

<p>Phil 8: Maybe, I've been, probably pick up on my meetings and also my prayer. I haven't been, normally I was praying like in the morning and in the evening, and that helped out a lot for me, and I haven't, I had just started getting back into the swing of that a little bit before the conference, and the conference was like kind of
a good motivator for that, give you a little boost or whatever you want to call it. Good starting off point again. Kind of drill in some reminders while being there, and you know, I'd like to think that I'm doing really well, but I know that I'm not. I don't know. Like school just started and everything is going real smooth and I'm keeping up on the readings and that's real good for me. Sometimes I tend to get behind right away and then I catch up and then I fall way behind, and then I catch up at the end of the semester, but right now I'm up to par, so it feels real like I said with the job that I got with the hours with that, the money, I haven't gotten paid yet, but the wage is enough so that it will help out our income so I won't have to be worried about that because last semester I was real worried about income, and I got kind of depressed and was out of work, and instead of doing homework while I was home, I was just kind of like being a vegetable, and then I'd like, when my wife was going to be coming home from teaching, I'd like you know get moving in enough time so I wasn't a slug when she got home. And now that's changed, and I go kind of both ways sometimes. I'm best off when I'm doing something it seems. If I have a schedule or a pattern to keep, that helps me, and with the job that I have now I work Monday, Wednesday and Friday and I go to school Tuesday and Thursday and I have a class tonight also. But it's you know so far so good. It seems like I'm starting off well, better than I have in the past.</p>

<p>Hardy 9: That's great.</p>

<p>Phil 9: That's what I strive for, some improvements. So, I don't know if I'm trying to bite off more than I can chew, but you know, it's got to be better than last semester because last semester it was fairly hectic.</p>

<p>Hardy 10: It sounds like you had a lot of worries last semester.</p>

<p>Phil 10: A lot of worries.</p>

<p>Hardy 11: Fortunately it's been raining opportunities for you so far.</p>

<p>Phil 11:  Yes, I was able to get the classes that I want and need for the semester. Financial aid was kind of a mess last semester because they got a new computer system and that gave me incentive to apply for some scholarships, but I found out I had to go through the Financial Aid Office too, and I was supposed to find out like the end of October, and I just found out at the beginning of this month that I had applied for three and I got two of them, so that helps out a lot also with some of the financial worries. I don't know how much I'm going to get yet, but still it's, just kind of along with that the job, the school, and you know, the down part of my life right now is that my wife isn't where she wants to be, and I can't put her where she wants to be. I can't really.</p>

<p>Hardy 12: And how does that affect you, and how does that affect the marriage that she's not where she wants to be?</p>

<p>Phil 12: Well, it, how does it affect me? Uhm, it makes me more like I'm walking on eggshells, you know. I can't be I don't want to say blunt, but I can't be . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 13: Well, do it now. Be blunt now.</p>

<p>Phil 13: Well, I can't just be. I can't like it seems that she's, I get this way too where I'm hypersensitive to things, and it seems like she's hypersensitive to that. Like she commented on how I don't compliment how she looks in the past, and then she goes through periods where I'm still pretty much doing the same level of complimenting which isn't a daily basis. It may be a weekly or every other week type thing. And she's fine with it, and now she's kind of at a point where that's like a big concern for her, because I haven't said how much I appreciate her or how much I care for her or how attractive I think she looks. And sometimes it feels almost artificial when I do say it. You know, it doesn't feel sincere.</p>

<p>Hardy 14: Because she doesn't look that way or because you are saying, because you think she wants you to say it?</p>

<p>Phil 14: Because I know she wants me to say it. And I think of these things a lot of time. I think of compliments and they never come out. Maybe like one in twenty or one in twenty-five will actually come out of my mouth, and I don't know why that is. I guess I could work on some of that.</p>

<p>Hardy 15: What do you think? Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Phil 15: Why do I think that is? The first thing that popped into my mind is, it was a pretty sick thought, to just not say it, you know so she doesn't hear it. Maybe if I don't say it maybe I might try to keep a reserve going, you know, so this amount of not saying it is acceptable so if I just kind of go up to the amount that's fine.</p>

<p>Hardy 16: Is it comfortable saying it?</p>

<p>Phil 16: Sometimes. A couple of times lately with some clothes that she's had they looked really, really nice, and I've told her, and it wasn't hard to say, and it wasn't insincere, and you know it was genuine, and it felt good to say. And sometimes like she'll come home and she'll put her comfy clothes on right away, and she'll
have her same color sweats on, and I think she's cute when she's like that, but I don't.</p>

<p>Hardy 17: After you've seen it a while, it just loses its edge.</p>

<p>Phil 17: Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>Hardy 18: So, you're saying that she's struggling with where she is, and she has some ideals about where she would ultimately like to be, and so I was wondering then, you talked a little about how that affects you because it has you feeling at times like you're walking on eggshells, and then how does that then, when you're walking on eggshells, what consequence does that have on the marriage? What impact does that have on the marriage?</p>

<p>Phil 18: I feel like I need to take on more responsibilities whatever they may be, going to the store, going to the bank, cleaning the house, just so she wouldn't have to do it because like that may set her off. You know, we do a real good job of splitting that up, you know, we have one car, and I'm a full time student, work part time. She goes to work full time, so we do a good job of juggling the car, you know, when we have time or whoever has the car, they are the people that go, and it works out quite well. But I have to run some errands tomorrow morning and I
can't go to the bank, and we need to go to the bank and I felt, I didn't feel comfortable asking her if she'd go to the bank tomorrow after work.</p>

<p>Hardy 19: Why not?</p>

<p>Phil 19: Because I thought it might upset her. I thought she was like going to go off again.</p>

<p>Hardy 20: And what happens when she goes off?</p>

<p>Phil 20: It feels like she's putting me down, you know. "Why couldn't you do this?" or "Why can't you go to the store?" or "Why can't we talk about this later?" or . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 21: And what happens when she puts you down?</p>

<p>Phil 21: I don't like it. I think it's, I don't think I speak up too much because I think it's happened before in my life growing up at home and with peers.</p>

<p>Hardy 22: What happened?</p>

<p>Phil 22: I can't see it a whole lot but other people in my family have noticed it and pointed out to me that I wasn't validated a whole lot or if I was it was in weird ways. Like I'm getting good grades in college, and you know, a compliment my mom might give me is "Oh, I knew you always had it in you." And the way that
feels to me is why weren't you getting these kinds of grades all along, you know, that type of feeling.</p>

<p>Hardy 23: So you can't even enjoy the compliment.</p>

<p>Phil 23: Yeah, it sounds like it's underhanded you know. It has undertones, and just trying real hard to fit in sometimes throughout my life and not really doing it at all.</p>

<p>Hardy 24: So growing up, was your mom often very critical of you, had lots of high expectations for you?</p>

<p>Phil 24: Um, I would assume so, but I really don't know. The best answer I could give you.</p>

<p>Hardy 25: Because you don't know what she expected of you.</p>

<p>Phil 25: I don't know is. . . Well, just because she would like for me to do my best, and I think both my parents were supportive to an extent, but it just, even if I did do well or if I did my best, it just never really felt like I was fully appreciated.</p>

<p>Hardy 26: This was from both your parents?</p>

<p>Phil 26: Yeah, I would say so.</p>

<p>Hardy 27: And who do you feel the most anger toward?</p>

<p>Phil 27: Um, when I talk on the phone I get frustrated at my mom easier than I get frustrated with my dad, I'd say.</p>

<p>Hardy 28: I was curious about your laugh when I asked that question.</p>

<p>Phil 28: Aw geez, who knows. Because I probably didn't want to think about it.</p>

<p>Hardy 31: Because?</p>

<p>Phil 31: You know, there are some parts that are harder to go to than others, and I guess this is a part that I've avoided for a while I think, you know.</p>

<p>Hardy 32: It's a painful place.</p>

<p>Phil 32: Yeah, and for me it might be humor or sleep. I like to sleep to avoid things.</p>

<p>Hardy 33: Does that help?</p>

<p>Phil 33: Does it help? Probably not, but it makes it go away just like drinking used to or whatever. So, it may be a defense mechanism or whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>Hardy 34: But it sounds like, I don't know, tell me if I'm wrong, as I'm sure you will, it's painful to think about your relationship with them or maybe even her and some hurt and disappointment you feel around that relationship.</p>

<p>Phil 34: Yeah, like, I don't know. It's easier for me to just like kind of grin and bear it, take it, than to say anything.</p>

<p>Hardy 35: Because.</p>

<p>Phil 35: That's how I was brought up. I don't know. Grin and bear it or suck it up or whatever.</p>

<p>Hardy 36: Football attitude. And is that attitude rooted in a family tradition, a cultural tradition, or religious tradition?</p>

<p>Phil 36: Probably not religious. You know, probably a little bit of both with the family and culture.</p>

<p>Hardy 37: And what's the culture?</p>

<p>Phil 37: Just the macho high school boy image I guess. That and, I don't know. Overcome obstacles I was taught that if you are going to do something do it 100% and just communicating. It's easier for me to not communicate than to communicate, and I know that's not really healthy, and I know it's not, it really helps our marriage out when we go through tough times when we communicate about it and get to the other side.</p>

<p>Hardy 38: I was going to say that that rule might work if you are out on an island with coconuts and it would make marriage a little challenging.</p>

<p>Phil 38: Yeah.</p>

<p>Hardy 39: So then who do you think you have the most, is your anger toward your mother greater than the anger toward your wife or vice versa?</p>

<p>Phil 39: I probably am angrier at my mom than my wife. It's just, I love her to death, and it's just I guess my expectations of where our relationship would be at this point is not, it doesn't really match up. I have in her eyes disappointed her in certain ways. I got kicked out of college. You know, she supported me through that, you know financially and a little bit emotionally. But I kind of felt like you know that I let the family down and that I let myself down too, but then I didn't really have a wedding where people were invited. My wife and I got married by ourselves in Las Vegas and we told our parents about it, and my parents didn't really take it too well. And I think a lot of that decision has a lot of hostility around it that's not really been worked through.</p>

<p>Hardy 40: Now the decision to do it that way was an expression of hostility or it created a lot of hostility?</p>

<p>Phil 40: It created a lot of hostility. We got married like I said in Vegas and I didn't invite my parents. I didn't necessarily want them there. I didn't really know how to say that to them.</p>

<p>Hardy 41: But I'm thinking that's also an act of hostility.</p>

<p>Phil 41: Could be, yeah. I don't know. You know what I had made up in my mind
was, and I don't know if I still believe this, but it was a spiritual union between
two people and we didn't want to have it tainted by negative energy or by negative
feelings or by people getting drunk or whatever. Because . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 42: Was there any of that in Las Vegas?</p>

<p>Phil 42: Not where we were. You know, we were on our way to San Diego, and we stopped. We planned it, I mean, we stopped on the way and spent two or three days in Vegas and got married on one of them. Saw a couple of shows, had a good time. Then we went on to San Diego where the 65th anniversary of Alcoholics Anonymous and world convention in San Diego, so that was kind of our honeymoon, and it was like a cool thing, you know. I still think it's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Hardy 43: It sounds that way.</p>

<p>Phil 43: And my dad just took it really hard, and I tried to talk to him about it quite a few times, and he said time will heal this. I still get along with my parents, but I think we kind of dance around this, you know, and I think, I don't know how much more I can do on it to resolve it. I think it's more in their court at this point.</p>

<p>Hardy 44: What have you done so far to resolve it?</p>

<p>Phil 44: I tried to make some amends, you know, saying that you, I didn't regret getting married in Vegas, but I regretted the timing of my telling them and the, just the way, I had to hang up on my sister because she was really mad at me, and I thought my mom would be the hard one to deal with. She was defiant at first I guess you'd call it, but then she got more accepting of the fact, and then I didn't really think my dad would react the way he did, but it hit him the hardest, his only son, youngest child, and I guess that meant a lot to him. But he can't really communicate either at all. I do a lot better job than he does to pat my own back, but . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 45: I'm really impressed that you did go back and attempt to talk to him about it.</p>

<p>Phil 45: I sat Beth and I, that's my wife, after we got married, I asked my parents to get together and my sister and my brother-in-law and sat them down at the kitchen table and talked to them about it, and I told them I was scared to tell them and that's why I didn't tell them right away. I told them about a month before and I had known for about five months that this was what I wanted to do, and you know, I wasn't open to any other suggestions. You know, they suggested having a small wedding some place, and you know, I had already made it up in my mind,
and that's what I did. So I was kind of closed minded after the fact. I just when I get in conflict I just want things to be better right away. And I think that's why I may be quiet because I just don't want to stir the pot anymore. I just want the old way. I don't want to have any argumentative tones anymore. I just don't like it.</p>

<p>Hardy 46: And it certainly makes perfect sense to me. I guess the thing I am wondering is that what happens. Not you, but when we don't talk about it sometimes I worry that rather than it going away it just becomes bigger than life, you know, it just takes on a life of its own, and sometimes it seems that it's almost worth enduring the pain and agony instead of sitting in there and painstakingly going through it knowing that at some point you get to the end and it's resolved or it's in a better place.</p>

<p>Phil 46: I've had scenarios like that where it's been rewarding to do that, and I've procrastinated for a while and then gotten my back up against the wall and just had to do that. So I do know from some experience that is the best course of action somewhere up here, but then in here.</p>

<p>Hardy 47: In the region of the heart . . .</p>

<p>Phil 47: Yeah when I feel it is here it's not the same logical thing. I'm just like bye, you know.</p>

<p>Hardy 48: And I was wondering, because you were talking earlier about all these worries you had last semester, that seemed like you were just encumbered with worry from money to you name it. And it sounds like you have been alleviated of some of that. I was wondering just particularly in terms of where we started this conversation, is there any part of you that worries about your marriage?</p>

<p>Phil 48: Yeah. I, you know, I want to be a good husband. I want to be better than a good husband. I want to be a good partner, and we've gone over some hurdles, you know. I had gotten to a point where I was lying about little things and I . . .Caffeine, I get all wired up on caffeine so I try not to drink it, and I was like drinking caffeine and not telling my wife, and that felt like a big lie, and I was like trying to study at night for classes. This was two semesters ago, and then I'd like get up and avoid things and watch TV and stay up late watching TV instead of hitting the books, you know. So I was just kind of in this cycle of, it was kind of getting out of control, and then with the work situation that I had, at that period I was working a lot and going to school a lot but not seeing a lot of my wife, and it blew up one night over dinner when I said I didn't put milk in the cream of mushroom soup that the pork chops were being cooked in, and she knew I did, and at that point in time, you know she was just like "What else are you lying about?" And I pretty much came clean with everything, and in her mind she probably thought I was cheating on her too because if I had lied I might as tell lie. So that took a long time to bridge back together that trust, and for some reason, about three weeks ago she thought I was lying again, and I was just like "Hon I'm not, I'm not lying."</p>

<p>Hardy 49: And what is your understanding about why you lie?</p>

<p>Phil 49: None, I have no understanding of it. You know, the things I lied about . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 50: Now is that a lie?</p>

<p>Phil 50: I think it's the truth. The things I lied about, I lied about the milk because I like it a little better with a little bit of milk in it, you know, and I was ashamed to have been drinking the caffeine so I, like, didn't want to share that.</p>

<p>Hardy 51: Okay, let's go back to the milk. Nothing special about that, it would just be fun to talk about. So the reason you put the milk in was because you like it in.</p>

<p>Phil 51: But she doesn't like it in.</p>

<p>Hardy 52: Then you liked because . . .</p>

<p>Phil 52: So, I could have her think she was getting her way, and I could get mine.</p>

<p>Hardy 53: Okay. And was there some way to get to that place short of taking the action that you did?</p>

<p>Phil 53: Um, separate pans, you know, put a couple of pork chops in a smaller pan with some cream of mushroom soup and some milk. I'm sure that would work quite well.</p>

<p>Hardy 54: Any ideas about why you didn't try that avenue?</p>

<p>Phil 54: Didn't want to dirty another pan, because it was easier that way, because I thought I could get away with lying to her, maybe it was a test for future lies, I don't know.</p>

<p>Hardy 55: It just seems to me, Phil, that I mean, it seems to me like you are in a very difficult position because you know when you are around these people that you care about, who care about you, I'm not necessarily talking about being physically around them, but even emotionally connected, it doesn't seem to me as if you have
had the opportunity or the experiences to be in those relationships, to have those connections, and feel the freedom to be who you are, that you're constantly compromising yourself to try to fit someone else's expectation as a way of sort of warding off disapproval, criticism, and then unfortunately, and very unfortunately,
the only thing that happens is that tactic only eventually invites the very thing that you are trying to avoid, you know, so that eventually she finds out about the milk and then criticizes you for that, and then you feel a little beat up, and it seems like you have had a lot of that in your life where you've gotten these powerful strong messages about how you're just a royal screw up. And you seem very sensitive to that. As if you are constantly scanning your universe anticipating it and then working very hard to avoid it. And I just think that that must be a very torturous way to live one's life. Is it?</p>

<p>Phil 55: Um, it's, I'm sure it is. It's not a goal of mine, let me put it that way.</p>

<p>Hardy 56: No, I don't think it is. I think that's what makes it difficult because I can easily see yourself responding to these situations in this particular way even though it's not what you want, you know. Now, let me ask you what is probably going to be a difficult question. If you allowed yourself to feel more, what would you feel?</p>

<p>Phil 56: At first probably anger, I'd say.</p>

<p>Hardy 57: And . . .</p>

<p>Phil 57: And maybe once I got through that part of it, you know, I just might feel life I guess. That would be a good point to be at.</p>

<p>Hardy 58: But yet for some reason you hold onto the anger.</p>

<p>Phil 58: Yeah. Yeah and I used to play physical sports and really get a kick out of a good hit or whatever, you know, that type of thing, in hockey and football, and you know, I don't know how healthy that was, but it was all in gamesmanship or whatever you want to call it, and . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 59: But it was a channel for you. I think we all need that.</p>

<p>Phil 59: You know, I get the idea sometimes I shouldn't be angry and that you know, if I was dealing with life, you know, on a daily basis, that that anger might not build up.</p>

<p>Hardy 60: Well, I think that in some ways that's partially true that you attend to these things as they occurred. Let the air out of them, let the steam out of them and move on, but somewhere along the way you learned that that was not safe for you to do that, and so I understand why you don't do that. I mean I think it's a two way street. I can only be honest and open with you if I somehow believe that, you know, you can hear what I have to say, that you won't reject me, you won't run away, you won't withdraw the relationship, and I won't be punished in some way. And it sounds like you haven't been able to get those blanket guarantees in the relationships that you're in, so you know, instead of dealing honestly and congruently in a relationship, you walk on eggshells. You tip toe around, and I'm just a firm believer, and you may not believe this, but I just think that when we strip relationships of conflict, because I think it's part of the human condition for us to have differences, when we strip relationships of conflict, then we also minimize and diminish the degree of intimacy we can have in those relationships because if you are angry and not expressing it, then it's adding a certain level of artificiality and fakeness to your relationship.</p>

<p>Phil 60: I agree.</p>

<p>Hardy 61: Now, so you said if you allowed yourself to feel, that you would probably at least at first feel anger. Now, I don't have any doubts that you will probably reject my request to do this, so just go ahead and prove me right, and we will get it out of the way. So, I'm wondering like could you express to me the anger that you
would express if you would allow yourself to feel it? Like imagine for a moment I was your mom. What would you say if I were she and I could guarantee you, "Son, I'm strong enough to hear what you have to say."</p>

<p>Phil 61: Um, things you say frustrate me.</p>

<p>Hardy 62: But that doesn't sound like anger to me.</p>

<p>Phil 62: No, that doesn't sound like anger.</p>

<p>Hardy 63: That sounds like walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>Phil 63: Right. I think I only got angry at my mom once.</p>

<p>Hardy 64: Only got angry once, or only expressed it once?</p>

<p>Phil 64: Expressed it.</p>

<p>Hardy 65: So what would you say to her? Because I see all this anger and rage roaming around in you like wild buffalos. Dying, screaming to get out.</p>

<p>Phil 65: It might be nice to yell, "Would you just listen to me for a little bit?" And then kind of . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 66: Is that how you would say it?</p>

<p>Phil 66: If I was, alright, if a situation where I got angry and went with it, hopefully, I'd be able to do something like that, but if I were to just kind of like think about ways that I have been angry or that constantly anger me, I couldn't kind of bring those to the forefront and like act on them. No, I couldn't do that.</p>

<p>Hardy 67: Couldn't?</p>

<p>Phil 67: No.</p>

<p>Hardy 68: Because it would hurt her, destroy her, she would destroy you?</p>

<p>Phil 68: Because that's not my threshold of anger, you know, I don't talk about that type of stuff. I talk about it when it's up here, you know, or I yell or I go off, you know.</p>

<p>Hardy 69: So either you don't express it, or you have a rage like exploding.</p>

<p>Phil 69: A rage, yes.</p>

<p>Hardy 70: So there is no middle ground?</p>

<p>Phil 70: No.</p>

<p>Hardy 71: Then is that the way it plays itself out in your marriage with Beth as well?</p>

<p>Phil 71: I can get angry, and we have come to a point where I can say, alright, she gets real scared if I get loud, because I can yell really loud, but I never have in front of her. When I get loud it intimidates her, and she gets scared, and she asks me, she'll say "Stop yelling" at me even though I might not be yelling, I might be
loud, for me, and you know, I worked on with some therapy saying that I'm angry. I've worked on that.</p>

<p>Hardy 72: That's great. And did that work out okay, when you've done it that way?</p>

<p>Phil 73: Yes. So I guess I have dealt with it a little bit. It's not something that's normal. It has to be kind of like after a session like this where it's kind of in the forefront where it's fresh, you know, without practicing, it just kind of goes away.</p>

<p>Hardy 74: I mean, forget about the anger for a moment, but is Beth picking you up after this?</p>

<p>Phil 74: No, I'm getting a ride home.</p>

<p>Hardy 75: So, you'll see her at what time tonight?</p>

<p>Phil 75: She'll be sleeping by the time I get home.</p>

<p>Hardy 76: Okay, so when is the next time you will see her?</p>

<p>Phil 76: Tomorrow morning when we wake up.</p>

<p>Hardy 77: Could you imagine yourself saying to her, "You know last night in the car I was really hurt by what happened between us."</p>

<p>Phil 77: Well, I might be able to do it. Yeah, I could do it.</p>

<p>Hardy 78: What is the most likely scenario, to not say anything?</p>

<p>Phil 78: Yeah. Just to hope it went away. Just to hope that her mood and my feelings would just kind of go away.</p>

<p>Hardy 79: And do your feelings go away? Because I keep sensing that they don't.</p>

<p>Phil 79: No, they don't. I don't know why I keep thinking they will, but . . .</p>

<p>Hardy 80: It sounds to me like what happened in the car tonight, that you could have easily felt like you were one of her students being reprimanded and chastised for being too loud.</p>

<p>Phil 80: And she knows she does that to me.</p>

<p>Hardy 81: Yeah, and so that while you wait for it to just dissipate, go away, what happens is it sits there and builds up, and then you have these rage explosions, not just the event and moment, and you already know this, it's all of those things. You are throwing up all of those things, and I just, you know, you're a pretty likable guy, and I just think that, you know, that it would work wonders for your marriage and your relationship with your parents if you could take like this experience that happened tonight, and make the conscious decision to not sit on this and not add it to all the other things that you are sitting holding in your gut, to try to get rid of it as soon as possible. And understand that it may well engender lots of anger from her. It may push her to this anger place. But see my experience has been that it's okay for couples to have that kind of energy, because when there's that kind of energy around, you know that also intensifies the energy as they come together, intimacy. But the two of you, my fear is that you will find increasing difficulty finding each other as these things continue to build up between the two of you. I don't know if she has the same tendency to hold onto stuff and let it build up, but it doesn't matter whether she does or not. If that's your tendency, at some point the two of you are going to have to deal with something that's akin to a blocked artery, you know. Somehow it's all clogged with gook and unresolved, you know that you're not going to be able to find each other. You may wake up one morning and the two of you realize, you know, who is this person over here. That's what gets lost when you lose the ability to sort of communicate with each other to take risks with each other. And granted you haven't had the type of safety in your relationships that have afforded you that. But I think you deserve that. I think we all deserve that. And it would be great if you could take some little small piece of initiative to . . .</p>

<p>Phil 81: To take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>Hardy 82: Yeah. You don't have to do anything big, just start small. It seems like tonight would be a good example because the situation in the car didn't get out of hand, and it was sort of approaching that, and if you could revisit tomorrow, it would be great. Now what is your sexual life like with your wife, I mean, what is your intimate relationship like?</p>

<p>Phil 82: It's not good. You know, when we have sex we both enjoy it, but you know, we don't have sex as often as I'd like. She's worked on some issues with that too, and you know, we had sex a lot more when we were dating than we have since we've been engaged or married.</p>

<p>Hardy 83: And is it her problem that the two of you don't have sex as often as you would like? I mean is that problem somehow . . .</p>

<p>Phil 83: She doesn't want to, yeah. I mean, it's like sometimes the thought of it will turn her stomach or something. It's not, I don't understand exactly.</p>

<p>Hardy 84: But I'm wondering if that's because of something inside of her or something inside of your relationship.</p>

<p>Phil 84: Probably both.</p>

<p>Hardy 85: You know, because you know I think sometimes it's hard for us men to appreciate that saying you know, "You like nice tonight sweetheart, you look stunning." That that does more for the libido and sexual relationship than anything else. That these things are connected, and it sounded like what you were saying earlier. She is not feeling tremendously appreciated, not feeling noticed in the relationship, not feeling special. All those things that I won't even say women, I think people like to feel that, and those things are connected to what happens or doesn't happen in bed. So if there is any frigidity coming from her which you haven't said or some lack of interest, it may be because other parts of the relationship aren't sparking that. And so while it may be helpful for her to take a look at that, it might be even more effective for the two of you to take a look at the dynamics in the relationship and what's supporting that, what's feeding her. Because sometimes I think you know men have a tendency to sort of push everything aside, conflict, war, you know, give me twelve minutes or whatever. And I think that women tend to want more intimacy, and that's really important. So that's what I'm concerned about and instead of computer like cognitive like emotion detached fashion is going to make it difficult to make those connections with her and probably with other people as well. Now have you had a chance to have any experiences of like even sitting down with your parents in therapy to sort of . . .</p>

<p>Phil 85: No.</p>

<p>Hardy 86: Is that something you would ever consider?</p>

<p>Phil 86: I'd consider it, sure. My mom may consider it, but I highly doubt that my dad would ever consider it.</p>

<p>Hardy 86: Because he doesn't believe in it, or because it's too threatening for him?</p>

<p>Phil 86: Probably too threatening for him. I mean, at one point during my parents' marriage my parents went to a therapist once, and then my mom went back again without my dad because he wouldn't go. So, they probably, I don't know what they talked about.</p>

<p>Hardy 87: So it seems like there is some piece of him that you are trying, I mean, it sounds like the two of you might have some similar styles in some ways, but the difference is that you are sitting here tonight as you have on previous nights facing yours, wrestling with it, not always winning, but at least with some resolve to hang in there. And it seems like you are trying to rid your life of the real powerful role that denial plays in your life. And it sounds like your dad has some of that where, you know, a lot of denial, you know, and the perils of that, you know where it leads you, and so I admire you for trying to push beyond and break out of your legacy. And I mean that broadly speaking. All of the pieces of the legacy that you inherited and hope Beth appreciates that because it's not wise to confuse success with effort. And maybe you haven't been totally successful with it at this point, but one certainly has to appreciate the spirit of your effort, and I hope you won't diminish that because you tend to have the tendency to kind of beat up on Phil a little bit when your mom's not there to criticize you, or your dad, or Beth. You do a pretty phenomenal job yourself. And give yourself a break. Now we're about to run out of time, but I did want to follow up and ask you so would it be reasonable for me to assume that you at least make the effort to revisit this issue tomorrow with Beth about the car tonight? Now you're being straight.</p>

<p>Phil 87: Yeah.</p>

<p>Hardy 88: Not lying to yourself.</p>

<p>Phil 88: No. No, that doesn't sound hard to me at all. You know at this point, it may have a couple of years ago, but now it doesn't sound hard at all.</p>

<p>Hardy 89: Because I think you know the more you work on, that's the best time to do it when they are minute because I think what you would benefit from is having some success at doing this stuff. Because somewhere over the course of your life, I mean, you've had huge pieces of your confidence and self esteem ripped out of you, and it's kind of hard to do anything that's risky if you don't have that, and if people around you are so quick to tell you what you are doing wrong, and not appreciate the effort that you are putting forth, coming here tonight is an effort. You didn't have to do this. So give it a whirl tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Phil 89: Okay.</p>

<p>Hardy 90: Okay?</p>

<p>Phil 90: Okay, sounds like a deal.</p>

<p>Hardy 91:  And Phil thanks. I appreciate your coming in to talk with me. Thanks. Some pieces of this were things you've heard before, and maybe rather than what you haven't done, dismissing it as repetition, that if you have two or three different people saying the same thing, hmmm.</p>

<p>Phil 91: Hmmm.</p>

<p>Hardy 92: There must be a pattern here. So I think it would be important to overcome this legacy your dad has handed to you of denial, you know. Alright?</p>

<p>Phil 92: Thanks.</p>

<p>Hardy 93: Pleasure meeting you.</p>

<p>Phil 93: Nice to meet you, too.</p>


<center><p><b>Treatment Plan for Phil</b></p></center>

<p>In future sessions, Dr. Hardy would move the case to Phil and Beth, then to Phil and Beth and Phil's parents and then adding Beth's parents. This would allow him to not only help Phil change, but to guide how the family system
changes with Phil's change. Because Phil's issues are relational, his immediate relationships within his marriage and family of origin are key to any lasting change in Phil.</p>

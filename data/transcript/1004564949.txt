<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so. The reason I was running late is—the last two times I've gone to fill prescriptions at CVS, they've challenged me about my prescriptions, which is really weird. The first time — both times I sort of ended up having a long conversation with the pharmacist. The two things they're complaining about were Ativan and Valium. And so they're like, "Why are you taking both?" I'm like, "Because I am. Because my doctor prescribed them both." "Well does your doctor — are the doctors aware that you are taking both these medications?" Same doctor prescribed them. And they're like, "Well why are you taking them both?" [00:00:56]</p>

<p>And I was just like, "Just fill the prescription." And this time, again, there was a note saying, "It was replacing Valium." And I'm like, "No." And she was asking, "Why?" I'm like, "I just talked to my doctor this morning. I just saw her. She just gave me this prescription." And the pharmacist was like, "I don't understand why. It's the same thing. So why are you?" And going on and on. And it just makes me feel, A, really frustrated. I'm like, "You're a pharmacist. Not a doctor."</p>

<p>And I asked, "Why?" today because I was pissed. And their response was "Well we just want to make sure that you're not taking — because these are replacement prescriptions you're not double taking the medication." Which is dumb — the first time it was kind of like, "Does your doctor know you're taking all these drugs?" And this time it was more like, "You shouldn't be prescribed both. You should be prescribed one or other. And we want to make sure that you're not accidentally taking everything." [00:02:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is weird. I'm just like — I don't know. It makes me feel like —.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you describe as well the tone is much more accusatory than anything else. Just like inquisitive or constructive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. It's like it's very — I'm used to having to present my driver's license if I drop off Valium and one other thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's fine. They're just like, "It's for I.D." But this is — and I've had the experience of having to justify myself to the pharmacist and having them argue with me about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm just kind of like, "Do you think I'm a drug addict? Do you think I'm engaging in dangerous behavior? Where are we going with this?" And one time they refused to fill a prescription until they talked to me. The first time they wouldn't fill it at all until they talked to me which was not [awesome] for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Including that I was like, "I'm completely out and I would like to take the drugs that I'm prescribed." It's — (sighs) I don't know. I haven't — last time I kind of thought of complaining. And this time I was like, "I am ready." It's one of those things where I think it's so much of the tone of it that I think it's hard to make a complaint. Because I can see someone saying, "Well they're just being careful." But I mean — after surgery when I was taking all the crazy drugs, my Mom picked up my prescriptions for me. [00:04:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My Mom is not me. And my roommate picked up one time for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not you either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm like — and not even related. Like I can see my Mom bullying someone late at night. To be like, "I am her Mother. Give me this drug."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my roommate just walked in and walked out. And I'm just like, "What the fuck? Why did they give you these drugs?" Anyway. The other thing is — so my roommate. So Ashby does this monthly book club with some friends of ours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was invited when they first started but I couldn't because I was taking a class on Thursdays when they meet. And then I sort of — I saw that they were doing a book that I already read and liked. And I e-mailed the hostess like, "Oh hey. I remember this book. I'm going to come." But then I was really tired and I didn't. And so she snubbed me. Snubbed me the next time I saw her. [00:05:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the hostess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The hostess wouldn't talk to me. Apparently she was really angry that I'd invited myself to the book group and then not showed up. Which was — I don't know. I just was sort of annoyed about it. This book group — and they drink. They discuss the books. They drink a lot of wine. And Ashby always comes home tipsy or drunk. Last night she came home and got into my bed. So A — I sleep naked. B — I take an Ambien so I wasn't really aware of what was going on at first. I was kind of like — I think I thought it was like the cat or something. So occasionally she'll knock on my door when she gets home because she wants to talk about something and she's drunk. [00:06:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But this was like 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning. And she got into bed. Like her face down at the foot of the bed and her feet up by me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which interestingly at home there is a phrase for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because it's a very common way to get more people into bed. Or it used to be. And to stay warm. It's basically called head to foot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "We used to do that all the time when we were kids." She was trying to convince me to sleep that way one time. And Christy and I said no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of like, "Go to your own bed." And she didn't go anywhere. And then I kind of fell asleep a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Seriously. Go sleep in your bed." I don't remember — I guess kind of like what I remember but don't remember very well. And she said she didn't want to. And I was like, "Whatever." I'm not interested in having an argument about this I'll just go back to sleep. But I had trouble going back to sleep because she shoved — she tried to pull the covers over her and then like her foot was on my ass. And I'm like ugh. What's happening? [00:07:32]</p>

<p>And then also I realized I was cold. And so I tried to fall asleep. (inaudible at 00:07:39) my phone. "Ashby it's 3:30 in the morning. I can't sleep. Get out of my bed." And so she started apologizing a lot. (inaudible at 00:07:54) I was like, "What?" I'm like, "It's fine. I can go back to sleep." And then she muttered something. It was clear that there was some reason that she was in my bed other than being drunk. And so I put on a T-shirt and kind of stumbled into her bedroom and I was like, "Ashby, what's going on?" And I'm still like on the Ambien so I'm like, "What's happening?" [00:08:18]</p>

<p>And she said something to me. Like I asked her why she was in my bed. And she said something like (inaudible at 00:08:29) so I asked her to repeat herself. And she said, "No, no. I'm glad you didn't hear it." And then I'm like, "Fuck you. What is it?" And she wouldn't tell me, wouldn't tell me, tell me. And I'm like, "Ashby if you want to snuggle, that's fine. I just don't want to be naked and woken up at 3:30 in the morning."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is snuggling a thing you guys do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But — like once or twice she's had a meltdown over how no one touches her. Or she feels touch starved. And like — I can't remember when it was. Just one time she was just like really upset. She was crying about how she was getting her hair cut or something and she was like, "This is (inaudible at 00:09:14) touched me all week." I'm like, "No if you want to sleep in my bed it's probably fine. Or like platonic cuddling is fine. I just prefer morning." [00:09:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was upset and drunk. And insistent. I was like, "Fine. I'm going back to bed." And in the morning I woke up early and she woke up late because she was hungover.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was only half remembering it because of Ambien. And I was sleepy. And so she completely — no comment. No like, "Wow I climbed into your bed last night and you were naked." Or like anything. And it's just so — it was just confusing in a lot of ways. Like I think at one point she had a crush on me. Like six years ago. That I'm assuming it doesn't exist anymore. But she wouldn't admit it either way. And I'm really curious. I am very curious like why she got into my bed. [00:10:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. And like it seemed super important. It wasn't just that she really wanted to. And I'm like, "What?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also I hate that she won't say anything unless I prod her. Even if I prod her when I get home tonight she's probably going to just say, "It was so embarrassing. I'm humiliated by you asking." Which is what she usually says. I guess part of it — like a lot of it — . So a lot of my friends who are kinky and (inaudible at 00:11:38) things like we just touch each other in platonic ways a lot. Like my friend, he like grabbed my friend's boobs and then grabbed mine so many times. [00:11:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like we're all watching a movie and it's like shoved together in a big pile. I don't know. Occasionally I sort of step back and I'm like, "I guess it's probably not normal. As it were to A — know the location of most of my friends' tattoos and body piercings. And B — just kind of talk about it." Or just like, "No check my bra." Grab. Or whatever. But I don't know. Or I will strip in all their houses. The middle of the house. It's just — so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess my question is — is Ashby part of that? Or not really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No she's not. And I think my expectation from these other friends is that if she's like — my (inaudible at 00:12:58) that would probably just say, "Can we snuggle platonically?" And I'd be like, "Yeah. All right. That's fine." [00:13:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly because I've done that and had people say that to me. And it's fine. So I'm kind of like if you just ask. But I think — I'm pretty sure none of her other friends — or most of her other friends would be a little confused or weirded out. Yeah. I'm kind of like if you had just asked. But I also can see why she wouldn't just ask. Like Ashby is very concerned about whether or not asking something is weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I can imagine her being too shy. Lacking in confidence. Afraid of being rejected if she asked. [00:14:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even if intellectually she knew that made more sense than just doing it she clearly wouldn't act that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she also has a habit of accidentally revealing things when really drunk. I'm like, "Mm." Like when she accidentally told her co-worker — male co-worker — that she's in love with him. And that went really poorly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just feel like that's no excuse. Like you're using being drunk as an excuse for saying something that you wanted to say anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. Also she's just been like very squirrelly this week. No actually probably like two or three weeks. I don't know. Like kind of angry. But not at me. Just seeming angry or upset and like not being willing to do household stuff. Like load or unload the dishwasher. Take out the trash. All these things. [00:15:24]</p>

<p>And then just a couple days ago she — she has a gym membership and she has a separate membership just for this place to go do Zumba. And she's complaining about feeling miserable and she just got back from a Zumba class. And I was like, "Well the cost of your Zumba classes you could probably just see a therapist another day." Because she's very insistent she wants to see a therapist every other week because she can't afford to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then angry justifications of why not. I'm kind of like, "Mm." Just bring it up. And then after seeing her therapist this week she had this odd, intense conversation about how — maybe her therapist is terrible for her. Or just terrible in general. And that she wants a therapist to sort of take more control I think. [00:16:41]</p>

<p>Or maybe do cognitive behavioral therapy. Or maybe make her talk about things she doesn't want to talk about. Or that feel uncomfortable. But her therapist's style is to not do that. I'm kind of like, "(inaudible at 00:16:57)." Like I really didn't want to say anything just because — it's odd. She's like alternately complaining about it but also blaming — like it was her fault that her therapist wasn't doing what she wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was her own fault?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well she was — (inaudible at 00:17:22) I'm an asshole patient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She vacillated between my therapist is a sucky therapist. Why won't she do this? And I'm a horrible asshole patient. I'm so horrible. I'm so horrible. And then also she wanted to do EMDR which (inaudible at 00:17:44) successfully had. And then the other thing — I think maybe what may have set this off is she saw her new psychiatrist. And the psychiatrist suggested group therapy. And Ashby was furious about the suggestion. Like really, really angry. I think — first she's like, "Do I look like I need group therapy?" I'm like, "I don't — ." [00:18:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does such a person look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't answer those questions. And then she's ranting about how group therapy wouldn't work for her because she's an asshole. Or just wouldn't work for her in general. Kind of on and on. I'm just kind like, "Okay. Don't do group therapy. I don't really — the doctor is still prescribing what you want." So. I don't know it's just been very (pause at [00:18:47] to 00:18:56) (sighs) — it's like it's been odd. It's like she's talking more than she ever does about the process of therapy and of seeing a psychiatrist. [00:19:10]</p>

<p>And is super defensive about it but less angry at me about it. Because usually — I mean more typically it ends with her yelling at me about how I think her therapist sucks. And that's horrible. And she makes me feel guilty. (inaudible at 00:19:36) Which I'm just kind of like, "I hate her therapist." (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also because it affect her weird like (inaudible at 00:19:50) like are you obliquely trying to tell me that you're kind of having a mental health breakdown but you don't want say so. Like where are we going? And I don't — I wish she would say. Or that if I asked her she wouldn't blow up. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>Mostly because I will straight up tell her if I'm like I'm feeling really crazy this week (inaudible at 00:20:27). So it makes me feel very like eggshells and weird. And I don't know. Like I'm trying to not over-analyze her behavior but—. I'm kind like after — I guess I feel like climbing into my bed in the middle of the night — it's not like I'm offended.</p>

<p>I'm just like that's odd. That's really weird for you. I climbed into her bed once when she was awake and I was high on prescription painkillers after surgery. I asked her if there were fireworks in the living room. But I also actually asked her — (laughs). I was like, "Ashby there are fireworks in here. But they're not in your bedroom." [00:21:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's just like, "What?" I'm like, "Can I get in your bedroom? Can I get in your bed?" And she's on the phone with a friend of hers. And she's like, "Yeah Karen's convinced there are fireworks. Yeah she's just lying in my bed." So I was in there for an hour and then I left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the fireworks had gone away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Conveniently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so it was very great. Oh my God. So Monday I'm like, "Because I climbed in your bed; you climbed in mine." Except it's not the same. Like she was awake and I was awake. Still high but awake. And this was more — I don't know. (inaudible at 00:22:11) all these ways in which I wouldn't really care.</p>

<p>Like I'm really cold. I'm lonely. I just want to snuggle with someone. Do you know what I mean? It really wouldn't bother me. Except for this confusing suddenly in my bedness. And then there is also that my bed also includes my cat and sometimes, for various reasons, a small dish of food. Because she has a hard time climbing up and down the bed. [00:22:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah cat food. So I'm kind of like there are a lot of things in my bed and I need warning so I can clear the decks. (pause at [00:22:58] to 00:23:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound, among other things, a bit amused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's kind of funny. I mean it is a funny situation. I'm like I kind of feel like (inaudible at 00:23:32) calm briefly. I don't know. It just doesn't seem like something that happens in real life. Like I feel like it happens in a book or a movie but not in my real life. And I don't know. [00:23:57]</p>

<p>I think it is kind of funny but I'm also — I think it's kind of funny. But I also think it's probably was not actually a funny, random drunk girl thing. Like I think there was a lot more to it. Probably some sort of (inaudible at 00:24:20). I'm just like, "That's hilarious. P.S. Are you going to have a meltdown? And if it's suicide, which I don't want you do to, but you've got to admit climbing into a bed in the middle of the night fully dressed was kind of hilarious." Like it's just kind of this mix.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess my main emotion is I think it's funny but I'm concerned about what it all means. And also I'm exhausted. Because I didn't get any sleep. [00:24:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because roommate in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Woke you up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:59)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my cat woke me up too. And I got up early to see [inaudible] and I'm really tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's just been on my mind all day. Not that I've been — I'm not upset. But I just keep thinking what? Am I sure I didn't hallucinate that on Ambien? I'm pretty sure I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also it feels — it doesn't totally feel like it happened to me. I think because I was in the middle of the night, woken up, Ambien, everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ambien. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. [00:25:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess — (pause from [00:26:00] to 00:26:13). To me it also (pauses from [00:26:14] to 00:26:33). It seems to involve this thing that I think happens for you where you really don't have an opportunity to communicate to the other person where you're at and what you want from them in a way that you have any confidence they will take in and respond to. [00:27:10]</p>

<p>Like there really is no communication it sounds like around any of this. And not for your lack of effort. But I think you tend to feel responsible anyway for that sort of thing and to — I think that gets in the way of also communicating what you feel about what's going on. Such as curious, amused, annoyed with her. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the other thing I was thinking about is sort of the urge to mother hen people in trouble. [00:28:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And trying to not do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a little difficult since we live together. But I do wish I — I don't know. I feel like I should probably either let it go or just be like, "What happened?" But another part of me just really feels like I want to help her. I want to make this problem easier or whatever. It's a combination of I want to fix her up but I don't want to actually fix her up. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the part about wanting to fix her up and the mother hen thing I think. [00:29:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the not actually wanting to that I'm not clear about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the part I don't want to do is get sucked into this drama laden emotional vortex which where everything I say she uses to bolster her point about how everyone hates her. Including me. And so I'm very clear I don't want to have that conversation. But — (sighs). (pause at [00:30:02] to 00:30:15) I guess I sort of feel like the answers — I feel like the answer is right there. Just ask to snuggle. Like it's not hard. It's really easy. [00:30:23]</p>

<p>If you knew it would upset me you should really know me better than that. And so it feels — I feel kind of weird constantly thinking about it when I'm really there is just an answer. A really simple answer. And I think I would be happier if I could convince myself to not try to analyze what was going on. And (inaudible at 00:31:12) about how she felt. And thinking that was fine or whatever instead. [00:31:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you mean you're getting sort of preoccupied with what was going on with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I feel like — in terms of I how feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me when I was talking about it with people (inaudible at 00:31:48) feel bad is it's also funny. You know I'm like drunk roommate in my bed. Well whatever. And I often will tell my friends about — there is this cartoon online called [Ambien Walrus].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Ambien Walrus]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Ambien Walrus]. Which is the person that made the cartoons. And [Ambien Walrus] is the personification of bad plans that make sense while taking Ambien. (laughs) And there is one where the walrus is like, "Let's cut off all your hair and kill your parents." And it's like, "Yeah let's do it." And they're just like a series of silly things. [00:32:32]</p>

<p>One time I knocked on Ashby's door and (inaudible at 00:32:38) pink rhinestones. And she's like, "What are you going on about?" And I'm like, "Focus Ashby. Pink rhinestones." And shut the door. And a couple nights ago I came in and she was laughing. So I went, "Ashby what are you laughing at?" And she's like, "Nothing. I wasn't laughing." And I'm like, "Yes you were." And she started laughing because I was so, "You were laughing and I need to know why!" So it's like it's half that. And I'm — I feel like it's a silly Ambien Walrus story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just be like all right it's an Ambien Walrus story than to just get so caught up in but what is her side of the Ambien Walrus story. [00:33:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) some of this I was kind of wanting to share a funny Ambien Walrus story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's something I would do. Like (inaudible at 00:33:48), "What. Oh yeah." But I would probably A — like ask. And be like, "Snuggle time!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the next morning be like, "Sorry. Snuggles." And I would like to be like, "Ashby that was an amazing drunk Ashby, Ambien Walrus interaction there." I think that would be nice. And I sort of fear and suspect that it's not a funny story to her. [00:34:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause at [00:34:33] to 00:35:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it's too bad. There are these missed bonding opportunities with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean around the event and the story. [00:35:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at [00:35:30] to 00:35:39) I think it is kind of too bad. I'm also thinking about (inaudible at 00:35:45). Bunch of my friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are ways in which it's like a big sleep over from when I was a kid. And I don't know there are like a lot of silly, late night punchiness and all of that which I think is fun. And silly. No one takes it serious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "Come on. Let's do it." I guess also because Ashby just laughs when I knocked on her door about rhinestones and laughing and all the other things. And so I feel kind of sad that she doesn't trust me on it. [00:36:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To just be like, "Eh, you know." I mean I did check in with one of her friends to be like, "Did Ashby have a break down at book group?" And the response was, "No she just got really drunk." Which is fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We should stop for now. (inaudible at 00:37:09) Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Also (inaudible) scheduling thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah sure. Is there (inaudible at 00:37:21)?</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where do we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I see you last Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think two weeks ago. I can tell you officially though. Oh no, I saw you last Tuesday in the afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. I got an e-mail last Tuesday night saying that I was awarded one of the fellowships. It's a Fellowship for a year of academic study abroad, which I applied for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, thanks. It's great news and I'm actually, as I think about it, happier that I got that than the other scholarship because it would have been crazy. I think it would've actually been harder to get by on what they would give you to live. So, anyway, yeah, so that's great news now that I know I'll be leaving Harvard in August at some point.</p>

<p>[01:17.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And headed where, or is it —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Paris for at least nine months. And we'll see what happens after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Today I'm just really tired. Still recovering from another weekend in the city, so I'm kind of overwhelmed with school, but that's fine (pause).</p>

<p>[02:13.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling in the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got this dull headache back here that's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's been kicking around for awhile now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's where I get my headaches is back here. Yeah, it does come back every now and again. When I skip meals, I pay for it later with a headache. A little tight in my shoulders and not sure I'm going to go to my afternoon class this afternoon. I'm feeling like I need to take the time to do some other things, but I don't know. I always feel guilty when I skip class (laughter). That's as deep as I have it right now (laughter).</p>

<p>[03:10.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did your wife respond to the fellowship and the news of moving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's delighted. Yeah, I mean, she was in the city when I heard, and so I forwarded her the e-mail. But I think it hasn't quite hit us yet, you know, even if it's been a week. Yeah, just kind of looking around the apartment, wondering what we're going to do with everything (pause). She's thrilled, and I am too about it. But these last few weeks of school are also on the forefront of my mind.</p>

<p>[04:15.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're still here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Speaking of the last few weeks of school, a few weeks back you had mentioned that your dad would probably be coming for graduation, and that was something you wanted to spend some time thinking about. We sort of haven't gotten back to that because other things sort of took precedence in the moment. But I wonder before that time actually arrives, if maybe we should turn our attention to looking at that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's something that I'm still thinking about frequently, and I'm noticing how my view of it is kind of walking around it. What is it saying? Is it still saying what I want it to say? Do I still need to say some other things in there?</p>

<p>[05:26.5]</p>

<p>Also, there are other things I want to put in there that I also recognize, the good things that my parents instilled in me. And recognize those and letting him know that I appreciate those. But as we've talked about in the past, fear is a big motivator, so how much of who I am today is because of my fear? Is that — I mean, there's good and bad in everything, and nothing is either/or (pause).</p>

<p>[06:42.7]</p>

<p>So where do I, after I tally all the feelings and hurts and insecurities, where do I come out? And what bearing does that sum have on my relationship with him today, if that makes sense. In no way do I want to cut off the relationship or limit it in anyway. In fact, I think it's limited right now because of my distance and my distancing in terms of communication, to some degree.</p>

<p>[07:49.5]</p>

<p>And so I guess my message is I, of course, I still love you and want to continue, but I want you to know the nature of who I am is the result of things that happened under your watch (pause). Not to shame you, not to hear you say "I wish I'd never done those things," but to just know that they affected me to the point that I was not aware that they were affecting me when I was living with you.</p>

<p>[08:56.0]</p>

<p>You were not aware of it, obviously. It was only years later that I realize it was affecting me, and whatever communication we had growing up wasn't sufficient for you to either realize that this was having an impact or thought to investigate (pause). So, I guess that's where I am with that right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you feel comfortable sharing what you just said with him?</p>

<p>[09:44.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean, to me that's kind of the next page. That's kind of where I've come to in my head over the past few months. I don't want this to be painful for him to read entirely. I want it to be something that's not so accusatory as it is revelatory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you've accomplished that.</p>

<p>[10:33.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my head (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and when you just spoke.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can recall hearing earlier versions of the letter, of your versions of the thoughts, and there was a lot more anger that you felt that came through in those earlier versions. It sounds like as you've processed it, as you've thought about it, as you've worked through some stuff on your own, that a lot of that anger has dissipated.</p>

<p>[11:12.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that's what I meant by saying that I'm not sure that it still says what I want to say. And specifically with the examples that I want him to know about, but I don't want him to get hurt by them, or I don't want him to put more weight on them than I want them to carry (pause). I mean, citing examples from when I was eight or nine makes it seem like I've been stewing on these things since I was eight or nine. But frankly, they only come up in remembering the past two years. And again, I don't know if I've quite reached the point where I can communicate those things without anger, without the envelope of shame. I don't know.</p>

<p>[12:39.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it doesn't all need to be accomplished in one letter or one conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter). I don't want to draw this out. Well, perhaps.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, privately there may be things you decide you want to share, kind of like, as you said, sort of on the next page. And then see what his response is. That might determine —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether or not I need to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether you feel that you do need to share some examples so he understands where you are coming from. Or maybe you don't. In some ways it sounds like you're trying to do the work for both of you. You're trying to figure out what you want and need out of sharing some of this with him. You're also trying to process it for him (overlapping voices at 13:26.9). And part of that is his job.</p>

<p>[13:34.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, I guess I get that. I just don't know if the way I've said them now is exactly the tone I want to use. I mean, he's going to react no matter how he reacts, and I don't know — I know I can't control that, but I just want to be as sensitive as I can to how those words come across.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. And that's the piece that's in your control how you present it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's interesting because I'm taking this class on reading memoirs, autobiographies of Arab people from the 20th century. Edward Said, a famous author who wrote "Orientalism" and died in 2003, had a sister, so he wrote a memoir and his sister wrote a memoir about six years later.</p>

<p>[14:46.3]</p>

<p>And it's an interesting account, the comparison of the two accounts, of his view of growing up as the eldest and the only boy, and her growing up as the third child, one of four daughters. So they were very different accounts, and I know my take on things growing up is going to be different than my older siblings because they were — most of them were out of the house when this happened, when the abuse happened.</p>

<p>[15:41.8]</p>

<p>But I think what I'm curious more about is before they left the house, when I was still quite young, before we'd even adopted the pair of siblings, before we even adopted my brother and sister. I don't have a lot of memories of that time, and the little I've talked to some of my brothers about this, and my sister too, my older sister, some of it is very resonate and some of it is completely foreign to me. Totally different memories. My oldest brother in particular saw the same things, but my second oldest brother, who is a year younger than him, has all these great memories of dad growing up.</p>

<p>[16:51.6]</p>

<p>And so I think — well I don't know what I think (pause). Part of the experience of taking this class is seeing the value of writing, even if it isn't the drama of leaving Palestine in 1947. Witnessing these people coming to grips with things — identity, gender, family, tradition — over the course of the book, and I haven't read a lot of memoirs or biographies so it's all kind of new to me. But in some of my reflections on the papers, I've revealed some of these things. I can identify with this because of this. It's allowing me to process these things.</p>

<p>[18:13.2]</p>

<p>So I think my — I don't know that I can get this letter done before May 24. Maybe I can. And even if I can get it ready for then, I don't want it to be received by him on May 20 and he has three days to process it before he comes. I guess I want — I mean, we can continue to talk about it, but I think it's going to be something that I develop further over the summer, either send it to him or deliver it in person. I don't know.</p>

<p>[19:16.7]</p>

<p>I want to be careful and somewhat sensitive to his receiving this from a distance. And then my leaving for France in September, I may not come back. I don't know, we'll see. But it might be over before —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the distance for him or for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think I necessarily would move over there if not for this grant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I meant the distance with him. I know you mentioned you wanted him to receive this —</p>

<p>[20:09.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to be sensitive about the distance because it's like, if he's not going to see me again before I leave for England and then he gets this letter and he wants to see me, I want to be able to allow that. So that's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it be like for you to have him here for graduation? What does it mean to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good question because I've thought about it with some anxiety (pause). I mean, the fact that my sister and her family are coming and my in-laws are coming tempers it a bit. If it were only my dad that was coming, I think I'd be far more anxious.</p>

<p>[21:38.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got quite a crowd.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, you know, it will be a lot of activities going on, things like that (pause). But I think one of the things that I'm conscious of is that when I've been around him in the past couple of years for family things, whatever, I've had kind of a cold exterior. It's not quite the same. It's kind of a strange alternating between warm and cold. I wouldn't say hot, just warm and cold.</p>

<p>[22:49.0]</p>

<p>I don't want that to continue because he doesn't know what the reason is. I don't want him — of course, I can't control this — but I want him to know what the reason is, as opposed to inventing one and so on. So with that, I guess I prefer that he get this before then. But I think —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The time is pretty short.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the time that he's here is pretty concentrated and short (pause).</p>

<p>[24:24.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's going on in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just looking at your collarbone (laughter). Not a lot. Just staring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So what does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know because when I don't look at you, I'm staring at the wall. When I'm not staring at the wall, I'm looking at you, and I don't know —</p>

<p>[25:07.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, those are sort of your options.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know what it means when I look at a certain part of you or if I decide to look at the outlet or your shoe. I think it also has to do with I'm not sure what the appropriate level of visual contact is here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends on what feels comfortable. And it depends on what it brings up for you. You know, I think what it brings up for you to look at the wall versus my collarbone versus my eyes. That's more important than what you're actually doing (pause). So what is it bringing up for you?</p>

<p>[26:56.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). You know, I don't know. I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way, but you know how you go into a museum and you see a beautiful painting and you just stare at it, right? And not really know what it is that's attracting you to it, it's just beautiful. It's just interesting. And you can kind of look at it without going anywhere in your head. It can be just a fascination.</p>

<p>[27:55.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interesting, because you go to a museum to be a purveyor of the arts or the objects that are inside it. It's very different in therapy. So it's interesting. You know, I'm watching the process of what happened in the session. So you were talking about your dad, graduation, what that means for you, and at some — it sounds like as you felt that you explored that and you felt like you came to a place where it closed, you left yourself, maybe, and went to looking outside yourself at me. So I wonder what that process means. What was it about that switch of being able to get absorbed in something outside of you, something external.</p>

<p>[28:51.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel present in the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So talk about what's present in the moment for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). Well my neck hurts (laughter).</p>

<p>[29:49.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very good body awareness. That actually is being really present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm wondering what your necklace says.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a Sabbath candelabrum from the 1700s.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The necklace is that old?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No (laughter). The imprint on the necklace is that old. I'm sure the necklace is only a couple decades old (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. That's what I thought it was, but I wasn't sure (pause). More than that, I'm listening to the hum of something.</p>

<p>[30:49.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The constant humming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). It's more about your appearance, that's all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in that exchange, you mentioned that you were noticing my necklace, and I actually gave you information about it. What's that like for you? Because I don't often do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It surprised me, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you tell me why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because it's none of my business what your necklace says. You wear it, you present it. But the print or the image is so small that you have to be very close in order to read it or see what it is. So I mean, I'm not reading into that, as you opening some door to me, but I was just surprised — not like blown away, but I wasn't expecting you to share what it was.</p>

<p>[32:27.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it change the feeling in here for you, that I did that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). Maybe a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 32:54.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think if I were — I don't know, maybe it means that you feel comfortable around me or maybe trust me, I don't know (pause). I'm also noticing the pace of your breathing. It's kind of shallow.</p>

<p>[33:53.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should practice those deep mellow breaths.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm not saying it's bad. I just wonder if it means that you are uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well coming from me, it means that I'm feeling alert. I will be honest and share my reactions with you because I think they're an important piece of the therapeutic process. I'm not uncomfortable in an anxious way. We've been talking about this stuff is really relevant and important, and I think it's good work. When I think I do feel you really engage, you've very alert, when we're doing hard work. Might my breathing be more relaxed if we were talking about the weather? Maybe, but that's because it's inconsequential. So I don't think uncomfortable in a negative sense, maybe kind of uncomfortable in that yeah, we're not chit-chatting about the fact that it's pretty sunny out today. That would be really relaxing but not important.</p>

<p>[35:20.6]</p>

<p>What I was thinking about as, you know, I didn't think carefully before I shared the detail of what was on my necklace, which I'm sure supervisors in the past would admonish me about. But after I shared it and we were talking about what it means and I did disclose a piece of more personal information and sharing that, it made me think about the conversation we've had about intimacy and what different types of intimacy — intimacy in a therapeutic relationship and intimacy in your relationship with your wife and with others outside of here. And I do think that as I disclose little pieces of information about myself as I have over the course of time, it brings an intimacy to the relationship which I think deepens the work.</p>

<p>[36:06.7]</p>

<p>I need to be careful and I should be more thoughtful about what I share rather than being impulsive as I was, to make sure that as that happens, it doesn't shift the balance inappropriately because the focus is supposed to be on you and not on me. And I don't want to burden you with information that impacts your work in here in a negative way. I hope that this piece is not that consequential.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't like tip the balance. I'm not reading into it as meaning you want me to know more about you.</p>

<p>[37:06.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it does — I mean, I think you could make a pretty good assumption about parts of my identity based on that. That sometimes can change your feeling for somebody. You know, if you had ideas about what my faith might be and then they're different than you imagined, I wonder if that changes your level of comfort, or if it changes —</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I assumed it was a Sabbath imprint but I guess I assumed you were Jewish (inaudible at 37:44.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's a necklace I wear a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). But it doesn't dissuade me, doesn't persuade me, it's kind of what I expected (pause from 38:04.5 to 00:39:42).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you want to go from here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). I don't know (pause). My head is racing a little bit (pause).</p>

<p>[40:51.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). That I'm still attracted to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that heart racing feel different than when it feels more anxious or panicky, or is it the same thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's different (pause). It's kind of like the anticipation of something coming (pause). Something exciting, something (pause), something unexpected (pause).</p>

<p>[42:45.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's an interesting wish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what you imagine would happen if the wish were fulfilled, if there was something unexpected and exciting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know (pause). I've never gotten that far. I mean, not in reality.</p>

<p>[43:57.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not really me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, in fantasy it is, but not real (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some things to explore are what the wish would be and what is the excitement from? What is so good about the unexpected?</p>

<p>[45:10.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not one that you necessarily need to answer at this moment. You can, but it's also something that might be worth just letting rattle around in your head for awhile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is something I've actually thought about (pause). We've talked about it a little bit, what would I do, and is the unexpected exciting because I don't expect a lot? I think that might have something to do with it (pause). But I don't know. I don't know. Like in my head, I do accept it. I mean, I accept that I would do something, that I would respond, but that's in the fantasy. In reality, I don't know.</p>

<p>[46:54.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both the fantasy and reality are really powerful. I think sometimes you minimize the importance of what the fantasy is, but actually I think the fantasy is really important, informative of things you want, things you fear. Things you know about yourself and things you don't know about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in my fantasy, if I want you (pause), how do I interpret that?</p>

<p>[47:50.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's no one right interpretation, but I think we have to look — for me, the information that you get from that is not so much about me but it's about the want. What is it that you really want? What is it that I represent? What is it that wanting your therapist, not just me, what does that represent for you, what does that mean for you? That's the stuff I would like to explore. You spoke earlier about when you look in me in some ways, it's like looking at an object in a museum. So what is it about that? What is it about putting those two things together? If that's what you want, what does that mean? What's safer about that and what makes that easier to want than a more known real entity?</p>

<p>[49:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, at this point I've compared you to a work of art and [a frozen treat] (ph) (laughter). So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) Just keep a running list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if any of these are flattering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not about that. Your job is not to flatter me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I just don't want to anger you (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I appreciate your honesty. Those are hard things to be honest and talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm exhausted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good sign of hard work. I know I've said that before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I wouldn't want you to do is walk away from this office and say "boy, wasn't that a waste of time." If it's exhausting, it's probably worthwhile work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I never leave here feeling like it wasn't worthwhile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You work hard in therapy. We do need to stop for today. I think we're scheduled for next week, but don't have anything past that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to schedule next week, or do you want to take the time to do that now?</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I got this card today in the mail.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> From my brother who, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your brother?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Who was real manic last year and left him like a scathing message after I'd been helping him for years.  And, um, the kind of wording that I, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like he realized [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it would be nice if, um, I mean, this is kind of what I would like to hear from my daughter and what I've always wanted to hear from my sister.  And my brother before he died.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're hearing it from a brother who obviously had issues last year, realizes now that -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean he's the only one that had the presence of mind to realize how mean he was.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the fact that he asked, yknow, hoped that you forgive him one day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.  And I, yknow, I will, I have.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, my daughter, yknow, I told her, she, again, when she was home for Christmas - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She cursed at me and said she couldn't take me, and, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I don't know.  She has hostility, reminds me of my sister 20 years ago.  And, um, so, yknow, I'm very, I don't know how to deal with it because it's like she backs me into a corner.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me what happened during the visit during Christmas that [INAUDIBLE]..</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we had a nice, we had spent the day together.  There was some tension, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She had come down from New York, then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She lives in London.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  She, she was back in the states.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And she was here for 5 days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was her whole time back from London here with you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At her father's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so she saw me 1 day and, um, I had invited her, I didn't have like her phone, she didn't have a cell phone, she was using her father's during the week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had invited her some, after we spent the day together I had invited her to something a couple nights later and I didn't hear from her and I called the father because, yknow, there was a lot of, I had never forgiven him for hitting me and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When we were married.  And, uh - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I didn't hear from her.  I heard from her like the last, the day before the last day she was going back.  And my first thing was, well, why didn't I hear from you?  [INAUDIBLE], yknow.  And she said, and your point is?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you spent the 1 day together you had planned.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that was okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There was no words, no tension?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Well, there was tension, but nothing extremely [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then you were planning on doing something together again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You invited her to go out but when you left the invitation in her court, she didn't respond - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or didn't say I'll meet you there or.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  She said she'd let me know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't follow through with it.  And never did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I get it.  So then when you talked to her right before she's going back you said, well, what happened kind of thing or you never called.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, right.  And then she right away and your point is?  And it was hostile though.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was laden with a lot of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, something.  And it hit me first thing in the morning and there was nothing I could have said looking back that would have diffused it.  I can't think of anything that I would have said that would have, I should have said, maybe, let's talk later, yknow, but, um, wasn't feeling good.  It was, the night I had before was, um, took a lot out of me.  Uh, it was a stressful environment.  And we were dancing a lot and the next day I just didn't feel right.  So, uh, I.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that was.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When she called me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When you were going to have her go too with you. Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, we were going to, yknow, kind of going out just to have some fun.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she knows my girlfriend.  Yknow, I think she has a problem that my girlfriend's younger than her.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Younger than your daughter? Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My daughter, yeah.  We're very close, we've been close for a year and a half.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, I think she has a problem with that.  And she had a problem with the large tattoo I got.  I think, um, she had a problem with me just trying to discuss this man who's 21 and wants, keeps calling me because he thinks he can learn from me because I said, yknow, I gave him a massage.  We talked about sex and he wants to learn for, yknow, his girlfriend and bring his girlfriend over.  And she, I can't understand that.  I can't, I just don't get why a 21 year old is calling a 45 year old, yknow.  And so there were several things that happened on the sense that I tried to share with her but it backfired - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I get it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow.  And, um, so I said, I was at a loss for words.  And I was, I didn't like the way she said that to me and I said, yknow, why are you talking to me that way?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So the sharing of all the things that had happened, happened over dinner a couple nights before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> During the day, yeah.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She [INAUDIBLE].  I mentioned the 21 year old, yknow.  And, um, and I said why are you talking to me this way, yknow?  I said what do you mean what my point is?  I invited you somewhere and I didn't hear anything, yknow.  You shouldn't talk to me this way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or even if she wasn't going to go, just to kind of let you know before.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not leave you hanging.[INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I said you said you were going to get back to me.  That's my point, yknow.  And [INAUDIBLE], oh, and then she told me what her plan was.  It was the next to the last day she was there, she was going to spend the day, uh, I don't know.  There's a new baby in the family.  Her brother, her half brother, had a baby with his girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So she spent practically the entire week with the baby.  Oh, she was going to spend the day babysitting.  I said bring the baby over.  I'm not bringing the baby over.  I said, okay, and then that night she was going to meet up with friends, stay overnight with them, and then have lunch with me before she goes to the airport.  I said I never even got a chance to give you all the presents I bought you.  Well, you can bring them to lunch.  I don't want to bring them to lunch.  Well, what do you mean?  Oh, it's always all about you, what you want.  And so I was just like, yknow, Christmas came and went, you and [NAME OTHER] could have come over.  Oh, you're a fucking something or other.  I just can't take you.  And I said, well, then don't take me.  And then she hung up.  So then I followed up with an e-mail saying, look, yknow, you don't have to worry about me.  I said, yknow, there's things I never told you 'cause I didn't want to screw your head up, yknow, about your father.  And, yknow, maybe give this thing a break for a few years.  And, yknow, yeah.  I said don't e-mail me because I'm not going to open them 'cause I don't think she could e-mail me anything compassionate.  And she could have sent me flowers or she could have sent me a card, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It took your brother a year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it took him to get well.  He wasn't well.  He was psychotic.  But he, he came around when he, yknow.  When she got psychotic she could have did, done a gesture but apparently she's not feeling like anywhere near compassionate.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like by the end of the week, yeah, I mean something [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean, since I, since then she's not, has not made any gesture to realize that she was harsh with me.  She still sees me as a self centered person, no matter how much, how much, she doesn't realize and she never will that I'm only self centered to the point where I took care of myself.  Yknow, with that, I'm very generous and love, and she doesn't get it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I think, I think the other thing too is you've been very proud of her, yknow, doing the things that she's doing of, yknow, being as independent as she is and working on her career, I think even when she was in college, she did all the right things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's always been on her own.  Yeah, with the making good judgments.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you've been very proud of her for that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like there were a lot of things that kind of interplayed.  Almost sounds like there was a level of, she's not quite as open, um.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like she's more conservative in a lot of ways.  And, um.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, this has been an ongoing conflict.  In, um, college when she said to me, you're not like, yknow, a real mother.  And I just was like, oh, she's having some conflict, yknow.  And, and now they're still going on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She may not realize what that meant until she's actually a mother herself.  Do you think that's in her cards?  You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she may not, or she's just has no idea of who I, she just doesn't want to know me for who I am.  She just can't get over that whatever that chasm or that wide, it's become wider and wider.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She needs to see you like the mother, yknow, [INAUDIBLE], or whatever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would like, I miss her who she, I miss, I don't miss this, this person that she is now.  I miss the person that she was when she could just like look at me and say, well, that's who she is, yknow what I mean?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it sounds like, I don't know, maybe the other thing that was happening, and I don't know what it was like for her in a sense, and I don't mean to defend her or anything because I don't know that, but if she was there from London for 5 days for such a big time, I don't know what, how much of her life was here in Philadelphia or what she had to deal with.  Sounds like she was over planning.  She was trying to do too much in a brief time, and not really taking into consideration the people that she was spending time with.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.  I mean, we were supposed to spend another day together originally.  That was the plan. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like to go to New York or something.  And I just kind of like, yknow, she wants to spend time with the baby.  But, uh, Christmas Eve and Christmas, I didn't hear from one of them.  Like my son, never heard from him around Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where does he love?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He lives like 2 miles from me.  And he, yknow, he also can't come to terms with [INAUDIBLE] that he has an ongoing conflict.  And he has said that.  He has this notion that I'm manipulative.  And I said even if I were, and I'm not saying I'm not, yknow, because everyone has to be shrewd if they're, yknow, going to be independent, making, yknow, make a lot of changes, they have to be really smart about it.  And men have helped me.  And he, yknow, living with me he observed it and he felt this was manipulation.  Then I said even if it were, even if I am, that's the worst thing in the world, yknow?  Yknow, like even if you were, your perception was correct, which it's not, but even if it were correct, why is that a problem?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, I guess unless he felt that you abused the manipulation.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like he would feel like I would do all this, like decorate his apartment, finance it, ah, get him out of jail, um, go to court with him, settle his finances, get him a job, and then he would think I would want something in return because I'd ask him to come over and move the outdoor furniture in the garage.  Oh, well, you always want something back.  He's the one who's manipulative really.  He's, he is.  He can, um, when he gets in relationships he, it's his way and he's, yknow, everyone tries to get their way and get control for what they want, but he has some kind of thing like his father had, sort of lacks compassion, he doesn't see where his needs override everybody else's.  And he's manipulative.  But I don't judge him for it.  Let him live his own life.  Let the women in his life deal with that.  It's just like he should not be concerned with my way I live my life.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How old is he now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Twenty eight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he's a smart guy.  And he's, um, matured a lot, yknow, because I took him back and sent him out again, took him back, and sent him out again.  Each time helping him lay groundwork for living an independent life.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I remember when he was in -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I worked, I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When he was going through major depression.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the problems with addictions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I was like working part time at the hospital and part time on his life for a couple years.  He doesn't, he knows I saved his ass.  But he at the same time, I don't know.  He just wants to keep secrets from me.  He is paying, I looked at the bank statements, he is paying on the charge that I financed his furniture.  He is continuing to keep his obligations financially.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's really good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, he knows.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Him being responsible.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He knows I did him a lot of, I did a lot for him in that.  Yknow, and he is keeping up his end of the bargain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There was a time that he was not particularly responsible with things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I had to teach him a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For him to actually do that [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's now responsible.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, maybe that's what we need to do to kind of like process the feelings or change the feeleings at least to know that you see him growing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.  I mean, that's what comforts me that they are in, they are running their own lives and they're, for the most part, well adjusted.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They've been through the worst of it, yknow.  You've seen them through [INAUDIBLE], you've seen them make changes in their lives to be more responsible and independent.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So no matter how much their feelings are and, yknow, whatever arguments may come up, yknow, you've seen them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know I've done a great job, regardless of what they think.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like there's room for improvement in their communications with you, but that may come with time too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yknow, there's like this thing in the DNA in our family and it's called estrangement.  And it's very pervasive.  It's even in the aunts and uncles and the cousins.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it's a 2 way street.  And estrangement doesn't happen just from 1 person.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I know.  I know.  And in some cases, yknow, I've initiated it because I'd rather have it than hostility - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow.  And in other cases, I, like years ago, went to a wedding, set of cousins are sitting at one, ones I hadn't seen them and had a chance to get to know them, they were completely stand offish, to my family, brothers and sisters, because of a status thing.  They thought they were a higher class.  So this is like crazy.  This is like in the family.  And it's on both sides, my mother's side and, my mother distanced herself from her sisters, and I never got to know my aunts and cousins on that side.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, with your daughter.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, maybe there's an upside too.  I mean, I wouldn't really be able to be who I am if I did have all this family obligation and I did have to mingle with such conservative people.  There would be just ongoing conflicts, yknow.  And that's the way I see it with my daughter.  If I didn't say it's better we don't be in touch, this trouble has been going on now for a year intensely.  Before that it was not, it was there, but it wasn't as intense.  It would blow over [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long has she been in London now?  When did she go?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Six months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Six months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She was in New York 6 months before that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So it's been a year that she's went away.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So when she first moved to New York she wasn't going to speak me or return phone calls or e-mails.  She just needed a break from me, even though we were never keeping in contact while she was in college, it was just like sporadic.  But she lived with me for a month before she left and she needed a break from me.  And so that's when it became a strain, a year ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, wasn't that interplay too?  You were going to visit her or talking about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I never planned to visit her in London, because I have extreme jet lag.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't understand that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  That's what it was.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She'd invited you to come.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she never gave me any, she just said, yknow, basically an open invitation, yknow, and why don't you come and you're going to, yknow, you should come, you're going to regret your daughter lives in London and you never came because you could have seen Europe.  And I'm like you don't understand, I have a medical condition, yknow, and I'd be miserable the whole time 'cause I was when I was in Paris.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And her girlfriend went out there, I think her father may go out there.  I can't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's only there for a year?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So she doesn't understand that either.  She doesn't understand my medical struggles.  That's self centered.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In her eyes?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh, it's in your mind.  Yeah.  The jet lag thing, yknow, the non-sleeping and how it affects me and.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] miserable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I feel miserable for 2 weeks.  My cycle gets thrown off.  Yeah.  If I miss 2 hours of sleep I feel it the next day.  And that's, that becomes another challenge for, like I was overwhelmed yesterday because, yknow, there's a lot to do for the business and I feel challenged because of my time constraints, yknow, 'cause I know I have a finite amount of energy in that day.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And sometimes I just get so frustrated with that, yknow.  But some people stay up to 2, 3 in the morning to get things done and they get up at 9 o'clock. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And that's not a reality.  It's not a possibility.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your body says that there's more to do but it's your body and you know your energy says you need to do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my nervous system, yeah.  So that gets a little, a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You said on the phone yesterday the business is [INAUDIBLE] trying to get, been under anxiety about the business.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, I was just getting, yknow, there's, there's, there's independent contractors to figure out how to do Excel to keep track of their commission.  It's just like, they're switching over a new computer from this to the XP.  There's burning CDs, so I can have music in the front room.  So much stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Those are, I guess, we talked about.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's other, my tax preparations, I hired someone to reconcile my bank statements, personal business.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we talked a lot about obviously the relationship with the kids and the holidays.  And although it sounds like the business things are things though that you're able to, there's a lot there -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But they're things that are manageable. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Marketing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can get your mind around and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, it's not like I, and I hired people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, I don't do it myself.  I don't, yknow, I hire people to clean for me. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hire people to do the books.  I hire people to do the music.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been hiring a lot of people lately to relieve the burden, yknow, and to do things I don't really want to learn.  But I have to learn certain things.  I have to learn the Excel, how to do it.  Yknow, and I have, like there's just a lot of things, there's marketing, yknow, um, I'm marketing the gay community through PGN, so like a gay news, and I'm, they're going to be starting to go to the Go Games.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I go to a networking group 2 hours a week.  I do my choir 2 hours a week.  I go to a chiropractor twice a week.  It's a lot to juggle along with making an income, seeing clients, building the foundation of the business, having the physical location of the business, and keeping up with that.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to hire a laundry service.  I will have something, somebody clean that when it becomes used more often.  Getting, laying out a plan for scheduling for that, yknow.  So, yeah, it's all, it's all exciting, yknow - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Full.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And full, and then I'm enrolled as an erotic educator for this California program correspondent, so I had a great [INAUDIBLE] conference with that last night.  And I'm able to, yknow, put some of that into my, I'm also educating myself about tantra and so that's my other business.  I basically have 2 businesses.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't combine the 2.  I have two separate phone numbers.  Someone calls me on the cell phone number because they've had that number from prior when I was marketing it as All for You before it became erotic.  I said please call me back on this other number, yknow, 'cause I can't really discuss that other business.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I've got 2 businesses I'm running.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are only 24 hours in the day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, for me there's only like 14 hours in a day and that includes all the maintenance that I have to deal with, like appointments and GYN, that is coming up, chiropractor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You need prescriptions today too, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I need for the Lamictal.  [INAUDIBLE].  I have these hearings, 1 with Blue Cross because they insist I was out of network when I was hospitalized and I insist that the doctors were telling me, no they were telling me that I had to be transferred in order to be in network.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is at Wilmington?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they sent me to Wilmington by ambulance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause you were, where'd you start off?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I went to Jefferson.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Jefferson.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so there's, so I go to court for them, I go to court for the other hearing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So we increased the Lamictal to 150 right?  And you're getting, what strengths are you, are you taking one and a half of the hundreds, breaking a hundred in half?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I used the samples you gave me.  I took 2 of them plus the whole one, the pink one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'll write for the 100s.  They have a score across them.  So you can take one and a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean they have a score?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They have a line across them that you can break them in half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Are you giving me samples again?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you another sample package.  I'm going to write the prescription, so you can take it to the pharmacy, but I'll write for the large ones.  Just one type of tablet.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's why it's going to be harder.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it'll be a hundred and a half, so 150, so you'll get, 30, 20 you'll get 45.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Wait a minute.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's one and a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's for 30 days.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Am I going to take one a day?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One and a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll have to break them in half?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they don't come in a higher strength?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They don't come as 150s.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They don't come as 150s, got it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly. And you're still getting a month at a time for your prescriptions, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Unless you can write it differently, but I don't think you can.  I need a receipt from today.  When I paid you in cash you did give me a receipt, but I'm being billed by the office for that day.  So I have to look up the receipt.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I have it from December 24th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I keep a receipt copy.  I'll let [NAME OTHER] know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that'd be great.  I think that's the day they're billing me for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You had paid, I have where you paid 75 actually on October 30th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think that's the date in question.  I think it's that December one like you just said.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to submit like an outpatient sheet for the day so it includes the cash transaction too on it, so they should have a copy of that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe it's another day.  I have to look at the bill again.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll be in the office tomorrow.  Check with [NAME OTHER].  She's usually -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  But I think I've been keeping up with it with cash.  But now I'm just going to write checks, so if I remember.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think you may need prescriptions for the Klonopin [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I have a UTI.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Actually I think you're okay with the Klonopin, but you definitely need the Prozac.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And can you write that any, you can't write that different, right?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We did with the Klonopin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, the Klonopin you did.  Yeah, that was good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] taking these other ones.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I love my work, I love doing facials and I love doing tantra with the erotica, and I even do role play with some of my, yknow, my regular clients.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Boundaries are still?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sometimes there's no boundaries because they're regular and we have agreements, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 25, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's the check number?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty six, thirty one.  Yeah, my instructor for the erotic school, he's like saying I don't see what the problem is for you to masturbate and teach masturbation.  And I'm like, well, there is a problem.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I told him, I'm in Pennsylvania and he said he used to work in Philadelphia and he advertised as an erotic coach.  I said, well, I was arrested, so I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So let's see [INAUDIBLE] 6weeks is March 11th, 8 weeks is March 25th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Eight weeks is fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So March 25th at 11?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Think I'm setting myself up for a disappointment because my birthday's in a month and I'm wondering if either one of them [INAUDIBLE].  I think I'm setting myself up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I should just accept that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you're expecting something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not expecting, but I'm wondering.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're expecting that they're going to acknowledge it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're basing happiness on your birthday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And dependent on that, then yes you're setting yourself up.  If you're going to your birthday and you're going to make the best of it regardless of whether they [INAUDIBLE] maybe they'll surprise you, but I would say if you go into it expecting nothing from them given the way the communications are, then you'll be fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm expecting nothing, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to be sad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, yknow, that's just kind of where things are in the communication timing, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I just wonder what the toll is going to be, yknow.</p>

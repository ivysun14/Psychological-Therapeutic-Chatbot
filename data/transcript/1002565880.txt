<p><b>DR:</b>	One more.  How was your weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keeping busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] my girlfriend's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's she at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She doing this summer?  Relaxing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's going to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she?  Where at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do they do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Catholic bookstore run by sisters.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Downtown?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So how's your summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not too bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too bad?  Busy enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've been, haven't been able to work as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I messed my back up so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just lifted something wrong and pulled a muscle and it's gotten, getting worse and I'm going through therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Helping at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They teach you some exercises to strengthen it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those Williams' exercises, they still use those, lying on your back and lifting legs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's kind of like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good if you can stick with it.  Most people don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Make those muscles stronger and hopefully not have problems later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] I've been doing it twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  How's the mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Are you still taking your Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wellbutrin, Adderall, Lexapro, and sometimes Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, all the same doses of the Lexapro and the Wellbutrin?  That seems to be a good combination for you still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often do you forget to take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not often.  And your sleep pattern tends to be all better, you don't need Ambien every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not every night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How can you tell you need it?  Just can't get to sleep or can you tell ahead of time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I just know if I'm going to be like [INAUDIBLE] or like if I have a, if I'm like at someone else's house, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, something different, a different atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know you won't sleep as good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or if I'm stressed out about something the next day which doesn't happen much in the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When does it happen, when you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I'm at school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you stressed out about over the summer though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not really stressed in the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  School.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is coming up, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking next term at school, what classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only have one year left, so I'm just taking my remaining business courses [INAUDIBLE].  I signed up for them, I signed up for them all a long time ago too so I haven't looked at them in a while.  Doesn't start until the 26th, so it's a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When do you check in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably go down there the 16th, 17th.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	First day of classes 25th?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twenty sixth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty sixth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are moving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we're trying to find a place downtown.  We've been living off [DEIDENTIFIED] which is like really close to the school [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Just drive and stay there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of annoying too.  Are you getting any places open?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they've got a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just got to find one to suit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One last year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many hours you working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Close to 40, but lately it's not much because of my back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't do as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Saving money?  Girlfriends tend to take that in gas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Not too much.  I mean, gas costs more [INAUDIBLE].  We don't really go out to eat all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take her out to eat at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.  She lives there so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is she living downtown or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  A lot of good restaurants there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's some good food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I found one out of [DEIDENTIFIED] last time I was down there a couple weeks ago, the [DEIDENTIFIED] something or another out there, you ever eaten there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's the [DEIDENTIFIED] or something, it's an old shrimp boat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I thought you [INAUDIBLE], no I haven't been there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a restaurant, it's very good.  Don't like seafood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eh, I like shrimp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's all fresh right there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of tired today, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Staying up late?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not too late.  Maybe like 12:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You on some medicine for your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what it's called, it's an anti—inflammatory.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any thing like Flexeril or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Soma, I use that a lot I know.  Some of them make you tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's 2, I take 2 of them at once [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some of them have antispasmodic qualities for muscle spasm and make you tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That may be why I'm tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the physical therapy, I'm glad you're doing that.  You've been healthy otherwise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably not too, probably also starting [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not for a while.  Probably swim?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I don't have anyplace to swim.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are things at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Family okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go anywhere this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No travel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] my sister, my sister got married so all my family went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How'd that go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No unexpected surprises?  Everybody behaved?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I've noticed with the Adderall though like it really helps me focus really a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But once it wears off—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just can't seem to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Guess you better take it regularly, huh?  Lasts about how many hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] 2 to 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Had you took the extended release before?  The Adderall, the capsules?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, in a capsule?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What you take's in a tablet and they make it in a capsule.  It's a long acting.  I don't see where I've ever written it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could try that, last twice as much, twice as long, huh?  If you want it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It could be better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it depends on what you're looking for.  You know, a lot of adults like the tablets because they can take it, they know how long it's going to last and that block of time, then they just take it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true.  [INAUDIBLE] twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You take 1 or 2 in the afternoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take 2 in the morning usually and then 1 in the afternoon and it seems to work.  Four usually is too much.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happens if you take 4 in a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I'm still [INAUDIBLE] my appetite decreases [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you get up at let's say 7:00, you take your 2 Adderall, you don't take the next one until 1:00 or something like that, it only lasts 3 hours then you're 3 hours with no coverage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I usually take them when I start to like notice I'm losing steam [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that would last, or occur about when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's see, it's not as quite as powerful but it still lasts, I don't know maybe an hour and a half to 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you take it let's say at 7:00, wears off at 10:00, is that what you're saying, 3 hours later?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I guess with the 2 it last more than 3.  [INAUDIBLE].  I guess it does last me like 4 hours.  I guess it only lasts 2 or 3 when I take like 1.  [INAUDIBLE] possible.  I mean, I just don't feel much jolt from 1.  Two and 2 just seems to be too much for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you spread it up into 3 doses if you took an extra dose late in the afternoon or early evening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never thought about doing 3 like instead of taking 2, that might be better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've taken 1 in the morning before and that wasn't enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess it wasn't, but I don't know if [INAUDIBLE].  It might have been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, the 2 in the morning don't make you feel bad, do they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What's the latest in the day you've ever taken it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe like 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that didn't keep you up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it hasn't affected my appetite, unless I take, when I take 4 [INAUDIBLE].  That's because I'll take 2 and 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they're only 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean maybe it was just that 1 time but seemed like the one time [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I gave you enough for 4 a day and that way, you know, you'll have extra if you don't use it and if you do want to try it you could take 2 in the morning and 1 at 12:00, and 1 at 4:00 or something to see if that helps you for the whole day if you have, you know, if you've got stuff you've got to do in the evening and you're kind of crashing and can't focus or.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can't get yourself organized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I probably need it for school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're not missing your Lexapro and Wellbutrin are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.  I might like think I ran out of Lexapro 1 night or the other and I called it in, so I might, I'll miss it maybe like once a month [INAUDIBLE].  I take Lexapro at night now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Wellbutrin [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Much trouble falling asleep, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  I mean, sometimes I'll go through [INAUDIBLE].  Ambien doesn't seem to have as big of effect as it used to.  Maybe that's just like my body.  [INAUDIBLE] been taking Ambien [INAUDIBLE] fall asleep like when I'm, like that, like this [INAUDIBLE] sleep.  It was last night I knew I wouldn't fall asleep and I took it last night and the night before that I didn't take any [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Either way you're able to get more in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  If I'm taking Adderall then like when I first get up fine, but once I wake up [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long's it take to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fifteen minutes.  Twenty minutes [INAUDIBLE].  Is that pretty normal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, all right, right on the mark.  And 3 or 4 hours is about right as far as duration.  Frustrated much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.  I don't really have the anger issues anymore.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Impatient or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really impatient [INAUDIBLE].  Last month I had a hard time getting motivated.  I just like, it was like I just don't want to work today [INAUDIBLE] all my friends are down in [DEIDENTIFIED] so [INAUDIBLE].  And wake up at 5:30 and not back until 7:00, by that time I'm exhausted.  [INAUDIBLE] and watch TV.  Lately it's [INAUDIBLE] a little bit more relaxed.  My back feels better, [INAUDIBLE], back to exercising so [INAUDIBLE].  It hurts a little bit and that's why some things at work I have to use a little bit of force, it's like pulling a little bit and then after a while like [INAUDIBLE].  I start to get like a little numbness [INAUDIBLE].  There's periods where I [INAUDIBLE].  Hopefully it'll be better by the time school starts.  Just do my exercises and heating and cooling and that what takes up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Takes a lot of time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's like 2 hours of my day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does take time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At least.  It's worth it because it's been working.  And then I go to physical therapy and I get ultrasound heat treatment and that works.  Going through exercise there, ice pack, pretty much just do the heating pad for 10 minutes, 10, 15 minutes, do the exercise which takes like 40 minutes, 35, 40 minutes, and then I do ice after that.  And for some reason I guess heating and cooling helps with the inflammation [INAUDIBLE].  Put off going for a while, that's why I got better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I waited like a month because it would go off and on.  And I was just re—injuring it over and over, it would heal and then re—injure [INAUDIBLE].  Finally I was like I'm just tired of this crap.  I just, I've seen what it does, you know.  I have a friend who he screwed his back up.  He's a weight lifter and he's obsessive about it.  He's huge.  I mean he doesn't take steroids but he looks like he does.  But he works out nonstop.  And his back hurts him all the time.  And, you know, he gets numb, he [INAUDIBLE] see a doctor and he goes to a doctor [INAUDIBLE] not like chiropractor and stuff but a real doctor.  [INAUDIBLE] I don't want to end up like that, so trying to just take it easy.  That's the one thing that's been a little bit stress factor I guess is the back.  For a while I was wondering if it was going to get better [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're pretty good overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, overall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I hope you have a good term down there this next year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, me too.  I need to maybe start off on the right track because I get like overwhelmed sometimes and that makes [INAUDIBLE] shut down.  I need to get organized because it's going to be all hard stuff to do this year.  [INAUDIBLE].  Start out that way so I don't get behind, because once I get behind and [INAUDIBLE] old habit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You should go back to your own comfort zone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really do.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, you know, if you find yourself doing that, then change your habits, change something.  You know, your routines, you know, do something else.  But it's not easy a lot of times.  Uh, scripts, I guess get you some Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying to think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just got your Wellbutrin I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and Lexapro I think it's my last one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  It's the last one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It said 1 refill left and I need to call it in.  [INAUDIBLE] amount of Adderall left.  I'm not sure how many refills are left on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None.  You never have refills on that anyways.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, there is no [INAUDIBLE] refills on this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not allowed, no, I wish.  Get low on any of these just call me and I'll send it to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  Will you say that exercise does have a big impact on your mood?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes I wonder, you know, which comes first, uh, the good mood and the exercise, they feel good, or do you, uh, exercise and then feel better?  I think it's the latter, probably, or maybe it's both.  Just reinforce itself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I felt like pretty crappy [INAUDIBLE] because I mean I used to do a little bit, but now I'm just starting to [INAUDIBLE] starting to feel pretty [INAUDIBLE].  I heard that it releases endorphins, which is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, running and [INAUDIBLE] runner's high, I think though just in general you get more energy.  You know, when you first start working out, of course you already have less energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's probably why.  I think I'll stick with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here are your refills.  And see you back when you get a break sometime.  You going to come back home often?</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p> (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (PAUSE) [00:01:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Thank you. (PAUSE) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:03:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know where to start. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:03:57) Spring Break.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? [00:03:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought I was going to go away so that’s why I didn’t, I canceled the session this last week. And this friend of mine, like I guess high school friend from Nepal, he said, “Oh, you should come visit me in (inaudible at 00:04:25)” and he like bought a ticket for me and stuff. (LAUGHTER) But like almost a month before my trip, like we lost touch. Like he would Skype like every day. It was like... (LAUGHTER) He was like a pest. You know? Like just as I was getting down to my work, he would ping me and insist that I talk to him and I’d talk for like half an hour sometimes, you know, longer. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) I mean, I guess I thought I was getting something out of that as well. But it really felt like, you know, like a burden on my time. Just as I’m about to start writing, he’s pinging me and it’s like... If I let myself get annoyed, it’s really annoying. (LAUGHTER) But I was like, “Oh, it’s okay, I guess. You have to be there for people. This is how you build friendships and relationships. Blah, blah, blah.” (inaudible at 00:05:37) concerned about stuff. But... So yeah. He bought me a ticket and stuff. And I was like, “Really? Should I really do this? I haven’t really spent much time with him and actually...” [00:05:57]</p>

<p>I mean, we’ve known each other for a very long time. But like... (PAUSE) I didn’t really spend that much time with him. (PAUSE) So it was a bit weird. I mean, I felt weird about the idea, you know, going all the way to (inaudible at 00:06:19) just to visit some guy that, you know, is for, you know, practical purposes is kind of a stranger. And I guess I didn’t end up going. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. We kind of lost touch. He stopped pinging me. Like two days before the flight, I was like, “Hey. I’m still coming.” (LAUGHTER) Like a day later, he’s like, “Something bad has happened at work and I think we’ll cancel the trip for now.” I’m like, “Yeah, sure.” But, you know, I was like really hurt. Or hurt as in more like, you know, like... [00:07:03]</p>

<p>I canceled everything for this, that week and... So it’s just... It sounds more foolish than anything else. I’m just sitting around in D.C.. (LAUGHTER) I mean, I could have made my own plans as soon as that fell through. But I didn’t. (LAUGHTER) Like I was supposed to fly out on Saturday and I heard from him on Friday. It’s just like... This is no way to treat a friend. You know? Especially someone you’ve been pinging every single day and been very kind of open with and friendly. Right? I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you think to talk about it before in here? You were thinking about going and not sure and feeling ambivalent? [00:07:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I think to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you think about talking about it in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn’t... It wasn’t on my mind then. I hadn’t brought it up. Right? Or I had?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I just think there are so many instances where you tell me about things after the fact. But things leading up to it, you know, that it’s clear that what’s going on before something happens could be helpful to talk about and think about together. But you don’t. And it’s sort of almost mysterious. It’s like, “I’m going out of the country.” It’s very mysterious. You didn’t actually tell me anything about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then clearly it’s complicated. You’re not really sure if you’re going to go. But you don’t really talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I’m wondering why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not prepared. Like I don’t prepare for things. (LAUGHTER) I guess that... This is a sign of that. I didn’t really want to think about it. I didn’t want it to occupy much of my time. [00:09:05]</p>

<p>I didn’t really like this guy. I was kind of mean to him and very mean to him because he liked me and I didn’t like him back. I felt that was such a burden on me. Like I felt like he was asking something of me that I really couldn’t give. And that really made me feel burdened or, you know, like... Yeah. So I was mean to him. Like this was I guess when he was in the U.S. I was in Ohio and he was in Pittsburgh. It was 2006. (PAUSE) Yeah. But like since last year, we were, we became friends again. That is we just spoke on the phone and stuff. (PAUSE) And... (PAUSE) Like I didn’t really think much of it, of him, of the trip. So I didn’t really want to think about it. I guess I was in denial or I was like, “Oh, this is too weird for me to think about. Maybe if I don’t think about it, it’ll go away.” [00:10:09]</p>

<p>Go away, not as in like not happen. But go away as in like it won’t be such a big deal. I didn’t want to make it a big deal. I guess that’s why I didn’t bring it up here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what does a big deal mean? What (inaudible at 00:10:29).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it... You know, occupied with it or preoccupied with it or you’re thinking about it constantly. I don’t really know. I have a very weird... (PAUSE) ...understanding of thinking itself. (LAUGHTER) I don’t really understand (inaudible at 00:10:51). (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Feeling ambivalent or confused about the process of thinking itself. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) Like what is thinking versus what is over thinking or what is planning versus going with the flow or... You know? (PAUSE) Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Sounds like a very basic human thing like breathing. But... (PAUSE) I guess if you had to be confused about breathing, you could be confused about that too. Like what is breathing? Are you supposed to breathe from your nose or your mouth or your diaphragm? You know? (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) What was the initial question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why you didn’t bring it up in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. What was your second question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm... (PAUSE) [00:12:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like something you’re trying to make a decision about that’s not clear to you is something that certainly people bring up in therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it’s... It wasn’t as big of a deal. I feel like I was dealing with bigger things. It just... I just was like a low priority for me. (PAUSE) I mean, I was like, “Really? Is this really happening? No one’s ever bought...” Chris (ph) has bought tickets for me. But that was (inaudible at 00:12:51). Has he? No, no. That... (PAUSE) [00:12:57]</p>

<p>Yeah, if I was in Nepal, he’d buy tickets for me because he has a bank account there or a credit card. Yeah. So it never happened like someone buying me like a thousand dollar plane ticket. (LAUGHTER) So I was really like baffled by it and like, “Yeah. Okay, you have a lot of money or a nice job. But why are you doing this? What does this mean?” It was too much. I didn’t really think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too much... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just too much. Yeah, I mean, too much (inaudible at 00:13:35). Unusual. Unprecedented. I don’t know. (PAUSE) You’re saying that normal people... (LAUGHTER) Not normal people but... I could have talked to you about this and prepared myself. [00:13:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not only that but it’s almost mysterious...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How little you said is striking too. Usually, people go away for a week, they just say, “Oh, I’m going here.” They say something even if they’re not talking to me about the decision. They tell me where they’re going. So there was like something mysterious... “I’ll be out of the country.”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So little was said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so if I had bought the ticket, I was planning the trip, I would have had much more agency and active, I would have actively participated and actively thought about it. But I felt so passive in this scenario. You know, the ticket was bought for me already. All I had to do was print it out, pack a bag, take my passport and go to the airport. You know? (LAUGHTER) I mean, that is like surreal to me. That’s not happened. And I didn’t really believe that it was, this was real, you know, this was for real. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>And, you know, come Friday when I got his message, I was just like... It was almost like, “Oh, I knew all along this was just a joke.” You know? So... (PAUSE) In a way, I’m glad that my unpreparedness prepared me for it. You know what I mean? Like if I had really thought about it, if I had prepared, if I had my bag ready like several days in advance and, you know, looked up places in Qatar (ph), and, “We’re going to go to this place. I’m going to see this mosque, eat there,” then I would have been really disappointed. You know? I didn’t want to think about it. I don’t know this guy. I was... I feel like I was right in not trusting him such that I was only depressed for like day or two when I realized that he let me down. You know? [00:16:07]</p>

<p>For whatever reason, you know, things beyond his control... I feel like my unpreparedness was the right thing to do. (LAUGHTER) And I’m not defending myself. I’m like just now thinking about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but you canceled the sessions. You must have arranged some parts of your schedule to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. Yeah. I canceled a tea with my professor that I’ve been trying to arrange for the last three months. That I was really upset about. (LAUGHTER) But... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it’s not like you didn’t prepare at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I feel like, you know, anticipation would have made it a lot worse. (PAUSE) I mean, I prepared by canceling meetings. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>It was different than anticipating things. (PAUSE) Well, I could say that I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. I just was unpleasantly surprised. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but you weren’t sure if you wanted to go. Part of why he maybe sort of dropped it is because he felt you weren’t interested. He may have been responding to you. If you were presenting to him that you were eager and excited, he may not have said what he did on Friday. So it’s not... It wasn’t just him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s fine. You know, I don’t really want to invest in that way in that friendship. You know? It’s really like weird for me to go to somewhere so far away and not know practically anyone except him and his roommate. You know? I would have been staying in an apartment with two strange guys in a strange country. So, in a way, I’m glad it didn’t happen. You know? [00:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why say yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I didn’t really have a choice. He just kind of sent me a ticket and I was like, “Wait. I told you that I cannot afford to do this right now.” He was like, “Don’t worry about the money. Just enjoy your break.” I was like, “Okay.” And (inaudible at 00:18:25) I guess I’ll see what happens. I feel like I don’t really have agency or I don’t allow myself to take agency in certain matters. I guess I would like to work on that. No, I know I would like to. But, I mean, another thing I wanted to like say about this was it’s kind of sad that I don’t anticipate. (LAUGHTER) In the sense that I know anticipation is to me, like 90% of the pleasure of any situation. You know? [00:19:11]</p>

<p>So it’s kind of sad (LAUGHTER) this this, like I go through life like this. I mean, I should say I go through life like this. But, you know, like... (PAUSE) It’s a simple joy. And like I think I would be much more engaged and alive and active and have agency if I allowed myself to anticipate or, as you said, you know, like bring it up and talk about it (LAUGHTER) and think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, make a decision.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even before the decision making. Like be actively thinking and be actively present. Like how hard would it have been for me to kind of like allow myself to think when he says, “Come to Qatar,” me thinking, “Okay. This is (inaudible at 00:20:15) ground level reality. Me in a strange apartment with strange guys in a strange country. I don’t want to do this.” [00:20:21]</p>

<p>I could have just said, “I don’t want to do this,” or, you know, “Let’s meet up in (LAUGHTER) some neutral space.” (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) I’m changing slowly. I feel I am trying to actively think in some scenarios and plan and, you know, not just react. [00:21:07]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) But I guess I just like to keep going (LAUGHTER) keep doing this and improving as a planner. (PAUSE) Yeah. I keep telling everyone, Chris and so on, “What is this? Like why is this guy completely incommunicado? I don’t understand anything, you know, like if what he’s saying, what happened at work is really the truth or if something else is going on.” [00:22:09]</p>

<p>I have no... I feel totally clueless. Like do I trust him? Do I not trust him? How do I feel about this? And I don’t know. And then I’m just like, “Leave it. Forget about it. (LAUGHTER) I can’t really do anything about it.” You know? (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 00:22:45) reminds me of the situation you were in last summer with that old guy. I mean, obviously the situations are very different. But I’m trying to figure out what the similarity is. The similarity seems to me like, “You know, this doesn’t feel quite right. I’m not really sure what’s going on.” You know, like... [00:23:03]</p>

<p>And, at that point, rather than talking about it with someone and trying to understand what you’re feeling, how you’re feeling by reflect the situation and then starting to really anchor yourself and think about it and then maybe make a decision based on it or not, like you’re just kind of like, “Well, let’s just... We’ll just ignore it. We’ll forget it and maybe it’ll go away.” And then something happens and it’s... I mean, in this case, it’s, nothing terrible happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it’s kind of the same process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. It is. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t know. (PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) I mean, I feel confused about him too as like a friend or whatever. I mean, yeah. So I don’t really know what I should feel about him and how I should respond to his Skype calls or like, and then, you know, the ticket or... Yeah. I guess I should have talked about it. (LAUGHTER) Or even just allowed myself to rationally think about it. (PAUSE) With some situations, you can’t really ignore. (LAUGHTER) I feel like I’ll ignore it and then it’ll just go away. But... (PAUSE) I guess that doesn’t happen. [00:24:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then there’s your feelings which you shouldn’t ignore either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The feelings you have about the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Like how do you mean in this scenario?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, he’s annoying you. You’re not really sure what to do. But then you should feel like, “Oh, that’s how friendships are built by being sort of flexible.” But you’re having all these feelings that you’re trying to sort out and that are confusing to you and that’s one of the reasons that you’re coming to see me so I can help you with those experiences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t... I was confused about that whole thing. Like some... I remember several instances where I was really annoyed. Like I was just about to start writing and he’s Skyping and I was like... I don’t know. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>I, you know, thought, “Okay. Just one more two minutes.” And then, you know, we ended up talking for half an hour and every five minutes, I’m like, “Okay. I’ve got to go.” But he’s like, “No. Let’s talk more. Just five more minutes.” And to me that was like really annoying where I feel trapped. (LAUGHTER) You know, I feel like... It’s not my annoyance... It’s not like a powerful kind of, you know, big man getting angry. It’s me, like a little kind of internalizing my annoyance and feeling trapped and feeling victimized kind of. You know, that’s how my annoyance manifests itself or how I experience it. But... (PAUSE) I didn’t really know what to do about it. You know? Because I felt obliged because he had bought me a ticket. So I guess I was talking to him more out of a sense of obligation. You know? (PAUSE) [00:27:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) I don’t know. (PAUSE) And like how do you figure that out? Like when someone is kind of not respecting your time versus they’re just kind of genuinely in need or like they’re genuinely... I mean, they don’t mean to disrespect. They’re just... (PAUSE) Yeah. They’re just in need. You know? Like Darren (ph) can be like that. He’s very... He needs attention a lot. But I feel like if I tell him, “No, I really need to go and work,” I think he listens. You know? [00:27:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like there’s your answer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you were saying that Darren is in need but, in the end, he respects what you have to say versus just pushing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there’s not any sort of very clear categories. It probably exists on a continuum. But it seems like there’s one end of the continuum or the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a little bit the way you describe your gay friend. I’m calling him your gay friend because it’s easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you know, “Just a little bit more. Let me just... I just need a little bit more of your help.”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He is... He’s getting like that. Like yesterday also, he kept pinging, “Let’s go watch this movie.” I kept saying, “No, no, no. Some other time.” (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I’m new to this where... Maybe I’m not new. But I feel like it feels new this whole thing of people wanting my attention, my help, my time and me trying to figure out like how much of myself I can give to them.” [00:29:09]</p>

<p>Like this gay friend (LAUGHTER) he really took a lot of time this, during this break. You know, and I regret some of that time. But not too much, I guess. I feel like I still kind of... (PAUSE) I mean, I didn’t meet my target but I don’t want to think of it that way because I am continuing to write. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are continuing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I have the momentum still from this break in terms of like writing. And so... (PAUSE) [00:30:01]</p>

<p>How much time do we have?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have over ten minutes. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanted to kind of bring up something else so, you know, we can talk about it and I can prepare. (LAUGHTER) So I’m looking for jobs and I don’t... I want to understand exactly why I’m looking for whatever and like what will be the, what will make most sense for me. (PAUSE) This is a critical time for me. I have good momentum on my book and I want to finish and I got into that program that, you know, that people work on their novels for a whole year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. [00:30:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. It’s very expensive actually. (LAUGHTER) But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What program is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s with this writing place in D.C. and they take in like ten students and we’re all working on their novels. It’s very expensive but I got their scholarship so it’s by half. But it’s still like $4,000. (LAUGHTER) So I... And I won’t get, I won’t have any money coming in over the summer because at school that’s how they do it. So I was thinking, you know, what kind of jobs I could do. And... (PAUSE) And partly, like when I was applying, I mostly applied this past week when I was supposed to be on Spring Break. I think like the motivation kind of came from a place of panic a little bit. I don’t know. Because I thought that I was going to be in Qatar and, you know, like (PAUSE) part of the reason to go was to feel kind of, you know, taken care of by a friend and, you know, I was going to ask him for a little bit of money because he had already like offered. [00:32:21]</p>

<p>I don’t know why I was going to do that. But not that I cannot pay the whole tuition myself but I still have this sense of panic and motivation because I’m not... (LAUGHTER) I don’t have a full time job. I don’t know. So... (PAUSE) I just want to understand like why am I looking for jobs and, you know, I don’t want to end up taking a full time job and feel trapped and then again at a time when I really am... I should focus on my book and, you know, keep going, keep kind of, keep the momentum going and kind of continue to live poorly, not poorly but, you know, like the way that I’m doing right now. So... [00:33:15]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) Yeah. (LAUGHTER) I hope I don’t end up making a mistake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re... When does the program start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In May.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is that in addition to going to school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I wanted to drop out but people are like, “No.” And then like maybe I should have one more year. So... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you want to get a part time position while you’re doing this or a full time... What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I guess I have to just look at my time commitments. But if I don’t... [00:34:03]</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ll have any, I’ll have the (SIGH) university job in the summer. So... (PAUSE) I’ll be pretty... I’ll have more time from May, mid-May to like September. So I’m wondering what I should do. If I should temp or if I should do waitressing. I have no experience in that. (LAUGHTER) Chris is like, “You should do something that you already have experience in and stuff.” So... (PAUSE) I even took this fitness training program yesterday. (LAUGHTER) It’s like a dance program. But it’s also a very... I’m like... I’m so sore right now. I don’t know why I felt I could do it. But maybe I can. [00:35:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) So I’m trying out different things to see what is the best thing for me. And I’m... (PAUSE) I’m interviewing with this place for a full time job that I feel like I don’t know. Can I really do this? It’s in a completely new industry. (PAUSE) But I feel like... I can’t really understand... I can’t anticipate or predict if I will be happy doing that and I’ll come back, you know, from a nine to five job still feeling I could write or if that’s a totally ridiculous idea and I should not have, not do that at all, not do any job or do something that, you know, (PAUSE) brings in money but maybe money is not that important. It’s also important to kind of keep feeling kind of positive and motivated and confident. So like if I could find a job that makes me feel that way, then it’ll also fuel into my writing or... [00:36:19]</p>

<p>I mean, I don’t want to do something that completely drains me and stresses me out and I don’t want to do anything but, you know, veg in front of a TV which is what I felt like, you know, two, three years ago when I was doing full time work. (PAUSE) So... (PAUSE) I’m thinking about this. I hope I have (LAUGHTER) I come up with the right solution and not, you know, make a decision out of panic or starvation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you do the full time job and school as well? [00:36:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) I don’t know what school will look like. I should find out. But I think I’ll have less coursework. Yeah. I’m really just lost in school. (LAUGHTER) I’m just like kind of only half there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re not sure if you want to continue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, like I said, I don’t want to drop out because that’s bad. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea in your... I mean, you have a degree.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have the same exact degree already. I have no idea if it’s bad or not. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t think it matters and if I make it as a writer, I don’t think it’ll matter if I dropped out. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you turned to me to ask if it’s bad? [00:37:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I’m just like confirming. (LAUGHTER) I guess just looking to you to ask if it’s considered bad. (PAUSE) Or in the professional field, look at something and say, “Oh, well you dropped out.” But I don’t think I have to put that in my resume at all. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I guess it gets... One of the thing it gets down to is how does one make decisions about things that are thoughtful and (inaudible at 00:38:35)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. How do you do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By thinking about them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Am I thinking about it correct? At least in this job thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re trying to think about it, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:38:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like the guy in Qatar was a little bit tied up with money like maybe he’d give you some money to help with this new program.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I was talking to him about it and I was like, “Yeah. It’s expensive.” He was like, “Oh, just give me a heads up and for that much amount of money, I need some heads up. If it’s little, then you can just ask me.” And I was like, “Wait. I don’t know what I’m going to ask you. But, okay, if you’re offering.” (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) No, I think that’s... I should... I shouldn’t panic. I shouldn’t feel like I need to ask people for money. I have... You know, I can pay the whole thing myself. I shouldn’t... I just have this in the back of my head that, “Oh, I don’t have a job and my mom’s rent is also kind of there and my situation.” [00:40:09]</p>

<p>So, financially, I’m not doing too well and therefore I, I’m looking to others. And I think that’s like a bad scene to be in. You know? So I shouldn’t do that. I should stop feeling that way and try and feel more empowered. One thing is feeling. The other thing is the actual, you know, ground level reality. Material conditions... So if having a full time job makes me feel more empowered, do I make sure I do it or, at this time, you know, like... Whatever takes time away from writing... I mean, it will. But more importantly will it be too much stress and make me not write at all. You know? [00:41:15]</p>

<p>So I feel like the only way to find out is to take up a job and see. And if it doesn’t work, then I quit which is really bad if I quit in a week or two weeks or a month. But then what can you do? You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you quit that soon, you didn’t really give it a chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, what can you know in two weeks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes with a job, you, it takes, you have to put a lot more effort in initially just because you’re learning the job and it may take a lot less effort and energy, you know, a few months in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you take a job and you go, “I can always quit in two weeks,” I’m not sure if it’s worth it to take the job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know, which is why I’m looking at part time options. (PAUSE) But I don’t make a convincing waitress. I make even less convincing as a waitress than I am as something I’m qualified to do. It’s like, “Really?” Anyone can do that. But apparently not because people look on your resume and they don’t see any waitressing experience. So... (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) [00:43:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you... Will you have as many classes next year as you do this year because you’re in class a lot this year. It would be hard to imagine you having a nine to five job when you’re in class a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I’m not in class a lot even now. It’s Tuesdays, there’s class during the, you know, afternoons and then another class on Wednesday nights. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I thought you were in class more during the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (PAUSE) [00:43:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We’re going to need to stop for today. Okay? But I’ll see you on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. See you. (PAUSE) (SIGH) I can’t get up. (PAUSE) Thank you. Have a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. (PAUSE)</p>

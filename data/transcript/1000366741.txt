<p>PATIENT: (Silence) When I got home yesterday I found it necessary to try to figure out why I felt uncomfortable when I was here and probably about the things I was saying.  And at the time.  Oh, I thought, well, it was because some of the things I was thinking seemed so melodramatic and they, just sort of ridiculous really.  (Clears throat) And I think I was also feeling in kind of a self-pitying mood because I was thinking that I really wasn't very good at this at all and couldn't really do it anyway.  But today, when I came in and was thinking about this reaction to how it went yesterday, it just seemed to me it was, even if it still would seem melodramatic to me, it was almost an excuse not to say things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not sure I understood you.  You mean, thinking it was melodramatic you feel was an excuse?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And the reaction, it was when I was thinking about the color red and blood and so forth.  And last night it just seemed very acceptable that, well, of course the reason I didn't want to say anything was that it seemed melodramatic.  And now I wonder if, if I — I don't know, I just feel differently about it.  (Pause) But also, that it was a very strong feeling yesterday, stronger than I've ever had, that I, I was feeling that I, I can't do this kind of thing.  So I think I was trying to read into any reaction you gave or comments you made as a sign that you felt I couldn't too.  And it just occurred to me that one of the feelings I had yesterday about things I, that were coming to my mind were, (clears throat) they were things that made me feel unacceptable.  So I suppose that would just be another form of being unacceptable. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it was in part a reaction I've had — I think it was the same, as I remember it, it was the same as sometimes when things just seem awfully hard or I don't really know what to do and I'm scared.  Then I sometimes will get the feeling, well I can't do it anyway and I've just got to keep going.  (Pause) But I wasn't aware yesterday of feeling scared.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, my mind went from that to just little things that happened (clears throat) today and how I was seeing all these little incidents as, well I suppose even as strongly as people rejecting me.  And it, I don't know whether I saw all the others because of the first thing that happened but just when I got there, I heard the man who takes care of woodworking come up on our floor.  And there was something I wanted to ask him.  So, he was seeing somebody else, but I went out to ask him.  And he, I know he was in a hurry but he just seemed very brusque to me and, and sort of annoyed that I was asking him and it just made me feel that he thought I was kind of a pest.  And I know it sort of upset me for the rest of the day.  And then nothing else really happened that I think much about except I was just, my general expectation was to have people do that to me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And again, it just, I was thinking how I can never judge on someone's reaction to me, how much it has to do with me personally and how much it's just the situation or something else on the person's mind.  And it just seems strange that if I had watched it happen to another person I would probably be able to tell very well but I just can't at all when it's me.  And I know I so quickly will draw back if I sense any kind of reaction like that.  And I suppose that would just make it worse.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know, yesterday you were feeling almost totally unacceptable on one score in particular, when you were thinking about your brother and you, some of your feelings about him.  And what you seem to be saying is that given that, it's very easy for you then to feel unacceptable to anybody for almost any reason, under any circumstances.  You say you tend to read it in and expect it because you already feel so unacceptable.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) But there are some times when I don't feel that way.  And I wasn't aware of feeling that way this morning.  And he's not a person that I expect a reaction from of that sort so that I just can't tell if something did happen or if I am just reading it in.  And I don't know how much another attitude of mine is entering in this, either, on why I think he might have thought I'm just pesty about because I do ask and do lots of little things.  And the only time I've felt as if he might be rejecting me is just at times when I'm asking something like that.  If we meet in the faculty room or some other place he's always very cordial and friendly.  And I have this feeling that, just about everything, that a person should be as self-sufficient as they can be and not ask help from somebody else, not bother somebody else, not be obligated to somebody else.  And so perhaps I already feel as if I'm being pesty to him, asking him to do so many little things for us.  And I do always feel sort of apologetic when I ask him.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I just began to think about this test that I've been giving my children.  And I, when I've been correcting it, I noticed something which sort of surprised me.  But I don't know, I almost had the feeling that I had failed completely when I saw anybody had even one mistake.  And there were times when it was a mistake that if the child had thought about it or even perhaps taken the test at a different day, wouldn't have made because I know the child is able to do it.  And my reaction then was to be annoyed at the child.  And again, it's, I don't know, somehow taking it all so personally, and as if somehow I have to account for it because it was my student.  And I'm going to have to find an excuse for it and, I don't know, as if the total responsibility is mine.  And also that somehow it might suggest that I didn't do something well enough in my teaching.  (Pause) I suppose all of this is just more ways that I feel unacceptable.  But then the tha—, same thing will bother me, that has always bothered me about even when I know these things: if the feeling is that strong I don't quite see what I d—, can do about it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose it's the same feeling of being unacceptable that makes me, well, feel almost that I'm just playing a part being married.  Because even now I've noticed that if somebody, if I'm calling MSC and somebody will say, "Is this — "  or, just somehow I have to refer to MSCZ as my husband or they refer to me as his wife.  And I find those terms very uncomfortable as if it's just a game or something that's not really true.  Or somehow they're just words and they really don't mean anything.  (Pause) And I suppose there's something about the words too, that makes me immediately think of an intimate type of relationship which I don't want to talk of to anybody that I don't know.  And therefore, even using those words which are commonly used becomes too intimate to me.  Because it occurred to me that there are times, if I'm talking to friends or acquaintances that I know quite well, that I don't mind using, "My husband."  I don't know quite how I'd feel about being referred to as his wife, though.  (Pause) In fact the feeling I have about the 2 words sort of symbolizes how I feel about our whole relationship.  Because I think I accept and want MSCZ to want to be intimate with me but I don't want to return it.  And I can use the word, husband, without much feeling but I don't like the word, wife, and I don't like hearing it.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence) I've begun to realize I, at least it seems to me, I do something.  Because I've noticed several times when I think of something that you would think would lead other thoughts to my mind, I suddenly find myself thinking about what I'm doing at school and planning new things to do.  And it's almost again like it's, it's an escape and also I'm going back into an area that I do have control over.  Because it's often planning what I can do or maybe thinking about something I did do and how I would like to change it a little and I have complete control to change it.  Because I just completely stopped thinking about my relationship with MSCZ or how I feel about being married.  And I would have thought I would have had more things to think about.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think the thing that made me start thinking about school, though, after thinking about MSCZ was, uhm, a feeling that not only have I really failed in my relationship with MSCZ but I feel (clears throat) right now that I'm failing in my relationship with the children.  Specifically because the last few days I've felt very critical of them and finding fault more than anything else.  And, but I didn't even like to think about that so I stopped thinking about that too.  (Pause) It struck me that — it hasn't happened with some of my friends — but with people that I've been a lot with, either lived with, like roommates or MSCZ or been a great deal with as the children, the relationship does seem to be based mainly on fault-finding.  Because it used to bother me that my experience with my roommates at college used to deteriorate into my just finding fault with them and losing a feeling of closeness that I had had which led me to be a roommate. (Pause)</p>

<p>And MSCZ doesn't take it anymore but it used to be that practically everything, every thought that I had of him was in terms of finding fault about something rather than thinking positively or liking what he did.  (Pause) And I was just wondering if the reason I do that is sort of a counter-defensive move in that if they're going to find me inacc— unacceptable, then maybe I should move first and find things unacceptable about them.  Because I was thinking yesterday when I was feeling unacceptable even in terms of what I was doing right here, my inclination was to become critical of you and to think you'd used a tone that you shouldn't have used or that you didn't approve of what I was doing and you shouldn't not approve or anyhow, finding fault with what you were doing, too.  And then that would make me fight back in all these cases, which so often seems to be the only way I would keep myself going, even though I created the situation to fight back in. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I (clears throat) I think in all those times I have the feeling of either, well, just being — it's, the situation is making me feel so unacceptable that what I really want to do is just give up.  And I'm not sure quite what giving up means but somehow I know I can't do that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it's as though almost any way you turn you, eh, you, you find fault, one way or another, with yourself.  If you start out finding it in some score, and as you say you find yourself turning it so you see it in someone else, then you feel guilty about that and it's another fault.  And it all ends up with an overwhelming kind of a burden of feeling guilty about everything, feeling to blame for everything, responsible for everything.  (Pause) At least, that's what I hear when you end up feeling that you just want to give up.  It sounds as though, "What else is there to feel?"  You know, when you corner yourself so thoroughly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) But this is another one of those things that I really have known I do, more or less.  Maybe I never realized quite the extent of it but in individual circumstances I've known I've done it.  And yet I just keep on doing it.  (Pause) I think I just feel guilty about being alive and, well, being what I am and having lived the kind of life I've lived.  (Silence) And I think I've felt guilty about being a member of my family.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>So I want to let you know, you know how we're doing every other week? It would be two weeks from today but I'm leaving for vacation on the 19th so if we could do next week or whatever, would you mind doing that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. Let me...I'll e-mail you. I just have to make sure that I didn't schedule something that week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, if not I can do that Monday, the 18th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, let me...oh you're saying in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because that's when I...my vacation is the 19th. So I just wanted to let you know about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure. [00:00:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything's been going okay. Still having a little difficulty with my girlfriend. We actually had a good conversation last week. She told me that she felt like I haven't been very supportive (pause) and I guess she was right in a way because (pause) I don't know if I mentioned before but her...the person she reports to now is my old boss (pause) and I guess she said I have just been really mean to her, like not supportive at all. </p>

<p>And I caught myself because she wanted to talk about where...she wanted to talk about something that happened at work and I guess I just got so (pause)...I didn't get enraged but I just went off. I just expressed my opinion and she got really emotional and started crying, hung up the phone on me. And I felt really bad and I was just like...I don't know what I can do to change how I feel about the whole situation with her there. And she told me that it's not fair to her that I (pause)...my hatred towards the company puts her in an awkward situation where it's even now she (pause) quits or chooses me over work. [00:02:25]</p>

<p>And I did some thinking about it and it's to the point where I'm just like okay well, she wants to talk to me. She wants me to be supportive. I'll try to do that. And I just finally came to the conclusion I'm like look, it's her livelihood. It's what she does to make money. Whatever I can do I'll do. But like I told her I am very protective of her because there was an opportunity that was at her job and her new manager was my old manager, only e-mailed one person (pause) and didn't tell my girlfriend or her coworker about an opportunity to move up. (pause) Well the guy that he e-mailed was their best friend. They're all really close friends so she told my girlfriend and this other girl about this opportunity and they both applied. [00:03:24]</p>

<p>And then the guy was running around like a chicken with his head cut off trying to figure out what to do because these two other people applied for the job when he was just trying to sneakily just hand this one person it. And it kind of (pause) pissed me off that exactly what happened to me now happened to her. And after our conversation I let her deal with it and I think it was good because I think she finally realized what was going on, finally. I mean she tells me she didn't want the position but she also realized that hey, it is an opportunity to move up. It is an opportunity to now be a manager in the company. And she's kind of just pissed off at the way it was handled. [00:04:14]</p>

<p>So I said, "Well, you've got to do what you've got to do." And for me I guess the hardest part is just not trying to get too emotionally attached with it. (pause) It is hard for me to explain to her that I don't think I'll really fully ever get over it until she does leave the company. Every time I try to tell her that she gets really upset. And she does, she feels like I'm attacking her again when I tell her that. (pause) I don't know...I don't want to tell her that but I know...(pause) in my heart and I know in my mind that's the only way I can. And I did express to her that what I learned in rehab at being a recovering drug addict is in order to fully get over stuff you need to eliminate the stuff. And I told her when I went into rehab and did all of my treatments I had to eliminate a lot of people I was close to. I had to eliminate a lot of people I socialized with on a daily basis for my own benefit. [00:05:35]</p>

<p>And I told...and I kind of related this to her, which I think (pause) maybe she finally got the sense where (pause) if I just keep them in my life and keep going (pause) with how I would have been living I go, "I can never truly heal from it." I go, "Eventually I'll get back into it. Eventually I will forgive it, but I can't have it in my face all the time too soon." Because I did explain to her that the wound was still fresh. The wound was still wide open and it's healing but it's not healed. And I think she kind of got that (pause)...finally felt the empathy that I was trying to express to her and trying to show her how difficult it is for me. How (pause) emotionally I get over stuff like this because that's how I cope with things. That's how I move on is I understand healing takes time but the timing, I never really started the timing process because me being with her and her still working here I feel never really started the clock of the time. I still felt that I was still living it and still in the moment. [00:07:08]</p>

<p>And it does bother me because I do...I've gotten better, but I do get really emotional when she talks about work and I get emotionally upset because I do want to protect her. I do want to help her look out for her best interests. And to me, like I expressed before, is I kind of feel helpless (pause) because she's not...she tells me she has it. She tells me she got this and she's just sitting there being walked all over in this situation, not trying anything to better herself and it bothers me. But I think she had a revelation after this past...what happened with this situation where she finally told me, she goes, "I finally realize I'm at a dead-end job and I need to move forward." And I told her, "I'd be happy to move forward with you. I'll support you in any way." But then again, I'm very hesitant when I say that because she gets mad when I say I go out and I network for her and I use people that I know in different industries and ask them if they are hiring or if she'd be a good fit. And then they say, "Alright well, have her contact me." And I get all this stuff and I relay the message and she doesn't do anything. And I kind of went off on her about that too. I go, "That kind of makes me look bad (pause) because I am here. I am trying to help you. I am trying to look out for your best interests and here I go and I do it. You've got the wall up blocking me." And it's frustrating because I do go back to that helpless thing where it's to the point where why do I even want to say anything? Why do I even want to say anything? Why do I even want to...? [00:09:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Blocking you how? I missed that part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She blocks me because she's independent and wants to do things on her own (pause) because she's been independent for a long time because she tells me, from what she's told me and she told me that really upset me last week is that she does have nobody to lean on. (pause) And she's out there to defend for herself, to look out for herself, and that bothered me because I really wasn't...that wasn't my intention to hurt her like that. My intention was to help her out, to help her get her foot outside of her current role and just start testing new waters. [00:09:57]</p>

<p>And (pause) I do respect her decision on when it's going to approach but I do feel like the longer she sits the longer she's just going to (pause) stay there. And I told her I do have a fear that someday if we get married and we have kids I don't think she'd quit her job. And she said that wasn't true. (pause) But, from what I've seen, from what I've witnessed, all these hardships she's gone through she's still going through. She's very uptight at work. She does not like the people she works with. She does not like her environment. She still puts herself out there. She still engages in it on a daily basis. [00:10:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel it upsets you that she needs her job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Well I understand she needs a job, don't get me wrong. But does she need this job in particular? That's what upsets me. It's because she's putting everything on hold because, "Well I'm not just going to quit my job." Yeah, well you're not looking for another job. And she's going by the notion, "Well, I don't know if I can get the salary that I'm getting at another company because from what people told me they don't pay well." And my counter to that is, "How do you know that? Have you explored that? (pause) Just because I could tell you that this company pays a lot better than that company or this company pays this and this, you don't know that. I could be making it up." [00:11:48]</p>

<p>The problem that I have with her is I want her to get out there. I want her to express herself a little bit more. I want her self-confidence to be a lot better and every time I think that I'm boosting it, I think that I'm helping her out, it comes back and it bites me (pause) to the point where I just feel bad like...and I get upset and I do yell at her and I'm just like, "What do you want me to do?" Because I do feel like I'm at a helpless thing where she says she loves me, she says she trusts me, she says she does all of this stuff. "Well, I'm helping you." At least I think I am. [00:12:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you're objecting to the fact that she's not listening or she's not taking your advice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do, because I do get pissed off because yeah I am a really opinionated person. She thinks I'm pushing my opinions on her, which is fine. But I'm also, in my mind, I think I'm helping her network. I'm helping her get the ball rolling on her job search, getting her on the path to working in a better environment. Just like what she did for me a couple years ago when she told me to get out of there, you know? She was the one who was like, "Why are you still here? Why are you doing this? Get out of here then." And I was the same way. I didn't quit until I really needed to and I think she's feeling the same thing but she wasn't to the point where she was forced to quit like I was (pause) because there was nothing going on with her. [00:13:36]</p>

<p>My only...my other thing with her is that I do get frustrated hearing her (pause) sadness in her voice when she talks about work, how she can never get an edge. She's always overwhelmed. She doesn't like the work. She's constantly taking the blame for other people. And no matter what I do to try to tell her, "It's not your fault. You've got to start throwing people under the bus," she still doesn't do it. She takes her job way to emotionally, way to personal. So anyone that attacks (inaudible)—which I try to explain to her, "They're not attacking you. They're attacking the company but you think they're attacking you." And to me I don't think that registers to her yet because she does want to do a good job. She does want to feel proud of the work that she's doing and it's just frustrating to me because my personality is totally different than hers, (pause) where you want to yell at me, you want to do this. Well, tell you what, here's the person that screwed it up. You have a question, you can call them (pause) where she just tries to be the peacemaker and says, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that." And I'm like, "Why? Why are you saying you didn't? You didn't mess it up. That person did. That person needs to be accountable. You can't be taking the wave on other people's problems on top of your problems. It's just not healthy." [00:15:16] </p>

<p>And she seems (sigh)...I don't know, she just...she's getting better at it but I guess there's still a lot of work we need to do on the topic. I still do have a lot of anger towards the company. (pause) I still do have a lot of anger towards the people that she's working with and I think the fact that she now reports to the guy who tried to dick me over really irritates me more (pause) because the job she does reflects the job he does and I don't want her to do a good job because I want him to look bad. But I know she won't do that. I know she'll go head over heels because in the long run she has to look out for her own self. And I guess to me that pisses me off. [00:16:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she's a (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That she's looking out for herself but the fact that her looking out for herself and being the best person she is helps the guy that screwed me over succeed, makes him look good to. And that bothers me. (pause) That bothers me the most, I think, is because she knows what I went through. She saw what he put me through. She saw how he treated me. And it was okay before because he wasn't her boss but now he is. (pause) And now it just (pause) really irritates me because I don't... (pause) I don't know. I just can't get to the fact of her doing her job well... (pause) I know she does a good job but her doing her job well makes him look well when he doesn't do his job well, or at all. (pause) And that bothers me. That bothers me a lot, same with the other people there. [00:17:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know Jordan, some people are not bothered by the fact that life is not fair. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like how?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like what you're saying is that it's unfair, right? That's your complaint is that it's unfair and so I guess I'm saying that for you it's important and I don't want to take that away from you, but for other people it's not and I don't want to take that away from them either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I...I mean, I have to come to a realization that life isn't fair. I understand life's not fair. (pause) I guess my problem with this situation is if she was with any other company and I didn't know anybody I wouldn't have a problem. I guess the problem with me now is because I was involved in the company. I was involved with her emotionally. I was involved in a huge fight with the company emotionally that that's where my negativeness (sp) comes from. And I guess that's what's part of my healing is, is what I'm trying to get over is the fact that I'm trying to forget and I'm trying to let it down but when she keeps telling me stories that trigger (pause) just the basic reaction that I saw from him and that I expect out of him, it really pisses me off. [00:18:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it would be helpful to just hear less about it? Life if she—because it triggers you—that you may not be able to hear as much as she wants to share all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would but then I feel I'm not supporting her. (pause) And she's mentioned that she feels like she does hold a lot of stuff back from me because she does know that I will get very emotional and I'll get angry about it. So she does not share a lot with me as it is. However, when she tells me I'm not supportive, well (pause) that falls into the category when she wants to talk about work and wants to vent to me, I can't be the spouse that I want to be to her because I do get like this. And that's why I guess why I'm here and why I'm healing is I want to find ways of how I can be that person without getting emotionally involved, without putting the emotion into it. And (pause) like we talked about and I talked about with her is I really just don't think I've had the healing. I mean, yeah it's been over a year since I left but (pause) I feel like I never really left because the whole time she still worked there. She's still been around the nonsense. She's still telling me about the nonsense which makes me feel like I never really left. I mean, there are times where I do feel that I work there still (pause) because I do have friends there and I do stay in contact with only the people I want to contact. Everybody else I've completely disregarded. But it is tough because it was such an emotional roller coaster that I was on and it did end in a nasty way because of the betrayal. [00:20:59]</p>

<p>And that's what hurts me the most because that's what... (sigh) I guess that's what puts me on guard with her because I do know that (pause) they really don't care about her. I try to explain that to her. I try to explain that no company cares about their employees. That's not true. And I know that's my opinion but living through corporate America I know that's the absolute truth. Corporate American people don't care about anybody but themselves and that's what...I guess that's why I get protective of her is because I do think she is vulnerable to everybody else because she does want to do a good job. She doesn't have the heart to be as ruthless as I do at times. She doesn't have the heart to be as negative to people at times and most of all she doesn't have the heart to speak up, like I do, at times. And that's ultimately what got me in trouble at the thing was because I finally spoke up. I was sick and tired of being picked on. I was sick and tired of being bullied. (pause) And when I spoke up, what did they try to do? What did they do? They eliminated the person who was calling them out on all their flaws, all their unethical procedures that they were doing. Everything that they preached to us not to do that they make us take a test for, this man was doing and I reported on it. And who was the one that got in trouble for it? Me. [00:22:41]</p>

<p>Am I glad that I got in trouble for it? Yes, because if I had to do it all over again I think I'd do it and I think I would pursue it even more. (pause) I think I would pursue it even to a more extent (inaudible) level. (pause) There were certain people that I would filter out of it (pause) but then there are other people that I would still contact and I would still (pause) pursue it. Just because that's not the type of...it's not the type of environment anybody wants to work in, when you're constantly being criticized for doing something...well, no excuse me...when you're constantly being criticized for doing something that you're shown. [00:23:32]</p>

<p>I'm not one to follow "Do as I say, not as I do." No, I'll do as you do because your example is what I know and that's what I'm going to use. (pause) And it just is what it is. I knew I was under the gun when he first started because I knew he wanted a female there. I knew he wanted someone he could dominate over. (pause) And he found out the hard way because as soon as I left and the kid that I worked with left he had two females (pause) that do exactly as he says. And his number one problem was he had people that fought back and he didn't like it. And that's where I feel bad with her, (pause) is because I want her to start fighting back. I want her to start being more selfish, more ruthless. Because if she's not I just see her emotionally being beat up about this. (chuckle) And honestly I can't let her do that. [00:24:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah but you don't want to be a position where she feels you're emotionally beating her up because you're not accepting where she is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the problem because I am...she has expressed that I am emotionally beating her up. (pause) And I don't want to do that anymore. I want to do it in a supportive way and my choice of words could be better. My temperament could be better but (pause) while I'm here I need to find strategies on how I can be more supportive. How I can talk to her about these issues without getting overly (pause) in to it.</p>

<p>Now it's going back to the first thing we talked about when we first started was my emotional reaction. And I feel with this topic, this is the one that emotions kick in too fast. There's no thinking about it. There's no digesting the information. There's just (snap)...and that's when I'm making my decisions and then I'm having to deal with the ramifications after. [00:25:53]</p>

<p>And (pause) what she's telling me the ramifications are what I'm seeing because I am making the emotional decisions. I am (pause) talking based on emotions only and they're not good emotions. They're negative emotions. They're adrenaline emotions that just (pause)...it just irritates me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like one of the things that you're struggling with and why it's hard for you to be supportive is you're having a hard time just accepting where she's at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would agree 100 percent. (pause) And I've made that clear to her, is I still... (pause) it's still difficult for me to know that she's still there. And I have to get over the fact that she is there. That is how she makes her living. That is how she survives in this world. And I'm starting to come to grips with it because after her and I had that emotional talk I started to realize it's not worth fighting with her over. It's not worth making her feel like garbage over, (pause) because I don't want to do that to her. [00:27:11]</p>

<p>And it's like you just brought up, me trying to be supportive and all that (pause) is backfiring because I was just emotionally attacking her and emotionally beating her up to the point where she finally broke down and told me because I had no idea that I was doing that. (pause) And that bothers me that I didn't know that I was doing that. And it bothers me that I want to be there and I think I'm being there but I'm doing the total opposite. And that's not the support I want to be for her. It's not the support I want to give her. </p>

<p>(sigh) So, and it is tough letting go of what happened there because it was a long process. It was like a year and a half process of me being treated the way I was, every day. And I guess, like we just talked about, is I really still can't accept the fact that she's still there. (pause) Because...it was kind of funny because I was one of the second to last to leave but it was a whole chain of people leaving because of this. I mean, there was a point where there were only six people that were employed in that office, when there was 13 or 14. (pause) And to me just seeing the people that stayed there, you can't understand how they could still be there. [00:28:54]</p>

<p>And I guess that part of me is just expressing my own opinion on people (pause) and that's something that I do a lot of because I do want to be heard. I do want them to know my side of stuff but I think now she knows how I feel. I've hammered it numerous times. I just need to work on "my opinion is what it is." Will it change? Eventually, over time but I still, like I mentioned before, I don't think the time for healing has started yet. (pause) And that's what bothers me the most because I do feel like I'm still stuck there (pause) even though I technically haven't been there for a long time. [00:29:54]</p>

<p>And that's the emotional game, the mental game that I'm kind of dealing with. (pause) And I want to work on my part of being a supportive spouse. I want to work on my part of helping her make good decisions, giving her good advice. And I feel like I can't do that (pause) continuing the way I am. (pause) And that's why I need to (pause) express my thoughts. I need to have conversations. I need to communicate better with her. And that's the one thing that's going well in our relationship is the communication. We normally wouldn't have this talk. It would have went on like everything was fine when really this stuff was eating her up inside. And I am glad that she's finally talking to me about it, she's finally expressing her concerns and her feelings and her emotions to me. Because after she told me what I was doing I thought about it and I got very sad. (pause) I felt guilty. I felt guilty to the point where she felt I was attacking her but (pause) that wasn't my intention. My intention was to look out for her, was to protect her. And that has been my intention. That is my intention, is to look out and to protect her. (pause) And it comes back that I have been emotionally beating her up. [00:31:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like one of the things that I'm sensing is that when she doesn't take your advice you not only feel a hurt but it's like she's betraying you by not listening to you. It seems like it's (pause) very deep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. I don't feel betrayed. She's never betrayed me but I do feel hurt and I keep going back where I do feel helpless to the point where anything I say I feel is not credible (pause) because of our past. Because like I said the damage I did before when I did tell her that I used to just tell her what I wanted to hear.</p>

<p>So in a sense I can understand that but it's to the point where if we're supposed to be working and we're supposed to be growing, why is she still not taking some of my advice? She doesn't have to take all of it. I understand you don't need to take all of my advice. I don't take everybody's advice all of the time but I do take some advice. And I guess that's what irritates me a lot is that she won't even think about some of my advice because she tells...(pause) she tells me that she's been so independent for so long that she has to look out for herself. She has to think about herself first and then me. And for me that bothers me. [00:33:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well but the advice you're giving her is for her so (pause) if she's not taking it...it's not like you're giving her advice to look out for you. Is that the case?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) No, but I am giving her advice to help her out, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so then I guess if she decides to take it or not (pause) why is she not helping you out if that's not the intent to begin with? Do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well see...</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I might be missing something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, you're right in a way where she is (pause)...I guess the advice that I give her is not... (pause) It's advice but it's my opinion. I think she thinks that it's me saying things because it's what I want her to do and not what she wants. Maybe that's the part that's missing because everything that I tell her (pause) it's kind of what I want. I do want her to leave her job. I do want her to try to find a new one. So yeah, that could be it, why she doesn't listen to my advice because I think she wants to leave on her own terms. She wants to find a job on her own terms and not with mine. [00:34:56]</p>

<p>But for me that's what gets frustrating is...and we had this conversation where she thinks because I have been out of work for so long—I have not had an income for so long, I have not worked every day for so long—is that I am focusing too much on her job because I am frustrated at where I'm at right now. And I agreed to that. I agree that has something to do with why I get so angry and why I get so pissed off because until I know that I'm going to be working I am always going to have that doubt in my mind. I am always going to have that fear in my mind that (pause) how am I going to support her? How am I supposed to help her with the needs that she and I both talked about? [00:35:49]</p>

<p>(pause) It does in a way. I do get upset that I do have a master's degree. (pause) I did what I could to better myself in school but (pause) she's still bringing in the money. She's still able to support herself on her own and I can't. She's able to support me as well and I can't. And I think that's where a lot of the jealousy comes in (pause) and maybe the negative emotion comes in is because she has all of the things that I want (pause) and she has all of the things that I want to give her. [00:36:46]</p>

<p>(pause) And for me it's been really tough (pause) because the culture that live in, the way I was brought up is that the man is always supposed to take care of his family. And when I can't even take care of myself or my significant other I feel defeated. I feel deflated. I feel emasculated sometimes. And for me that bothers me. And I guess that's why I take these different approaches to try and help gain my masculinity back to help gain my sense of pride back (pause) because knowing that I can't provide for her now really disappoints me. It's not where I saw myself. It's not what I anticipated happening. [00:37:51]</p>

<p>(pause) And I guess the hardest thing is (pause) it's so hard not to look in the future because the here-and-now is so difficult for me. I guess that's why I do get into my emotional charges. That's why I do get upset. That's why I do get frustrated (pause) is because the here-and-now is not the here-and-now that I want. The here-and-now is the here-and-now that I want a couple years down the road when I am able to work, when we are married, when we do have a family, (pause) when I am able to support her. (pause) [00:38:40]</p>

<p>And I think that's one of my major problems. It's one of the major difficulties that I do have right now. It's one of the major difficulties I do have in the present time because I have all of these aspirations to do all of these things. I am getting my education. I'm getting more education. But all of the stuff that she wants now, I can't provide. All of the stuff that I want later, it's not arrived yet. And I guess that's where (pause) the imbalance comes in, is where the uncertainty comes in, is where the emotions come in. It's just really difficult for me because (pause) she does want to get married. I know she does. I do too. But I guess she doesn't understand the emotional stress that I'm under because I do have my mom and dad pressuring me. I have my family pressuring me. [00:39:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get married, to get her a ring. I've got my dad telling me, "I'll give you a loan. You have to pay me back." But for me it won't be sentimental if I take his money for it. I want to be able to do something on my own. I want to be able to afford something for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when she doesn't take your advice do you feel like she doesn't need you at all? She doesn't need you financially? She doesn't even need your thoughts?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: At times, yes. I feel that if I was contributing financially, it would be a different conversation. But again it's kind of like with my parents where if I can't contribute financially, my opinion really doesn't matter (pause) because it's her money. It's their money. They can dictate what they do with it, what I do with it. And for me it brings me back to the helpless stage where (pause) I feel bad because I can't do anything on my own. I feel like I've done all this other stuff. I've tried the best that I could to be able to provide for my future and I can't do it. (pause) And the hardest part for me is the here and the now, is I can't (pause)...I guess I fully can't accept the fact that this is only a temporary part of my life. Everything that I do want, everything that I do want, I want now but it's not going to happen now. And I can't accept that. That's why I have to look in the future. [00:41:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But Jordan some of these things can happen now. You can get a job and make some money even if it's not the income you ultimately want. There are things that can happen now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I would agree. (pause) I would agree. (pause) But I guess unlike her I guess there's something holding me back. There's something that's just there that...I just can't explain it. Do I want to go back and work part time? Do I want to go back and work nights, weekends? Do I want to (pause) do all this stuff again? The major problem that I have is (pause)...the problem that I have probably working is I wouldn't get to see her as often as I wanted. Last year when I was working at the restaurant we had two totally different schedules. And it did take a toll on our relationship. [00:43:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're doing exactly what you get annoyed that she does is that she's saying, "If you work here, you make this money. If you work here..." There are plenty of jobs you could work the same hours she does.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I guess the problem is finding them. And I guess I do have a lot of stress and I guess I am procrastinating a lot too because I do want to focus on my job search. I do want to focus on trying to get a job for the fall. And I guess maybe I'm using that excuse to not pursue other things, is I guess I want to be able to be flexible in case I do have to drop something to go on an interview or to meet someone right away. I guess that is true that there are other things that I could do. I'm just not choosing to do them. And (pause) I don't know. It's just...I don't know. I guess...(pause) maybe I do feel like I'm in a situation like her that all these situations that I've been in previously, (pause) I've done the best that I could but I don't feel like it was appreciated (pause) and I guess that's why I'm hesitant to go back into those fields because I have done retail. I have worked in a restaurant. I have worked in the corporate world. I have worked in delis and stuff like that. I've landscaped, I've done all this stuff. I just feel like I have explored a lot and I just feel that (pause) putting myself out there and helping these other people out (ph) isn't really going to help me out (pause) because like I mentioned before you have to look out for yourself and when you're working for somebody else it's hard to look out for yourself. [00:45:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know but not making any money is hard to look out for yourself too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely! I agree with that 100 percent. And that's the frustrating part. That's the real frustrating part is not making any money. I understand every little bit helps but to me I feel a little bit's not going to help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. We are needing to stop but why ten dollars is not better than zero dollars is something for us to think about together. But (inaudible) we do need to stop. I will e-mail you about next week. I think this time next week will be okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, very good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure! [00:46:01]</p>

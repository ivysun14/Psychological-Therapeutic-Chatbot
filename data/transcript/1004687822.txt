<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's been a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Sorry about — I couldn't reschedule because I had all this work. Anyway, I've been working a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you? And you've been commuting to work a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's a lot of time that's spent in the car, actually. It's a little bit annoying, but I've started listening to podcasts and trying to make the time pass faster. But, yeah, it's been real —</p>

<p>So usually, I think, before each therapy session I try to be like okay, what have I been thinking about this week or whatever. Sort of like gather my thoughts. I really didn't do that this week. I don't know. I just don't really have anything in particular like a theme or whatever.</p>

<p>[00:56.7]</p>

<p>But in terms of — what I'm trying to say is it's not going to be as organized as usual. I guess one of the things I've been feeling lately is it's so different to work than it is to be a student. Like maybe not in a good way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So different how?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just — I don't know. (pause) I mean obviously, it's more actual time that you have to do something. Like when I was in school, I had to go to class and then I could, you know, go read that book or whatever. It wasn't like three to four.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a lot more control over when you were working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Which didn't always turn out to be the best, you know. (chuckles) But it's kind of like — maybe it's just because I'm working like literally every weekend every night, so I'm doing all the overnights like Thursday through Sunday.</p>

<p>[02:05.9]</p>

<p>But I just feel like it's taking over my life, and it's fine because it's work. That's what's supposed to happen. But, I don't know. I mean, like every time I have to run errands or something — I know this sounds really vague and weird, but like I would have to run errands, like pay bills or go to see the doctor or [there's this secretary] because you have to do something.</p>

<p>I don't know. Even just like day-to-day things, I feel like I could be doing something else. I just feel really like detached and sort of removed, like "What am I doing? Why am I doing this?" I know why I'm doing this. I have to pay the bills. I have to pay rent. You know, like that's useful to have somewhere to live. But it's just like — I don't know. It's just so different from what I used to do. I don't know. It's almost like it's meaningless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel detached from?</p>

<p>[03:01.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. I think it's just like this mundane thing where I'm like I'm used to doing this other stuff. Like it was so meaningful to me when I studied, you know. And so right now I feel like I'm walking around and going through the motions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it the time or is it what you're doing with your time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's both. I mean, because when I have time to do other stuff, I don't feel as bad. But when that's literally the only thing I can do — like I'm kind of sick right now, so I've been sleeping more. So I did the two previous overnights, Friday and Saturday night. I don't even know what day it is anymore. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you do an overnight, you leave the house at what time and get back home?</p>

<p>[03:58.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I leave the house at like five p.m. and I spend the night there or whatever, and got home at like eight or nine in the morning, and then I went to sleep because I was really tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then my alarm wakes me up at five, and I have to go back again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So all you've done is work and drive and sleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I was sleeping, all I did was dream about the hospital. (laughter) So I feel like, you know, I hadn't left which is fine. I really like being at the hospital. I think it's more like the driving. I know this is vague.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's a lack of balance. Didn't you say you felt like you were detached? Well, you don't have time in between. When you're working those shifts, you don't have time in between to get back in touch with your life, your house, your friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I'm definitely feeling a lot of that recently. We did a house-bonding thing on Thursday, and that was the first time I'd seen any of them in a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's not a typical work experience because you're working long shifts. It sounds like they're longer —</p>

<p>[05:01.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're 12 hours, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: — than if you were going to work at nine and coming back at five and having the evening to get back in touch. But you have these chunks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think it's because I'm babysitting during the week, and I can't do it during the weekend. So hopefully it will get better, but I don't know. It just feels like — and I hate saying this because it's so snotty — but my God, my life is meaningless.</p>

<p>What am I doing? Paying bills and driving. (chuckles) That's what it feels like. So I don't know. That's sort of been bugging me. I don't know. I've sort of been thinking like how do I make a meaningful existence? (chuckles) I know that's a big existential question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be meaningful? Yeah, that's a big question. Let's break it down a little bit. What are some things that do feel meaningful to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I guess that's a good place to start. I don't know. (chuckles) I think — I mean, the weird thing is that I really do like my job.</p>

<p>[06:10.2]</p>

<p>You know what I mean? I mean, I don't know. Like when I'm at my job, it's great. I think it's all the time my job consumes out of work because technically I'm the boss or something, and so I have to do all this administrative bullshit that I hate doing. (pause) So I think —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which takes up time outside of that shift?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so even when I'm home, I'm doing work, and it's fine. I mean, I don't mind hard work. I like hard work. If it wasn't hard, I wouldn't like to do it, you know? But I guess something that's challenging, which I find my work to be, except most of the time —</p>

<p>[07:03.1]</p>

<p>Maybe — here's what it is. I think some patients are interesting but the majority aren't, which is annoying to say, you know. Like the intubation we saw the other night was cool. But the night that we had pretty much only psych patients that wouldn't speak to us until midnight was not exciting. I just feel awkward when it's a psych patient. I'm just like "Okay, yeah, tell me about how you're suicidal" and I'm standing awkwardly in the room so I can't — you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels uncomfortable about it for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like if that was me, I wouldn't want anyone else in the room, you know what I mean? I'd just feel like, okay, if I have to talk to someone, why do I have to talk to four people at the same time, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they have any choice about who is there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they can say "leave" or something and I would be happy to because, I mean, it's all about making them comfortable or whatever. The patients in general, I mean.</p>

<p>[08:04.9]</p>

<p>I don't know. It's just — I know this is vague, I know. But, yeah. I mean, we have a lot more psych patients than I expected. We had a 45-year-old male who was schizophrenic and attacked his terminally ill mother who was in the room down the hall. It's like sad, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, those are difficult situations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a lot of those, apparently. (chuckles) But they've gotten easier since the last time we spoke, I think. Sort of. It's easier to kind of brush them off but not be like whatever, which I find that a lot of the providers are kind of. Like there was — I know — this is kind of my life. It's like everywhere, you know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your place to be able to sort it out, so it's okay that it's not all formatted just yet.</p>

<p>[09:01.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) There's a woman who had never been vaccinated. She never had vaccines as a child, didn't have a rabies vaccine. She was a vet tech which, you know, she should probably choose a different profession but whatever. She had been bitten by a really sick cat and so they questioned the whole rabies kind of thing. So [the person who served] was like "Oh, antibiotics and the rabies vaccine is what the treatment is."</p>

<p>When they came back into the little cubicle area where there's just the providers or whatever, she started ranting about how this woman didn't want to be vaccinated and how she didn't believe in it. I was like "Oh, maybe she's a Jehovah's Witness and she doesn't believe in vaccinations." She's like "Well, she better believe in death by rabies." She was just really rude about this woman.</p>

<p>[09:57.8]</p>

<p>It kind of sounded like she just wanted to be able to make the decision because she said something like "I would like to choose my treatment" or something like that. I don't know. It was just very frustrating. So there are certain things. I think there's a lot of ups and downs in the job. Maybe that's it. But anyway, that's kind of work life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you feeling socially at work, because it sounded like it was a little bit awkward with some people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's still awkward but I guess now I've felt that I'm the one who is making it awkward. I've tried harder, especially on the overnights where there's less of us so it's easier to talk to people. It's kind of weird. The overnights are weird. We get really close and they start like making fun of me, which is cool. Like making fun of me in a good way, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which shows a certain level of familiarity.</p>

<p>[11:00.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And I'm pretty good friends with the doctor that's on his own on overnights, so he kind of makes fun of me too or whatever. So it's actually been a lot better socially. I still feel awkward whenever there's a new person. But I've decided that even though I've been there for a month, it's okay to still not know everyone because there's a lot of people who work (inaudible at 11:19.9). So I've made this effort to be like "I don't know that person. Let me go introduce myself."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard. It's really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are people responding to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're really nice, yeah. I've even made a couple of friends. There's a woman there who is really into new age spirituality, so we always talk about stuff. She asked me for — it's kind of awkward to say — but she asked me for my expert opinion. (chuckles) So it's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you are an expert in that field.</p>

<p>[12:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Maybe, but it's weird to hear that. So that's actually been a lot better. I was thinking about my old job and how that was, and I definitely enjoy this one much better. Like at least socially, everyone is —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is it a difference between who's there or — ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there's just more people there. There were six or seven at my old job, now it's like 30 at the same time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's a lot more to choose from about who you're going to mesh with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I haven't met anyone who has been mean to me or anything, so that's been much better. It makes it better when I'm there to feel like I'm part of the group or whatever, even though I'm outside of the cube. In terms of home life — because that's kind of work life, I guess — oh, I've been really angry at Tim, even though I haven't said anything to him.</p>

<p>[13:06.1]</p>

<p>So I know I used to have a thing for him. I don't do that anymore, especially after this kind of happened. He started to like date this girl in his Russian class from the summer. But the thing is, she has a boyfriend and he was telling me about how it was going and stuff. I was trying to be a supportive roommate and then he's like "She has a boyfriend." I'm like "Well, then why are you at her house until 2:00 in the morning every night of the week?" He's like "I don't want to be that guy, but —" I mean, that to me is like so sleazy.</p>

<p>If you look at him, he's like the cleanest-cut guy ever and he's like the nice guy or whatever. But to me, I don't know, I can't help but feel like irrationally angry about it. (chuckles) I think maybe it's because of my family, I don't know.</p>

<p>[14:02.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, infidelity really ripped apart your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So for me, that's a really sensitive spot, I guess. I haven't been able to — like, we went out for house-bonding and he brought — I forget her name. I think it's a "T" name. It's like Trisha or something. I couldn't even look them in the eye for an extended period of time. It was more like glancing, like I'm trying to have a conversation but I'm — like, it was hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really disapprove of his choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And her choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I thought about it later and that's actually how I look at my dad. I can't really look him in the eye, which is really weird, because nothing else has solicited that reaction from me ever, outside of my relationship with my dad. I also know that I can judge all I want, but it's not — you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[15:01.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not your choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and it's not really affecting me. (chuckles) I don't know, it's affecting some dude. I don't quite know how exactly to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you shared with Tim?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. Besides, I've been like far away for a long time. Or I haven't been home for a long time. But whenever he's around, it's hard for me to kind of interact with him. It's like "Hello. Goodbye." (chuckles) It's more like avoiding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's really going to affect your relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder how you could let him know what you're thinking without necessarily judging?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's hard. (chuckles) (pause) I don't know how that would work. Wouldn't that be kind of like judging to tell somehow I'm judging them? (chuckles)</p>

<p>[16:07.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, I think you can disagree with his choice and not judge him as a person. So it's kind of like separating the person from the behavior. It seems quite clear that you disagree with his choice to become involved with somebody who is in a relationship. But you don't have to change your opinion of him from a roommate you liked to a person you dislike. It's going to take stepping back a level, I think, from judging the person and just talking about this particular decision he's making.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that sounds really hard. I mean, okay, but it's easy to say something — like Julia is really annoying about cars in the driveway. She'll always call me and it's kind of annoying because I always move her car without calling her.</p>

<p>[17:07.1]</p>

<p>But it's easy to see how that's kind of something annoying that someone does that I'm willing to put up with because we're friends and otherwise she's a really cool person. But to me, it's really hard to separate —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems more character-driven.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It feels like — and I know it's wrong to — I know he can do good things and be a good person and also make mistakes. I get that. But it's almost like this isn't a logical way of feeling. Does that make sense? It's like really —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like you're having such an emotional reaction to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it's not something that — like that whole eye contact thing. I was thinking "Oh my God, I have to look at people when I'm talking to them. Otherwise they're going to think I'm rude." But I couldn't do it.</p>

<p>[18:05.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think that was about for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I don't know. I mean, it's almost like I wanted to express disapproval but was trying really hard not to. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's interesting because usually we think about avoiding someone's glance when we feel ashamed. Oftentimes when somebody feels ashamed, they won't look up at the person they think might be angry with them. But this was different because you didn't have anything to feel ashamed of in this situation, but you felt like they did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, there's a word for that in Spanish, actually. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is? What is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [<i>Pena querer</i>] which means when you're ashamed for something someone else is doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like for you?</p>

<p>[19:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, maybe. That's so weird. (chuckles) Yeah, kind of. I don't know. (pause) I feel like this is a special thing that if it was anything else that he was doing, you know what I mean? Like this is really close to home. It makes me angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want him to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I think that I do in that passive-aggressive — this is like when I was writing that e-mail to Phil. I knew it was wrong as I was doing it and was still doing it. I think it's that kind of thing, you know. So I think I secretly want him to know, but I don't. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why don't you? What is it that stops you from wanting him to know how upsetting this is for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think that I don't really want — I mean, it's a lot of things. I don't want to be that person that judges someone and is really judgmental, because that's not who I am. It's like a special case sort of thing.</p>

<p>[20:09.1]</p>

<p>I also don't want to bring that problem into my house and really acknowledge it, you know what I mean? Because it's the same problem that I ran away from 3,000 miles ago. I don't want it, you know. Maybe that's the problem too. When we were at home, we never really acknowledged it. My dad would never talk about it and when I did, he was like "Why do you care?" So maybe it's just that coming back in that kind of sweep-it-under-the-rug mentality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that reaction is something to be ignored.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't know. Maybe that. I don't know. Like acknowledging it makes it real too. That seems like a really — I don't know. (chuckles) It sounds like I'm in denial. But also, like what do I care? It's none of my business. You know, that's kind of —</p>

<p>[21:10.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Partly. But he's also someone you spend time with, when you're not working all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, these are not two strangers on the street. If it was two strangers on a street, then it doesn't really impact you. But he's a housemate, and a housemate that you liked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there is some relationship here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's telling you about it. It's not like you found out about it by accident. He was sharing this information with you, so it does seem like it does touch you in some ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So would it be similar to — so I was talking to Julia about something — and in retrospect I feel really bad about this — she was telling me about Sergio and how they got in a fight. I couldn't really — like I thought she was being a little crazy.</p>

<p>[22:05.5]</p>

<p>I thought that Sergio's thing made sense to me, but I didn't say it like that. That's sort of what I thought, like how can I say this in a way that's supportive but I'm not lying at the same time? It was kind of hard, and so it turned out to be a little bit awkward. I was trying to play it off like I was being devil's advocate, so it was a little bit awkward.</p>

<p>She went to take a shower or something, and I went to find her to talk about it, which was really hard but I didn't have time to think about it. I said "I'm sorry if I wasn't supportive." It was hard to phrase it, but basically in a nutshell I said something like "I wouldn't want someone to lie to me. I would want you to tell me what you really think, and I hope it's okay that we sometimes disagree."</p>

<p>[23:12.2]</p>

<p>And then she told me something else and I was like "Oh, that makes much more sense." We finished talking and it was less awkward, and we were really great after that. Because I felt it was my responsibility not to lie to her, especially over something that matters. So maybe it's something similar, I don't know. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you can express — it seems like it's important for you to have him understand what it's like for you to hear about this. So that makes it important for you to share it because otherwise, you're hiding not only what you feel about it but you're also hiding the fact that you do feel something and it's not okay. Like this is not okay with you.</p>

<p>[24:03.1]</p>

<p>So maybe the first step is to figure out what's important for him to know about your reaction and why that's important to you. Is it because you want to preserve the relationship? Is it because you want to teach him something? What's the motivation in disclosing your disapproval? And then we can go from there to figure out what's appropriate to say.</p>

<p>With Julia, it sounds like it's really important because she's a close friend for you, and you really value honesty in your friendship. Your relationship with Tim is a little bit different. So we have to figure out what makes it important for him to know that you disapprove of this behavior or this choice that he's made.</p>

<p>[24:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I don't know. (chuckles) It's almost like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all very innate right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It almost feels like when someone throws a ball at you and you're not ready, you know. It feels really — (pause) I don't know. Sort of like built-in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instinctual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't know. I mean —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your distaste for the infidelity is an instinctual reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes it important in your relationship with him for him to know about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because it's hard for me to spend any time with him at all, because all I can think about is "Oh my God, he's such an asshole right now." You know what I mean? Even though he's being perfectly nice to me. Is that a good reason? I mean, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be. There are no rules here.</p>

<p>[26:02.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It feels like whenever I'm with him, I can't think about anything else. That's how it is with my dad too. I just don't want that to over —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Overshadow everything else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I also don't want the way the relationship is with my dad to start to happen in miniature form with Tim.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like to spend time with Tim and have the time —</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're good friends. Yeah, we're friends. Yeah, we joke around about stuff and have a lot in common. We both play this one extremely nerdy video game and play chess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to be able to continue doing that stuff with him, or do you want that stuff on to be on hold until —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's sort of been on hold because we've both been really busy over the summer. But, I don't know. We used to go out drinking, just the two of us, for fun. But now I couldn't fathom doing that. Does that make sense? I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[27:04.6]</p>

<p>Maybe because it makes it difficult to spend time with him, or maybe because I live with him. (chuckles) Charlene told me that she'd been over to the house the other day after the house-bonding thing and I just felt really icky. Kind of skeeved out a little bit, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would you want to happen as a result of sharing with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't know because I also don't want to control people or try to control people because that's kind of been a problem in the past, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, like if he wants to date this girl, your telling him you don't approval is most likely not going to change that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a slight possibility that he'll have this realization of the impact that it has, but most likely it's going to be "I'm sorry you don't approve, but we're meant to be together."</p>

<p>[28:10.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or "It's her decision."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something else, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a possibility he'll be impacted by your words and have a perspective shift, but you're not in control of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't know. It's so hard for me to feel — like if he said "This is none of your business," I would be like "Oh, yeah, you're right." (chuckles) I mean, that's kind of what it feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but you recognize that it's not directly impacting you. It's not your choice to make. Yet he's someone you do care about and like and you're avoiding. He must notice that, or he's going to notice that at some point. Work might be a good sort of cover for a while. And he might wonder why.</p>

<p>[29:10.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So it's not fair to be dishonest. Yeah, okay. How would I even talk about that without sounding judgmental or really annoying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you remember "I" statements?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I don't know. I just don't know what I would say. Like "I think your dating someone who has a significant other is —"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about "I feel"? Change the "I think" to "I feel."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because part of what you want to do in conversation is open up a little bit. If you open up to someone, they are less likely to be defensive. Whereas if you judge him, he is going to feel defensive.</p>

<p>[30:08.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you can use an "I" statement and open up with expressing how you're feeling in reaction to something, he might be able to hear that a little more. What is it that it makes you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel uncomfortable in like — yeah, I feel uncomfortable. It makes me icky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if I play you and you play him, if I started with "I just wanted you to know that one of the reasons that I've been avoiding you a little bit is that I feel uncomfortable knowing that —" Trisha?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I feel uncomfortable knowing that Trisha has another boyfriend and that you're dating, spending time with her."</p>

<p>[30:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I can't think of anything else to say other than "It's not your business." Maybe like "I didn't know that" or — it's weird to be on the other side. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's go with your gut reaction, because when you put yourself in his place and you heard that, you thought he'd probably come back with "Well, it's none of your business." To which you'd respond "I understand that. I just wanted to share with you why I've had a hard time spending time with you or being able to spend time with her when she's here."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Okay. (chuckles) Yeah, that doesn't sound judgmental.</p>

<p>[31:59.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It gives him a little context for what's going on. If I try to flip it and pretend I heard the words, it might be like "Well, thanks for letting me know." I'm not really angry with you. I understand why there's been a distance, but I don't feel really angry with you. If you said "I think it's wrong to date someone who has another boyfriend," I might feel angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you do still feel that way and that's okay. But the piece you've chosen to share, if you talk about your feeling discomfort rather than choosing to share your thoughts about his behavior, you're sharing what your personal reaction is and how it impacts you. And that just feels easier to take in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. Okay. I can try. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[32:58.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you don't have to — by allowing yourself to share that piece with him, you don't have to hide. You don't have to pretend that you're comfortable with it anymore. You don't have to hide from them if they're there because he knows. He might do the respectful thing and not talk about it with you. You can choose to talk about other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be an okay outcome for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think it's almost like when you — like I'm thinking about that e-mail I sent to Phil which was passive-aggressiveness at its best, except aggressiveness. So, you know what I mean, it kind of built up and I said these really mean things, but that's how I was feeling. That's almost like all those things I was secretly feeling, but not very intensely until they all sort of came together, and this wanting to express my disapproval is also secret like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like your secret goal.</p>

<p>[34:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I hate saying that because that's not what I want to do, but it's almost like there's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is a piece of you that wants to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Even if 80 percent of me thinks it's crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a part of you that wants to teach him a lesson that this is wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe just tell him that I think it's wrong or that it — I don't know. I mean, my dad always said it was none of my business, so maybe that makes it a little bit harder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got a very strong reaction from dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I hate that he's creeping into my life. (chuckles) I don't even talk to him, and he's creeping into my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the big difference between the situation in your family and the situation here is that you and Tim are peers, and your dad is your dad, right?</p>

<p>[35:09.1]</p>

<p>And he had power over you, and you didn't have a choice. He was your dad. Regardless of whether you wanted him to be your dad or how much contact you wanted to have with him, you can't un-dad him. But you and Tim are peers and you choose whether or not you want to be friends. You have a choice over that. So you're coming from a little bit different space, but there are a lot of echoed feelings that it brings up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that fair to Tim? I mean, I've obviously made up my mind about this like 15 years ago, so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. Does it feel fair to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I hope it is. Maybe it's not about fair or unfair. I don't know.</p>

<p>[36:06.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. Well, my asthma is acting up too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you take something? Have you taken something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not working anymore. It's fine. (chuckles) But I think it almost makes me think — it's hard to separate, like you were saying, separate the action from the person. I wasn't even thinking about Tim when you said that. I was like "Oh my God, my dad." So I don't know, that seems like it would be really hard to do. And at what point do actions represent the person, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a really good question. When is — at some point, our actions are a reflection of our beliefs and values, and it's hard to know when that is. I don't know the answer to that question. Is this, with Tim, something that is indicative of a deeper character?</p>

<p>[37:14.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I kind of feel like that's different, almost, to how my dad is. I mean, I've never known him to be anything different. I've been thinking about this too, like what would it take for me to get over that, you know. To like forgive him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your dad or Tim?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad. And I can't come up with anything. I think this Tim thing has brought it up for me again because I've been thinking —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sure echoes so much of the disappointment and betrayal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like I could still forgive Tim. Like there are things he can still do that would make me feel comfortable living with him. That's fine, everyone makes mistakes. I'm not saying I don't make mistakes —</p>

<p>[38:04.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't know if he thinks about this as a mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and that's fine. We all define mistakes differently, whatever. But I don't know. It seems like all this dad stuff —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think they're absolutely linked. I mean, your reaction to this happening in your house is definitely linked to such a strong impact that a similar action had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was talking to Julia about it and she was like "Well, they're not married." I was like "I don't care if they're 12 years old and dating."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. To you, it's really important, and it's understandable why it matters so much to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Would that be like — and this isn't my first choice, but would that be like important information to contextualize why? For Tim, I mean.</p>

<p>[39:04.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depending on what he's like, yeah. Because some people might not need to understand why you feel the way you do. I think that depends on his personality. It makes it easier to understand. You know, when you started talking about this, I could put the pieces together and I know the history. It makes perfect sense why you have a stronger reaction to this than anybody else who hasn't been hurt by infidelity.</p>

<p>I think one of the first things you said was that you've been so hurt by this and your mom was so hurt by it and you strongly identify with her. So it makes sense why you have this really strong reaction. Well, if he needs to hear that in order to take in what you're saying, that totally depends on what he's like, and you probably have a better sense of that than I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think part of your thought process ahead of time is preparing what you want the conversation to be like and figuring out what your boundaries are. If he wants to know, would you feel comfortable telling him?</p>

<p>[40:07.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he's nice, sure. He knows my dad and I don't speak. He knows there are issues there, but I don't think he exactly knows why. So maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe sharing that would be a way of getting closer to him too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you want that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's weird how that works, right? (chuckles) Because that's how I felt with Julia. I felt like there had kind of been a little bit of a distance growing between us and not just like the physical distance. Then I told her — it wasn't like a fight. It was just like a weird —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A difficult conversation.</p>

<p>[40:58.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it was weird. And when I talked to her about it, it sort of made her open up more and I guess share something that she hadn't been comfortable sharing before that contextualized the whole thing for me. Then I understood, and I apologized for not being supportive, and we agreed that we don't want to lie to each other or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you got closer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and now we're back to texting every 10 seconds, which is weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what you went through with her is an amazing process of deepening a relationship, and that's what happens when you come to some sort of an impasse, whether it be having a difficult conversation or a disagreement about something. Being able to name what's going on and talk about it and be open and honest with one another and not be blaming or defensive, that's what allows you to get to the next level of understanding and feeling close.</p>

<p>[42:09.6]</p>

<p>You feel safer in a relationship having known you can go through that, that you can have a period that's tense and she wasn't hurtful to you and you weren't hurtful to her. You didn't lash out at one another. You reached out and really demonstrated how valuable the relationship was. It makes for a stronger relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is — I definitely kind of — (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You put into place a lot of skills that you hadn't worked on before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think it really helped that I couldn't overthink it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes I think that when you think about it too much, you kind of freak yourself out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All that stuff kind of kicked in and worked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that was very helpful. I thought of you. I was like "I've got to call Dr. Asgaard (ph) and tell her."</p>

<p>[43:01.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad to hear it. We should probably wrap up for today, and I think we need to schedule for next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also have a housekeeping issue. Your check from last time bounced.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did? Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. That's really embarrassing.</p>

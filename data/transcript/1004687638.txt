<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no need to (inaudible at 00:17) again. I wanted to try meeting three times a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Sure] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (background noise) So, this is a way of saying you're a (inaudible at 00:47) analysis, it sounds like? I mean... yeah. [00:00:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I was thinking and talking to some, yeah -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never (inaudible at 01:03) in any case, I'm just sort of trying to get a sense of what it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I'd rather not share] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (laughs) I didn't realize what—one of the things that was making me feel weird about meeting more frequently is that it felt like I didn't deserve it. The main thing I think about—well, [it's almost a regularity] (ph), is being, like, what other people—I guess it's partially that they might (inaudible at 01:39) but not just that. So I'm, like, well, you know, (inaudible at 01:41) since I was a teenager, and doesn't seem to need that much therapy, (inaudible at 01:49) I think she does. So, I think linking with the other people I knew who had horrible things happen to them, that are completely crazy and—why should I be going so frequently if they're not? If that makes sense, even though I know that me going to therapy is nothing, like—it's not secretly taking it away from someone else. [00:02:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and actually (pause) often (pause) I've seen other people like that, and (pause) (inaudible at 02:31). Sometimes, you would often—those people with histories like that (pause) are inappropriate or more intensive or more psycholitic therapy. They send them there and do very well, and other times—I guess what I'm saying is severity of history doesn't necessarily correlate with optimal intensity of treatment. (inaudible at 03:18) [03:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of like the core thing was that I didn't deserve it, or, I think—I don't know. I have a hard time, which we've talked about, letting people be nice sometimes, and I think that it is part of it. Tuesday night I went out to dinner with one of my friends. And a little bit after we sat down and falafel (ph), she said, "Devon, I'm really sorry to hear that you've been having an extra hard time with the question (ph)." And my knee-jerk response, I'm, like, whoa, rude (ph). Just sort of say, like, oh, thanks (ph) and (pause) I didn't just—I was, like, I should just thank you, that's—I mean, that's really nice, but I don't know. [00:04:28] It reminded me of it took me of it took me a really long time to be able to say thank you to compliments. So, [a little bit later] (ph), I was like, "What I actually meant to say was thank you." And she's like, "Yes, I understand, you know, I feel the same way sometimes." But (pause) I don't know, something about thinking about how I hate (inaudible at 04:51) compliments just made me think, like, oh, yeah, it's about [worried so] (ph) about not feeling worthy or good enough or something. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 05:49)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think (pause) one of the times (ph) I was talking to—were the (pause)—her comment was that—well, she's like, "Yay, I'm your friend and I think you should feel better." And, you know, just nice. The other thing (ph) she commented and she's like, "Well, like, why shouldn't you do something to make yourself feel better? Like, what would be..." (pause) I don't know. I never put it that way, I'm, like, "Well I get what you're saying, but I still feel bad about it." [00:06:53]</p>

<p>(pause) The imperative (ph) should be more able to (pause)—I guess to cope or to feel OK. And sometimes I work when I'm having just a really awful day. And it'll (ph) be like, "Well, you know, everyone else seems fine or relatively fine, so why I am so frustrated?" Especially when something, like—right now I'm working on a screencast of something for work, and it's something that I'm, like, well this is something I don't think anyone's going to use. [00:07:54] And well, in theory, learning how to use this is interesting, what I'm doing is super boring. And I just don't want to do it. And I'm like, well—I think I should just do it, whatever, you know, I have a job, which is great. I have a job where I can also fuck around on the Internet for half a day if I want, but I also just feel so frustrated about it. The other day, they all (inaudible at 08:24) the boss's office, and they seem really fine, or no one else complains during staff meetings, except (inaudible at 08:35), so that (inaudible at 08:36), in staff meetings. </p>

<p>(pause) So, I don't know. [I need it to serve] (ph) (pause) [00:08:49]. Just shutting off is not one of my general things that I do very well, so (pause) I don't know, I think I worry that my feeling of frustration or upset or aggravation is out of proportion or inappropriate, like I shouldn't be feeling this aggravated or upset about work or about other things. [00:09:43]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'd be nice if you could feel what you felt, and that was OK. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I don't—like, part of me doesn't fully believe that (pause)—I guess I don't always believe that I—it's like, since I am feeling that way—it seems very hard. I guess I don't always trust how I feel. [00:10:57]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that's just a different kind of attack on your emotional life. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 11:36) attack.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One kind is, you shouldn't be feeling this. and recently you were just talking about another one. Or were you not really feeling that? [00:12:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. Yeah, maybe it's a sort of self-counseling (ph). (pause) I mean, sometimes it just I don't want to feel that way. I'm sad I feel jealous of—like, I'll feel jealous of my friends, like, that my friends are hanging out with each other and I'm not. So... [00:12:54] </p>

<p>And I really, like, I don't like feeling jealous of my friends or, like, feeling like if they're—wishing, like, well didn't—I guess it's sort of feeling—the way I'm feeling is like... (inaudible at 13:16) And I was so sort of, like, (audible at 13:30) a little bit left out, and kind of inadequate, like... I don't know. And it's sort of, like, well why wasn't I invited? Like that sort of feeling. [00:13:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I (inaudible at 13:58) you, but I think I know the feeling you're referring to. But how does that relate to your feeling for what we were talking about? It doesn't have to, I just have a feeling you're gonna need to point them out.</p>

<p>CLIENT So, I really don't like doing it that way. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Like what?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) I guess the part I don't like is more, like, jealousy. If I see my friend talking about how they hang out sometime at the movies, I just really hate that. Sometimes I feel just, like, really jealous of it. I'm like—I mean, and then I feel left out, of course that's part of it, but... [00:14:47]</p>

<p>Like, I don't want to (inaudible at 14:55) my jealousy, and I also don't totally (pause) get it. Because I mean, it doesn't (pause)—it doesn't really make sense to me. Why would I feel—why do I feel jealous about it? I think part of it also that sometimes I feel (pause), like, I feel jealous and sort of mad that I want to do something. [00:15:43] Like, an act that'd (ph) be revenge. But (pause) I don't—I mean, this is, like, (inaudible at 16:00) I think I'm jealous. I really want to, like, I hope you trip and fall down, but I don't really, like, that's not really what I want. What I want is to, like, see you or something. But I sort of am, like, having this weird impulse too. (pause) And I'd like to just, like, destroy whatever they were doing, but somehow make it (pause) less fun or to spoil it. Like, I want, like, revenge or something, even though they didn't—nothing was said to me. But I still kind of want revenge. [00:16:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they didn't hurt you, you wouldn't need to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's—I don't know. But I just feel, like, they weren't doing anything. Two of my friends hanging out, and that has nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [This might be inappropriate] (ph) but, not to you it didn't.</p>

<p>(laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It also makes me feel really petty. Like, I feel like a terrible—I feel like a terrible person or terrible friend that I'm sitting here being mad at my friends for hanging out. [00:17:49] </p>

<p>I generally am not mad at other people for having, like, something nice. You know, like, I'm not jealous of—like when friends get married, I'm not, like, I hate them for getting married or I hate seeing couples holding hands. I really, like, didn't (inaudible at 18:18) about it. And I really like weddings. (pause) So, it feels weird to me that this is where I'm getting, like, jealous and petty and (pause) wanting to lash out (pause) at people that I like. [00:18:52]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>And I can't help thinking that (pause) this is sort of another (inaudible at 19:29) at your feelings. How they should be. I don't believe them. I don't believe them, and sometimes they (inaudible at 19:52) poorly on me. Like, I'm full of jealousy. [00:19:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 20:04) I'm sure there's something to this, you know, some explanation for why this is something you're sensitive to, and it invoke this reaction in you. I mean, (inaudible at 20:17), but everything that you're saying, I'm also hearing it as (pause), like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like my feelings. Yeah, I mean, I don't, like, I don't—I don't know. It just feels like I shouldn't be feeling bad. I'm sad that I'm doing whatever thing. I also just, like, I feel bad about myself. [00:21:01] And also, mad at myself for not, like, calling the person or asking them to do something or (pause), like, a gazillion other things that I could be doing. And also, I don't like experiencing myself at being childish and petty. (pause) </p>

<p>And I find it hard to talk to my friends about it. [00:21:57] (pause) Like, talking to the actual person, let's say—I don't know. Like if I'm really jealous of one of my friends hanging out with (inaudible at 2:16) and I felt really jealous when you were hanging out, but (pause) I don't even like—I can't even think of, like, doing that. To me it just sounds really creepy. Like, I don't like it when you do anything with other people. (laughs) So, I can't really talk to that person, and then (pause) the (inaudible at 22:44) that person's just hanging out with has the same problem, like, sort of—and I feel really controlling, like a stalker, or, like, it just feels really weird. [00:22:57] </p>

<p>And I don't get other friends (pause). I just don't understand, like, sometimes they're kind of—some of the time defensive about it. They're like, "Well, why didn't you just call them, or why didn't you just do that?" You know. Like, I don't know. Like, I'm not really sure what response I want or would be helpful, but (pause) I really feel like the response I get is on the defensive, and also I worry that whoever I'm talking to now thinks I'm really just feeling controlling over them as well. [00:23:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) That's too bad. I mean, it's not about them.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's something that—like, you know how they say, (inaudible at 24:26). Like, I don't—we already talked about it. That I'm feeling jealousy with my friends because I just feel—I just feel very uncomfortable expressing -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (inaudible at 24:40) ashamed of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. [00:24:46] It just seems so controlling, like, I want to control—I just—I don't know. Like, I feel—yeah, I'm ashamed that I'm upset that my friends are doing something nice. (pause) And also, like, I end up—I don't (inaudible at 25:35) a lot, for, like, seeing people. I just, I don't know, don't. And a lot of my local friends, like, they're scheduling things like a month out, like, to hang out. I'm like, "So, are you busy the next three weeks." And it gets frustrating feeling like  (inaudible at 26:05) as best I can now, I don't know how I'm going to feel in three weeks. And it feels—having to—it's sort of active (ph) saying—my friends saying, like, "Well, I'm really busy till the end of the month." And I'm thinking, "Well, I'm free all month." Like, I feel really inadequate for my lack of all these things that would—like, not having a packed calendar. [00:26:36]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling (pause) sad about things socially, in a more general way? [00:27:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, for a while I hadn't—so for, you know, three years or so after, you know, Josie, I didn't want to go any more parties. Like, I just didn't want to go anywhere (ph) And then, you know, having a gazillion mutual friends going out with friends, like, over your friend's house who's having a party or whatever. I felt like I was basically 50/50 chance of seeing Josie. [00:28:48]</p>

<p>And so, in that way that it does, like, some people sort of—they're like, Oh, Karen's like (ph) Depressed, like, it's just had to (ph) to break up, and it's sad. And then for, like, oh, I'm just used to not, like, going to parties or going out. And so I feel like I've dropped off. (pause) Like, I recently, like, kind of got dropped off from people's—sort of party invite list, or people who they think like, "Oh, I bet she'd be up for, I don't know, running around and (inaudible at 29:43)." </p>

<p>And as far as—I'm like—I understand, like if I keep on hanging out, why—I feel like, oh, she's, you know, always saying no. I'm like, why should I keep asking? But that makes me sad. (pause) And also, sort of (pause)—If one of my friends used to live—basically, her apartment was sort of on my way home, so we finally stopped by there, like, maybe every week. (inaudible at 30:34) stick my head in, because I'm walking by anyway. But, I see her a lot, and she—her spouse are super social, like, he has three bands (sp), and she's doing all of this art stuff. So (pause), you know, it would not be uncommon to be like, "Oh, and then..." XYZ. [00:30:58]</p>

<p>And so she moved twice. And now it's, like, it's kind of hard to get where you are. It's really annoying to call the transit. This wasn't a just walk over. And then, like, I don't know, like, (pause) I feel weirdly awkward asking someone to do something one-on-one. (pause) Especially someone's who's busy, because I feel like, "Oh, they're really busy." [00:31:50] You probably want to maximize your socializing to be, like, with more people, and maybe just hanging out with me is not interesting enough. And when someone's like, "Oh, I can't do anything for the next three weeks," it really makes me feel like, "Oh, I guess you don't want to do anything, since you're really busy for the next three weeks." And it's also such a classic, like, blow-off. Like, "Oh, I'm busy." And these are all people who I know are busy, like, they're not just saying that. But it really feels like (pause), I don't know, like people are just too busy for me. </p>

<p>And then the other thing is that—I mean (pause), like, I think as an adult it's really intimate to have someone over to your house. Like, just to come over and just to do what you're doing or whatever. [00:32:57] But on the other hand, I really enjoy (inaudible at 32:59) my house. It's not hard to get there. It's right there. But it can be hard to do that, like, how they can get randomly squirrely about it. And we have our ongoing conflict about how clean the apartment has to be for someone to come over. So (pause), I just feel really weird (ph) to attempt to invite anyone over. Even though, like, I won't care, but I'll have to care, but I'll have to care about it from Ashby (ph) for the next three weeks. Or, like, the day before, just, like, whatever. [00:33:45]</p>

<p>And when I talked to her about it, we end up having this weird, like (pause)—she's like, "No, it makes me feel really horrible because it's a nasty and it's a disgusting house, it's so filthy. But, I guess you should invite someone over anyway." But it's not OK, like, it's obviously making you uncomfortable. And then, kind of, like, ideally I wish that, you know, that I need to clean more or whatever. But I don't. And I'm fairly OK with that. I also, like, anyone's who's known me long enough knows this. Like, all my old friends know that I'm a total pack-rat, not a nasty creep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Keep going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, like, they're OK with that. And I'm OK with it. [00:34:43] So (pause) it gets frustrating to have that versus (ph), like, affecting when I invite people over. And she's also, I think, the first roommate I've had that's been—I guess that resistant to having someone over when things are messy. Like, (inaudible at 35:10) like, "Our room's really messy, we should clean up." I'm like, "Yeah, OK. Yeah, we should clean up a more a little bit," or whatever, but (pause) her feelings of feeling judged are so intense that I feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I think what you're telling me is you're pretty lonely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of, like, sometimes I am. [00:35:55] I guess it's just weird, like, sometimes I feel really lonely. And sometimes I feel like (pause)—I guess not exactly lonely, but (pause) I feel frustrated that it takes me so much time for—it takes a lot of emotional effort to, like, e-mail someone and do something.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>And I want it be easier, like, (pause) I guess, more, like, there are so many things that can just get in the way of seeing people. And it would nice if (pause) it wasn't so hard. [00:36:57]</p>

<p>Like, the last time Ashby (ph) was away at her parent's house for a week, like, I could've just invited everyone over and she'd never know. (inaudible at 37:13) so tired, and I kind of don't wanna ask someone over in case they don't want to. And what if I invite a bunch of people over and no one comes over? And everyone's already, like, everyone's probably already busy, and just sort of (pause). Like, some days, I'm just—I'm totally happy to just go home and read a book. But some days, I just sort of sit there being like, I wish that I could—I wish that I was—felt able to, or was better at (inaudible at 37:54) just calling someone and saying, "Let's get ....."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 38:10) stop for now. (pause) (inaudible at 38:18) I was feeling. [00:38:24]</p>

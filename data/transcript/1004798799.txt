<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I apologize. I started having some—a bunch of allergies, so I'm already—it's hard to understand. I'm starting to get the decongestant out, but everything's still very, very cheap. Oh, gosh. I've just been—I am pretty much physically exhausted again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—we sold our car last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:00:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And therefore—I am running back and forth to do all these errands and stuff, and all that, and I'm just not feeling very well. And just, you know, all this other stuff going on that just has made it extremely tiring, you know? (pause) I—Saturday was just such a complete and total, like—I don't even know how to explain it. It just turned into an overwhelming disaster, so I—I can't even not really do much of the grocery shopping myself or go with my husband to do it. That's sort of like the division of labor here. Like I said, because we just sold the car and we had—ow, ow, ow—we just had a rental for a little bit, temporarily, I wanted to make sure we were really stocked up on the stuff, so I sent him out—into Target. And it was—it was Saturday afternoon and I think that subconsciously the reason why I try not to—I mean, part of it is just physical exhaustion -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah. [00:02:23] </p>

<p>CLIENT: —but also part of the reason I want to not do it is—I mean, because he doesn't react well in crowds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And instead of kind of trying to spare him from that, I just would rather not have be around him when I have to deal with like around crowds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's just—and because he was just—there's so many people at the Target on a Saturday night period, it would just drive him crazy and then there's sort of like a communication breakdown based upon that and—it sort of turned into this—I don't know how to explain it. It really could—it could have been worse, but it was definitely not great. And I had mentioned to him that I was trying to—to get a bike, so we could just stop over, and actually try to do this—and I do these things before I come in—before I decide I want to do something I knew I was like feeling overwhelmed, I came out with a compromise, like, "Why don't you go do this. This is something that you like to do and I'm going to go look at bikes and we can meet back up." [00:03:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were going to get the bike at Target?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least look at the bike. I mean, I wasn't certain—like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fair enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I don't know that I'm going to get it, I'm looking at this, right? And he'd be like, "No, I don't want to do that." And you know what—I already—I knew this was something he didn't really want to look at bikes, so why in the world would I, you know—and I already knew this and I came out with this compromise. And so he looked at this and I was talking to him about this, and he's like, "Yeah, it's not going to fit in the rental car." I'm like, "Well, this and that." And he said, "I'm not going to do it." And I can tell he's getting grumpy about the whole thing and this and that. And</p>

<p>I'm like, "Ok, well, at least I know how valid it is and maybe I can get it—I see how the buses have these things in the front that you can throw bikes on, blah, blah, blah." And I was like—I was leaving and this and that, and I—it—to make a long story short, I guess between the Target -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and the fact that I—he really hates it when I call my mom while he's driving, but I wanted to call my mother really quickly and let her know what the prices of bikes were at Target, because she was talking about helping me out by buying a bike for me, blah, blah, blah. The anxiety of that makes him drive faster, and he got pulled over for an exceptionally high speeding ticket, which, of course, made things even worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How fast was he going? [00:04:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, apparently there is this area right like near where it goes down to like 20 miles an hour -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was like 65.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So—and blah, blah, blah, and it just—you know, everything started to evolve from there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And finally, I just like—I was really upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I really tried to talk this out, because I explained it, like, "I come—you know, I can tell you're really upset," but I also knew this is the last time we're going to have a car, so it's much—it's much larger than the one we have even by far, because it has a backseat, you know. You know, I was trying to get as much stuff, this and that, and I said, "You weren't even really all that interested in trying to figure out to fit—how we could fit a bike in there, or looking into this kind of thing so we could get a bike—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and this and that. And basically, he talked to me like, "I'm really trying to do this and that" and basically he talked like, "I'm really trying to do all this stuff." And I even said, "Hey, I you—I know you really like the new star wars Legos. Why don't you go look at these while I do this and" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and this and that, and then he came out with these things, and it just—like it took most of several hours to try and work this whole thing out, because it's like there's so many things going on at this point, but mostly it was the fact that it—he wasn't really in a good mood and every single thing I was doing was making him more upset. You know? And (pause) I was just really, really—got really upset about the whole thing and this and that, and it just took a long time to like get around to having this conversation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:06:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But mostly about the fact that, quite frankly, sometimes because he's so upset about so many things, it's not really all that pleasant to want to be around him. You know? Like in public right now, sometimes. Usually I like to be around with him in public because he's the perfect husband in the world, as opposed to—but when he's over in crowds, he just totally shuts down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, I've been really trying to do a lot of things that were independent and all that stuff, but it's just, you know—and part of that was getting a bike. You know, I was calling my mother because—it wasn't like I was calling my mother to gab about something, or like to annoy him, just to gossip and see what like our husbands were doing. I was calling her because I was trying to get her to give me money to buy something. You know? It wasn't like I was doing it to be annoying. I was trying to do it as soon as I left Target. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just in case she said, "Well, figure it out and buy it." You know, I don't know. "I'll drop it off and charge it and we'll see something" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It just evolved from there. Well, thank God—and I didn't tell me mom what really happened -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —at all, because she knew that he—we were being pulled over because the phone—or well, the—being pulled over. I'm not driving, mind you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's driving. [00:07:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I would never do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she explained to Dave that it—if (inaudible) on—on—on—you know, was working on Sunday, that it would be really in my best interest to go and buy a bike, and have it at the house. And she looked at me—and she's tried to tell him,—she's like, "I'll tell you what. I'll pay for it. Go get a bike, and you know, more or less, take responsibility. You're the one who's going to be like the hero if you do this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You come home and there's a bike there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you get—that would be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, this and that—and the biggest of why I was really—like I have a lot of concern is because I'm not sure how much I have to modify this (ph)—and you know, all this stuff. But we'll see. And I—but the thing is, is that I had a conversation about the fact that, quite frankly, as much as you're cranky and bitter about these things, look what she did for you. She was pulling you aside and saying—giving you the opportunity—not necessarily for her swooping in to make things better—to make you be the hero.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now he's just been so like—there's the whole thing where he just is there talking about the fact that he has such little contact—you know, has such little contact with his family over the years—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that—for certain things, it seems so—like things that my parents won't—they really don't get out—they really don't talk to him that much, but you have—super invasive and questions that are super-invasive, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:08:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my mom asking, "You know, are you in an accident," and sometimes I've read that, you know, it's been—several days afterwards is when all these aches and pains start, you know, "How are you feeling?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not that invasive. But since his family would never ask -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I think his mom still hasn't called him—you know, she called him on her way to vacation, and you know, he said "You know, when I'm depressed, you should try not to like get on the phone." Well, she—I guess she's dealt with the situation by never calling again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least until she thinks that maybe we've forgotten about the situation. I don't know. So—so—immature. But I mean, although, he has these realizations that this is not evasive, by most anybody standards -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's still so instinctual for him to get over—and I mean, I guess it's partially because he's overwhelmed already, or this and that—but you know what, I'm really sick of him making excuses about it. But I think eventually it kind of got us worked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Good. [00:09:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's just been—I feel bad because now he's gotten me—he's gotten me a bike, and I haven't had a chance to use it yet, of course, which is embarrassing, but it's been—but it's only Tuesday and I got it Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've gotten home after it's dark every day. But the—the thing is that it—ever since then it's just that—I have been physically completely and totally taxed by what I've had to do to get back and forth from work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he's making you ride and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, he not always. Yes and no, but also like—like—like my dog is here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She goes to day—doggy day care while I'm at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly because I made arrangements—my landlord did not want an animal -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, she's really good, and they said, "You know what, if she's supervised—you cannot leave her alone."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's an informal thing—officially, on the lease, they said—they never changed it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they said they would always look the other way as long as she was never left alone by herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I like it because I drop her off and she—she's with other dogs</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. She probably—</p>

<p>CLIENT: She loves it there. So we're separated. But then it becomes like the, "Ok, so now I have to go out and get—you know, now I'm going back and forth to get her at day care, and going back and forth to work, and walking home."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And last night, I've already started to get—I've had a lot of muscle cramps in general, but actually, I've been getting ones that are—they become so bad -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:11:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that they're really—I mean, because it's—I mean, it's physical exertion that I can't do. And so last night was like an all-time low of really badness. And so I don't—I don't know—I am chipper about it now because it was so disturbing last night that I sort like thinking it had to be a dream; it wasn't. But the—you know, it—but it was just so frightening that I worried now about it a little bit, about being able to do this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It came from work—the doggy day care drama -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and then -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, I've gotten muscle—I mean, muscle—I mean, muscle spasms—yeah, I think—I have—I have a data point of 1.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, walking to the doggy day care, going back to the subway, and then doing this and that, you know? And you know, he's alone with such—so it's absolutely silly for him to go to the pond -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is on my way home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's just—I would say I have only a data point of 1, but the data point was so darn scary last night that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How high did it get?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (laughs) it was extremely excruciating, last night. And the second time—oh, I can't even believe I'm going to admit to this. It was so bad that—well, I first fell out the bed, and then I evacuated my digestive system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right onto the floor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of the pain and cramping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. [0013:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's when related to—that was related to exertion and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think so—well, you don't know (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It probably was—well the problem is ok -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so you never absorb—the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —related to the absorption (inaudible)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: —there's huge amounts of things like this. I have to take other things, too, but the electrolytes slowly get absorbed and then I say, "Nah." And it becomes—and this is why I actually it really drives me crazy, just—I know we're going to out on a tangent here, where people tell me, "Oh, there's great new treatment out there for this." And I say, "Yeah, there are treatments out here, but it's not just like a one consequence." You start throwing off all these other things, too."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. A whole cascade.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—and my doctors here are a little bit more—about the consequences of things, but they're a little bit more flippant about it, whereas my other doctors—I mean, I think it's because I have been treated for a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where my other doctors are like, "Hey, we're going to sit down. Let's sit down with a piece of paper, we're going to talk about—like we're going to talk about consequences, like side effects. What can you accept? If you—if you can handle this, what can you accept for that? And do you understand that if you do this, that you—it's not like you just say when—you might get cancer. It's just a matter of time until you get cancer, kind of thing."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was really eye-opening and made me feel a lot more in control of my treatment process.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas, this is, you know, I'm just hurting, told well, "You know, most people adapt to this better than you do." And I was like, "Well, that's great. I'm so glad most people adapt to this better than me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:14:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've sort of started thinking that most people just don't complain to their doctors about it as much as me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they have—like they have—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's just that—and so I just—we'll see how it goes this week. I may end up having to go like get in to see the doctor. If I get any more muscle spasms, though, the other thing is I don't want to make a big deal about it, because they are the precursor of MS, and the only way, at this point now—I mean, they've done a lot of testing. The only way they can actually test me for MS is a spinal tap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you don't want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I have had too many things stuck into my spinal cord already, and I sort of drew the line. That's strange, I know, but like having it—feeling like that way. I've had—I've had lots and lots of epidural injections in my life. Not the kind like you would have a baby, but they put steroids in where there's inflation (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. [00:15:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was such a very difficult part to manage part in my life, that I just also—I don't like having things stuck into my spinal cord. It's painful. It's really painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they would put me on a lot of—I mean, it was funny because I would go to the doctor, and they would put me on one dose for a whole lot of Valium. And it was just like one dose of it. So suddenly—I had to take it two hours ahead of time—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —just so that I wouldn't fight. And I wasn't the first one. I wasn't even the 30th person that week to have to be done that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because it's—they need you to be so pliant, because it's so painful and there's so many—there's a lot to it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I—I would have never started that round of things if I had known what I was going to get into with that. I would have been like, "Oh, ok. No thank you." But it was just like—I was—it was so—it's not like—it's not like I was sticking my head in the sand about not going—how can the doctor get rid of the (ph) muscles cramps, I was simply saying that I need to have—need to have two-weeks worth of DM (ph) before I'm willing to, you know, start having that route.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm just sick and tired of having to trade pieces—I mean, I feel like I'm losing my life one little bit at a time. I just keep trading off pieces of my life. And it's—it makes me feel really hopeless, you know? [00:17:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some things I can trade back, like if I want to go for chemo, I won't be so nauseated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But some of them, you don't trade back, you know? Like I—you know, there's certain things like I know I will never get parts of my mind back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Replacement joints. That's metal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So you sort of—and—and there is no point in the future -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in which I'm not going to have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —you won't get back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You won't get it back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it doesn't—you'll never get it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't ever get to go through a metal detector normally at the airport ever again. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you don't get your 30s back to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't get my 30s back. I don't get any of them back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I am trying really hard to—to intellectualize what's going on right now in terms of how this is going to dig us out of debt, not having a car, by taking it—by intellectualizing it in terms of literally looking at it in black and white in terms of the money. And now also trying to do it in terms of if I can walk back and forth enough to lose the weight, then the doctors will decide that I'm actually being compliant. They—they—a lot of the doctors say they won't really help you out until you lose 15 percent of your body weight. It doesn't matter what size—what weight you are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Help you out with what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like help you out in terms of pain medicine or help you out in terms of this or—you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:18:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're unwilling—it's almost like as a gesture, 15 percent of your body weight, apparently is a gesture in showing that you're interested enough in your own well-being to be able to need help—to get the help that you need for other things, you know? And—which I think is just bullshit. I mean, if I had 100 pounds, that would mean 15 pounds. For me, it means 30 to show that I've actually done that. But it doesn't matter what weight it is, 15 percent apparently is a gesture to show that you're—you're—of enough self-interest in that. Where in the world do they get this idea?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe if I can do that, then they will start being more cooperative with me about—and, you know, that's part of the—the walking back and forth thing, too, is you know—and the biking back and forth it's just to show also that I am going to be compliant enough that if I—if they do take a risk on putting me in something, like, you know, a bariatric weight loss something or other, you know, that I'm—I'm—I'm going to be complaint. Or to get me into a—you know—there are pain management trial—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, study trials -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to show that I will be compliant about it, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:19:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are some really interesting things in which they would do—they would do things—nerve interrupts, you know? Things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They—I don't really get it. I went off pain medicine, specifically so that I could show—that I was—that I wasn't just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so I wouldn't actually have this problem. So now it comes—this becomes another gesture, another gesture. It's like, you know, I have another—I have another really toxic relationship in my life and it's with the medical industry (laughs). And—yeah -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I've actually explained, because I've talked about this, I don't even hate Big Pharma. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People always talk about they hate Big Pharma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no—I have no problems at all with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how expensive the stuff is, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I know exactly why it's expensive. You know? But it's mostly because of the fact that I've just gotten pissed off at the gate keepers, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, especially (ph) up here, I guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's a lot of gate keeping here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the problem is I got spoiled by the Cincinnati medical system. One, because I had innies (ph) and knew most of the people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two, because I had a doctor that was extremely proactive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Half of his practice is in the SIU, and for years was sports medicine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he is and diagnostic—diagnostic—diagnosticians and stuff, specifically. But, you know, so his belief is that it's not getting you—getting you back to good enough is a different level of things. He wants—because all the women -half of his patients—you know, being able to walk isn't—isn't good enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:21:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being able to—being able to be able to do normal activities for a 30-year-old is good enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know—and that's why he had the conversations with me about like, "What are you willing to trade off? Are you ok being with nauseas? Are you ok with being this," you know? And I really feel like I don't get that kind of feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's kind of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's very—sometimes it feels very powerless. And I feel bad because it's like, I don't know if anybody else other places—part of the reason why I was able to have this treatment was because I was spoiled. Between my husband's colleagues that knew me—literally anybody who was anybody in—in orthopedic surgery knew my husband, and therefore—because he used to actually perform well and do good things. Still like has—like it's weird because like he isn't completely in the field now, but he still has like patents that are currently like progressive. Like they've been filed and progressing -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like some studies that he's worked on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, like, you know—so everybody knew when I had to get orthopedic surgery, you know, it was this guy's wife, you know, and things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was his field in grad school? I didn't know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's biomedical something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but between undergrad and grad -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he did a couple different stints. He did some things in petro chemical, but then he worked as part of the university's what's called Bone Engineering—Bone Engineering Tissue—Bone Tissue Engineering Center. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so they do all kinds of things with bone. And then when he went to grad school, he started from—went from really, really macro to much more micro stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—and he was working more as a chemical engineer for the Bone Tissue Engineering Center -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which sounds weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they were doing large things like bones and things like—they were literally things like replacing—like—things related to bone replacements. Actually, I know a lot about it because I—I was actually in talking to them, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd give them a bill. I couldn't get hired -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so I did stuff for them tech—technologically-wise. I'd give them a bill and they would pay me and that kind of—you know, that kind of stuff. So I knew a lot about their stuff, because I helped a lot. And so he has—he has several patents, both you know, U.S. and internationally, for this type of foam that what it is, is it's something called BMP, bone-modelable-like protein.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a foam that's basically for people who are like older or people who have calcification problems. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's used almost to glue the area back together again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's injected. But it's a combination of—it's a combination of bone metabolic protein, which makes you grow it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then at the same time it also has a type of antibiotic in it, because the—the number one reason why they have these problems is you get these thin films where get these little infections -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that never go away. And that's the reason why these things—these little infections keep it ever from healing properly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's always like that—that—they're called thin films. They're actually like a slippery (inaudible), so it never actually heals. And then the other thing is, is that once they're done—once it's done, it triggers in so you're body actually remetabolizes it and it goes away. So it's literally a system that goes in, and, you know, stays there for several years, and then goes away on its own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's a really -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so that's how he used to be like known.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time I understand part of the reason why he didn't want to do it was because the surgeries were so brutal. Like a lot of the stuff before—before they went to clinical trials for humans, almost all entirely was done with cat—rats with (inaudible) defects. And you have never had a day until you have had to put 100 rolls—100 holes into the skulls of rats. Yeah. You can see where now you want to not get into that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that's just—that's just normal. You have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it—you never evolve—until you become a director of a place like that, you never evolve out of getting out of having to do that kind of dirty work, ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even like once you become a principle investigator or once you become a professor, you can get out of it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you just can't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So everyone knew who I was. You know, and like there were very, very famous people, like—like in the Olympics, the U.S. or—or the big surgeon there -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, and—I can't remember the last name. But he knew who I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like all of these people did, plus, because I used to skate and because of like a bunch of other stuff—ok, I came to the combination of orthopedics and sports medicine -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I knew lots of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I don't know anybody. And—and the thing is, is that quite frankly, in theory, you're really not supposed to be treated differently because they know you, but at the same time -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But of course—yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But at the same time, you know, it's like, it—I felt like, if I—you know, I had these conversations with doctors about stuff, I got a lot better care?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:26:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have yet to have eye contact with my doctor when I come up here. They have all turned their backs—and I don't know if you've noticed this, because it's all digital online, they turn their back to you where they're at their computer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't get—I mean, when they examine you, you get eye contact, but the entire time when there's talking to them, you get no eye contact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's—I mean, that's not that big of a deal, but that is an indicator -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —of removalable of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, a lot of the stuff that you're having trouble is part of like whole person stuff in that it's sort of like, you know, is treatment for this system worse—worth this cascade of side effect -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —or not? Or well, you have this issue and you know, you want to tell them about it, but you don't want them to do certain things in response to it. I mean, these are more like whole person problems -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —rather than just like, you know, "Here, there's situation, the marrow, replace the joint."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's different, yeah. [00:27 :42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even then they did—they found that the whole cascade of issues was related to it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —including being warned, "You'll never be able to go through airport security again" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"without it being a giant pain in the ass."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, I really feel like I'm not being treated like a whole person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I don't like going—I've met many people who have chronic illnesses -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —who really love the attention of going to the doctors.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They like being sick. I would do anything not to be sick. I would actually like voluntarily lose a limb if I knew that I would never have to deal with the—at the very least, I would give it up if I knew that I never had an autoimmune-related issue again. I really feel very strongly towards that. And it's not because I hate the doctors, as much as I am just so sick and tired of having to deal with it. It's like a part-time job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more than a part-time job. I've been under—like if I spend 40 hours a week -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you doing that (inaudible) you feel sick and tired of like or the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean like—so like, for example, you know for—I'm getting muscle cramps here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to—but in the mornings, because I have my—because my thyroid is being attacked by my immune system, I have to take desiccated thyroid, which means I can't take calcium in the morning, which means that I—but if I'm having muscle cramps, I need more calcium. So know I have to figure out sometime between when I get up in the morning and four hours later to get calcium. That kind of battles. Like I've got to—I spend—and I've never calculated, which is interesting, but I—I would say I easily spend 20 hours a week—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —managing the ups and downs of making sure I don't screw anything up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:29:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's not even talking about the pain. I'm just talking about making sure that I don't have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's not even like, "Oh, this is a bad,"—and like—and again, going back to a doctor that I really loved. He explained me to their treatment tests and side effects, but don't drink alcohol. One is you'll get really drunk really fast, and one you'll need a new liver. He's like-yeah, there's—there's a difference. One destroys your liver and one you—you're not going to be able to realize how fast you're getting drunk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, the same thing with like don't eat any more calcium. It's not like it's going to, you know, give you problems where you start getting stones in any—in organs that you're not supposed to. Like, because it calcifies and the next thing you know you're gonna—your pancreas does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's like there are immediate and very real -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Serious consequences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —serious consequences.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like it's shots. And I'm like, you know—you saw how many shots I took. That's three months of shots, that's a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:30:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just—I'm just sick of it. I don't feel like I'm getting attention from it. It doesn't make me special. I'd like to believe that it's made me into a more patient person -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I—and maybe it's just because I'm trying to find a—a bright side -to it, that it's made me into a better -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think 99 percent is—sucks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, maybe there's some silver linings here and there -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —but it's mostly been awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's been really freaking awful. And so, you know, it's (pause) and the worst part is, is that (pause) all I'm doing is slowing down the decay. It's not fixing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:30:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's—I can—I mean, if I knew I was going to stop any progression, but there'd still be pain, but you know, stopping progression—you know, if I was halting it in its tracks, different story again. I'd be ok with it. But if I let myself sit and think about the fact that right now, as I'm breathing, my immune system is potentially tearing apart some new organ or some new joint in my body, or when it decided to reclaim my nervous system and started taking apart my myelin sheaths—you know, I think that's how you pronounce it, but the point is that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —yeah, do you realize how freakish that is to know that other than breathing, my body is just mutilating itself? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really scary. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really terrifying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really terrifying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really quite disturbing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And this—it's so mysterious—and it's not just like mysterious for me, it's mysterious—once you start getting into this brown mode (ph)—getting more than three autoimmune diseases, it is so cut and dry in terms of—not that they know what's going to be next, but they know the fact that they have not a clue in the world what starts it, they have not clue in the world what makes you into remission -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they can't even just tell you, "Oh, if you do this, you will go into remission," or something. They have no clue. Half of the drugs they—they give you, they don't know why—like I take quinine. [00:32:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have no idea why quinine helps the bones from getting too soft. They don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't help the people with like this or that, they don't know. But they know that it helps. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I take the same stuff the people have that like—the people that get like—oh, what's it called -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scurvy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —not scurvy. I do—I think it helps the scurvy thing, too, but it's um the—the disease you get when you from mosquitoes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, malaria.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Malaria. It's one of the anti-malarials.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have no idea why, but they know it's—you know, that's kind of creepy. Half the drugs my husband takes, you know, in terms of that—in terms of things for his brain, they—yes, they don't know the exact mechanisms for them, but they really do understand, like, serotonin-related things or dopamine-related things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we have a basic understanding of what's happening. They have no idea what—the mechanisms behind these. But it works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And I imagine that really, for you, who tends to like know things, or at least know that somebody knows it -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —again, disturbing. I mean, I understand—the only medication that they really understand that I take -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —is—it's the anadrol injections I get, the one that—it gets rid of—it's a TNF alpha-blocker. What basically it does is it blocks tremor necrosis factor, which basically means when your body senses cancer or a tumor, it kicks in and stops it from happening. It kills the tumor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I—so this is the one where if you stay on it long enough you will -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you will get cancer. No matter what you do—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —if you stay on it long enough you will get cancer -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It fights the (inaudible) the way that it otherwise would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because your body won't—you will get a tumor and your body won't know about it. [00:34:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the only one that they really have a clue in the world about how it works -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and that's the scary—and I mean, the funny thing about that—actually, although I'm saying it, I'm ok with it. I know that that is a risk that I'm willing to take.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Quinine, they know that after awhile you get—start to get vision problems. Again, they don't know why you start to get vision problems -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —afterwards, but they know that—that's a risk I'm willing to take, again. It's still like all of these drugs have all of these things and they don't really know most of them, and it's just—it's just so freaking serious and it's—I think it—I think it would be much better with being sick like this -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —if I didn't have the med—and this sounds really stupid to say this—but didn't have the mental capacity and the desire to understand things as much as I do. If I were less than intelligent, I think I could be better at peace with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's the intelligence peace and also the extent to wish for you understanding and knowing how they work, makes you feel a whole lot less helpless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you know you can't literally do anything to understand how things work I think makes you feel a degree of like ease and in control of what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And, you know—and—it's—it's—it's—it's not even just the fear as much as like the fact that—I guess the problem is that if—you know, when I try to understand more of this and I actually try to be really involved in this -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —being brushed off and being told, you know, things like, "Oh, don't worry, I don't (ph) understand also." [00:36:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "Try me." You know, yes, my degree is—you know, my husband actually does this. He pulls this, "I am—you know, I have a Ph.D. in this and I used to teach, like, physiology. Try me on—try me on trying to describe what a carbamate formation (ph)"—they found a new problem with his brain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, "Try me on telling me what this carbamate formation is. I used teach, you know, anatomy and—and—and physiology, so I'm sure they'll understand it." And sometimes they actually help him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, with me, it's like my background is science and I don't have enough credibility -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, except for the fact that I should understand everything that I own in my life -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —including my body. [00:37:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't believe anybody else should. I don't have like these beliefs that everybody should understand like, you know, how their air conditioner works. It's just who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) It's just really frustrating, you know? I don't want to be talked to like a peer, like I'm a colleague, but I'd like to be at least talked to as an educated consumer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And it's—you know, like for example—and I think I briefly just said something to you—in which I got forwarded something—a journal article about how inflammation can also—the pathways for inflammation can also mimic depression. Did I send that to you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Well, I'll send this to you, this is really neat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently, like this—this thing where like the inflammation pathways light up the same—they were doing these things where I guess some—some particular type of brain scan where it lights up like the same parts—parts of the brain -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —as certain things related to depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It looks like it's depressed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the—the—the concept is that they were proposing that evolutionarily, the reason why that was is if you had so much inflammation, they wanted you to pull back and pull away and not be so active. Therefore, like—it was almost like an evolutionary thing -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:38:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like that's our—if you're that hurt, that you're that—that much inflammation, then you really should start withdrawing from the social things -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, because you're doing the same things -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to heal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —that depression does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like flu is supposed to make you tired because you need sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was really interesting. And, you know, I thought that was interesting because—and I will send it to you—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because it's fascinating, but it is an interesting -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I don't necessarily believe that I'm depressed now because of the fact that I'm not inflamed, but it is an interesting -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I think there's a few thousand other things that's doing that, too, but knowing that mechanism -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that is kind of—it's empowering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing that like, you know, when I have a fever, my body is trying to kill the bacteria, it's trying to raise heat so it kills the bacteria, you know? And—and knowing that my body wants me, you know, if I've sprained an ankle kind of—or done something much worse than that, actually, because I think you had to have a trigger for that—but, you know, that it knows that it wants me to not be, you know, so involved, therefore it mimics the same thing as being as being (inaudible) depressed.</p>

<p>Very interesting stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely. [00:39:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I don't know. I mean, I don't believe—I don't—and the—and the thing that is just really hard is that I don't want to believe—be one of those people that people believe—I've read Vitamin D, and therefore I'm a doctor after that. I would never try to diagnose myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm not sure. I would never try to diagnose myself for something that I haven't had five or six times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs). </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the tonsil infection that I—I—I used to get every year, I was pretty good at figuring it out, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:40:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, I'm not one of those people that believes I can—I'll go in the doctor and say, "Oh, I have this rare disease that I saw on the Internet." Yeah. But it's just—it's t just really like if it—I need to feel control over my life and it gets—and it's—you're right. It is because so much of my life is completely powerless. But I don't necessarily know if (pause) it's weird. It's like (pause) I don't know if I'll ever be able to be at terms with being completely powerless ever. I'm not saying I have to be that way for everything. I mean, I—I actually want to change for so many things. But I think that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I certainly seen you've become more comfortable with your powerlessness over certain kinds of bad feelings like frustration, or, you know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still a little celluloid along that one road (laughs). But yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Yeah, you know, it has a little—you know, you speak more easily about -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —things that are upsetting, or you feel bad without kind of paraphrasing them positively or feeling bad about yourself or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hate to change the subject, like, I don't think there's none of that, but it seems to me that there's less and you are more at ease with the subject, "Ok, that' the way it is."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "That's how I feel," -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "That's the way it happens, so" -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well like—and the powerlessness that I -am I running close to the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to (inaudible) for the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Even the powerlessness of, like, you know, I was talking about my job like this, which was like big changes -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —once I realized that I can—the—the asshole that I used to be and work the system -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:41:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I was like—I got reprimanded quickly to—just to say it was for having a personal conversation on the clock when I should have punch out first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I was disgusted. I wasn't mad at first at who was having a conversation with me. I knew this was pushed down from much higher up than this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like now whenever I am punching out late for something that seems illegitimate, know I put extensive notes in the time clock—they've got to be sick of this—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I have been to recently killing them with over information, and that makes me feel powerful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really feel like I'm hurting them or anything like that, but at least I'm documenting that what sounds like I'm talking to somebody about something on eBay is actually like me talking about mobile payment systems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, the new aisles. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Work-related.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it may not be obvious, but I don't want to have this—to back-pedal and scramble to—in the moment to do it. So now I'm just typing it up in my time card and it—it's actually helped me immensely. I don't know if anyone reads them or not, but if I ever get called into the office because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: —of the six minutes that I had of personal conversation every day, I can know say, "Pull out my time card and ok, now you can see that it was a personal conversation." So then—ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then we have a (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday morning, yes. And if not, do you think you'll be able to let me know by mid-afternoon so I can come for the appointment by that time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Hopefully, we will get back home before it rains.</p>

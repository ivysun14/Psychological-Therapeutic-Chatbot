<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: Been very long?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No.

</p><p>PATIENT: How long was that? Four days?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Two.

</p><p>PATIENT: Two days?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was back before I expected.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) See I haven't had any new thoughts, really, since I was here before. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it all the same for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I can't think of anything. Yeah, I can think of things in my relationships to the neighbors and, but not with Jim and I, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like some of the things (inaudible) they're open-ended in things to explore that (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you kind of have to experiment. I think that two of us have to experiment, you know, even before I can even talk about. You say, like, "This isn't even going to work at all," or - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But do you have said experimented? (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. And so that's - well, before we have. [2:15]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying (inaudible) what you talk about in here is the depending upon the kind of things that you and Jim do together?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's like if there's any hope at all, you know? I just don't know what - it seems to me like we've covered everything. You know, like why I don't like sex. I don't - you know - like every reason that it could possibly be, I've already thought of. And I don't know what to do about it now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Given that you know all the reasons, that doesn't make you dislike it less. (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, and there are - there's enough reasons for me to feel like that's why I don't care for it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, like they don't really explain it anyway.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't know-maybe I do like it underneath it all. You know, it keeps coming back to this climaxing - that I think I would enjoy intercourse if I could climax. And that seems to be-you know - [3:49]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) why you don't like sex (inaudible) if you climaxed you would like it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I would. But I don't know the reason that I can't climax. That's what I would like to know. Maybe it's because - (inaudible) don't like it (inaudible) I really don't want to experiment every time we get into bed. Now, you see, I get really tired of doing this thing and, you know - and everybody is hoping - not everybody, but it's just, you know - hoping that I'm going to climax and it's - it's really is, you know, like an big amount pressure on me. Like you've got to produce, and it does kind of bug me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're sort of getting fed up with all the experimenting and the concern that goes into the experiment. [5:38]

</p><p>PATIENT: It just seems like it's really built up, and it's such a simple act. I just have never, ever been able to practice anything-you know, the piano on up. I just don't have any (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I'm not quite sure - 

</p><p>PATIENT: So I don't know - like - that's why I don't like sex. I don't want to practice, you know? Like I always want to do things right the first time, and -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you want to have a climax and that's all.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all. I don't want to lay around practicing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Laying around (inaudible) really turns you off.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like work then. And I don't like to work-unless it's something I want to do-then I will. [6:48]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you don't want (inaudible) because if you're saying you like to be - in some way you like to be - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Let's say if it's something I enjoy doing, even if it's work, I'll do it. But then I guess it's not work if you enjoy doing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're saying you don't enjoy it very much. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't enjoy it. But then I - you know, a couple of months ago, I said I didn't even enjoy sewing, you know. And now I'm just thrilled about it. So maybe - [7:27]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So maybe (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. But you know what happened was I learned how to sew. Like I feel like if I'd learn how to have intercourse, you know, then it's - I don't feel like there's no hope for me, it's just taking an (inaudible). I know it's blocked (ph). [7:56]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well what kind of a (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I wonder (inaudible). There should be, you know, like a course or something - someone that shows you how they do it. But it's getting in there and doing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) having the whole thing (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: That's (inaudible) quite right. I don't, you know (inaudible). But then again, you know, like there are a lot of people that don't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A lot of people (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. And like they really don't know how-they really don't enjoy it. You know, I feel - I am so much happier when I am busy. I mean, so busy that I really don't have time to (inaudible) [9:31]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I think there's so many things that you can find fault with when you're sitting around, you know, looking for something to do. Well, like there's always something to do - but something interesting-something that you enjoy doing. Well, like, this last week I really - I had to make my daughter dresses because she had none. I was expecting my mother-in-law to (inaudible). [10:24]

</p><p>And I had to run out and buy all this material and sit down and sew, you know - all of it. And I did not - I really didn't have time to do it all. But I was really - I was just in seventh heaven, you know? Because I thought you know, like I had accomplished something, and I couldn't have cared less what the girls were doing. I didn't feel left out or moody or anything. Like when I'm just (inaudible) you know, would be the housework, but I really had something (inaudible) for me. [11:03]

</p><p>And then I got you know like complaints from my family - just how the dining room is a mess, "get your sewing things out of here - "

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you went (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I did. I think that somebody should have said, "Gee, these are nice dresses. You really did a good job."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And all they noticed was the (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, they noticed they were nice dresses after I said, "I think somebody should say, 'These are nice dresses. You did a real good job.'" (inaudible). The girls didn't care, you know - really. (inaudible) [11:48]

</p><p>But it's really - it's just amazing how - this is not really (inaudible), but to me it is, because I've never been really involved in anything, except like (inaudible). But anything that I have really produced some finished product that was really neat-and I really felt good about it. [12:20]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you felt really sort of proud, and then Jim came along and he noticed it. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, he gets really tired of me going overboard with different things. But I didn't feel guilty about it that time, because I had to give a (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) But are you saying that he looked at this and said, "Well, here she goes again. One more - "?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then I kind of had to straighten him out a little bit, too - you know? I said, "Look, (inaudible) I'll go out and buy the kids some dresses." Anyway, he settled right down and watched his TV. You know, like that's the way he is. I mean, I (inaudible) complain about him because - but I was just so happy. I was just (inaudible). Because I felt myself kind of clicking back into the old those ladies are very close, you know? They both live on the first floor. And I'm not in, you know-because I'm on the third floor and I have to come down. [13:44]

</p><p>And it really - it's really something when you live up. You know, I heard that on TV last night. And I said, I know what the - you know, like the high-rises they're making the people live in? I know what that's like, you know? You're not living next to Mother Earth. And it is so completely different.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're sort of isolated up there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am. Because like I always have to come down because that, you know, it lower (inaudible). And why go upstairs?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like why make that effort? You're not going to have to (inaudible). [14:30]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's for the person who lives across the hall from me, you know? Like she (inaudible) go down and have to find (inaudible). And it really is. It's just like being in a little (inaudible). But I really think I've been learning so many things this summer-not only about myself, but like everybody that's in - . The slum-dwellers that they put in those things-I know how they must feel. Like they probably would rather go back to their shacks on the ground than be stuck up in the air.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you must really hate it up there.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't really hate it; it would be much nicer to be on the first floor.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [15:33]

</p><p>PATIENT: The next time we move, though, we're moving out of New York. It's nice up there. (inaudible) I feel kind of silly because,, you know, like people have studied this and everybody knows it's (inaudible) that I feel like I'm really living in an experiment. I figured that out-so, I'm just so clever this year-I believe it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You make it sound like you feel like you're sort of - like you feel like someone who's independently discovered the wheel.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There are secrets (ph) about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Everybody else (inaudible) they have already heard. I mean there was - it happened to be on TV last night. And it just so happens I - Jim and I had been talking about it earlier. He decided that was my problem-I felt isolated. But I feel better when I'm here. Like last night I felt like I was being ostracized, you know, from the people downstairs, and I didn't - it just doesn't (inaudible) here this afternoon, you know? And I even know all the reasons. And I don't think it's because I have bad breath or anything like that. 

</p><p>It's - they baby-sit, you know? One works and the other one baby-sits for the child - and they're on the same floor and it's handier to run it in and out and you know - instead of come upstairs and borrow when they - . And I do the same thing. But it kind of - you know-I'd like to be included in whatever they're doing, I guess-if I have nothing else to do. [18:06]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you're going to understand how come you're not included, and it has very little to do with you, really (inaudible). But in spite of all of that-in spite of the fact that you know that it's not necessarily (ph) about you - it still might be nice to be a part of that community.

</p><p>PATIENT: And also, like I'm sure that if I were the witty, interesting kind of person that they maybe would come upstairs.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you were extraordinary.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then, you know, when you're just -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ordinary?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not worth the effort. I'm not going to have anything clever to talk about. [18:57]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you might not (inaudible) and you're hardly (inaudible) sexually (ph) sociable and you're (inaudible) person.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but there aren't very many of those, anyway. Just [wearing shoes] (ph), and I think that a lot of times - I do anyway - I just get tired of the people that are so clever and so witty-but you never know them. You know? Everything you say they give you back some funny line. And it is entertaining, but I want close friends. And I feel like it's really hard in a city to have close friends-unless they live across the hall. Because you have - it's really, there again, it's a lot of work. Maybe it's just - maybe it's not (inaudible) should be upset (ph). [20:08]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like whichever it is, it doesn't so much have to do with you. It has to do with -

</p><p>PATIENT: The environment, actually.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Stuff that's really out of your control-where you happen to be, or -

</p><p>PATIENT: Part of it is and part of it isn't. Because we could initiate friendship. But it is an effort. And I guess if you want it bad enough-if you want to be with people, then you invite them, you know, for something that's not expensive. You know, like we have a little money problem. Then you don't invite them to go with you to eat. Like so many of these kids that are in our set, so to speak, are going out to movies and to the theater and out to eat-and unbelievable, you know. We go out to dinner every six months. And that's a big deal. 

</p><p>But you - like I would like to have goals (ph). You don't know what I'm talking about, because I was thinking it instead of saying it. I was thinking that what we do with our money is like we take (inaudible) and we took the kids to the circus - we had some money. We spent all day at the circus. And then we did something with them Saturday. And then Sunday, we took them to the movies. And you know, like other people would hire a babysitter and go eat, or go to the theater. And I'd like to take the children places, but I would also like to be able to go out. And we can't do both, and so it's all for the kids. Well, that's just where we (ph)- [22:17]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's (inaudible) like in the crunch of finances, like you wind up doing things with the children, rather than going -

</p><p>PATIENT: And I won't begrudge them that. As a matter of fact, I feel kind of sorry for the other people's children. And them some of them don't have them and they don't have to worry about them. But I don't think that they could seem overly anything to the girls, but not to me. You know, like we've taken them more places that they want to go. Because I like to go to the circus. And I wanted to see the (inaudible), whether we took the kids, or not. You know? [23:10]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there's a way - I thought though-there's a way in which the kids are really too much with you.

</p><p>PATIENT: They are. But it seems like that was going to be our final playing. I'm not going to initiate them going to - well, let's face it, they're may never be another child's movie. And you can only go to the circus so many times. And so that was sort of our playing before school started. But - and I am. And I am more now that they're in school, if you can believe it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You are more what?

</p><p>PATIENT: With them. I mean, doing things for them-I am driving, or picking someone up at 9:00, 11:00, 1:00, and 3:00. I am in the car all day long because of kids. Unbelievable. But then they're - like, it's also unbelievable how well socialized they are. When you think of Jim and I as children, it's just scary to think anybody could do that. I mean, they're - my children compared to the other kids are just, you know, average kids. But when you compare them to their parents, they're so much better off-it's amazing. And I don't really feel like - I don't feel like I'm living my life for them as much as I used to. I mean, I still am - you know, like doing the same things and running the same, but then it's going to be over shortly, too. [25:16]

</p><p>My daughter went off to kindergarten and she'll never be the same little girl. Now it will be - you know, the teacher is going to be her authority. Sit on mother (ph), the teacher is always right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible) pleased with how they've turned out. That's what's considered you guys (ph). And also you really shouldn't feel grudging of the time you've given, because they're never going to be that age again. Pretty soon, they'll be more or less on their own.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean like you raise them to be independent, but it's kind of hard to let them go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible) It feels like a loss.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does-definitely. Well I think that you just sort of have to choose between two social lives, you know? (inaudible) children and adults. You know? With adults. And if there isn't enough money to go around, like we're going to have to choose. And I think, you know, for us, we made the decision for the children. And other people wouldn't do that. That's their bag. It would be nice to have adult and times with your children; but like even time-even if you had the money you don't necessarily have the time, if you're working and going to school and everything. I'm really quite pleased with our - you know, like the things we've been doing and with our lives. You know, it's (inaudible). [27:29] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what you said makes it sound like it's different. That's it's different to you (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think, you know, like we have had children too close like we did. But I really do feel tied then. Like if I had one child, and then when that one was in school, have another. This is - you'd feel differently about the whole thing. So we didn't - and I don't - you know-and I think sort of accepting that well, we did have them close, and so we're going to have to make the best of it. You know, without gypping the children.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) It sort of sounds like you're feeling like, well the situation with (inaudible), and given that you're in the middle of it, like you've really got to make the best of it-and part of making the best of it is not venting on the children.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I don't know-one thing is (inaudible) sacrifice. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, it's not really a sacrifice, though. He was like I said everything we did this weekend was something - I think that Jim probably enjoyed this weekend, and I was having a great time sitting (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I thought that you were saying that the sacrifice part wasn't going to the circus because you like circuses; but the sacrifice part was taking them. Like better you and Jim should have gone to the circus alone. [29:17]

</p><p>PATIENT: And that would have been ideal, you know, if we would have had time when we - not time, but even a little ingenuity to have done some of these things - not even going-yeah, like going to the circus, or walking in the park or doing anything by ourselves if we had had done anything before we had children. But we just like - we just lived together, and there was never any money for anything. You know? A movie or anything. But we didn't - well, there wasn't a circus in our town-one of the (inaudible), but you know? Going to the beach or - can you think of anything cheap? I'll bet you can't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Star-watching.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Anything. But, I mean, that's one thing. Or a picnic or -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you couldn't think of those.

</p><p>PATIENT: We didn't do anything. We are the type of people that would love to go if somebody would say, "Would you like to go?" I think that's the point (ph). I mean, if somebody initiated -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) [30:49]

</p><p>PATIENT: I always have to fight. I still have to fight with Jim and say, "We are going to a picnic," or "We are going here." Unless he thinks of it and decides it's a good idea, then there's always - if he's spending the money, then there's enough. And if I - it's funny how that works. And if I think of it, then there's not enough money. But I think like I would never argue that there isn't enough money to just - you know, going some place. And it's like it has to work that way with us, or we'd be - I think we'd have to (inaudible) doing the things that would cost money. 

</p><p>I mean, I wouldn't go on a picnic, say. Well, the last time I wanted to go on a picnic, I invited friends along, and he had a fit-because there wasn't enough time. You know? If you go with people, you can't eat and come back. And it's - but then he's like that, and he's always been like that even before we had children. I mean, like that didn't change him any. [32:14]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were saying a lot of things; and I'm not clear on all of them. One thing you were saying was coming up a lot (inaudible) [doing and you], (ph) and I have to stick a stick of dynamite under this guy to get him to go. Because it's always "we don't have enough money," or like "don't want to go." He's sort of drab that way. It's a thought I wanted to check out what you think (inaudible).[32:53]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, he is kind of a drab person. But then again, he surprises me-wants to go to Janet's (ph). We may never go if I don't go get the tickets and hire the babysitter or, you know. But he does want to go. And like, you know, we went to a lot of parties last winter, and I said, "We're going to have a duplicate party Friday night." And he starts in. "What are we going to do for money? What are we - ?" You know, all of these things. And I said, "I don't know, but we're going to have a duplicate party." You know? And it's sort of like you're talking to a small child. "We are going to have it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really have to lay down the law to him to get him to -

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, every once in a while, you do-or else he would - and he freely admits that would just as soon stay home and watches TV, and that's all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like giving (inaudible) he can say anything. Well, you weren't mad.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think he needs to go out, though. Because when I used to work, I was happy to stay at home. Because like, you aren't there very often. [34:26] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So for him, being home is some sort of different experience than it is for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's relaxing for him because he is around people all day. And I'm not. But I think like we should go anyway. Whether he (inaudible) and he can relax six days and go on Saturday.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you really need it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do. Even if I don't want to go, I need it. Because I have a good time. I mean, I could go to a dogfight and have a real good time. Getting out. I don't know-maybe I feel guilty about wanting to stay home. You know? [35:12]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm not sure what you mean.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you know, like I sit there and say, "We have got to go someplace." You know, and I'm tired and I - you know, a lot of nights, I'd just as soon stay home and watch TV, but I feel like I should.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Should-because you're going to be stagnated if you don't? I don't know what you mean.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That it's nice to have a new experience every once in a while. That's kind of the - you know, to think about or to plan for. I can't come tomorrow. I have a duplicate.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What is a duplicate?

</p><p>PATIENT: Duplicate bridge. Do you play bridge?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Everybody sits east and west, and every table plays the same hand and everybody north and south plays the hand, and at the end of the evening, you figure out who played it the best-who bid it the highest and made the most (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're not playing against north and south, but you're playing (inaudible)? [36:46]

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's really much more challenging. I mean, I like it because I'm like the best bridge player in our group. I love to play duplicate. And - yeah, everybody likes it if they are good at something. "Oh, that's my bag."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it really feels good to be on top.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes it does, occasionally. Well, you know what feels better than like being on top, is having people come to you from all of these tables to ask you what they should bid and what they should do. That makes you feel good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There you sit back the expert, sought out by others.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And it even delights me (ph). Some of the men, they spit out these rules all the time, you know-for anything you would do. Like - well, you don't know how to play bridge. It's anything you would want to bid or do, they have a rule for. And they're down there at the bottom every time we play.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like they're smart alecks-that's really all they are is smart alecks. Because when the chips are cashed in, or whatever -

</p><p>PATIENT: They're not on top. And I had another friend who said - she would always sit down and say, "I just had fantastic luck at cards." You know? And I was like, "You don't have luck at bridge in duplicates, because everybody that sits the same way you are is playing the same hand, and that's not - I mean, depending on who you'd be playing against-somebody that doesn't know how to lead-then you're (inaudible). But we're all pretty (inaudible). [38:38]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's not luck. It has to do with some ability -

</p><p>PATIENT: It has to do with - right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that feels good because you're skillful at something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it does. Right. And I guess I like to beat Jim. It just thrills me to no end. I'm happy if he beats everybody else-if he's just under me. (chuckles) Which has happened quite a few times.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How come?

</p><p>PATIENT: How come?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because he does everything else better. [39:14]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ah. So this is your area of competence (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: So this is one thing-yeah. And if I don't have the bridge books (inaudible) he's going to be better than I am in bridge. He will read a bridge book and he will know the rules; but he will also know how to apply them. Which I think is why some of these guys maybe aren't very good bridge players. But if you're playing against somebody that doesn't know the same rules you are, there's no sense in you -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it doesn't get - it's sort of like a different game they're playing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) what you were saying was, "they know the rules, but you know your cards."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But they don't - they lack common sense. But then I think - I don't know if this is true of all men - but they are very, very confident. And I bid and play (inaudible) - and they're always trying to make you have to pick. But they're not supposed to in bridge. If you can bid and make your contract, that's all you're supposed to get. And if you see that you're supposed to make it, then you make it. And they're always playing for the [egg can] (ph) and they go down. I mean, there are two of them I'm thinking of that do it this way. [40:32]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like they kind of come on-I don't know if you can do that in bridge or not-but they sort of come on like Errol Flynn - sort of swashbuckling without the understanding and (inaudible) good on it. You can't go along playing a steady, intelligent game with none of that show off (ph) (inaudible). And you wind up with that quietness (ph) on top.

</p><p>PATIENT: But even like - there was one fellow who was just not a very good bridge player. And like, he'll say, "I'm not a very good bridge player." And I was so pleased to see him - his points were up there-above the two that know all the rules. I mean, it just - it made me feel so good that he was quiet about it, you know? And he didn't - the other - the two fellows want people to think that they're really good, you know? And they'll tell you about it-anything you want to know they'll tell you. And I sit and ask, you know? I mean, I'll play that game, too-answer the questions and look up to them-but I always beat them. [41:50]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you feel (inaudible) to them fitting in (ph) spouting forth all those rules then you're resenting them (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I just - I don't even use their rules. I had a bridge teacher once that said that all you're supposed to do is play common sense. And I think that they really don't know that yet-and maybe someday that they'll learn.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there's a fight (ph) (inaudible) getting incongruous (ph) - the paradox seems to me that - I get the picture of you sitting in a group wide-eyed, taking all these rules for them; when at the same time, thinking (inaudible), "Well, someday they'll get to the point where I am, where they can rely on common sense and not have to show off with all those fancy rules."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I don't even think they think they're showing off. I think it's just a matter of masculine pride. [42:48]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But what I'm getting at is that there's a way in which you must - I don't know whether you do that then, but talking about it now anyway - there's a way in which you could have been (inaudible) and then like you ask them - I don't know. I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't even care if it's me that - you know - I would have been just as happy for (inaudible) who doesn't know how to play bridge to win. You know? Just felt that he could - I just hate it so much. And I don't even know if they're showing off, really. It just seems to me that they just know these rules, but they don't ever apply them. So what's the sense of knowing the rules if all you're going to do is talk about them? And then we play with people who don't want to learn anything new. 

</p><p>And they say, "Oh well, what do you want to learn these for?" "Well, because I would like to someday have my Master's in bridge." You can get your Master's in whatever you want, I guess-mine is bridge. And it's a great - it really is a nice - you know, like it saved my life in a number of towns. Because you're always looking for somebody that knows how to play bridge. [44:26]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And because it gets you out meeting people?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It really - it's a great social (inaudible) something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds as if it (inaudible) like it must be a great instigator, too-like it gets you out looking for people to - it makes you -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, that's about my first question to anybody I meet. You know, like I don't even care what kind of personality they are if they hold their cards in a warm body. And, you know-competent. I don't care because I was a little loser when I first started, but I hate to play with them now-unless it's my idea.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by "unless it's your idea"? Like you ask them instead of - 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I hate people that - and I've played with, you know, a number of them that sit down and think they really know how to play bridge. And you find out after the first bid that they've only played a couple of times before. You know, like there's no shame in saying, "I don't know how to play bridge." And say it, you know-and surprise me with your skill, or something. But don't let on like you're good, and then blow it. I guess I like modest people. [46:05]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, on the other side (inaudible) seriously (ph) braggers.

</p><p>PATIENT: But that's not only in bridge. But it's especially nice to know who you're playing with in bridge. Well, like if the people don't know how to play, it's nice for me to know that they don't know how to play, so that I'm not bidding sky high thinking that they have - you know, because every bid tells you the points. I bid, and your response tells me how many points you have. And if they're just bidding up, then I'm low. [47:01]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Out on a limb?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're really in trouble if you're taking them for ten points and they've got six. I mean, that doesn't see like much, but it is. You know, if their man is going to see you (ph). I'll tell you all of that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But are you talking about not - about your partner that - ? Yeah. So I guess, you sound like it's especially important to know if your partner - because if he's an empty bragger-because if he is, then you're really in trouble.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's why I like people to play. I've only played twice. [47:40]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you couldn't play with Don.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because he's - you don't - you play conservatively with Don-and I generally do. But when you see that he's got all the points in the deck, you have to bid them. But with Don, I'm just a little more cautious because I know he doesn't know how to play. But he tries. He sitting there trying. And he's not afraid to ask a woman and the rest of the fellows-[not to brag] (ph), but the majority of them wouldn't think of asking a woman. They'll just, you know, "I was born with card sense (ph) and go right in." You know, take you down five tricks, or something. But it's real different playing with men and women. [48:41]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sound like the men at least got in a subservient to (inaudible) before they look up to you

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I think that they're just - really they're stupid. They are really stupid. And I admire a man who does not know and will ask. Like Don will and my husband will, but that's about it. The rest of them go in, you know-just jump in with both feet and don't know what they're doing. And the women will always get up and ask somebody, even if the person they're asking doesn't know any more than - you know, two heads are better than one. And they'll ask somebody at a different table. Although you can't do that at duplicates.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the point is that women who have common sense when they're one down to (inaudible) to ask somebody.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They don't know the answer, but they try and find out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the men kind of come bulling (ph) in. And if they don't know anything, they'll be darned if they're going to ask. They just wind up making a real (inaudible) fools of themselves, as always. [50:20]

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's funny-they don't even know. I don't think it would occur to them. Maybe they go home and ask their wives after it's happened what they should have done. But I don't think it occurs to them to read a book or anything like - I mean, these are all students-but I think somehow they feel like bridge is beneath them. And they wouldn't waste time reading a book or asking their wife, you know, what does she know. She just knows how to do the dishes. And yet they're all great on women's lib, you know? "Get the woman out working. Let her do her thing." But I still don't think they respect them. And I think like Jim even does more than these guys that are always talking about everything for the women. And I think they're really hypocrites. [51:25]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And yet (inaudible) they talk great game, but when you see them close up and they're interacting in groups (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I feel that with so many people. And it's really disgusting to me that so many people are hypocrites. You know, like out of our set, there are like three couples that are, you know, kind of on an even keel and aren't too much either way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean the male [dominate the female only] (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They're just nice, ordinary, not-putting-on-a-show people. Yeah, I guess that's - is that a good number? Depends on how many I know, right?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like to you that - that you 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I sometimes wonder if you don't have to be a little something to be working on your Ph.D.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's abnormal for a lady (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Can really have a bee in your bonnet, or you'd be satisfied, or something. I mean the guys I know that are working on their Ph.D. are all a little lopsided. Well not all, I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking about being driven? Or what -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, something. And it kind of makes me wonder if I want Jim to go to therapy until after he has his Ph.D., he might never go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because he'll never get his Ph.D.?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because he'll always sort of - he'll always be possessed by the desire of getting that Ph.D., right? So he better not wait. [53:41]

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I said he shouldn't go to therapy until after he gets his Ph.D. Otherwise, he may not want to - he may not want to (inaudible) -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I was on the other side of that. I understand it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess maybe if - maybe if he doesn't want to go, it would be all right. You know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what I thought you were saying. You would prefer that he not be so incredibly possessed and get therapy and not his Ph.D.

</p><p>PATIENT: It won't make any difference either way-except that we're here to get our Ph.D. And I'd hate to let everybody down-not him anyway. I guess it really isn't everybody that is - .

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well at least - it sounds like at least for Jim and for other people, too, like there's a way that you two (ph) have taken (inaudible) marriage single-minded and - crazy is not the word, but - well, crazy [in terms of] (ph) to crowd you out.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I think what - I don't know about the other people, but with Jim, that he has to prove himself to himself. And he wants his Ph.D. for himself, not for anybody else. Maybe to go back to his old hometown one day, [because they said] (ph) he'd never amount to anything, you know? [55:19]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it hurts me when there's everybody - it would be interesting to find out why people were going on for their Ph.D.-you know like in teaching, when everybody knows there's no money in it. That's not the motivation.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What I'm not clear about is what's Jim's motivation for - what (inaudible) you. It sounds like it has some impact on you. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm rather proud of him-that he would want, you know. I mean, I never thought I'd be married to a Ph.D. When we got married, he didn't even have his Bachelor's, you know? And that was kind of a pleasant day for me (inaudible). But sometimes I get real sick of being in school and being without men (ph). But then, I didn't like it when he was working and then had to leave it. So-and I think maybe when we're closer to his Ph.D., I'll feel like it's a little more worth it. It's a long way off right now. I'm (inaudible), but he's going to be middle-aged before he does get his Ph.D. And so (inaudible) he's too old to get a job-or they won't be teaching that when he gets out. [57:27]

</p><p>If everybody could be in the same boat-I guess I do look to try to keep up with the Joneses - well, I don't try, but I'm envious of the people around us who have money. And like it's whether they're happy or not, you know-they still have money. I'll never be a hippie, I don't think.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You like to have money.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to have money.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I would, but I don't know-never having had any, whether -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to find out.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd like to find out whether there's anything in it or not-whether it really buys happiness.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But (inaudible) the side of it (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But besides that (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I think that it would be a much easier life if you had some money. If you got fed up with your kids, you could hire a babysitter and go out and enjoy yourself. You know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The other side of that is (inaudible) sometimes feeling sort of trapped not having money. [59:17] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, and I get really tired of it sometimes. Well, when I think about it, you know? There's some (inaudible) things I'd like to have-well, if there's one thing I'd like to have, one thing Jim would like to have, and one thing the girls would like to have. And if somebody would cough up a thousand dollars, we would be satisfied for a year-or until we decided something else to have. But these are - like they're very important things-a camera-a good camera we don't have. Our kids are going to grow up and we're not even going to have pictures of them. And we'd get a camera, or a ten dollar camera-and every time you want to use a flash bulb, the batteries are burned out, or something. And we must waste rolls and rolls of film and flash bulbs every time we try and take a picture. So we threw the thing away. 

</p><p>And then encyclopedia-my daughter asks me all of these questions-and I never have an answer. I mean, she doesn't ask you something really (inaudible). She's unbelievable sometimes. You know, when I think I didn't even ask my folks about where I came from. She did not care about that when I was a seed-she wanted to know how it got in there. And I was just floored. I must have been 20 before I figured that out - or, you know, it even occurred to me to ask-not that old. [1:01:00]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the point is like she is a really bright child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think so, you know. She's probably normal. But as long as she - you know, someday, she's not going to ask. "Mother never knows."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like needing money really in some ways is (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: An encyclopedia (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or even a camera for pictures of them-it's sort of like for them -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, like everything is - yeah-like every appliance is for your family. It's not only - like I'd like to have a dishwasher. So I wasn't always going to - I hate dishes. I have dirty dishwater sitting half the time because they sit (inaudible). And I think that's a health hazard-the way I do dishes. You know? So everything is necessary (ph). (inaudible) [1:02:04]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you doing that right now?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right now?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: You didn't think I'd know (ph). I know I'm not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You like comfort (ph). Well, I don't know. I wondered if-am I just taking what you're saying too seriously though-but I thought you just said to me something like, "What I just said was sort of half true and half camouflaged."

</p><p>PATIENT: I did, yeah-Jim's mentioned that he want to get the girls an encyclopedia, and I know that I need one-when they're asking me the questions. I feel like a dishwasher is not first on our list. But nothing I ever want was on the list. And so this time, selfish or not, it's going to be on the list. [1:03:21]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're so consistent (ph) about that and it's sort of uncomfortable - you seem a little unclear (ph) about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: You mean Jim thinks we shouldn't buy a dishwasher? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no. You're [consistently like that or you are] (ph), not the encyclopedia, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And I thought, you know, on the one hand, you're emphatic about that, but on the other (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Whether it (inaudible), I feel like (inaudible) isn't getting an impression (inaudible) it's not going to be that bad. You see the price just went up (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. They don't (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: They don't. That's the first time - well, I mean they do, obviously. Twenty cents now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What was it before?

</p><p>PATIENT: Ten. And a cup.

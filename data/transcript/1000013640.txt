<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the sixth interview.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was wondering before: I sort of understood that I approach these with something on my mind that I need to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is like asking whether I expect you to have something prepared. No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am supposed to have something on my mind - not prepared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some kind of pressing issue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not even a pressing issue but just something already in mind. Some sort of direction to start off with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't think that is necessary. Like that is the kind of thing that can evolve, or you can find out what that is. You are talking not necessarily before you come in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I sort of...spend the day before sort of thinking about what I am going to talk about tomorrow and then I don't come up with anything and it is just strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you ought to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you aren't doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just maybe if I don't have something to talk about, then it is not going to be very beneficial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you won't get the help (inaudible 1:59).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Do I have to say something again?! (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckles.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got a letter from my sister today and it is sort of bothering me, making me feel guilty in several ways. She is my younger sister and I sort of feel guilty because I am thinking when we were both younger I sort of picked on her. I was unkind to her. She (inaudible 3:02). She gets attention a lot of the time and when she doesn't, she loses here temper. It just builds up and builds up and she gets migraine headaches and (inaudible 3:23) from tension. She is 14-years-old and (inaudible 3:29). She has sent home from school when she gets slightly nauseous. It is really bad. She is say about she gets these headaches and she said something about how she can never make Dad happy. It is like he is always putting some kind of pressure on her. I don't know, I sort of want to write back to her and tell her I know what she is talking about - about the pressure and everything like that - and you know, be cool about it and try not to let it bother you. It makes me feel like I am teaming up with her against my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are taking sides.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is right - I am taking sides, yeah. It seems like I am taking sides. And if I don't take sides I feel sort of bad about it because I think maybe part of her problem might stem from the fact that I picked on her when we were both younger. And I think sometimes that I was pretty mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel some kind of responsibility to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet acting on that; you are not sure it would be really right - what a son should do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it won't be what a son should do and I would feel guilty then. You know, taking sides with her against her father because I would be sort of telling her I am never minding her or paying attention to her. But he would give me a lot of baloney anyway! To do that, I suspect I would feel really bad about it but then if I don't, I sort of feel I should be doing something to help her since I picked on her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You owe her some kind of help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not only the fact that I owe her this because I picked on her but it is also that she is getting a lot of the things I think I got - and am still getting. I would like to try to help - but try to help her have an easier time of it. I sort of understand how uncomfortable it is. 0:06:20.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have gone through that but there is a lot of sympathy that you have for her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just feel the whole thing is definitely a strange situation that I don't feel exactly comfortable talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Neither of the two choices that are open to you seem really satisfactory. There is something wrong with either of them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, I suppose I am feeling good about this - this letter - because it convinces me that what I have been thinking about my father - that he has been making unreasonable demands on me - it sort of convinces me that that is true and I shouldn't worry so much about the pressures he is putting on me. In that sense, it is almost like...it is like good parcel and bad parcel talk: kind of like stuck in there together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are good things about having your views validated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet, how to act on it - that is the problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of know what I should do - I think I know what I will do - but I don't know how it is going to leave me feeling. I just kind sit back and write her a letter and tell her: "You better do what your father says." I don't think that is the solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really cannot just let it go as if you didn't agree with it; as if you can see it as normal. But there is some calculated thing: are you going to feel guilty about doing that, without telling her your position after you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It could also be that I would feel that maybe I am using her to get back at him. "It is all (inaudible 9:05): dad is full of it." In a way, it could be interpreted as a way of being getting back at my father. 0:09:16.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By whom?</p>

<p>PATIENT: By taking his daughter away; you know, setting his daughter against him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And who interpreted that way? Or who could interpret it that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, My parents probably because I am (inaudible 9:31) my sister. That sort of thing: they could interpret it that way. That might be present in my motivations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you experience that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without me really being aware of it. Before I came here, It didn't seem that way to me but just thinking about it, it seemed to be a possible motivation, like driving me in the direction of (inaudible 10:12) my sister against my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I see that as a way that the action could be seen, theoretically speaking, but you are saying more than just it could be interpreted that way. You are not sure if that is not maybe what you really are doing or what your (inaudible 10:43) goal is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just might be an element of...it is not the only thing that is wanting me to do what I am doing. That is part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are clear that there are other kind of motives involved, but maybe you just think that revenge (inaudible 11:07) is in there. So that would make it difficult for you to take that step or it wouldn't seem right to take it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would add to my guilt. Not only am I going against my father but I am getting revenge in the process just adds to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are doing something even worse - that kind of feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of. I think that that is (inaudible 11:52) that is exactly why I brought it up - revenge - because in my thoughts, I hadn't been...not aware of it, but, you know, I am just allowing for - it seems like - a sub-conscious thing. 0:12:09.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, saying: "Well, it could be."</p>

<p>PATIENT: This may be the real reason and these other things are just sort of conscious thoughts, but the real motivation for my actions could be, you know, I could be angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't bother me much I guess. If it was sub-conscious, I guess I wouldn't have much control of it. That is sort of the way I am - there is not much I can do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is a way in which it does stop you: that consideration, maybe there is some kind of underlying motive that makes you pause or hesitate than just being (inaudible 13:05)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not that I am hesitating or anything like that; it is just that I am feeling sorry about doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what you are going to do but you are having doubts in the process of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are not even serious doubts. I don't think I am...I am not trying to stack up doubts to the point where I won't do it but there is just some uneasiness about what I am doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are having some misgivings with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think it gets a more and more significant thing, how I sort of feel about how I may have hurt my sister by teasing her. It is sort of sadistic, as a matter of fact, I would think. I would feel bad if I didn't try and (inaudible 14:50)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are saying you were kind of cruel to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and maybe this is one of her problems; she does have a nasty temper. I may be one of the causes of that and that temper causes a lot of friction between her and my father. 0:15:10.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of thinking that you may be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I may be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An indirect cause of the present problem. That does concern you - when you are kind of more central. And then you feel guilty about it and it makes you think that to have consideration you should do something for her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should try to help her any way she wants. I should try to give her advice and not tell her what to do. You know, if she is interested in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that a kind of thing you see as a duty that you have because of what went before, or is it a more positive wanting to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is a combination of both. I feel guilty having been a mean big brother to the only other kid in the family. I feel guilty for being mean big brother. I sort of want to make up for it. I also would just like to be this brother, even if I didn't have something to look out for - (inaudible 17:06). I think I have a lot of problems in relation to my father. I sort of blame my problems on him. I don't even remember whether I may have talked about it before. I am beginning to feel even strange constantly talking about myself. 0:18:36.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange in what kind of way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of talking about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of getting bored with keeping on someone else's (inaudible 18:50)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of bored. It is not like there isn't anything more to go over. I just seem to be stuck in the same place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't see yourself kind of getting anywhere with these things and reaching a different level?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, even with these things I have sort of dwelt on, they just seem to stay as they were. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you are experiencing a change in how you are seeing stuff (inaudible 19:46)</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are a couple of minor exceptions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it doesn't seem to be like: "Oh, this is just a bore and a drag?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: At this point it is sort of becoming that. It doesn't seem to be too alive, or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too alive in terms of what kind of thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is just like real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something a little bit distant and uninvolving by the (inaudible 20:47) 0:20:49.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 20:50) Sort of talk about things and just kind of not relevant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't touch the ongoing things in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am beginning to wonder what is ongoing in my life; what is even relevant in my life? It always seems kind of (inaudible 21:53) like the things I am doing are worthless and I am having trouble doing these worthless things. I come here and talk about (inaudible 22:03) and such things and it sort of gets into another stage of absurdity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like saying you don't care about anything you are doing. Basically, you talk about these things that you don't even care about. It is like building up all of these levels of distance and frosting. "So what about all of this? It is all on a foundation of nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for the most part. I am sort of tired of talking about things - negative things. I would like to talk about positive things but I don't know any. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that equivalent to saying there isn't anything good happening in your life now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much. I sometimes get this feeling that your mind starts to work in certain ways and it becomes more and more efficient working in those ways. Like someone who reads a lot gets to be a better and better reader without really being aware of it, I guess. Or when you start to work out how to typewrite. Before long, your mind knows the place of the keys and you don't even have to think about it. Like, my Mom used to sort of start going in...I would start to feel depressed and everything was negative, negative, negative; and gloom, gloom, gloom. It just keeps on wrapping up and getting bigger and bigger. It gets to the point where it is beyond your control. 0:24:21.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that that is just a habit that just runs off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is a habit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is a habit for you to feel bad and depressed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it (inaudible 24:30) to that if you are (inaudible 24:33) or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, by this time; sure. It has been going on for several years. Over these past several years, if I had have gone in this direction instead of going in another direction - you know, real docile - hard study would be a habit too. Now, I am just stuck in this habit of feeling mainly worthless and unhappy, and a big lack of motivation - it is just a way of habit. It just doesn't seem like talking about these negative things is going to get me out of the habit. I sort of feel like I should be doing something I like. I should be getting interested in something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should be, but you may not have the solution.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is better than what I do. I am just dwelling on the same old problems because dwelling on my problems is what got me into this habit in the first place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is like, just to talk about your problems is just one further instance of the very thing - it is like your basic problem now. It only keeps you on that path. There is no way in which it moves you out to a different kind of (inaudible 26:36).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might but I don't think it has. I don't know whether I am capable of understanding it to the degree that would be necessary to move to a different perspective. 0:27:03.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't sure you could get hold of what is going on for you - be able to deal with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess in the sense of understanding it but I sort of have to understand it in a more less personal way. It is hard I think for a person to look at themself and understand themself because the way they are influences how they feel. I think you still have to be attached.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you cannot really see yourself clearly - the way you want to? It doesn't seem like there is any way that you can get that distance on yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything you said but not that there is no way that that can happen with distance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are too involved and confused in the things that are happening to you? Like you are really in the middle of all that - all that tangle? So what is in the middle of that tangle? Are you feeling confused and kind of jumbled around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The sort of stuff that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of locked into it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am just talking about - from my viewpoint - about this mess, which seems to be part of the mess. everything I say has a sort of very negative side to it. That is not going to make it any easier for me. 0:30:05.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of keep on emphasizing the depressing aspect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of. It just doesn't seem that much different from what I did before. It seems to be...this seems to be the same sort of process as what got me into this - sort of introspection. The only difference is that before I just sat and talked and kept it almost in me, but now I am sitting here thinking it is similar stuff. It seems like the same stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a structural difference but it hasn't made any difference to you to be saying it out loud instead of keeping it to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not too much - no. There are a couple exceptions which are pretty much the same as if I had, you know, just been thinking about it. Except that this way I sort of keep it going for an hour as opposed to, you know, doing it for five minutes and then running off and listening to the radio or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is another structural difference - that it is a longer amount of time - but it sounds to me like that is another difference that hasn't really changed your experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, it could be helpful to sit and get really into it. You know, in five minutes you cannot get (inaudible 32:26). In an hour you could but so far, this structural difference hasn't had any effect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is kind of like you are staying at that five minute level - just for a longer amount of time. 0:33:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I started to think about it and I just say: "Nah, that is sort of off the subject." It is kind of annoying me and I am trying to get it out of my head but it is (inaudible 33:49). That is where I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how come you want to get it out of your head and go back to where you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 34:00) some sort of light (inaudible 34:05) or something like that. And I sort of fell of the track. Now, you know, I started going down deeper into it. It was getting a little complicated - a little hard - so I had to skip back up to something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is how it seems; it is not exactly a (inaudible 34:28) excuse to stay away from something complicated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, (Inaudible 34:44). I sort of forgot the way I was going and what we were talking about before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You somewhat have lost your direction, so right what is it? Right now: "Okay, what the hell, you might as well talk about it." The first thing that came into your mind because you have lost (inaudible 35:14) with everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it seems to (inaudible 35:22)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To what we were talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is kind of relevant. I think it is a feeling I have - an unrealistic feeling - that is an assumption that I operate under and it is sort of unrealistic. It gets me back to the bit about, I don't know, just (inaudible 36:35) the question. It gets me back into the same old negative...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That seems like there is a feeling and then there is your judgment that is bad or unrealistic and that slip kind of brings you down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it gets me back into the same old negative cycle, which is something that I am very much wrapped up in. You know, rejecting this unrealistic feeling - the sort of negative thing to do. But then folding to the unrealistic feeling kind of results in my being disappointed each day because I suppose I have this feeling that some day, something is going to happen. I am going to do something I like and I am going to get into it. And presto, I will be happy for the rest of my days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something is going to change everything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not one thing. I just sort of feel like there is a situation...there is some place in life that would make me happy; one particular set of situations; living in a certain place with certain people; doing certain things for a living; having a certain amount of money; and having a certain amount of free time. There is something perfect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some combination that is just going to get you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perfect, yeah. I sort of feel that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is just going to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I just hang on, it is going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are going to come up against that one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Slowly, things will start to fall into place. After they have all fallen into place, I mean, yeah. So rejecting that is kind of really negative. It is sort of saying: "Well, you are going to feeling like you are now for the rest of your life." But then, holding onto it is bad because every day, seeing these things not falling into place is disappointing. It is disappointing each day. 0:39:14.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every day it hasn't happened; is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible 39:19). Nothing has happened along that direction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are left waiting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are left waiting and wondering; maybe this is not real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And wondering maybe you shouldn't be hoping. Maybe nothing is going to change for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To acknowledge that is very negative. You are saying it is always going to be like it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The idea that things are going to say the same would mean to you that you would never be happy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that they are not going to get any better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And negative means you are probably saying that or really you are getting further down into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I cannot be (inaudible 40:37); I have a habit of being rejected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to give into that; you don't want to have to be pushed to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Really, it is unpleasant being unhappy but I don't want to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But every day when you look around you, and nothing in your life has changed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing has changed; it always seems to get more complicated, and more "ifs" and (inaudible 41:23)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is like saying nothing gets clear; nothing sure; definite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, nothing good is clear; I might see bad things clearly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can really experience pain sometimes and that is very definite. 0:42:08.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is very (inaudible 42:12) very much; they are very vague.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they are always (inaudible 42:18).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are vague as long as you can only imagine them; what they would be like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much, yeah. Now I just like...right now, I feel like I am hanging in mid air. I have said it and nothing has come of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So this is where we are and it is not pointing anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you are is in this unhappy groove that you have kind of laid out the boundaries of but it hasn't...nothing has moved for you on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking of...when we were talking about things like what is happening with me in therapy. This is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is an example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is another example: I just rolled along and almost have to cling to something. To me, it doesn't seem to (inaudible 43:49) anymore. And now...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't get, like, what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to say now or what to go onto and I just float around and (inaudible 44:01) comes up with another idea and we will start off again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that was saying you kind of perceive some idea and then you kind of (inaudible 44:10) and nothing further gets (inaudible 44:13) at all. You are just kind of like blank after that. Kind of: "Oh." And you don't particularly have any kind of reaction to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no reaction and nothing (inaudible 44:54). Nothing else: it is like going down the road and all of a sudden it ends - nowhere. You are still out, like...0:45:03.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are still in the middle of this huge field.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With nowhere to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it doesn't tell you whether to go left or go straight ahead down the road.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of sit there in the car and watch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Actually, what I do is sort of jump back to some other place - to some other road and drive off. There is no continuity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is no way to get to from one road to another, except by kind of backtracking up to this...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not even backtracking; it is just a (inaudible 45:42). I was stopped in the middle of the field and I will start off in the middle of three (inaudible 45:48) down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is no continuity; how do you feel about that? Is that like just being jolted around all of the time? Kind of ripped out of one thing and having to remove yourself out into another? Got to be getting somewhere - got to be driving on some road.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 46:18) so I cannot relate (inaudible 46:20). What does what I have just said mean to anything else? You know, a field by itself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you are getting a picture of all these places that you have been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. How do they relate to each other?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do they relate? You see, one answer one could give to that as well is: "So they are all related because I have been in them all." But that isn't...they mean something more than that, probably. That wouldn't be an answer for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at all - not at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? Why doesn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't tell you how...I don't know, it just doesn't seem tell me anything about how two things relate, just the fact that I have sort of explored each one of them a little. It doesn't tell me anything about the contents. It is a different sort of relation; it is not a (inaudible 48:04). I suppose you could say that. 0:48:04.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really meant - what I was asking for - was what do you mean by relations? That, I understand but that isn't what we are looking for. That isn't an answer to your question about how different things relate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is sort of like if you have a (inaudible 48:26) field that you have been in, like meadows or something; the same sort of thing. I want to relate them all together on the surface that they are on. Like if you set them all on a flat surface in one place. I want to relate them all on a surface. But this saying that you have been to most of them is like going above them, through the air or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't say what they are all grounded in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it doesn't tell you anything about how they link up together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They seem so abstract to you just to say (inaudible 49:18) - so insubstantial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it doesn't really specify anything or tell you anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the kind of thing you want to know would be what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like a whole framework of my feelings (inaudible 50:01).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some kind of way to order things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This way, everything is all kind of shuffled up together and everything - all those different things - that you count for the same; it doesn't really seem to you that they do all count for the same. You wanted to find a way of getting to structuring them that fits with that sense of (inaudible 50:36). There is no order to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still want to have the feeling that I am not missing something; that I can come up with a final answer. Like, an answer that is either going to right or wrong; yes or no - something like that. I want also to be sitting with a (inaudible 51:01). 0:51:03.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a feeling that something is missing? Is there something essentially you haven't gotten to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What if the things don't link up together in some sort of order and they don't seem to fall into classification? What if I don't know how to classify them just yet? And then it doesn't seem like I am being thorough: I could be overlooking things entirely, which is so (inaudible 51:59).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of things did you think you could overlook entirely? I guess something critical - like a critical piece?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a critical piece. Sometimes if you are doing a homework file or something like that, you could spend all sorts of time on it and not figure out how to do it and then come back to it later. And here it was, like it was so stupid, you went over it time and time again and you were completely unaware.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like all of a sudden you can have this little kind of shift on what...to see that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, all of a sudden you might see it but there is no way of knowing if you really missed something until you see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are in the middle of just not being able to get it in place. You don't know if it is ever going to fall into place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until it does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where you are in your life. Isn't that still in the middle of the problem? And not having any kind of surety at all that it is going to come out. Not knowing if you are missing some piece or if it is just a matter of time of shifting around afterwards, thinking that there is another way or whether there is anything you could do. 0:54:03.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really whether there is anything I can do or whether it just kind of happens. Or if there is something I can do, how do I go about it? How should I decide?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Decide what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether or not a given thing should be done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not having any measuring point to compare things to or to (inaudible 55:01) them against; or be able to size in relation to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have one but I don't think I could have one. I don't know exactly what you mean by measuring point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a criterion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I cannot take anybody else's word for it because they are not me. If I haven't tried some alternatives, I don't know which one is best. And If I haven't tried any of them, I won't know whether a given alternative will be bad or good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't have any way of predicting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have no way of feeling certain about what I do: feeling certain about my decisions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No way of knowing you have made the right choice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, whether these things are certain and feeling fairly confident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, whichever way you go on it, when you have made that choice and then you have to take a step to do it, it is like just going off into the dark.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like holding your breath and not knowing what is going to happen next?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then it might be like a jump back. It is a cliff and you jump off, you don't know what is going to happen when you jump off, but after it has happened, it is too late to do anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you keep imagining that sinking feeling: it is too nice (inaudible 56:59) 0:57:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it feels like that, or afraid of that possibility. I don't feel (inaudible 57:11) do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is a chance you might be wrong; there is a chance you (inaudible 57:16).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is more than there is just a chance: it is just that I have no idea even of the probability.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like saying there is a chance that it might be really big and you just don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A chance?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is a chance you may sink and that might be 90 per cent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it is (inaudible 58:06).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that not knowing leads you to what? Feeling what? Feeling what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not knowing how to...like just make decisions about what helps; or come to conclusions about myself; or an action or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you cannot make...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just debate it because any of this is not me. I don't understand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't understand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I am not sure of what the consequences are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, never being sure of what is going to happen next, it would be better to not move from where you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess it feels better. I don't look on it as a choice. You are hanging on to where you are because at least you can survive - well, you have survived here in the past. This, sort of, like it may continue if you don't make waves. 1:00:10.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know the place where you are, or you obviously don't know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It is like being in a small lighted room - like a door at each end - and it is dark out there. I like making those kind of analogies but I think they are accurate. Even if where you are is really empty, you have no idea about either door. You are really afraid to die, which could very well happen if you go out the wrong door - or could happen if you go out the wrong door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The room you are in is really small and deserted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't know anything at all about those doors?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 61:26) outside - nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean you don't have any reason to open them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but the first thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or do you have some notion of what might be there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With regard to stepping out, that is a (inaudible 61:58) informed decision. You know, if you step out one, you may never be able to get back to where you were. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might not even be able to get back to that very small, constrained place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it should turn out that things are now worse than they were, you probably couldn't get back to have another chance at the other door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it is going off a cliff. It is a possibility that you can never restore things to the way they were. In a way, it is like I am not taking responsibility for what I do. But in a way I think it is justified because I don't think I should be responsible for decisions that I have to make, or that I am not given any control over it. 1:03:17.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are being forced to go out one of those doors, so why should you be stuck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not exactly; I don't know (inaudible 63:36).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is a good way, don't you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the thing about not having to have responsibility and not having to be stuck with all this consequence.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 63:56) not having any responsibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think it is fair to have responsibility, or a choice that you have to make in the dark. Then there is this thing: well, what is responsibility?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is just the way the world holds you accountable for your actions and if you did something, well you missed your chance and then you suffer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being blamed and punished.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not being helped; not being helped when you are in a bad situation because you chose it - but you really didn't have any choice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You weren't allowed to make an informed decision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it was just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you are being told and you want to say then: "Well, I didn't put myself in this hole."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you didn't pick to put yourself in that hole, you just had to go one way or the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to day: "Well, why should I have to stay in that hole?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like how can you say it is my fault? Why cannot I have some (inaudible 65:49)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Why can't I go back?"...On Monday? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 1:06:19.6</p>

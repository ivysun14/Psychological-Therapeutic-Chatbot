<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're talking about he's got his ADHD which uh, he has sometimes racing thoughts or it's hard to focus or hard to concentrate.  He's also been taking a few other medicines here, some clonidine, Parafon Forte, Valium.  Complaining of not sleeping that well, waking up 5:00 in the morning to which he takes a Norco to try to help him sleep.  How many Norcos were you taking a day last week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Last week I was taking a handful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A handful, how big are your hands?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that big -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I was taking a few.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, well if you're down with 1 a day, that's good news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, now we can get you some like an Ambien CR or something to help you sleep through the night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that something you would recommend?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so that you take that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And um, then we give you something to help you focus during the day.  Now again these focus medicines, you were on that before.  You were on the Adderall 20 mg before, twice a day.  That can cause insomnia too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they help you stay focused.  If we give you the generic uh, Adderall you take that in the morning and like maybe at 12:00 noon and it should be out of your body by 10:00 to go to bed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so we'll do that.  Um, I'll give you the 10 mg not the 20 because I don't think you need that much.  How much you weight?  Let's hop on the scale and see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Can I talk during the recording?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure go ahead.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, I'm just curious.  If taking like the XR would be better for him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, why do you ask that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, because I take XR and it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 158?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 158, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh, the XR is just kind of keeps him more mellow it doesn't like you know, come at you so hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's pluses and minuses to it.  There's also something called Vyvanse to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right I've -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Heard of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You might have problems sleeping though [INAUDIBLE] as well am I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You have to take it early enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, that you just take 1 a day early in the mornings.  It's supposed to last all day. There's some Vyvanse which is even less like to be abuse; although it probably cost a little more.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh have you been pricing these?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I'm, I'm just saying with me no insurance everything's pricy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the Adderall is more affordable and so if that's an issue.  I agree with you the XR probably is a better choice medicine.  But is he able to get, will he do it.  Notice I can prescribe out a Mercedes Bends but if he can't afford a rental, you know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> As far as the Adderall to XR?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They have generic form now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It just came out, like three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Four weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know they're working on.  Uh, do you have prices on that, do you know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh, well with me, well I have insurance -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh you're right, never mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are pricey.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're right, when I, yeah never mind [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah because when generics first come out they're not necessarily that much cheaper.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, so I guess just stick with the generic that not time release because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's cheaper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why I said "Like give him 10 mg in the morning" -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "And 10 at noon."  They'll probably do the trick there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so 10 mg before noon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks you guys, I really do appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  How's, if you use it then it matters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, how did you know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because there's no other choice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure you have other choices but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really, those are both choices, those are pretty much choices that are -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No longer in my life any longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, right about that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So him taking a Norco, that isn't a bad idea, is that correct?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Instead of us trying to get off of opiates [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now do you feel that the Ambien will be strong enough to help him sleep at night and relax him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We hope so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do they have different dosages of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he's getting the full strength adult dose.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now the other thing too with sleep, how you're doing and stuff like that, or you know if you get up, you're up.  If you get up at 5:00 AM, you know the sun's up now.  Get up and drink a big glass of water and go run around the neighborhood two miles.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He likes to wake me up when [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm like go, lie back in bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's like I have to get up now, I'm up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess I just got to find a more healthy way to make myself sleep at, at a descent hour so, I can function the next day properly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All part of his, you need to put your anxieties aside.  Write them down, do what you've got to do then shut down your brain like you turn off your light.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How do you do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you write down what it is that's in your head.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You put it somewhere -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And just kind of leave it there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Rundown, a rundown.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're kind of taking it away from your head?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now it's somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you suggest us maybe working out at night or going for a walk?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know it's okay to exercise at night.  Just probably not right before bed, going for a walk is kind of nice -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some, some people get in to real stimulating conversations shortly before bed and then they go on and on and on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And part of it is yeah the, the some people have circadian night owls; which case get a night time job, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's, that's not a bad idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You wake up at noon, you know.  [LAUGHING].  Um, but sometimes you're talking because you have anxiety about the day and other times you're talking because you did do during the day what you needed to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I believe that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you're worried because it's like oh man it's 1:00 in the morning, I should be sleeping but I got all this stuff to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it helps to instead do it during the day.  Unfortunately there's no substitute for action.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know they can sit there and look at the weeds, they won't pull themselves -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We need to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know or hire someone that will stoop down and do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never had, well it's exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> See he'll have me up to like 3:00 in the morning getting his resume together and find a job and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's about time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When he wakes up in the morning like that kicking and screaming do you think that he should try to go back to bed or like you said he should get up and start his day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get up start the day and start stretching, moving stuff like that because a lot of your stuff you know, may just be some of the withdrawal aspects of things too.  So, you got the Adderall for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now the Ambien, does it tend to take a while to -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I've taken that before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kick in or does that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you tell him.  How does that work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does it matter what you ate before?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think that it was, I think it works well for the deeper sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But um, I know my dad.  You know when he was taking it though it, he did sometimes wake up after a couple of hours and he would take another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, what, what helps you sleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I take a 0.5 mg of Xanax every night and that puts me to sleep.  I don't know why but it does.  That works for me because I haven't taken any of those other, I don't know about a lot of those strong pills.  I've never taken anything like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Need to find stronger pills.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like I've never taken Norco [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No there are a lot of people that don't take any pills and they sleep every night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well I take Adderall and I take Xanax and that's it.  But I've never taken a Valium or a Norco, those are scary to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I couldn't, Vicodin makes me throw up, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah a lot of people that are allergic to it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I can't handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The other things you need to sort of train your brain and your body to create your own neural transmitters in your head rather than relying on pills from the external environment to do that for you.  Yes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my goal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pardon me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh I, well yeah, well yeah I do right here in front of me actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What works for you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From [NAME OTHER] the husband she's calling.  So she's in the hospital okay. Okay, well here you can come get it but I need to talk to uh, I'm thinking, just a second.  Uh, come in.  Let me just read over this for a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take your time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They probably want a copy of this.</p>

<b>NR</b>: Uh, I just need discharge paperwork, but they don't have that yet.  What I need is date.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay this is the admission thing.</p>

<b>NR</b>: Yeah, thank you.

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay thank you.</p>

<b>NR</b>: Um-hum.

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah there are plenty of people that don't take medicine for some psychiatric condition and are able to control themselves through tapping in to their bodies own neural transmitters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the goal eventually.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Weaning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, meaning that you have the power to control your behavioral response to stimuli in the environment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's a practice of a skill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nerves stimulates you to do those certain things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me give you an example of something that you'll understand.  Human beings have a innate instinctive desire, if you take something like a baseball and throw it at you real fast.  You want to get out of the way so you don't get hit.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you can train yourself to step right in front of the baseball, actually go chase it and catch it.  Okay, so you can choose to over come that fear.  Human beings have an innate fear of heights.  Yet you can train yourself so that you go to work everyday on top of the Sears Tower or whatever.  Uh, these ironworkers walk on little balance beams.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know 1000 feet above the ground.  So you can train yourself to interpret stimuli in a different way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can I ask you a quick question?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry to interrupt like, I see her sometimes shaking all the time.  Now is there a natural way maybe or a technique you would prescribe to her as far as maybe stimulating a part of her brain not to always get the shakes?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah we'll get to that in a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're paying people to fly airplanes for a living.  Plenty of people that ride on airplanes everyday for business, vacation, whatever, you know there are people that step on airplane.  They have a panic attack -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well that's a phobia so that's different, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well just that, it's the same airplane -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's what you think the airplane means.  In fact these people before they got on the airplane the thought of going somewhere on an airplane makes them start having panic attacks for weeks in advance.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not, they haven't even left the ground.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But what happens if you say airplane they think "Oh I'm going to die and crash."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They say "Well I'm going to be trapped in this mysterious tube or something like that."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So people view airplanes in different ways.  It's the same damn airplane but it's what you think the airplane means.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, some people say "Oh airplane, fun, relaxation, vacation, I get to sleep while I'm flying."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a way to tranquility.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not me, my ADD I fell like I'm locked in a box.  I want to get up and walk around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's not your ADD, that's not what you're understanding, it's your fear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that could be something else.  It could be anxiety or like you said a phobia.  It's a fear.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I'm not scared of flying.  I just don't like being stuck in a plane.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stuck, well -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you really stuck?  See that's your belief.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I could talk to you all day long -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You think it's, you think -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> This is his appointment, I don't want to take away from that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, [PATIENT NAME]'s appointment -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you think you are stuck, you think you're stuck.  No there's a door.  You could jump out if you want.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not if you're in the middle seat and you have two -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you did it would be a long way down -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, then don't, don't get the middle seat.  Get an isle seat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's what I do now.  I get the isle seat -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get the isle seat -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You get up and walk around and stuff like that.  Yeah, but a way to practice would be to put yourself in a tiny little chair up against the wall in your house and practice sitting there for an hour.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I would die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think you would.  But things you could train yourself to do it.  How about if you say I give you a $1000 if you sit still for an hour?  See now your brain is associating something different.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're thinking pleasure now with sitting there.  See we just screwed your brain up for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I would -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's wonderful to look at my apartment right [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe he does.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He freaks out, he freaks out.  He can not stand it but that's the only place he wants to be.  He does not want to be with anyone else.  But with me in my apartment but he can not stand it because he's claustrophobic and I don't know what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe get the balcony.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have a balcony.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's even more claustrophobic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go stand on it, really oh okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So I try to clean the place up and move some of the clutter but that doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the area is still the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it's what you want to look at and what you want to focus at.  See if we put you in like a closet and kept you in there for like an hour -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We're going to do that today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or a bathroom and then we let you out in to the apartment it'll seem big.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We try doing that tonight, I'm being -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you could do it, you know, the thing is you have to gradually -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If you look me away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go with it.  Like elevator, I mean some people start by showing pictures of the elevator and talking about it and gradually sitting there and watching the elevator go up and down, then sitting in the elevator while it's on the first floor with the door open.  Then going up to the second floor and getting off and then going to the third floor and then you know eventually working their way up.  You know so if you took a person and like physically tied them up screaming and yelling, kicking.  Put them in the elevator and made them go up and down for a couple of hours after about 90 minutes they're anxiety level would ware off.  They'd realize that even though I am tied up here I'm on this elevator, I'm really okay.  Your body can only hold that high level of anxiety for so long then it wares off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For instance -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you accommodate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was tied down per say, for the first 10 minutes it was the worst.  However, I got, I knew in my brain there was nothing I could do to get out and it was only going to take time to get out and just like you said "That high level of anxiety right away tends to go away through time."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you knuckles doing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know I'm, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm just, you know this is overwhelming for me.  But I'm trying to help him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then take it one piece at a time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And that's what I told him in the car.  I go one thing at a time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But her mind races, I can see her sitting there -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or take it there just slowly -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And understand the big picture.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, I, I could do that and I know how to do that.  But he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keep in mind what you associate to a certain thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's some kind of fear -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Blocking her from being normal, not being normal per say, what's normal.  But for, for you not to be racing, for you not to be shaking, for you not to be cracking your knuckles, and you've got to condition your mind to, to uh improve on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, perfects like learning to meditate you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She can take some courses in Yoga, meditation, things like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I want to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's huge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't want to go do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah that's like with you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know I keep telling myself, I've got to go do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just sign up and do it.  Yeah, you need action.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But he does keep bringing up all the things that he has to do and all the things that he has to get straightened out and I have to keep bringing him back and like let's focus on what we're going to do today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not even today, this hour we're going to go to the doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When we get home we're going to do this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I don't want to depend on you forever, you know I want to end up taking care of you and but I just need to be shown the way.  I, I choose -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to show you the way.  But don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, part of it is doing the action too.  It's like you know, I see a lot of people who are obese and they need to lose weight and a lot of them they want to get gastric bypass or stomach staple -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or something like that and the issue is if you want to lose weight you eat less and work out more, it's a simple formula -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you start losing pounds.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're giving up, they gave up already by getting in this state though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of times they say "Oh I follow my diet," well you, you really didn't because they, they followed the diet until they ate the whole chocolate cake at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like all day long they follow their diet and then at the end they freaked out and their stomach hurt and so they ate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you can relieve that pain in the stomach by drinking a whole bunch of water and eating Brussel sprouts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every morning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guarantee you're not going to gain a bunch of weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eventually you start feeling nausea and you don't want to eat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every morning she complains about what she eats.  How she has stomach pains or feeling upset in her stomach.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I have anxiety right now.  But I'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How do you know that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I know how to deal with it.  When I have anxiety I don't talk about it I, I do something about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what are you nervous about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Helping him right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's fear there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well what's the anxiety about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because there is a lot that we have to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah there are things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you just track it down, figure out how much time it's going to take.  What order you're going to do it in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I'm, I know it, I know that some of things he isn't capable of doing so I have to literally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, is he really incapable or he just hasn't done it yet?  You guys are both capable of learning to speak Japanese.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I, I've got to teach him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have to teach him because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could speak fluent Japanese.  I'm capable of that to, I don't speak fluent Japanese but we're all - </p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Capable of that, okay.  We are.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I agree with you but I guess at this point with him finding a job it's detrimental, like right now it needs to happen - </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I can't, I would almost in a sense rather do his resume and get his application submitted then trying to teach him how to do it and then do that because - </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're starting to sound like my wife.  She thinks it's just easier just to clean up after the kids rather than teach them how. </p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, certain things I do, I do believe that and I'm also trying, I work full-time.  On top of it all so I'm trying.  You know today's my day off, I have to get everything - </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're used to being the manager huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a nurturer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a manager.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I know I can handle it all I just need time and I don't have time with work.  So, I'm worried about him when I'm at work; because I think he's not doing everything he could be when I'm not there to help him. </p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if I truly don't know how to do those things then I, when you're at work how can you think that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you're going to screw it up that badly.  So, when it, what you can say is you know what if you do 10 push-ups every hour, huh, ten sit-ups every hour and you just did that if you didn't know what else to do.  Start out doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I could do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you still don't know what else to do, grab the dictionary, turn it to a random page.  Come to the first word you don't understand and write it down you start using it in a sentence all day.  Okay and every hour you do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that what you've been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much, like the last like six months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's been using big words lately I don't know where they come from.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well that's one way to learn.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm trying to learn and, and uh, at a pace that is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, sit down cross your legs and start breathing deeply, holding it in and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See that's that meditation thing.  That's what's going to calm the anxiety is the meditation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The quick breathing and those kind of patterns.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what we've got to start learning about as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm breathing right now.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Breathe deeply.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I like you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well thanks, I'm glad you do, I'm, I'm sure [PATIENT NAME] does, that's why I was going on with it.</p>

<p>[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Appreciate it all.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like all these things with [PATIENT NAME] he actually, doesn't that, how do you like, I don't know I would just be like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he's been there done that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's pretty simple stuff.  You just need to apply it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need to look at it in a simple way.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One day at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, people make their problem in to a big issue and then it becomes their issue and their life's focus.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's like you had a flat tire and you spend all day complaining about why you got a flat tire.  In stead of say "Well there's a nail in it why don't you just pull it out and patch it up and fill it with air" instead you start bitching about the board you ran over three miles back -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not going to get your tire changed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So a lot of people sit there and complain about the board they ran over.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because why it happened but you just need to take action on how to fix it.  That's why it don't, like you know don't look at your past that's going to make you feel how you feel about it.  But take action on to do things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and all these medicines -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They work because you allowed to play create the same neural transmitter that you would create if you did the same kind of behavior.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, then we say it again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Your mind can control the things that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> By giving a pill, I can directly put in to your brain the same little neural transmitter, hormone chemical messenger drug that your body makes on its own to key in to the receptor.  In other words you've got all these locks in your brain and on your gut, your heart, your muscles, you've got all these receptors.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, they're like catcher mitts, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Way before the right object come along -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some catch baseballs, some catch soccer balls, some catch footballs.  So it's got to be the right shape or just like you got locks and keys, okay.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not every key fits in every lock.  But like opiate locks are attracted to opiate keys. Okay and there's actually four different types of opiate keys, imagine that.  Okay and some keys when they lock in to this lock they also activate another lock at the same time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but anyhow, the point is that your brain naturally makes its own little keys or its own little balls and some neurotransmitters they go out and they find these little -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Receptors -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Remember when I was telling you like last week how I don't want this medication -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't feel like it's -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to smoke a joint because it's not making me high how I was before.  I don't want any of that because it's all, I believe that if there's something else that's, it's, it's more in the mind than anything.  It's something else like, my adrenaline and stuff like that are wanting to learn is taking president, president over that.  Does that make sense in a way?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, for example with adrenaline that's one of those neurotransmitters that you guys are probably aware of every time you have a panic attack, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, like if you're flying an airplane and all the sudden the engines cut out because you hit some ducks or something like that.  Now, it you're the passenger you're adrenaline might be beating faster or whatever or if you're the pilot might be beating faster.  But if you've trained for this before and you know "Well yeah, I can land this thing in the [DEIDENTIFIED]" you will just calmly land it in the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Been there, done that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it's like no big deal.  It's like "Wow, gee that's kind of fun."  Never did a belly up landing in a river before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's that the river that the gentlemen did that one in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you keep your whits about you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's how you perceive the circumstance.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it's like if some people you know have an easy time driving a car down the highway going you know faster -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then, you know, other people, they purposely avoid the highways.  They take side streets.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hey that bothers you I don't understand those people.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Shouldn't bother you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, well you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but what you attribute to something.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, some people enjoy exercise.  They enjoy physical exercise, other people [INAUDIBLE] it.  Right, it's what you think it means.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like I will clean but to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All what it means to you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Me it's like organizing my life -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> To you it's like a chore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Or to some people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In all essence you believe it's a tribute to OCD -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's not the case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, organizing then goes in to other things, you know about having control and order and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, blamed it all on OCD.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you can call it whatever you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See what I was saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, when something is taken to an extreme it could be considered OCD.  If you want everything so clean it becomes nonfunctioning, then maybe it is OCD.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, like no trash in your trash, no books on your desk, no shoes on the floor, you know no water in the sink.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, wow that's a bad [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like if you're the kind of person every time you wash your hands in the sink you dry the sink bowl out. That could be an extreme.  You could say well "Why are you doing that" and say "Well, I don't want the spots to form."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and say "What if the spots do form?"</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What will happen?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What will happen?  Well then they won't look good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now you're thinking about this constantly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if it doesn't look good.  Well then it will bother me, well why will it bother you?  
Well because it won't be arranged properly or -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be out of order.  So, what does it mean if it's out of order?  Does this mean your mom's going to beat you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know did that happen as a kid or what does it mean.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or does it mean there's disarray, I mean humans naturally like symmetrical things. But you can get to where it is an extreme.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like, like I come home from work and I can sit down and relax until I literally have like my checkbook balanced and my receipts organized where they go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I believe that -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have to have my room clean, I have to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Everything has to be in order.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's deeper than that you can't -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> There can't be dishes in the sink -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You just can't relax.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I can't have crumbs, I can't just sit down and there's all these [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She can't relax.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Papers around me.  I have to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why she is a manager.  It's in her nature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But is that, it's okay right?  I'm functioning though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, yeah, you know fish.  They like water they don't like land.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I like fish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Birds they fly well through the air -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They run on the ground so, so unless they're adapted for it like an ostrich.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They swim okay to, some of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is, yeah, ducks are pretty good.  Ducks are all around.  The ostrich doesn't swim it runs though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What does that have to do with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I'm saying is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No you're more of a literalist.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I like you a lot, literalist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Okay, what happens is that you have people and you have animals that have preferred environments.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That they are best adapted to.  Fish do better in water than on land.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you better in a neat organized environment -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you do in some chaotic kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She believes that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She believes it and there's probably good reason.  Maybe she has gills.  Okay so people with gills they like water because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're supposed to be there it's how they get their oxygen.  Okay so you have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But [INAUDIBLE] like a guilty conscience?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like guilt?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Guilt, no I said gills, like fish.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] guilty, I'm like what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm making an analogy.  I spare the analogies because I know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You can tell that I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're more literal, you're more tangible, you want it, to see it, to feel it, to know it's there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right that's how [INAUDIBLE].  When I have homework I do it.  -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When I have this, I do it; because what is the, if I sit there and procrastinate all it does is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Literally keep me up -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Responsibility.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It eats me up a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you think you have attention deficit, why do you think that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because when I don't take my medicine then I literally have all these things that I need to do but I don't know ho, I'll start doing 1 thing and I go to the next -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so it's hard to organize then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right and I just will -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See that's where like you now not giving medical advice.  I'm just saying in general what I've found is a lot of people if they can work on organizing their brain.  Then they don't need the medicine to organize it because you create your organization through building up yourself in your head.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told you that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, so I will need your card and we will have to schedule an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] same drug.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you rework the circuits.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I am on Adderall currently I've been on it since I was [AGE], I'm [AGE].  I need to get off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah well the stuff, the stuff works -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why you can't relax, that's why you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have to practice the organizational skills.  Some of the things you can do you can do exercises.  Like uh, the alphabet you know, well here's a good example for you.  Let's try this, uh, why don't you count 1-10, count out loud.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Me or him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One, two -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One, two, three -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four, five -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Four, five -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Six, seven -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Six, seven -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eight, 9, 10.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Eight, 9, 10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay now do that backwards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ten, nine, eight -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Ten, nine, eight -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Seven, six, five -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Seven, six, five -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four, three, two, one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Four, three, two, one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay now do the alphabet A-Z.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A, B, C, D -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> A, B, C, D -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> E, F, G, H, I, J -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> E, F, G, H, I, J -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> K, L, M, N, O, P -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> K, L, M, N, O, P -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Q, R, S, T, U, V -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Q, R, S, T, U, V-</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> W, X, Y, Z.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> W, X, Y, Z.  There's even a song that goes with that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't do that one backwards.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now do it backwards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't do that one backwards.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M - .</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING] .</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I can't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah it is, thanks.  Um, so anyhow you can practice that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, now probably that's what you're thinking about is the backwards alphabet right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I mean I take them [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> O, N, M, O, P, J, H, G, F, D, C, B, A.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What do I have to do.  What does that have to do with what we're talking about though?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you can practice that, so you can do it faster.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Why would, why would I want to do that faster?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You go A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To train your brain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T,  U, V, W, X, Y, Z, Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T. [LAUGHING].  I'm really like rehearsing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> P, O, N, M, L, K, J, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A, and you do the same thing with numbers to, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So are you grouping them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, I'm just going back and forth.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And what is that doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That helps you with sustaining your focus and attention.  Now if you do that you start building up in your brain the ability to focus on things and concentrate and then if you really want to get good then you have someone that starts adding in distractions.  Put on the TV, put on the radio, someone start tickling you and see if you can still do that and keep up the focus and the pattern.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a, it's a way of meditation if you will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One, 2, 3 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that even though the whole world is filled with chaos you can keep focused on your task.  We're not saying it's an easy task, you guys had a hard time doing the Z Y X [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other things bother her that aren't her problems.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well my medicine, well my medicine wares off I have to literally like, or if I'm at work </p>

and I notice that my Adderall is kind of wearing down and people are talking to me I have to literally be like "Stop, walk away" like "I'm talking to this person" could I literally -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right you compartmentalize it you stop one thing at a time and that's one way to do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But what I'm saying is just another way to build up so that you make your own Adderall in your head is to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Should I be practicing that while I'm on it or while I'm off?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, while you're on it because you can think of sometimes is the medicine as being like a cast for a broken arm.  You ever break an arm or see someone with a broken arm?  What happens when they take the cast off, what happened to the muscle?  It typically shrinks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] the mask the other now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The muscle shrinks up so it's like your medicine sort of like a cast for your brain, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And uh, if you take -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like you take the cast off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The cast off you're going to have an atrophied muscle there.  So, part of you brain doesn't know how to make it stuff anymore -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's an atrophied muscle?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well that's one that's like weak, shriveled up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, I can't [INAUDIBLE] without it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How I mean I should probably try to get off of it right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, this is something you and your doctor need to talk discuss.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If what you're saying is what -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm making an appointment, I want to know about you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's say and I said for you is that in your brain and in you, you could produce more than what Adderall is doing for you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, basically you can produce as much neurotransmitter as you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Any drug out that you can produce in here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay well you guys can finish; because I, this is about you I'm not even -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but the two of you kind of tie in together so the idea is you need to practice that stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need to practice it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it's kind of like saying "Go on a diet and exercise" and they come back and weight 10 pounds more.  I say "Yeah, been" -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, bigger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "On your diet?"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You been exercising?  Bullshit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like say "Yeah I was on my diet 23 hours a day it was the last hour that got me."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now is that because the factual data wasn't there.  He truly said "Yeah, I wasn't on a diet" so you weren't there to prove him wrong.  But the factual data shows you and the science that he weighs 10 pounds more.  If he stuck to this regimen, you and I know, he wouldn't weigh 10 pounds more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the other thing is whenever physical discomfort you're enduring in this process of adjusting without opiates -</p>

<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can endure a lot of pain.  In fact you can train your brain to make opiates, okay. I mean I see plenty of people, I see people that like cut themselves, okay and don't feel the pain.  Okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have, I have tremendous, I, I broke my elbow before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Went out the same night, still did that.  Cut the cast off, same year had surgery on my shoulder and my wrist.  I have tremendous tolerance for physical pain and I don't want to have physical pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you can take part of your brain and just compartmentalize it, put it over there.  It's kind of like a hypnotic thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How would you kind of tweak it per say to that kind of section?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, some people they physically take and they say the pains here and they just take it and put it over there now and you can, where you like learn to compartmentalize the feeling or an emotion or something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah you take part of your brain and you sort of hold that over here and you put it there.  Now you know it's there, all right and if you want to feel it you can do it and if 
you don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that takes time to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you could like shrink it down like that and push it off.  Okay you can picture doing that in your mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Now how do you take the action to start -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did you learn to walk?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Practice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, because that's the answer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did you learn to speak English?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One word at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One letter at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah that too, one sound, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One sound or syllable or whatever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Da, da, da, da, da -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You call it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.  Right so that's what you do.  You just practice until it gets better.  How did you learn to ride a bicycle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Practice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, here's one you can practice.  Try to do this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then backwards?  I don't know if I could, like this and then like so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see you can do it too.  What's your name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What am I doing?  Making a circle?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Making two circles going the opposite directions meeting at the top and bottom.  You pick which way you want to go this way or you can go this way -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Meeting at the top and bottom.  You got to meet at the top and then at the bottom, meet at the bottom -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're not meeting at the bottom.  [LAUGHING].  Yeah that's, we've got to work on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We've got some exercises that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Obviously it can be done, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay can you do what is?  One of these -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm like rubbing my head and writing these down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you writing down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This shirt, this shirt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you right handed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try to use your left hand today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Use it on your mouse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a good start because you know you're not going to start writing with your left hand right away, use it on your mouse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Use your left hand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What did you call that ambidextrous?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ambidextrous yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then what are these exercises doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're trying to grow your brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're learning.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And with that only comes from practice and thoroughness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What you're doing you don't need to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Every time you have that go like this instead.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I do this all day long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just let it hang.  Pretend you're a scarecrow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take a deep breath.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's good.  It helps to breath.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well we'll work on her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, when you notice that she's tense tell her you got to breath.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what she -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He makes me [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When, when I said that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No you're choosing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have the power to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This behavior, right, you're choosing this behavior -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As your excuse or reason or stimulus to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So when he's racing and going [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just like an airplane.  People choose the airplane to make them feel happy, sad, nervous, afraid, or see it as a paycheck, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it doesn't, they don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can view an airplane however you want.  You can view heroine however you want.  If you're a heroine addict, you go "Oh my nose is running."  Okay, if you're a cop you say "Oh that get's you arrested."  You know if you're a Columbia drug deal, you see that as like money in the bank.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now what you're, now what it is in all reality is that -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay wait, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> People don't have the power to make you feel how you want to feel.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, so let me ask him.  When he is sitting here racing, going, saying all these things that he needs to do and all, all the things he wants to get done and he needs my help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You choose -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I choose how to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How to respond -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And that's what I say "Okay we're going to take this" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You see a person with a gun on the street.  You choose how to respond to it based on your perception.  If you knew the gun was not loaded you would respond differently and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then if it is loaded.  But you see it you make an assumption the gun is loaded and it's a real gun.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is it, okay so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And therefore your heart rate goes up a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See we've got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's a few new that it was a fake gun or had no bullets.  You wouldn't feel as afraid.  You'd say "Well obviously this person means business.  They brought in a gun" -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "They're acting like it is."  Except there is no gun there; therefore I'll stay calm and kind of have a joke because I know your story.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see, I see a red [INAUDIBLE] at the end of that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, so my point is with him when he's doing that.  Is it okay for me to maybe </p>

<p>[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just look at him objectively, you need to keep your own objectivity about yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She thinks -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might even say something like "[PATIENT NAME] how do you feel right now?  Have you taken a deep breath lately?"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what she told me when I told her to take a deep breath -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She goes "Breathing's overrated."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I never said that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You said that this morning -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I was probably kidding -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or yesterday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I was probably kidding but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was probably kidding.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean seriously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well here's the thing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The more you can stay in charge of yourself the more you can control your environment around you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Which I am doing a good job of doing I feel like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  All right then enjoy it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I just get overwhelmed when he's saying all these things.  So then when I get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You choose to be overwhelmed -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What I'm going to address.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's coming at you faster than you feel you can process.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, is it okay that I choose to ignore the second half of what he's talking about?  I'm hearing it but I choose to not acknowledge it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what you could do is acknowledge him and just say "I can only process this at a certain rate" -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "Therefore I'm going to have to sit down, slow down and take this one piece of it at a time."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah and have I not been telling you that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's objective.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I've been telling you that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You've been saying "I'm overwhelmed right now, I believe I am this, I think it's because of you."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well people get that way.  It's like a computer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I can find -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know you only have so much ram in when you're 100% and you've got order -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Overload.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The order of operations and you can only process at a certain rate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But now computers -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or people train themselves to choose at the level they are -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you can try to train -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Overloaded, correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To upgrade your ram.  Okay, so if you work on this maybe you can have more ram chips plugged in or you can improve -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The process or speed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, like a guarantee, for example uh, you're faster at adding numbers now than you where when you were [AGE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely, 100%.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, because you've trained a lot with it.  Okay, you've practiced it a lot, you've built up a lot of circuits -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can I ask you a question?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have a big bus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now where did you truly learn to add numbers?  As a child though, correct?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Per say.  In, in a sense I'm trying, and I'm trying to stay objective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About it but when you first learned to speak, you're first learning as a child to make sounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What if no one teaches you to do that as a child?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No you'll still mimic things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now you've got to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it might be the sounds of your she wolf mother or something like that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oww, like that.  You know but humans are good at mimicking things, just like parrots.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, very subjective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Parents, I'm saying -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Parrots, parrots.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Awk -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pauli want a cracker.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah that's what I meant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they'll mimic what they see.  So humans and monkeys and other primates are good at that.  They will copy what they see.  That's part of how humans learn -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's how they only taught to learn?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They can copy good behaviors, they can copy bad behaviors.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a language.  Children normally or naturally will learn to speak whatever language they grow up in.  Almost effortlessly -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They can learn Chinese as easily as Swahili.  All right but one language maybe better than the other -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of how it's constructed, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so much easier I believe or I'm not sure -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they'll learn, they'll learn whatever together [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure that for a child compared to an adult to start learning two different language that's all they heard.  Like my dad speaks Italian and English and my mom speaks German and English.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they were taught as children because that, there parents both spoke both languages in the home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's tougher I believe as an adult to start picking up and learning those kinds of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is and it isn't because you have the construct.  When you were a little baby and some one says cow.  You don't know what a cow is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now you know it's a vacca, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know it's the same thing you know it's four legs, it's got spots and makes milk.  Okay, when you're a little baby you don't know that.  Okay, you don't know the difference between a cow, horse, and pig and a dog.  Okay, you don't until you know you meet one or you see one at the zoo -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Horse show.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you see more pictures.  But you don't know, okay where as if I say Africa.  You guys probably have an idea of what Africa means.  Okay, if you where two years old, I said Africa, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you'd be more like Africa maybe or something like that.  All right, but you know Africa, I could say name some countries in Africa and you could give me a few.  Come on give me one?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Name what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nigeria.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there you go.  Give me another one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Africa?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Africa give him a country that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One country in Africa.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I couldn't even tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cameroon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm not good with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, Egypt, I don't know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> South Africa that's a country.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's right by Sicily, kind of right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's across the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh it is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but the id, we're not here to embarrass you your geographical sense.  I'm sure you know the geography of Nordstrom's or wherever it is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know inside and out.  [LAUGHING].  Okay and you know all the designer fashions and names that you know I would go what's that.  You know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No I, right I totally understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's your forte, that's what you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Work on, just like you know someone who's in to trees -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And know other species.  Okay, so you train so yeah you have a great facility at this.  Uh, so basically you've learned to specialize language that fits with your work.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right so as an adult what I'm saying is it's easier some ways to learn language because you already have an emotional construct of what that means in your head.  Okay so when I say light pole, yeah you know what a light pole is.  Now if I can tell you in another language what that means or like luz means life, L U Z in Spanish.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it in, in a sense what it means to you is what it means?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know what a light means, what I'm saying is a little kid doesn't know what a light necessarily means they, I, they don't have the words to associate.  They just know something hurts my eyes when I look at it, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right they get, think of light as moon or something or anything [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right and that's how people they generalize.  You know so they call every male a dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and every woman a ma, ma and then you find out "No that's a woman, I'm a woman, I'm your momma, dada."  You go woman, you know so then they still think huh, they're all women but you're a momma and I'm not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or something you know and when she's got a little kids she's a momma but that's someone else's momma.  You know and so then you start differentiating and it takes a while to understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If when you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know keep in mind you know little kids they're like space aliens you know or you'd be on the new world, you wouldn't know, you know if I said Ferugi.  You know Ferugi?  Do you know Kablaga?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know that's like little kids that English, Kablaga Ferugi.  You know which doesn't mean anything in any language -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I made that up, Kablaga, Ferugi.  You going to go blah, blah like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know so until you know that it means something you don't know what feeling to give it.  What emotion.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But eventually you'll figure out what that means.  If it means vanilla ice cream and you're hungry and that's hot and you're wanting that thing, they say "Kablaga, Ferugi" and I can make your stomach growl by saying Kablaga Ferugi or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You said ice cream my stomach almost just fell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah see because that's what I'm saying the power of a word can turn on your neurotransmitters in your stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's sickening.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's whatever you associate with that word?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, Kablaga Ferugi.  Okay, vanilla ice cream, Kablaga Ferugi.  Eventually I'll, you come in next time I'll say Kablaga Ferugi, your stomach will growl -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm thinking -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you won't know why.  But your brain is hooked up Kablaga Ferugi, which I really did just make up -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, so the next time I come in you're going to say that word and I'm just going to think of how you related it to vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you're going to think of ice cream like a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'll probably forget, but the thing is your stomach will remember and I'll say Kablaga Ferugi -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That word.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your stomach will remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's as if the receptors from -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, my thought -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're learning something -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I remembered vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're teaching yourself something.  What I'm saying is you are affecting neurotransmitters in your brain.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what [INAUDIBLE] do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> By making the a new association to something that you have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And he doesn't see that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No clue what Kablaga Ferugi means, neither do I.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But now we know it means vanilla ice cream, we've agreed on that and so therefore -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, I've got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I'm drawing on your memory of vanilla ice cream and your state of -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hunger to make your stomach -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do things.  Do you need a signature?</p>

<b>NR</b>: I'm just telling you that I put your next patient in the room next door.

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you Kablaga Ferugi to you too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would you say, would you say -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] instead of like thinking about what this means and that means -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No that was not related to ice cream.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You've got to think about objective and you can't over think things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You could trigger what he said certain things, words, to, to feelings in your body, correct?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And don't over think it, you're overwhelmed, you're crossing your legs, you're freaking out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No because I'm trying to worry about your problems but now I'm thinking of things </p>

<p>[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My problems right now are monetary issues.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Spend less, save more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm trying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So should he be continuing taking the medicine that you already prescribed previously on top of what you gave him now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just as needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should take the Ambien to sleep if he can't.  The Adderall, to keep focused unless you do these other exercises, and the clonidine, Valium and Parafon Forte to what extent you need that assistance in getting yourself off -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Opiates.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, otherwise if you're willing to endure the discomfort, people don't die from opiate withdrawal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right they just feel like it.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But the Norco, stop right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> End of discussion's there yeah, stop the Norco.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, for sure.</p>

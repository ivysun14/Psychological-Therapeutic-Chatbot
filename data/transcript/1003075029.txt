<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks.  So how are you?  [LAUGHING].  You asking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm done, I'm doing good.  Uh, I've noticed, like my appetite has picked up, so I'm actually able to eat.  Um, I don't think, I haven't noticed any significant weight gain, but I've just noticed that I don't look so anorexic, I guess, like I actually have a little bit more substance to me and not so, kind of  —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're motivated to do things, like you said, to tone or to go to work out and stuff —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh—huh, yeah.  Well, I enjoy the run, you know, it was really nice, so I've going to go over there and test drive a car because I really want to see if I even like driving a car [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Instead of a truck, you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Uh, otherwise I'm just going to go to my old standby and just buy a Wrangler again, because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like Wranglers and it makes me smile [LAUGHING].  So, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much better do you think you are, on the Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Between zero to 10, zero being no change, ten 100%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would say eight, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I still notice that like, if [NAME OTHER]'s blows up on me, like, I still cringe a little bit, like yesterday, he got all pissed off at me because I looked at, we were in the car.  And I looked at the car next to me and laughed because it was a silver Mitsubishi Eclipse and there was a guy in it, because I could tell by the arm, wearing a big thick watch, and he's playing, like Britney Spears dance music or something like that, and it was funny.  And I was like, look, there's a gay guy next to us, and he got all mad, like, wanting to know why I was looking at the other guy, and I'm like, I glanced over and saw the watch and the car, I heard the music and thought it was funny.  So [INAUDIBLE] I can let you out and you can get a ride with him, and what like, what, what are you, where are you getting off, like, with this attitude?  And then we got home and I wanted to change shirts because I was wearing a tank top and I was cold.  I wanted to put on a long sleeved shirt, so, um, I had the blinds, not like this, but like, the vertical blinds?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had had them open during the day, not all the way open, not where it was like full window, but the blinds were still in front of the window?  And I went into the closet, which is on the opposite end of the wall, turned on the light, grabbed a T—shirt, took off my tank top, put on my long sleeved shirt, and he got all pissed off because everybody could see my boobs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was in the closet, and he was like, I am so mad at you right now, he's like, I just want to knock you out and put you out until the morning, and, I mean, like just kept going off and he's like, do you want to get raped and all this, and, I'm like, okay, first off, we live in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Second off, how are they going to get in?  We're on the second floor.  You know, I'm like, okay, can understand if they're like severely motivated, blah blah blah.  And they say, you know, but, I just said, I'm sorry, you know, I didn't even think.  I was in the closet and, you know, I had my back to the window, and he threw something into the bedroom, and that's when I turned around, and I was topless at that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I had my long sleeved shirt in my arms, you know, on my arms, just getting ready to pull them over my head, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He just got so incredibly pissed off at me for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how did he calm down, [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just left him alone.  He was like, make me some food, bitch, and, or make my dinner, bitch, and all this, and, you know, and, just like, okay.  I can understand being a little bit upset, but to like, take it to that extreme?  That's uncalled for.  Because I don't get mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still frightened of him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he hasn't gotten in my face since, in a couple weeks, so I'm not frightened, but I'm —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you think has caused that, the anger to change?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think the Lexapro has just calmed me down.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So you're not as reactive to him so he's less reactive to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Does he see a difference in you on the Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I haven't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never talk about it?  Does he know you're taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, but he says that he doesn't want to, he's like almost embarrassed by the fact that I come here, and I'm like, [INAUDIBLE], well, whatever, if it's going to help me, then deal with it.  You know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's embarrassing to him?  Like you're crazy or something, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, he thinks I'm crazy anyway, it's like he wanted to, he said all it takes is two signatures to put me in a mental home —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he had threatened that on more than one occasion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But not recently.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he, he might see you as better, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, and then last night he was, uh, going off saying this is what, he said something like, I can tell you this, keep this up, [PATIENT NAME], he's like, we won't be together in six months.  He's like, I'll leave your ass, I'll keep my bitches on the side, and he's like, I can guarantee you we won't be married, you just keep it up, just watch, just wait, you know, and, like, what, what did I do to deserve all these threats and things like that?  I don't, I'm, I guess I'm not understanding completely because I'm happy, you know, I'm content.  I truly enjoy my job, I am taking care of myself, I noticed I'm not smoking as much, I'm getting out and riding my horse, I'm spending time with my dad because we do the barn thing together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he jealous of your relationship with your dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  He doesn't get along very well with his dad.  I mean, I think, I was telling my friend [NAME OTHER] this morning, because she's like, she's like, girl, she's like, I got brothers and uncles that will beat his ass for you [LAUGHING], and I was like, awe, link, I'll keep that in the back of my got, mind, and I'm like, but, uh, I'll just know that the repercussion would end badly for me, I think [LAUGHING], because I know my boss has also hinted at  the fact that if</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anything ever happened, he would have a massive issue with —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He would what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My boss, um, has actually asked me if [NAME OTHER] hits me, and I said no, he's come close, but he hasn't laid a finger on me.  He's like, you would tell me if he did, and I'm like, yes I would.  He's like, all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, yeah [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you feel protected by people around [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do, like, I hang out with good people, you know, and I'm okay being by myself, too.  You know, it's, like, my downtime, because at work at the restaurant, you know, you got to put on an act, you got a big smile, be bubbly, get the food, and so you can get a good tip, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you seem like you're enjoying it a little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I really like it.  It's fun.  I don't like grouchy people, but it's still, I like my restaurant.  I like going to work every day.  I don't like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that it's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Waking up sometimes, but [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?  You don't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like getting up in the morning sometimes, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's different because you worked at that other restaurant, uh, before, what was the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Name of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I think it's the people, I, I love —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't like the people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I love my coworkers, and my boss is just awesome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  So I really can't go wrong with —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With that, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you actually look forward to being there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I, there are a lot of times when I don't want to come home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, you know, like Friday and Saturday nights, and I'm like, well, anybody want to do anything?  No, all right, I guess I'll go home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you done some things socially outside of work with them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, I've gone out with [NAME OTHER] a little bit, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's a waitress too, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she's my bus girl.  So, but other than that, no, not really.  And, oh well, it's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how many hours you working there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, about 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, that's full time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.  It's usually 10:30 until 4:00, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then 10:30 to whenever somebody shows up [LAUGHING].  I clock out for a little bit and then I usually clock back in around 5:30, and I work until 11:00, 11:30, and then Saturday it's 4:30 to close, and Sundays it's up in the air, we don't know [LAUGHING], because I think I might start taking over being a waitress on Sundays now, Sunday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean an extra shift, or instead of other —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Instead of doing bartending, because I always end up going home early because it gets slow, so that would be pretty sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because Sunday nights, there's good opportunity for some good money, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're making pretty good money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, about $40.00 a lunch period, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wanted to be getting $50.00, so I'm not too far off of that goal —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You make more at the dinner shift than the morning shift?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, because the lu, dinner is more expensive, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I know there were a couple times that I did, uh, that I helped them out and grabbed a couple tables and on those tables, you know, their bill was $30.00 and I'd get like a $10.00 tip off of each table, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that's 20 bucks just off of two tables.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if I can keep that up —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much work is it to perform, you know, to put on a happy face?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, sometimes it's, I mean, it's not that hard, uh, but it's brings you out, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, at the end of my shift I'm tired, just from —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm, talking, walking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh, just from being around people.  Even though it's usually quiet by 1:30, 2:00 at the latest, I always have about an hour to two hours just by myself, but even still, you know, I have to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Happy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Still be on in case somebody walks in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have your parents come in and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I treated my mom and dad to dinner, on a Saturday night, it was a couple days after my mom's [AGE] birthday —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they loved it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, they thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, so that was good.  And, uh, I guess when my grandparents come back from Arizona, they want to come down and take my mom and dad out to dinner there, too, on a night that I'm working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So your mom told them you're doing well working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, be nice if they still helped me out a little bit financially [LAUGHING], because the only thing I do for myself is go and get my nails done, and that's just because they look nicer as a waitress and a bartender.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, people look at your hands when you're shaking a martini shaker —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or giving them food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not spending much, now, are you, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't spend anything.  I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, even [DEIDENTIFIED] said room and board is free, right, or included?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I paid for a couple months and my trust has paid for a couple, so I'm just looking forward to it being moved so I can, like, get caught up and not have outstanding debts and get my credit going so I can get a credit card and actually move forward.  It's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the status of that now, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Crappy, I don't know [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hasn't been moved or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not, not that I know of.  I haven't gotten a phone call yet, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do your grandparents have to agree to that, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Me, so, because they handed over the trust to the [DEIDENTIFIED].  They're not trustees of it, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not?  So they —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, they just set it up, but they have no control or power or say so if, in anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I figured if I, because we did this, oh, back in April, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, the guy at [DEIDENTIFIED], find out what's going on, and then call my grandma and have her call the [DEIDENTIFIED] and really, let's get this moved.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PATIENT NAME] needs a car [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, that's the main reason you want to do it?  I figured you didn't like the guy and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I hate the guy.  I'm, I'd like to see him suffer massive, massive emotional pain and mental pain that he's caused me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of his controlling nature?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, no, I mean, he hung up the phone on me on more than one occasion in our conversation, that's just rude.  I'm a client.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, I don't care if I've had an attitude.  Like, um, oh, this was when he, he gave me grief about the charges here, and, uh, he was like, well, you never submitted anything and I'm, he's like, I don't know if this third party is legit, I'm like, if you look back in my file you'll see that there's been thousands of dollars paid to this same place at the same address.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Same format.  Well, that was 2-1/2 years ago, and I'm like, I don't care if it was 2-1/2 years ago or 10 years ago, this is my mental health we're talking about, you pay it.  And he hung up on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sick old asshole [LAUGHING].  It's on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think you were a little more irritable then, without the medication, too, so, I mean, you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, but still, you don't hang up on me.  Tha, I mean, you don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What has —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Question your clients when it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What has switching within the bank, within your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I already did that, and I got even worse, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] are to do that, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd like to dissolve it and, I mean, it's been such a hassle for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old do you have to be before it's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty—five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] been a while, yeah [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just like, well, I'll be [AGE] in two, next year, so, I mean, it's only [DEIDENTIFIED] more years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll be [AGE].  Do you feel that old already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.  Like, my joints, I mean, last night I had a heating pad on my back for a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you could, you've calmed down.  You're not like you used to be when you were [AGE] and you discuss —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too much on your [INAUDIBLE], [LAUGHING], you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you, you're channeling in a good place, though.  You're working, you're exercising, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, my friend [NAME OTHER] says it's from, because I told her about last night, and she's like, she's like, honestly, she's like, sounds like he's jealous of you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, she's like, you have a good family relationship with your family, you know, your parents help you out, you get along with your grandparents.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's like, you like your job, you know, you have your horses that you like to go see, and she's like, and you're working out, and she's like, and you look good.  She's like, you've lost a lot of weight and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, [NAME OTHER], when he sits down, I mean, when I sit down, it's, it's flat.  But when he sits down, it like comes over his pants.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, he's not fat, but he has a belly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, and, you know, I mean, he doesn't do anything about it and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, if he doesn't work out, even when —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you take him to work out together?  That will calm him down as well [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the thing is, this is what's funny is, he wants to join the, uh, Reserves or the National Guard, which I think, God, I can only hope that he gets accepted into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, be good for both of you.  He'll get into shape and he'll feel better and you'll have time away from him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, except I don't know if he'll make it in.  I don't know if he'll pass the medical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE], he'll be [AGE] this year.  But he has a slight heart murmur.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's got a bad leg.  I mean, it doesn't affect him, but, you know, and he was talking about joining the end of the summer, and like, okay, so you, we need to cut down on smoking now and start going for a walk and sure building up —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What motivated him to do this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he's heard of, yeah, he will never find a job, unless he has some kind of military experience, pretty much, because they'll give him the training that he could do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anything else, I mean, no college education or anything like that, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Actually, they'll pay for, in Illinois, if you go military, they'll pay for a college education.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would love to do the same thing, but I know for a fact I won't pass the medical [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why, because of the depression then, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The depression, um, my knees, I've had a lot of broken bones and a lot of injuries to my knees, so I won't, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might talk to somebody, actually, might be a good experience for you to go through —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I start —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is it, is it two year?  No, it's a Reserve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you would go, like, one weekend a month type of thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I just don't know, like I said, I would like to do it but like I said, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It might be a good organizing effect.  But why don't you just go talk to them, you know, go in and just see what they have to offer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't, I know for a fact, though, that like my knees wouldn't hold up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my only thing, because it's, today I was limping around earlier and I took some aspirin and I was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, I'm on my feet, you know, I'm in good shape and I was able to run easily, but for me to be very sore the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and I've been going for a walk pretty, you know, once or twice a week now and running, and I had, wear good shoes, and my knees at, my joints are still acting up, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it, the doctor said that I would end up having probably both my knees replaced by the time —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know when I'm older, so, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're stable anyway, now, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, probably look into that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, that's all that matters is [LAUGHING], my mental health and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know, and I rally do like my coworkers because they make me feel good about me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, like I said, I really hope that, you know, but [NAME OTHER] has no motivation to start working out now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He'd rather sit on the couch and look at the internet and, or watch a movie, and eat.  And, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the warmer weather, that could help, I mean, go for a walk with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I said, I'm like, well, what, I said that yesterday, I'm like, well, when we get home, why don't just go for a quick walk around the block with the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, walking is boring.  I don't care if walking is boring, you have to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're out of shape, you're severely out of shape, and you're a little bit overweight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You told him that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just said that, you know, it's going to make it easier if you start getting into shape now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I just, and then I just once again, kind of say, you know, I will, ran for two miles today, you know, I'm like, I ran for a mile and walked for a mile.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm still offering to go out and do it.  I'm like, my knee hurts, and I still will go out for a walk with you.  And like it hurts to go up and down stairs right now, but I'll do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If it helps motivate you.  And he was like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I ended up making him dinner and then, uh, we will, ended up watching a movie and I kind of fell asleep and was like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  Well, you're just not under the stress you were, so we'll just keep you on it.  It's just 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, you know, I don't think I need anything higher —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's just like the right amount of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's good stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we don't need anything for the attentional problems either, right, you're focused okay and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, except when my dogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I mean at work, you're, you're able —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To concentrate —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we don't have to go there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, and I think a lot of the reason why I find myself, like, not paying attention to [NAME OTHER] is, uh, because I'm supposed to pay complete attention to him, but he never wants to hear about my day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's kind of frustrating, so I don't offer anything, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He'll get his back kicked [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, now, let's leave that alone for —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In the Army [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, in the Army, yeah, and I, no, the Army would be good for him, especially if his temper and all, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know he's been through, I know he said he did like three years of anger management —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he said previously, if he hadn't had it, he would have, like, knocked my ass out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still think he needs to have anger management, though [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the military, we don't control [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so, uh, do you want me to give you samples, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, please?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My phone just went off.  Do do do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's my friend [NAME OTHER].  A husband and wife arrive in heaven.  Wife says, here we are together again.  Husband says, fuck that shit, the, deal with, deal with death do us parch, death do us part, bitch, I'm single [LAUGHING].  It's like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so, when should we meet again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'd like to go three weeks?  I, I don't want to go quite a month, because it's funny, it just seems like, uh, we get along —</p>

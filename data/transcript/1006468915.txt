<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________<p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: …the paper is correlated with his present. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I was happy to oblige. I actually had a cancellation so it worked out perfectly that you could move to this spot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that’s great. Let’s see, well it was… so taxes. I did taxes this last... well I was going to do a month Friday… I did the month Friday night. Jeremy’s brother sent… his wife was going to a bachelorette party. Jeremy invited his brother over. And it’s hard for me. There’s lots of drama going on, whether Christina’s being a good mother or whether she’s overloading Ozzie [ph?] and making… spreading him too thin, giving him equal baby responsibilities but not equal total team responsibilities. [1:05] So that might be taking care of the baby and doing all of the cooking and the dog watching and the… so I mean I had some observations and sort of… but it’s hard because the mom says something, Jeremy says stuff to me, and I have my own opinions. But it’s… I mean I do feel bad because it does seem that even though they’ve talked about it, one person does have a larger portion of the work, and especially if [inaudible] personal experience with Christina wanting me to come over on Fridays and spend time with the baby, which I’m working on Friday. I mean I don’t mind spending time with the baby Friday night but she meant during the day, and she’s had… I mean just making sort of the assumption or extrapolating from her bringing the baby into the office on Fridays and then leaving to do chores. [2:15] I don’t want to… I mean I guess I’m personally impacted by this as well so I mean I guess I do feel I have a say in what I think is fair or not, or whether… my personal opinion. But anyway, he came over on Friday and we gave him dinner. Made tacos, which was really fun. And it was nice. I got to hold the baby and I mean the baby didn’t seem to mind me. He didn’t seem to be too interested. I have to admit I’m more of a three year old toddler sort of… that’s sort of where I… my interests come, rather than babies. But I wanted to at least tend to the baby while Ozzie [ph?] and Jeremy were making cocktails in the kitchen. So I feel I was doing my Auntly duties and I was… the cats were sniffing the baby and sitting near it. So I felt… I don’t feel like I’m a totally bad Aunt. It’s hard to say. I don’t feel…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like people are saying you’re a totally bad Aunt? [3:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well Christina said that she doesn’t… she wants me to spend more time with the baby so that it gets to know his Aunt. And every time when we go out with them they’re always like hold the baby, hold the baby. You don’t want to hold the baby? And I’m like well, I mean the baby’s… I can hold the baby. I don’t particularly want to. It’s nothing against the baby. It’s just babies are rather fragile. I mean not that fragile but I mean I’d rather hold a cat, but not like a baby kitten, like a too, too tiny kitten. I just… I mean I just don’t feel any warm and fuzzy feeling. I guess I’ll say that. But I can understand once the baby gets a little bit older I’ll feel a little bit more closeness to it. So [inaudible] being a bad Aunt but I think Christina puts a little pressure on me for spending time with the baby. And I feel like why are you doing this. I mean I don’t demand her to come over and spend time with my cats. And I mean I guess cats are a little bit different but I mean there’s a long time for that, the child to grow up, and I don’t know exactly how to say Fridays are really busy but you’re welcome to come over Friday night, or maybe that might…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds fine. I mean I think her desire to want her baby to be connected to… is it a boy or girl? [5:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s a boy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His Aunt and Uncle, I can understand that. But it was their decision to have a child, not your decision to have a niece or nephew. And your life goes on. So I think being respectful of your schedule and your job. Just because you don’t have to punch a time clock doesn’t mean that you don’t have to commit time to your work. And your work schedule didn’t change when she had the baby, so I think saying Fridays I really need to devote to work, but Friday nights or another time that works for you I’d be happy to have you guys over to come spend some time. That’s perfectly acceptable and lovely. Not everyone’s world has to revolve around baby’s needs. Hers does right now. And maybe Ozzie’s [ph?] too, but… </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess I’ll use that because [inaudible] going down to Vermont for Easter and spending time with the whole family. [6:24] It’s always sort of a… I mean it’s… I know when Jeremy spends time with my family he probably gets a little exhausted from the intertentions and… but I feel that with… I mean I guess spending time with every… I mean I sort of feel that every family is sort of dysfunctional in a functional way, and just when you grow up with that family you’re used to that dysfunction so…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know how to work around it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But so I’m curious just to see how that goes. It should go fine. I mean it’s Easter and it’s… actually, Easter’s my favorite holiday. I… because I love… well it might have been because our mom had us do… gave us Easter bunnies, and the colors and the season and how we had an Easter dinner and we went to church. And it’s actually… it’s fun because Jeremy and I were going to go to a long orthodox Seder. And it was actually funny. The rabbi took Jeremy aside when he came to my… Kitty’s, Jeremy’s mother’s, birthday, and he was like what’s the deal with Suzanne. [7:43] And Jeremy was like well she’s not Jewish and he’s like well obviously but... he’s like what… why is she so interested. And Jeremy passed on, essentially, my message is that it’s part of Jeremy’s background and I want to be able to share that with my children someday. It’s being able to answer questions and give them the traditions that Jeremy likes celebrating and being able to know about them. And the rabbi was like okay. But I guess he just wanted to know why I was so curious because I actually wanted to see the rabbi in a more frequent, maybe once a month, and (pause) [inaudible] but I mean and I just… I sort of feel… I mean there’s two parts of me. One that’s very enthusiastic about… to rekindle religion, and the other part that’s just exhausted. And that sort of came up this weekend when I was doing my taxes late into the night and I was… Jeremy fell asleep on me. [9:03] I… taxes are just very stressful because I don’t have… half of my year’s a W2 if I teach, and the other half’s a scholarship, and how I put away scholarship money is kind of a fluid thing, how much I’m saving. And it doesn’t help that Jeremy, he skipped three paychecks, and so he’s been really tense about money. And I actually had to have him pay my Rhode Island tax return and that was… I was just really sensitive about that because I know he’s really touchy about money right now. And then we kind of… I mean I don’t know if it was just in the morning when I woke up, whether I was touchy, but I wound up just crying when… and I was just… I was crying quite a bit when he told me that I… he was getting on my case that we didn’t have any paper in the printer when he brought some home, and I didn’t tell him that we were out or… I mean I don’t know how we ran out or when we had paper. I just remember printing three or four pages and being out of paper. I don’t remember. [10:28] I think it was just… I was asking him for money. He gets a little tense. So how much do I need and what’s your finances and how much are your taxes, and it’s just all such a delicate thing. I mean in one sense it’s typical because we’re still operating on… well I have two bank accounts, which is… it’s kind of an artifact of the past, and he has a bank account. And so how money is distributed, it’s all sort of random. And how much I’m giving him per month. And it’s a lot of variables. And I mean I think I get frustrated when… I mean because I already feel guilty. I sometimes feel like I’m frivolous with money. And I mean for many years I was able to pay my taxes. I guess I was just… it’s… when I was responsible for everything I had to live within my means because there was no buffer. And now, here, if it was $700 that I was lacking for taxes, I… last year I was lacking that much so… because he’s kind of a cushion. But it just sort of… it wasn’t… after I was exhausted and I’d done my taxes, which were more, much more, than last year, I don’t know why, I still don’t know why. Anyway, but it was just… it was… so I started crying, and it wasn’t a… and I got a message from my Dad, hello, is this your same number. [12:25] Mom and Dad have been trying to reach you. We miss you. And I was just sort of thinking about if it was… I’ve been meaning to call my parents but I was just really exhausted. I’m [inaudible] and at least two racquetball classes for a week and trying to get work done and yet I’m just… and I had this one girl, she gave me a letter of recommendation Friday night and wanted me to have it done on the 15th, today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wanted you to write it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she gave me a letter as a rough draft, and so I’m currently just fixing it really quick, just because, I mean, there’s limited time. And I went to see my advisor today. That’s… I’m going to have that until the Seder to work on it. But I mean I was just freaking out because it’s like there’s so much to be done and it’s taking forever. And my parents are wondering where I am, Jeremy’s mad at me for doing this, this, and this around... because he gets… he calls himself OCD clean, and in a sense he’s not OCD clean or else he’d be cleaning the wall [ph?] a lot more often, which I do. [13:41] But he is sort of very persnickety about things being left out and he can get kind of harsh. I mean I guess it’d be different if I were a kid, but if I’m along his age, I mean I could… I mean I’ve gotten better about the toilet paper, and I do do that, and the tissues, replacing those. I just have a hard time when things need to be replaced or I just… it’s not top of my priority list. And so I just felt like he was attacking me by just not being very nice about the paper and… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re upset that he feels like he’s the only one that does it, or… </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He feels that he’s sort of the only one that takes responsibility for the paper. He ordered the ink and he was doing this so people can print out stuff. And I mean I can understand. I… the printer, I sort of ignore. Sometimes it has paper, sometimes it doesn’t, and that might be just… I mean I haven’t changed the ink on that machine for seven years. [15:01] It’s been going good until just recently. And with paper, I mean it’s just… I sort of… I mean I guess there have been little things that I’ve been sort of using the last of. I do use the last of… almost the last of the sugar but… and I didn’t tell Jeremy because I didn’t know I needed sugar. I normally just get sugar when I need it. But I didn’t know that he was making simply syrup or… and so I think that was it, the sugar and the paper. And…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So part of it is communication. And lack of sleep, it looks like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may be feeling partly overwhelmed because it sounds like, yeah, a lot of people are sort of wanting things from you. Christina’s wanting time from you for the baby, Jeremy’s wanting you to really notice sort of some of these details and communicate with him and take more responsibility, it sounds like. Your mom and dad want you to pay attention to them. Everybody’s wanting things from you, and it sounds like you’re feeling exhausted. You clearly didn’t get enough sleep last night. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got to bed earlier. I got to bed at 1:00. So it’s moving on up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re moving in the right direction. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But still…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don’t feel tired. Well it takes a while to reset that sort of sleep deprivation that you have accumulated. And I know, also, you’re switching your schedule. But yeah, I mean it sounds like you feel overwhelmed. There’s a lot of people wanting things from you, and not having enough time to do all the things that you want to do, whether it be racquetball classes or sleep or focus on your own work. [16:40] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I guess… and sometimes I get frustrated because Jeremy needs these motivational talks probably like every other day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For you to motivate him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About work, but it’s going to… things are going to come through and that he doesn’t need to worry about this. And I mean of course we talk about all the intricacies, but I mean Jeremy… I mean I think he’s putting a lot of pressure on himself to be the main provider. And he got mad when I told my mom that he hasn’t gotten three months’ pay and so money has been tight. And he felt really ashamed and upset because then my parents might think that he’s not able to provide for me. And I was like listen, we’re a team here. I was like right now I’m… I guess I sort of… it’s just an interesting sort of way of thinking about it, providing for me, because I’ve provided for myself for many years on my own salary. I mean I definitely live a better lifestyle than if I wasn’t with him. For sure I’d probably do a lot more shopping at than I do now. [17:57] But yeah, I just… I get frustrated because when he’s like… he comes home stressed and he needs someone to talk to and then unwind, I’m like what about me. I’m stressed. I mean I don’t want to talk about it but I was like here I’m spending all this time motivating and ensuring that things are going to turn out, and in my mind it’s a real push. It’s a real push for me to say these things because I don’t think… in terms of research I’m like… I get frustrated and… but in some… when push comes to shove I know that I can make up something at least to happen or occur or… I mean I guess in my mind it’s just sort of you work every day. You work hard and… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s… your expectation of what the day would be like is different than his.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I just… I feel like I put up with a lot more in terms of the commute, because generally it’s not as straightforward as his commute. Even though there could be traffic there’s not multiple switching of vehicles and interaction with the public. But sometimes that can be amusing. There was a guy on the subway that… he was staggering around drunk and then he entered this… supposedly it’s supposed to be locked, but it’s the cabbie of the subway. And he peed in there while we were just all scared that he was going to blow something up or… but it was just his pee leaking on the ground, which I credited myself with being disgusted but everyone else was disgusted. At least my stuff was not sitting on the floor like some people’s. [19:55] But anyway, that… so… and Jeremy’s done… actually he started picking me up at nights because I’ll be working late in my office. Part of it is I just need that space to… once I get going. And the girl that I was… it doesn’t help that I haven’t had any coffee today. The girl that I was tutoring, she seemed fine with me picking problems. I felt a lot better. And then that was another thing with picking problems. It did take me a long time. And of course I’m going to mark down how long I spent searching for the problems and finding their answer, preparations. But I mean I was happy that she seemed like oh, these are great questions. Some of them were actually pretty difficult. (yawn) Sorry, I’ve got to keep it together. I’ve got to get it together. But I mean and now it’s sort of… I felt good because I sort of set the boundaries to my comfort level. I mean without having to ask. And I think the thing is, is that my mind just starts to over worry about what if. It goes in a negative spiral when I get scared or feel like something’s not right; it just keeps on thinking and thinking and thinking, and fast forwards to cops coming to my door and saying…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so we have to watch for when you start to kind of predict the future in a catastrophic way. Think about what’s realistic here. What’s your worst fear? Your worst fear is probably not the most likely outcome. [21:40] And that’s doing some of that reality checking and noticing I’m getting pretty catastrophic here, let’s think about what’s more realistic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean and that’s how… I was supposed to mail a letter today but I actually just forgot it. I mean I had it out. I didn’t mean to forget it; I just totally was running late today. But I didn’t mail my taxes and that was a… I didn’t have much time to think about it just because today… yesterday was such a busy day. But I’m trying to get better at mailing and writing letters because I mean… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, confronting that fear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Jeremy… bless Jeremy’s heart. I have him reread my letters and verify. Okay, I’m going to close the envelope. Is that okay? He’s like yes; yes it’s fine. And so I mean I’m going to try and get to the point where he doesn’t have to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you can trust yourself. You need a good goal to think about writing it. I mean you be the person that rereads it once, and then letting it go because that way, if you can work toward that, what you’re doing is you’re teaching yourself to tolerate a little bit of the anxiety rather than finding a solution that sort of makes it go away for you. [23:01] Because even though it feels like a relief when he reads it and says it’s okay, you’re sort of teaching yourself that you can’t be trusted, that you need somebody else to okay it, to check it, that you’re not letting yourself trust your own judgment. And then sit with whatever anxiety there is that your [inaudible] wasn’t right and then move on from it. And just like with hand washing, when you were worried that there was something, some sort of contaminant, whether you would transmit something to someone or you had picked up something gross, by washing your hands repeatedly it feels… you get that relief in the moment as soon as you washed them but it doesn’t teach you to kind of just let yourself be done and [inaudible] and if this… with e-mails or letter writing it’s the same thing. Him checking it is like you washing your hands again. So you want to see if you can set what’s an appropriate stance, which is washing once, which is rereading once, and then, yeah, you’re going to feel anxious when you let it go for sure, but if you can do that over and over, the anxiety will subside just like it did with hand washing. And you’re able to leave the bathroom now after washing once and not feel like you really need to go back. [24:14] That’s, I think, what you want to work toward, is finding what’s reasonable and what’s also teaching you, give yourself the message that your judgment is good enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and that’s… it’s really paid off, really paid off for me just to wash my hands once. And even when I’m around the house and baking something, I still want to rewash my hands because I’m like oh, no, and then I just have to take a deep breath and realize that it’s going to be okay. And… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s a difference between good hygiene and obsessive. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and plus the time that it takes, and the worrying. I mean I sort of go back… I mean I’ve gone… and I think… I really credit myself just because Christina gets on my case for eating on the subway and not washing my hands. Are you sure, you know how gross it is. I’m just well, I’m not laying on the poles and licking the poles. Maybe I’m touching them but I mean everyone has different standards. It’s just… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem to be okay. [25:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think maybe that’s sort of my problem. Sometimes Christina will… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you have some people in your life that reinforce extremes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or sometimes it feels like she’s kind of picking on me, like ewww, why would you do that. And I’m just like it doesn’t matter. And so I mean I don’t know how to respond when people say that and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I wouldn’t. And you don’t have to answer the question. How can you do that? I’m cool with it. And I think it sounds like Jeremy has some extreme tendencies as well, and it sounds like Christina does as well. And finding your own limit of what’s… there’s a range of what’s normal, big range of what’s safe, and it’s okay to be in there, that you don’t have to be to the extreme end. Good enough is good enough. And there’s some benefits to having the flexibility, to not having to perform things to a really extreme end. And I don’t think… you don’t have to have an answer for Christina because those kinds of questions are very judgmental, and letting it go unanswered or pointing out like oh, that sounds like a really judgmental question is a fine answer of setting… of… because that’s also setting your boundary. You don’t get to evaluate my choices. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, that actually… because then you’re not… I guess because she constantly does it over and over, and she’ll bring it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this new with baby or heightened with baby?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it just… Christina and I didn’t really talk before or share things. [27:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because sometimes people’s sort of fears of viruses and germs can get heightened when they have a baby, and rightly so. Baby doesn’t have an immune system that’s built up like an adult’s is, so sometimes you [inaudible] a little bit more…</p>

<p>CLIENT: More, yeah…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …observant and worried. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re an adult with a developed immune system that can handle lots of whatever’s floating around out there on the T. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I will say… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your body’s designed to fight against it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I’m around the baby I do make sure I wash my hands before I touch the baby. I think that’s definitely reasonable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because it’s a baby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean they were thinking about installing hand sanitizer stations in the house but… and making sure that everyone had their flu shot before they saw the baby. I mean these are… there’s nothing wrong with these things. I guess that’s their standards. But I didn’t get my flu shot just because I have a fear of getting the flu shot. I’d rather just ignore it and just make sure that when I’m around the baby [inaudible] go to the bathroom and wash my hands. So… and they haven’t said anything about that. They don’t question… I mean sometimes they… anytime someone goes to pick up the baby they put some hand sanitizer in their hands. But I can understand. [28:51] That’s their boundaries and it has to do with that they… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s their kid; they get to make decisions about their kid. But she… but for you putting a… the boundary there, where she can ask that you to do certain things because she wants to protect her newborn versus commenting on what you do for yourself as an adult. You’re not taking… you’re not feeding a baby on the T. The baby’s not touching stuff anyway. But putting a limit there. She can, if she wants to, install hand sanitizers in her house and make sure people use them before they touch her kid; that’s her stuff. But it doesn’t need to transfer over into your stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that’s… I mean that’s one reason why I was talking to my parents. I do… I mean my parents are sort of dysfunctional in their own way, but I sort of feel that they’re a little bit more relaxed on these things. And it’s nice. I sort of have a general… they’re definitely more… I think they see the bigger picture with some of these… and they don’t see the bigger picture in all areas so I guess no one’s perfect, but those sort of things that I try to convince myself not to worry about or… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like they have a fairly realistic view of that stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think maybe that just might be a thing of upbringing or just… but I think that’s a very smart idea, is just… I mean because I don’t tell her I think you should be breastfeeding or I mean those sort of boundaries. I realize that if she wants to raise the kid a certain way, I mean I’ll respect those if it has to do with me, but I don’t bring up judgmental questions like why don’t you do. I mean I never do. I just don’t ask people those… I just… I… in the big picture of things, as long as it doesn’t involve me, I could care very little. [30:43] I mean if it’s a friend I’m going to care for their well-being but… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But also using that same sort of barometer of there’s a wide range of what’s okay. It might not be the same as what you choose, but if it’s okay, if she were harming the child or if you felt like the child was at risk, then there’s a limit where you might want to step in and say I’m concerned. But these are not… breastfed, bottle fed, both are okay. No one’s being harmed there. Those are choices and… or sanitizer or no sanitizer, choices that are probably both okay. So using that same standard for yourself and others because I think you can sometimes be a harsh critic of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that’s… yeah, I mean and that’s… and I think that’s really what boiled down on Saturday, is that I cried twice that day and just… I told Jeremy, I was like I felt bad because I said that sometimes he’s the antagonist of me feeling overwhelmed. I mean it’s true. Sometimes… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just a sort of expectations and making sure that he gets out for walks. And there’s so much that I do to make…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like you get put in charge of…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and to make his… I mean I do enjoy spending time with him but there’s some… I guess I’m sort of at the point of my PhD where I just sort of feel like I just kind of want to rot… or not rot with my sciences but just sort of…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can put the blinders on and focus on one thing. Yeah, I wonder if you could do that. [32:26] It’s not forever but are there some things that you can cut out so you can sort of put the blinders on to some of these more peripheral things, so that you can finish this up and get it done. We need to wrap up. And I wanted to share from last time. So this book, I want to caution, it has some really good information but I want to caution you that it is… they wrote it for a younger audience than you and Jeremy, so some of the language feels sort of young a little bit. I don’t want you to feel condescended to, but the actual information is pretty good. It’s written in a straightforward way. So I think it might be helpful, and you’re welcome to just borrow it [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that’s perfect. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I put some little sections markers that I thought would be helpful, so things that I marked off were kind of some of the general physical… general physiology and physical stuff that might be helpful. And then… </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I actually… I did pick up a Cosmo and I did read, and I was very shocked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is written for a high school sex ed type of course. You’ll find it’s probably a little less… the terminology’s a little more straightforward and clinical, which sometimes is harder to read, sometimes easier. But take your time. Read through what’s helpful. Feel free to… </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, [inaudible] pretty [inaudible] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, thank you. [33:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, thank you so much. I must say I probably am at the high school level when it comes to this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I mean there’s also… I hesitated because it’s… I think if you’re a woman and if… the language in there is there is boy and girl, but the physiology doesn’t really change so…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, I mean I don’t think… I mean I actually… I read a lot of Wikipedia and so I’m… and my sister tells me all these clinical things about every sort of drugs and health things. So I’m very used to the clinical. And being from the sciences. So I don’t take [inaudible] of any…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I have us next for Tuesday the 29th at 1:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I didn’t have us scheduled for May. Do you want to pick some dates now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, let me get out my calendar. I just got this new phone and I’m getting used to it. And next time I’ll turn off… it’s pretty loud any time it… let’s see. On the 29th what time are we meeting?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had us at 1:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I can do 1:30 on all the Tuesdays in May, or if you want to skip. Sometimes we skip one. [35:05] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let’s see, in May maybe we could do three. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about we do 13th, 20th and 27th, unless you’re going away for Memorial Day weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I’m not going away for Memorial Day weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let’s do that. So let’s skip the 6th and do the last three.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can do them all at 1:30 so we’re nice and consistent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I will say getting here early, it wasn’t… getting here early is not my jam but I do feel that it set me up for starting the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if we want to switch to that in the summer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think maybe that would be… it depends on what my summer teaching schedule is but…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when you find out your summer teaching schedule we’ll sort of look at that. And I know we sort of moved away from the morning because it was really hard to get there. It’s also sometimes really hard to get here on time in the afternoon as well. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We’ll play with it and figure out what works best.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I think for the remainder of this year it’s a good idea. But yeah…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We’ll stick with what we have for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: For the summer school it’s going to be brutal. I have to get to school at 8:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that’s early. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the things you do for your job. I mean I guess I should be just happy that I get to teach summer school. Okay, so [inaudible] so 29, 13, 20, 27. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And [inaudible] pay [inaudible] $20 or $25 times 2 which is 50. [inaudible] bottom of the bag. [36:56] Yeah, I actually, surprisingly, didn’t really… I didn’t have sex ed. I… my mom signed me out of it so… which might be explaining some of this. So it’s good. Parents always want to do what they think is best, so I can understand. Thank you so much for fitting me in. That was very kind and I really appreciate it. It really does… coming to therapy on a regular schedule does really… I feel like I’m making more progress. But I guess that’s sort of generally how therapy is. You can’t just go once a year and work on things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn’t have quite the same affect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. I’ll see you in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. And for sure I’m going to have my phone on silent. It’s so loud. I’m so sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that’s okay. I think I forgot to silence mine as well today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I will say the alarm is powerful on this one. Wakes me up. And I haven’t figured it out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (7-minute silence) It's funny how many days I find it extremely hard to say anything.  And I think the main thing that is in my mind is I get feeling almost panicked that I won't have anything to say.  And I think I was thinking too of the remark you made yesterday of uhm, perhaps when I came in I had already stored things up to say and I, I think do do that because I know I didn't do it today.  And so all I could think of when I came in was, I don't know what to say.  I've nothing to say.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you take my remark to mean you shouldn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just thought it, it was, you know, an awareness that I do do this when I'm coming in.  So, so what I'm doing when I'm in here at the beginning is recalling things that had happened that I wanted to talk about.  Perhaps I took it as, as a comment on the fact that I shouldn't but I don't I'm not aware that I thought that way.  (Pause) Because I think I found one of the things that has made me feel good about coming is that afterwards you continue to think about things that you began to be a little bit more aware of and sometimes things begin to fall into place at least temporarily I sometimes get a sort of feeling of relief.  And then something might occur to me that I would like to talk about and then I do try to remember it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>The other thing that occurred to me (clears throat) while I was thinking I had nothing to say was fact that very often my husband will complain to me that when I do have something to say, it's usually in a complaining way but if I'm telling him about things that happened to me during the day it's usually things that are annoying or bad or unpleasant and things that I'm upset about rather than telling too much about things that are pleasant.  I do tell too about things that are pleasant but it seems the balance is on talking ab—, looking at things, looking actually almost for unpleasant things.  And then sort of pouring them all out on to his lap.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm giving him the responsibility for them when I do that.  Because then I feel sort of, they're not weighing on me anymore.  But they must weigh on him.  (Pause) And it's a funny thing too, I remember my mother saying when I was at my wedding or afterwards, just as I was about to leave, uhm, keep your own counsel because, I guess, I was inclined to say everything and anything that was in my mind and must have been generally unpleasant (chuckle) things and I suppose she was implying sometimes you, there are just things you shouldn't talk about or maybe you know something you shouldn't that you should just know and it shouldn't go any further and I do find it's hard to keep things to myself.  Although then I remember all those years in high school when I felt as if there was so much on my mind and I didn't talk to anybody about it, at least I don't recall talking to anybody about it.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Thinking back on your question just a little while ago I think probably my, after initially reacting when I was talking in here then I thought back on the remark about my stirring up things and I think probably my first inclination was to think now which way did you mean it, did you mean it as something I shouldn't do or is it alright for me to do it?  (Pause) And perhaps one reason why I get feeling sort of panicked when I have nothing to say is that I feel you'll feel very impatient that I'm not saying anything, or even disapprove.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you think I'll be impatient or disapprove if you don't say anything, what do you imagine would happen then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not aware of imagining anything happening, I just feel extremely  uncomfortable and frustrated and nervous.  (Pause) Just, just having anybody's disapproval has always upset me a lot.  (Pause) And also the, I know it's ridiculous, but even though I may not like everybody I can't stand to be aware of the fact someone may not like me and if I know somebody is inclined, (cough) perhaps not even strong as not like me but isn't particularly interested in me, then I will make more of an effort to be friendly than to somebody that is already being friendly to me.  (Pause) Probably why I hesitate on doing so many things, just being afraid I might incur somebody's disapproval even if it is somebody I don't know, just somebody passing me on the street looking at me would disturb me if I think then that they disapprove.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I think this is one of the things that bothered me so in, in my feeling about being at home with my family is just sort of a general feeling of disapproval.  (Pause) And I know, I'm sure some of what, some of that that I feel now is based on the fact that for a long time I was a very unpleasant person and I know I was a very unpleasant person but even before then I think that well, I, I knew anyway that certain things would not be approved of and certain things would be and I didn't know where I stood, where, how I felt about the things that were approved of or disapproved of and I wasn't sure that what my parents approved of, such as working hard and keeping your nose to the grind stone and things like that were things that I really wanted to do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mention that you had not liked my referring to your job or your task here —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Job is —</p>

<p>ANALYST: — as talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: — The word (chuckle).</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.  Is there any connection between that and your feeling I would be impatient if you didn't talk?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose so.  Because I suppose I then think well, this is what I'm supposed to be doing here.  And I think sometimes I'm wondering if, well, sometimes I get self-conscious about what I am saying and wondering if, if I'm just saying stupid things or irrelevant things or something like that.  And then I feel perhaps you're being, you might be feeling disapproval because I'm not really saying anything.  But other days, I, I don't know, I just don't seem to have any trouble at all and, and I almost do then become unaware of your being there except that I'm aware that I'm talking to somebody, you know, I'm not just talking in an empty room.  But that I don't think about how you feel or well, I'm sure I always think somewhat about how you feel, because sometimes I find I can't say something that comes to my mind right when it does, or I have to think of a very euphemistic way to put it.  (Pause) But I'm, it's just after yesterday when it just seemed that ev—, as I remember yesterday, it all just came so easily and I f—, I felt good after yesterday.  And after a day like that I keep expecting that every other day will be the same way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you said you had a feeling that you, talk to, that you almost forget that I'm here, but then you become aware that you're talking to somebody, you mean somebody other than me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, just, I, I think what I meant by being almost unaware, was just simply not thinking in terms of your approving or disapproving or anything.  Except when something occasionally something will come into my mind that I just find I can't say it right when it comes into my mind.  But then I, but every often I can see that unless I say it I'm just going to try to get around it and I'm not going to get around it so eventually I'll say it some form or other but maybe I'll try to put a little more distance between me and the subject before I can say it.  (2 Min silence) Something that occurred to me today after meeting the mothers of the children I'm teaching.  So many of the children you could see not exactly why they are the way they are, but so many little things about them that were so much like their mothers and of course it probably would be the same with, way with their fathers.  But then I was just thinking if I were, how a teacher would have seen me, having met my mother and what little things of my mother they would have seen in me.  Because I can remember so often thinking in terms of not wanting to be, have certain aspects of my mother or certain aspects of my father and I must have felt or thought in terms of the ones that I did want, but it seems much more that I was thinking in terms of what I didn't want.  And my uh mother's mother lived with us for a time, uhm, after my grandfather died she came to live with us and then would, I think she might have been with us all year for several years and then she began going to ad in the winter but she was a very easy person to have in the house.  I think it's it must be very hard thing to do and she didn't try to interfere very often, and uhm, she would rarely do anything with us directly, you know, in disciplining or anything, unless my parents were away, and then she was the one in charge.  And in many ways I think I used to hold her up as what I would like to try to become.  And to the point of practically idolizing her and remember one time I was talking about it to e and he at this point I think had probably started analysis.  Anyway, he was becoming very aware of what attitudes his parents, anyway, had had toward being either male or female, and, and how this affected him and uhm, it's been I think, quite evident my mother doesn't, has had some very strange attitudes about being female, and uhm, I used to think my grandmother was the one who was so very feminine, and he, he surprised me by saying, well, she's probably the reason your mother is the way she is (chuckle).  That she had certain attitudes too, which were a little bit, I don't know, strange isn't the right word but that she didn't seem to like completely being a female either.  And I know I didn't.  But I think, she's quite ill now and I was thinking about why it upset me so much because she's in her 90's and I hardly ever see her and when I do, there's so little really to say to each other anymore because she is so much a part of, well, she's just so much not a part of my life.  And no matter how sweet she is and, and she's always had a nice little sense of humor and all but visits would become kind of a sense of duty more than anything else.  But it's almost this ideal I've made her into being that I find extremely upsetting to think of her as dying.  Because then it, it would be the end of that ideal.  And too, maybe I'm making this part up but I think I always felt she cared about me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>My mother always let me just have a tantrum if I were going to and, if she'd make me be in my room but my grandmother would, if she ever knew I was having one, would stop me having one by sort of shock treatment and, I mean, I, I looked upon this as really caring.  That she cared enough to hit me to stop me from being whatever I was being.  (Pause) And I th—, I imagine I also felt she was interested in me and things happening to me without judging me or just that she approved of me enough so that it would take an awful lot before she would start really judging me.  And whereas my father sending me all those things about being a grind used to annoy me terribly.  She used to constantly be after me with little things on not smoking and not drinking and it, I just found it sort of amusing.  (Pause) And she also had an ease with people that neither of my parents seemed to have.  My mother might have but my father was so shy that I d—, they just, she had to kind of fight to entertain at all and, I don't know, she was always— you could kind of see her tensely going through a certain pattern every time but I think I admired my grandmother or just liked to see her in action because she seemed so very much at ease and she does have the ability of thinking about another person when she's with them so that she's not self-conscious and centering things on herself.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You said she lived with you for several years.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, uhm, well, I guess, I don't know when she came to live with us, but sometime in the early fifties I know she came, or maybe, my grandfather died in the, oh, some place around 19XX and it could have been any time after that.  I think for a while she lived in her house still.  Because I remember my uhm, I don't know, my, my uncle lived in part of the house for a while and I don't know if that was after or before my grandfather died.  And I know that it was very hard on my mother having her there.  Because they were quite different and just things like my grandmother liked cooking and sewing and things like that, which my mother would do but she didn't like them.  And it was only after all of us were pretty much out of the house that she seemed to really take some kind of pleasure in cooking.  Because so often she was going off to committee meetings or something.</p>

<p>This is another thing that used to really annoy me and too, I felt that if she really cared about us as children, she wouldn't have always been going of to something.  But we'd either have tv dinners or else she'd slap on the table some old roast and we'd have it the same old way night after night.  And, and again, I just (clears throat) I didn't like eating that way and I took it again as a lack of interest in us.  Although now I think (clears throat) to be fair to her, I think she was terribly frustrated because she hated being just in the house and doing housework.  And she felt, I think a lot of pressure from all the little things that you have to do when you have four children and I don't know quite why she got into comm—, lots of committee work but it must have been the only thing she knew to get herself out of the house, and I don't think really liked that either.  But I think she did like the fact that she was considered good at it so people always wanted her and I'm sure she was flattered by that.  Maybe that is why she continued in it.  I used to think, I wondered what she'd done that she liked.  Because she was uhm a social worker when, before she was married and then for a while after she was married and uhm, I imagine there are a lot of frustrations with that, because, especially then, it wasn't a field that was highly developed.  And there was probably a lot of inefficiency in things that drove her crazy to see happening but just from little things she said, it sounds like she hated doing that too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>She's a little less, I don't know, tight I guess you could say now, but I can I think it used to seem to me that she has one female friend who's been very close to her for oh, years since, I guess since high school, although this friend is a little bit older, and the only time I think she really relaxes and is just spontaneous and enjoys herself, although I'm sure she does at other times, but it strikes me or it used to strike me that the only time she would was with this woman.  And this woman used to be visiting us a lot because she lost her husband when she was fairly young and they lived close by and her children were about the age of uhm, well, one is a little older than my older sister and one was a little younger than my older sister, so, they used to do a lot of things with us.</p>

<p> And then it's almost like my father is an outsider when they're being that way together.  And I think he feels that way because he sometimes will say awfully cutting things to her, to et, the woman, and yet I know he likes her and I know he feels a certain sense of responsibility for her because he was asked by her husband to sort of make sure she was alright when he was dying.  And my father is a type of person that takes something like that very seriously.  But she's sort of scatter brained and just drives him crazy.  And she's very funny about it, but when he is enjoying the funny aspects it almost seems like he's kind of cutting at her too, and sort of making her look like a fool.  Because that is what he has, it seems like he has to do to anybody he doesn't approve of or anybody who annoys him for any reason whatsoever.  He seems to have to make them look foolish.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I can sort of see the way my grandmother did, I don't know whether her mother even began it, but, began a certain attitude that my mother had and that I certainly had had, of feeling that you had to do something more than just keeping a home and having children in order to contribute or justify your existence, sort of make it meaningful in some way and I know this is something bothered me terribly.  And I suppose it still does, although I feel a little more that I've come to terms with being a woman, but even now I can't imagine just staying at home and keeping house.  And then I used to think well maybe I can't imagine that because I've never seemed to have ha—, developed any hobbies or interests or known what to do with free time and so I'm afraid all I'll do is make lots of little jobs for myself and that since hate I them and I hate housework, then I'll just be (chuckle) very unhappy at what I'm doing.  But maybe it's more, it used to be that I really just felt you had to be doing some great thing that everybody would recognize in order to make yourself worthwhile.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I just wondered too if uhm, I was thinking about the fact that I used to go out for sports but I never, I could do them alright, but I, I've never been extremely athletic and then my older sister who's not really athletic, but she's always had this great drive to be out doing things like climbing or skiing and she really pushes herself when she's doing these things, way beyond anything I've ever been able to push myself or had any interest in doing.  And when I won't push myself the way she does, I know she doesn't approve of me and my father thinks that this way she drives herself is wonderful because he does the same thing.  But I was just wondering if that's her way of kind of trying to be something more than just a female.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And just thinking about the one thing that really I think torments my grandmother right now and has for several years because well, she's had a stroke I guess it is, she's paralyzed now so must, if she's able to think about it, it must be on her mind all the time, but it used to be too when she was in a nursing home and just not, just so weak she couldn't really do too much, uhm, that she just felt so useless and that she was just kind of existing and doing nobody any good and therefore why did she have to exist.  And this really bothered her so I can see where she must have always had that attitude of, you have to be meaning something to other people in order to justify being alive.  And it used to bother her too for a FEDW years before she went into a nursing home (clears throat) because she'd be around the house and she was already too weak to do much of anything, and her eyesight wasn't good enough to do sewing.  And it just frustrated her terribly that she couldn't be doing something and being useful.</p>

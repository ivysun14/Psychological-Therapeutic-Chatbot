<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) One thing that's been on my mind since last night is, uhm, well, it suddenly struck me that what I was doing with MSCZ, especially this week and probably many other times, was forcing him, reacting to him in a rather — well, certainly not responding to him and, and therefore being cold and unkind in a way, or thoughtless and forcing him in the end, instead of being good humored about it to finally just get mad at me and just say he wasn't going to take any more of the kind of treatment I was giving him.  And then as soon as he did that, I'd start feeling differently.  And even if — well, I was just thinking, last night, when I came home, he was there.  And, and I hadn't expected him to be and I felt very happy that he was.  But almost immediately after, I got as far as expressing that I was happy he was but then almost immediately I found it very hard to continue to feel that way.  And then eventually in the evening, when I kept sort of withdrawing more and more, he finally just got mad at me.  And then after he got mad at me I felt very different.</p>

<p>And somehow it just seemed related to the way my father was always getting cross at me.  Sometimes when I was older it was either of us egging the other one on so we were always fighting.  But then as soon as we'd had a fight or his, after he had been cross with me, I'd always sort of make up to him.  And I seem to be forcing MSCZ to have the same type of relationship with me.  Almost as if I can't show my feelings unless I feel guilty about having been, well, mean or thoughtless to someone.  And then I, then, when I feel guilty, I can show my feelings to some extent.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And into this reaction with MSCZ is something else that, uhm, well, I'm just confused about it.  Because sometimes I have reactions that seem to belie how I feel and, and I just don't understand how I can control them.  But yet sometimes I think I really use this inabil—, inability to always express how I feel as an excuse to get his sympathy.  And I think I was mentioning it before, that I'm trying to force him into sort of babying me or feeling sorry for me, which seems to be something I do with an awful lot of people, more or less.  (Clears throat, pause) And if I look at things this way, I can see why so often I'm, I have such a negative attitude about things.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Another thing that's on my mind is something that just happened this afternoon.  And it's, well, I probably talked about it before because it happens all the time when MSCZ asks me if I'd like to go to the theater or do something in the evening.  And up until that point I will have wanted to and there'll be several things that I'd like to see, whether it's a play or a movie.  But as soon as he asks me in this way, sort of, "You make up your mind and then we'll do it."  Even though I know, as soon as I say something, if he doesn't want it he'll disagree, I just go blank and I just feel as if I can't, I don't have the energy to make, make up my mind.  And somehow it just becomes a very emotional thing.  And it's gotten to the point now where he's doing it more just to force me to make up my mind and so I resist all the more.  And then I don't want to go at all.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it just puzzles me, if I have several choices that I did want to see previously, why it is that I have to, that I still want him to be the one to finally decide and say, "This is what we're doing."  Because if he had just called up and told me he had tickets for something without even asking me, then I might initially feel annoyed he hadn't asked me but in the end I'd go with a fair amount of anticipation.  But the fact that I was in on the decision just ruins it.  And somehow I think I compare it in my mind to having to make a choice when we're at a restaurant.  It's, it's almost as if, what if what I choose won't be as good as what somebody else has.  And so what if the play we go to isn't as good as another one we could have gone to?  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I often prefer going to movies.  And I have always thought recently, since this has started to happen — I used to love going to plays, but recently it's just seemed to be — well, I used to tell myself well, I don't have the energy because I think it, seeing a play demands much more from au—, an audience than a, than often a movie will.  And I thought that was the reason.  But right now it occurs to me that just the difference in price has a lot to do with, well, if I make a mistake with choosing a movie it isn't quite so serious because it didn't cost as much.  And I find it very hard to sometimes spend what you have to spend to go to a play.  And it seems silly because I might go to 10 movies for 1 play and spend more on all these movies.  But I guess it's, my spending more, the commitment is that much more.  And then if it doesn't, if it isn't that good, then I feel the mistake is much worse.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And this just makes me think of how I spend my money anyway.  In a way I've always been either very miserly and I'll go without a lot of things that I could have, that don't really cost that much and then I'll suddenly go on a splurge and sort of, without real planning or thinking, spend a great deal of money.  It's almost as if I've finally worked myself up into spending it and then when I, and then I just spend without control.  And then I go back into being very miserly again.  (Clears throat, pause) I wasn't quite that bad this year because I know that's how I do things so I tried to plan better but I still did all my spending right around Christmas time, both for gifts and, and clothes I needed.  (6-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was thinking again about my reaction to this evening and well, sort of feeling what the tension that I put myself into, sort of fighting with myself, since I do feel the way I do.  And then I'll start thinking that it's so ridiculous to feel this way when all I'm about to do is something that should be very enjoyable and I should be able to enjoy it.  It just seems so wrong not to be able to.  And so I end up fighting myself.  One, on one side I'm sort of berating myself for feeling that way and on the other side, I do feel, well MSCZ used the term, I'm in a fog.  And that is the way I feel.  And I was just wondering too what — so often what I do do is for some definite purpose, to get people to react a certain way to me.  And I can't quite see what purpose I have in taking the attitude I do so often about making choices or wanting MSCZ to make the choice.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was your choice?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, in the end MSCZ ends up wanting to see a revue, despite — well, we couldn't get tickets for the plays that I had wanted to see.  And actually, as so often happens, I'd much prefer just to go to a movie because somehow it just seems easier.  And then MSCZ decided he wanted to see some one of several revues and even though I don't know anything about any of them, it just — I mean previews, go to some preview.  Uhm, it's just easier, again, to have him make the decision.  But just this way I'm going into it, feeling I almost don't care, —</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's interesting because you, you never did say which one.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Which play?</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not sure what that might mean but it is like you —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't want to admit my choice.  (Laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I'm not sure.  But you didn't say.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think I do feel that way a little bit.  Because when MSCZ asks me, my reaction is, "Well, you are going to want something else, so I'm not going to tell you what I want."  Well, I wanted to see, uhm, "Hadrian the 7th."  And then I'd heard that "40 carats" were good.  So both of those, I was trying to get tickets for, which we couldn't.  And then I'd heard that, uhm, some people at school had liked "Funny girl."  And I wanted to go to that.  But for some reason, when MSCZ asked me what movie I wanted to see, if I wanted to see a movie, I found it very hard to tell him that that was the one I wanted to see because I'm not sure I'll like it and I'm not sure he'll like it.  And so having to commit myself there was very hard.  And that was the same with any other plays.  I just wouldn't even make up my mind on any others because I was too unsure about them.  (Pause) But I don't see why I put such importance on it, either.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.  But, but you still haven't said.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  What?  What we're going to see?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh!  That's what you meant by, you didn't want him to tell you or he didn't want to tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't even remember the names because I hadn't heard of them before.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And I just didn't care.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  At that point well, I was angry at him for introducing something new, I think.  And then it was a real unknown, maybe it really wouldn't be any good.  Some of the previews we've gone to before have been just awful.  And they still cost as much as when they're in their regular season.  And (pause) I think maybe there's a little bit, too, of, when I have decided what I want, it's the same thing as I've talked about before in other situations: uhm, I make up my mind what I want and then I can't get tickets for it.  And I can hardly handle the disappointment or whatever I feel when, after I've decided what I want, I can't do it.  So it's just better not to make up your mind than to make it up and then not be able to handle how you feel about it when you can't do it.  Because after having decided on the 2 plays that I did particularly want to go to, my reaction now is, even though I was told there were no tickets, is to go to the theaters and see if there've been any that have been handed in, not give up.  And I sort of think, well, there has to be a way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So, it's not solely a matter of, you can't make up your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I guess not.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's, ah, something a little different.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Now that I think about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's as though, if you really made up your mind, that's that and nothing else will suffice.  So then you can't make up your mind about any alternative, which is a little different.  It's as though what you really want, you want so much that nothing else will suffice.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But yet, when I think about that, I don't really want any of those things so much.  It's just that if I make up my mind on it, then it's, I can't accept that I can't have it.  I mean it's a much m—, well, it seems almost more immature than the way you've put it.  Because I was thinking too, if, uhm, we are going to do something, and it could be a num—, a variety of things, it could be going to the theater or the movies or a party or a, any type of thing that a person would look at as entertainment and fun, uhm, and if something causes the thing to be cancelled, I have a very unreasonable feeling of disappointment and, well, I was going to say anger.  Anger I don't know at what, but that I can't control the circumstances and whatever the emotions are, I, I think I just ended up feeling it's better just not to get involved so much that I'll have these emotions.  Because somehow I feel as either they're too strong to control or else I feel that it's unreasonable that they be so strong.  (Pause) That must be why I like, I, or I choose to stay at home much more than wanting to do things, because then I at least, whatever I do decide to do, I have complete control over.  And if I decide I'm going to sit down and read a book, I know I'll be able to do that.  And then everything's much safer then.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I think that must be why, too, if MSCZ says, "What would you like to do?"  I often don't want to just tell him.  Because he might want something different and then we'll have to work out a compromise and I find that very difficult too once I decided what I want to do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: And that would work the same way, I suppose, if, uhm, when you have the idea it would be better if he would just decide and then you'd go and you wouldn't have to worry and think about it, then you never face what you really want and feel the disappointment of not getting it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That would protect you there, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Well, it just goes back and it just occurred to me it's that basic, well, pattern that I have of either having to be in control completely, making all the decisions or else being completely the follower and, and being told exactly what I'm doing.  (Pause) And since I see this pattern from so many different angles, with so many different emotions involved in the different situations, it makes me wonder if it's really the same thing.  Or at least, when I think of it in terms of making a decision about what to do for this evening, I can't relate it at all to something that I remember relating this pattern to before, of thinking of, uhm, my father always yelling at my mother and being very aggressive and my mother always being very passive.  And I remember at that time it (clears throat) that I was caught in the middle between seeing these 2 different roles and perhaps copying both of them at different times.  Now it doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't seem to relate in the same way.  Or, I, I don't make the connection.  It just seems to be very simply, I want what I want.  Well, I guess that's what my father was doing then.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, you made that very plain, that you feel that you were just an extension of him.  His interest in you was solely as you reflected on him and did what he wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And now I can see, too, in trying to be, I suppose, a good wife to him, my mother, instead of, or not to have a lot of family fights, instead of trying to work out compromises, just, it's almost as if she just kind of gave up and let him make the decisions so there wouldn't be a lot of conflict.  I mean, just even in the way he treated her, instead of doing anything about it she just very quietly took it because it just was easier.  And then he'd feel guilty and be very apologetic but there was never any working out of something between them.  It was just simply his hitting her, in effect, with words and then feeling sorry that he'd hurt her.  (Pause) Which takes me back to what I was doing with MSCZ and — although, instead of just taking it, he'd, he'd also tell me about it and it was only when he reached the point where he wouldn't take it anymore that then I'd feel sorry and be very contrite and so forth, just the way my father was with my mother.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I've sometimes wondered too, just in thinking in terms of how much I behave because of what I saw my parents do, if the reason I have such trouble knowing how I feel about sex is because I never saw any signs of it between them.  So it was almost as if they had completely renounced it or, or wouldn't admit it or just didn't have any such relationship.  And so however I might feel and want it, it's almost as if I have to reject it too because it wasn't a part of my parents' life as far as I ever could see.  And even in imagining (clears throat) when they, when they were behind their closed door I never could imagine them being close or having any sexual relationship at all.  Because it just didn't seem that a couple who could be, especially my father, be so embarrassed about just kissing my mother hello when he came home or good bye when he left, or at least he looked embarrassed, he certainly — it was sort of a perfunctory thing, anyway, that they could ever want to have any kind of physical contact when they weren't in public.  (Pause) And somehow, knowing that they had to have had some kind of a relationship or else they wouldn't have had 4 children, doesn't help at all.  It just seems like something unreal.  And the real thing is, the, the thing that seems most real to me is really the part that isn't.  Because I can remember when I was smaller, being very puzzled at the fact that I was a true daughter of my parents.  And I just couldn't understand how it could have happened.  And I had to accept I was because I looked too much like both of them, but otherwise it would have been very easy to believe I'd been adopted.  Because I couldn't understand how they had intercourse even 1 time in order to conceive me and certainly not 4 times.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But I suppose in a way what seems real to me is the real thing too because I was just thinking that, however much of a sexual relationship they did have, I think in a way my father was rejecting it all the time and does reject that aspect of being a human being.  Just the fact he doesn't like having contact with, physical contact with people, even within his family and he doesn't like looking people in the eye and he doesn't like seeing people holding hands in public.  And, I don't know, just so many things that he reacted so strongly to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You feel there's a sexual connotation in looking people in the eye?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I thought about that afterwards, what, why I'd felt so uncomfortable yesterday.  And perhaps I do, I don't know.  Except, the only thing that came to my mind was that there was something intimate about that.  You don't just look anybody in the eye.  (Pause) And I don't know whether the fact that I put so much on looking somebody in the eyes is because of having seen my father so, well, so often avoid looking anybody in the eyes.  It's just sort of a joke now between MSCZ and me, if not between other people and other friends and me, of the way my father just can't look anybody in the eyes when he's talking to them, at all.  (Clears throat) So maybe if he found it so hard, I must have assumed that it meant a great deal to do it.  It's almost like, too, you're showing your face if you're looking at somebody's eyes and then perhaps you're showing a lot more about yourself than you might want to.  Because he doesn't even just sort of look around the person's face, he looks away or looks down.  I mean, he really averts his face.  (Silence) And I think there's something connected, of looking at a person and listening to a person so that you really understand what's happening to the person.  And I don't think my father can do it at all and I rarely do.  Because we're both thinking about ourselves so much.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

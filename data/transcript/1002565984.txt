<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you guys today:</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Nice to see you reading over there.  So great.  So we're set to go over—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] asthma and growth for both guys.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just realized I walked in here without printing out both charts.  So I will do that so you can bring that home 'cause I would that closely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So since we were together in three months, [PATIENT NAME] has grown .4 of a pound.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yay, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're still fourth percentile and he's not grown in any inches.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Forty eight and a half inches.  So, still petite.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But holding his own.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is good.  So, let me print that out.  How's the eating going?  What do you like to eat these days, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] likes pasta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] picky eater.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you like milkshakes or ice cream or anything that fills you up a little bit more?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  See, there's no, um, eggnog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now we have to go back to our smoothies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course, I forgot, you're the eggnog man.  That's right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're going to have to boost you a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Any troubles going to the bathroom with all these picky foods?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about sleeping?  Any troubles going to sleep, falling asleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's hard to go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And what do you do when it's hard to go to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just lay in your bed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, then eventually sleep comes.  Do you find that you're coughing in your sleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He takes his allergy medicine at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, I don't if the Zyrtec helps better then, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you taking any other medications right now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Zyrtec and the Singulair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Singulair.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you know, I saw that warning on the FDA—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something we're supposed to chat about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, we supposed to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We've been fielding a lot of phone calls.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The warning was there that there've been a couple of case reported to the FDA of kids having psychological issues with the Singulair, probably attributed to the Singulair.  And there's another, two other medicines in that family that are also having the same issues.  There was one case of somebody feeling suicidal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But just crazy weird thoughts, racing thoughts.  We've had patients in this office over the years, the FDA warning wasn't used 'til up here 'cause we've had a couple sickly toddlers that have really, personalities changed dramatically, stopped the medication, personality came back.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I think the upshot is for all of us to be aware of our kids as well.  If there been no personality changes, to discontinue.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct, which is why I didn't call because, I mean, I would've [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the way it comes across with [NAME OTHER] and the nightly news, we all of sudden realize we have to stop and we then we have to think about what really [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so part of us being together today is to see how is that Singulair working 'cause it is a preventative medicine for asthma.  So you did a great job on you [INAUDIBLE], his breathing in and out are very crisp and clear.  And what we did was we could tell based on how tall you are, we can predict how well you're lungs are going to work.  And that's what this number is here.  And then, what we did was, we measured how much, this line here, is how much air can you blow out in that first second.  Can you blow out as much air into this little tube as you can the first as we predict and you did?  You did 100 percent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good job, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is excellent.  When we look at this number down here, this is your smaller airway.  That's all the way down here, and that's where, with asthma, the air can back.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If the ones aren't squeezing as well, air gets trapped down there.  And he blew out 77 percent of what we expect him to do.  Can be very normal for some people.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or it can signify maybe we need a little bit better protection.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, how is this now compared to the last time he did the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good question.  Uh, looking at, uh, I figure the Albuterol, the number did change a little bit to 86 percent and 107 percent.  So there definitely has been some improvement.  I think this computer is acting like it's already Friday.  Come on in.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	I'm sorry, this is for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, thank you.  All right.  And there I'll just have to say, I don't have PFT in here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, probably paper, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I was going to, I have to pull his paper chart.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Do you want me to get that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can get that, [INAUDIBLE].  I'll be right back.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	So how have you been doing?  You doing good?  Yeah.  Have you had any problems with you breathing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he doesn't have [INAUDIBLE] very often.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, I don't know if that's good or bad.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Well, if he doesn't need it, that's great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or he forgets to do it right.  But he's pretty good about taking his medication every night.  So that's good.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Anything else been going on?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he's starting baseball.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	That'll kind of challenge those lungs.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Exactly.  You know that's a good point.  Yes, 'cause he does get tired when he, uh, he runs a lot.  So—</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Well, there's not running in baseball at all so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Actually, there's less running in baseball than soccer, I think.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	That's true.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's a lot of down time.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Do you play soccer?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Thank you ma'am.  So the PFT with you a while ago, December of '04, um, the smaller airways were a little better and actually got worse, actually we gave him the, the Albuterol.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's when he was younger and he couldn't, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, you can see that's much more jagged than, um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just he took the test, that age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think some testing artifact.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would agree 'cause in each case, things went down.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, where's that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually, this from '05 and this one was from '04.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] even wrote on here that you were very congested and had a cold so it was hard to breathe when you were doing that.  But this, as you can see, that much more jagged than what you did today now that you're more mature.  So, the correlation between the two is not completely as helpful as one would hope.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But we'll put it in the chart anyway.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was just curious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's a good question.  I appreciate you asking it.  So I would, the way I would look at this is, I think the Singulair is helping.  Could he get more help with his asthma?  Perhaps with an inhaled steroid, um, like Flovent or Pulmicort or something like that.  I wonder if this baseline number could be higher on an inhaled steroid, which might be a different kind of prevention in his lungs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he has the Singulair and the Zyrtec and that other inhaler.  Is it Flovent?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You taking the Flovent now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he's not taking it right now.  Well, it's past today, he's supposed to do it twice a day.  And he forgets sometimes to do it.  So, I don't know if that's bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I would do it twice a day.  Put an extra toothbrush, do you brush your teeth twice a day?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So put an extra toothbrush 'cause you've got to brush your teeth or, or swish and spit after you take it anyway.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And let's see if we can improve this even just a little bit.  Again, 77 percent is not a disaster.  It's not, uh, life long and cause of major troubles, but if we can improve the architecture of his lung by decreasing inflammation there, we're heading into the spring season with all the allergies.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's give him the maximum protection possible.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  So do you hear that, [PATIENT NAME]?  You have to do the Flovent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  Twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two puffs twice a day plus your Singulair.  How much are you needing Albuterol at all right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not very, uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very, very seldom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So at least from an Albuterol need, his asthma is in great control.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is good.  So, what I'm really gunning here and I'm being persnickety about it, protecting those lower airways.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There have been some studies in the last year or so that look at those lower airways in young children and watching those young airways grow up, and people in their 40's that weren't well protected because we had Flovent when we were kids are showing to have some destruction in their lungs with the inflammation, that lifelong inflammation of the lungs from the asthma is causing their lungs to be not as compliant as one would hope for a healthy [AGE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's doing his brotherly duty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll just put you on a chair and spin you.  So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  Flovent twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Try the Flovent twice a day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Singulair at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Zyrtec at night.  It's a great idea probably not interfering with his sleep very much.  That's probably not the reason why he's [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, if they the pollen and stuff bothers you, you can use like salt water nose squirts to help flush out you nose, wash your hands after you, and your face after you've been outside.  Get the pollen away.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, I'd recommend that we repeat this again, you know, in two months or so and just if the daily Flovent has made difference.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's that sound [PATIENT NAME]?  Good.  So, we printed out your growth chart here for [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can see the percentile as we said, uh, his weight still in the lowest range, height still in the lowest range, but for him, doing great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], um, since we were last together, he's actually gained two pounds.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He actually jumped percentiles a little bit, which is very exciting.  And then, looking at his height, he's grown just a wee little bit, statistically keeps him at the same percentile.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's, there's still—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How are the charts?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's still on the charts 'cause I think she printed out the body mass index, which for your kids is funny.  They have no body mass.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So I wanted to thank you very much for the recommendation for [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  I want to get to that too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's phenomenal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  He's said very nice things about you, too.  He came to our office to teach us about what he's doing now.  I think within a week or two after your first appointment and he thought that you and your husband have the whole package well in place and, and that you're going to do fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's amazing and he's [INAUDIBLE] when I need to and his response was [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  Are you seeing differences?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.  We've seen huge differences.  He put him on Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, because he felt if he lowers his anxiety level, his attention would, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come in play.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  So, it didn't work exactly like I wanted to, still has his attention issues, but he's a more calmer kid and sleeping in his own bed and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And just, you know, very socially engaged.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was huge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But even most kids today don't look me in the eye or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But both of them today, it just made my whole day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  That whole social piece, so again, that social piece in him being [INAUDIBLE] is not always acting appropriately because he doesn't know how to.  You have to develop that skill.  Issues we've got to deal with, but we're getting there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that can be learned.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you have something to work with.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.  Exactly.  So it's, I never had to punish him because he was always in his own world kind of thing and now he's engaging and, oh, this is what you can do, this is what you can't do.  It's kind of funny to do that in [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Interesting.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, his still on the Prozac and the attention is irregular.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But not the long lasting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause now he swallows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was very good.  So, [INAUDIBLE] with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You hate to put your kids on all these, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure and I know it's a very thoughtful, difficult decision for you and dad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but I knew there was just one piece I couldn't get my hands on and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] nailed it with the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm telling you he nailed it, gave him [INAUDIBLE] and I was all skeptical.  I was like, why.  [INAUDIBLE] kind of thing, you know.  It's like, it's due behavior stuff for all that inside, but really, and it shouldn't be long lasting.  He's very positive about that, how kids don't need it as they go into their teens so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, 'cause you now have the window of opportunity to teach him all the strategies that he won't need the medication.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause it's only been since December.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was Jan, actually January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  He's amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's good.  You guys deserve it.  It was the hardest—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was [INAUDIBLE] whole five years [INAUDIBLE] so thank you very, very, very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is just back in town in the last year or so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, I didn't know he was here before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He trained here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, I don't know if he was classmates with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or right around that time.  He was part of a five year program.  So he's a board certified adult psychiatrist, child psychiatrist and pediatrician.  And then, he went off to the [DEIDENTIFIED] and did all this research stuff and now he's back here with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] doing mostly research.  His clinical practice is very small.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very, very, very small.  And I was very thankful to have him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But we have always precept, in fact before [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] this morning, every Friday morning someone in this office, usually [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is in the psychiatry clinic teaching [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and his peers pediatrics.  And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] have been doing it for 40 years.  So we formed a relationship with that program, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] knows us and so he has always said whenever we need whatever and he came to give us his personal number, and said, I know I'm busy, but if you have patients that need to come on in, just give us a call.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So thank you.  He was like manna from heaven.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You deserve it.  Well, he's, he's right on the research team and knows everything about everything.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Besides being brilliant, he has his finger on a lot of stuff so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he related so well in that first meeting.  It was, that for me, was huge [INAUDIBLE] that connection.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It just felt safe enough to take to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm glad.  All right.  So, you guys are growing.  You're doing well in school.  We're get your lungs just a tweak little bit better or at least try to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything else we can do to help today?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're going to get you guys off to school.  Do you need notes for school that we were here together today.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's fine.  Um, one little thing about [PATIENT NAME], he's developed a phobia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phobia of what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Spiders and bugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, I actually e—mailed [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, um, that it's just a little weird thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it just out of the blue or has he actually had an experience that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just out of the blue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This week.  Full blown.  Scared to go outside.  Kind of worrying about summer kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have bugs in your home.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  Bugs and bees and spiders [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, interesting.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] preteen thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But hopefully, he won't have a lot of exposures and you guys can keep talking about and talk—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And talk him through it.  Things will get better.  Very interesting.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hope some things get a little calmer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Well, you don't have to stay calm forever.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Here we go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Gentlemen, thank you so very much for coming.  I love good news about all three of you guys.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, I should book an appointment for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'll do another pulmonary function test in two months, if that's all right, please.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  So, we'll do it after school.  Please don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.  Yeah, [NAME OTHER] in charge of all those scheduling things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can do it when school's out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Should I do a weight check and the same time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, the weight check come with the PFT 'cause that's how we predict what his predictable will be, but we can always take a look at [PATIENT NAME] weight along the way, too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never a problem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okie doke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Have a good weekend.</p>

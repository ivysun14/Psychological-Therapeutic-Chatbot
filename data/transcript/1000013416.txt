<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little tired. I was up... I was up working until about 7:00 this morning. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were up all night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I went home and I slept for a few hours and then I got up a little later and then I should have... but so, anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Crisis at work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just something that... I wouldn't call it a crisis, but just something that's been nagging for a long time and a lot of people are screaming to get it done. So, I guess it's a... a crisis in that sense but, yeah. However, I actually went to work all night the other... the last couple of days ago also. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of... I don't know. I mean, I... I don't mind doing the work, but when it turns out to be something rather stupid... but it's sort of satisfying in a way to track something down and... yeah, I don't know if... I guess it's part of my job for better or for worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Working all night is part of your job?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes, yeah. Sometimes. It's just that there's a... working with computer systems sometimes you have to do things in the middle of the night when there aren't people calling, because a lot of people calling. So, you have to take those opportunities. Well, anyway, but it's sort of nice in a way. You can... you can work... it's quiet and I can... I can get stuff done. So... so, it's in that respect. Anyway, but the... I feel okay; a little washed out. It's so beautiful out. Anyway. </p>

<p>But we were talking last week about trying out something. I don't know. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like today it's sort of hard to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's hard to have the feeling of what feels like what you'd like to talk about or which way we should go today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, kind of I feel a little... of course, spaced or a little...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From not sleeping. It's very much got your attention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little hard to think straight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A little bit. I don't know if that's good or bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not great for work but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one thing since we're... we seem to have... be having a lull at the moment as far as direction goes, why don't I take this opportunity to check in with you. I think this is our 13th meeting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And as you know, we have 30 sessions...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. [3:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...as part of this treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I wanted to check in with you about not just how it's going, but also what do you think would be helpful for you now and for us to focus on in the time we have left?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I would like to... I guess, of course, every... every time we talk about something it seems like that's thing, or I go out thinking and talking... of course, talking about I guess my indecisiveness or passivity or my inability to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Express anger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...express my anger and, yeah... and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that still seems important?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is definitely important. And other things I think that... of course, when I came in, the drawings and that, but I think of that... as we were talking about, I feel that they... that that relates to the anger and that. So, I think it's kind of rolled up there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, we haven't really talked about the drawings much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a feeling like we're ignoring something, or does it feel like it's not really where we should be focusing for you? [5:12]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sort of neither really. I mean, I feel like we're... I don't doubt that it's... that we were going to speak about it at some point and at the same time I feel that... that it's not like I feel like I've been avoiding it on the one hand, but... but the issues that we're addressing I feel that were...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are related to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...are very related to it. So, in that sense... of course, it is... I feel a little more comfortable about talking about it than... at the same time... but with... we have something I'm sure will come up today or whenever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think about it I wonder how... yeah. I guess when I first started I thought, "Well, 30 sessions seem like a fair amount.", but now I don't know if that's really... it just seems to go so fast and then I feel like, obviously, there's some pretty deep seated issues. These are things I've been wrestling with or been a part of my life, and I've dealt with them on some level before in therapy as well and I... it's always hard for me to say how much benefit I've gotten out of it in the past. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you have a sense of whether the way we're working now is helping you to address them in a different way or in a way that didn't happen before? [7:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean, I think that it's... it's much more direct. I mean, it's more... I feel that although... I feel like there's this kind of balance or dynamic where you're sometimes leading, sometimes I'm leading, and I feel that that's good because sometimes I think I need that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I... I feel that it... it is... I mean, ultimately I don't know but... but... but I have a sense that... that it's...that it is... of course, I would like everything to happen at once in a way, I guess, and wish it was an easy process... easier process than it is in some ways. I feel like I'm pulling my own teeth in some ways but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, there's a little frustration about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of the struggle it is and how much time it takes and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I... sometimes I... I really do look forward to coming here and... but I think on balance I probably rather have another... I don't know. Not have a disruption. Not have to come and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you can say a little bit more about that; about sort of like the mixed feelings you have about coming here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's always bugged me before about... of course, I mean schedules are always kind of a... a thorny thing for me in some ways. I don't know. I kind of rebel against it. I've never... I never had a job where I was like 9:00 to 5:00 then I would... and it's been an issue in therapy before. It's an issue with my wife and... and... and I think it... it becomes perhaps a focal point perhaps for... for being... for rebelling, I think, in some ways or for... for... and maybe an expression of... of anger. I think that by being late... and lateness and stuff like that. I... [10:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't that feel that way with us too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It hasn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like today when you related...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I... no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...did you feel like it was an expression of anger? Does that seem...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't know. No. I mean, today I was just like zoned I mean. I... it has perhaps... I think it's happened maybe on one or two occasions. Maybe that one time I came in here remember and... and I was just... I was kind of worked up within myself and I think the... and I was saying to myself... I was like giving all the reasons...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why you were late?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And... and there... there was definitely some anger. I mean, whether it's directed... exactly where it's directed I don't know really. I mean, it's... I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you have a sense... in... in a way it's a little problematic because it was a while ago, so it might be hard to sort of get into that same...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. To get into your... what your mind was thinking at that time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But as you say it now and you think about it, was... do you have a sense that maybe you were irritated with me about something or disappointed or frustrated with me in some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't... except that there's a little thing about it, of course, my perception of you as a... an authority figure and... that you're a... in some way, of course, controlling my schedule or controlling, I guess, in that sense. It's a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, there's a little bit of anger of you having to come when I'm available...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and not the other way around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And... yeah. Of course, I always seem to be like frenetically busy but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you since we've talked about sort of expressing irritation and anger and frustration to people is difficult, how are you feeling right now having sort of told me this little... this little bit of a little... being a little frustrated at me for having to come when I'm available?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do I feel right now about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I... well, the... I mean, of course I... I thought about it and I thought, "Well, when is really a good time for me? I don't know." Well, of course, the weekends are easier for me, but then again it takes away from the weekend. So, it's... it's damned if you do, damned if you don't really, ultimately. [13:32]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it feels like a trap in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, having to come here and I wanted it to be done with and, I mean, in that sense there was frustration. Yeah. Like... yeah, I'd... I'd like... I... I... it's like I wish you could write a prescription and say, "Here, take these pills. You'll be fine. Goodbye." Not that I'm a big pill taker but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can... can you tell me more about that wish? Like what... what feelings do you have as you just said that to me right now; that I could just write you a prescription and make it all better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What feelings? I mean, it's like I would... it would be... well, there's feelings like what... why am I so messed up? Am I really messed up or... or, no, I'm not really. It's like I'm thinking, "Why does the world have to be so complicated? Does everything have to be so complicated? Things should be much simpler.", and I... I almost... yeah, it's like I... when you hand me a prescription or... or... or like... or maybe grab me by the collar and say, "You got to do this. You got to do this.", and... and... [15:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me what are you feeling as you sort of did that shaking motion? Seemed like it was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel a little bemused and, I guess, I think perhaps I'd like to do that to you as well to some extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that there's also... well, this... this feeling of like being... I guess it has to do with like you being an authority figure and me being in like kind of the hot seat and having to perform or to... and also that... yeah, that you're kind of an observer, but you're active but at the same time you can sort of sit back at some... some level and be detached and not kind of be invested in... in, I guess, quite the same emotional way or some... some like that... I don't know, but there's a certain... I guess, it's like you're omniscient in some ways that I'm not and so, I guess, a feeling like, I don't know, like you have all the answers or I want you to have all the answers and... and... but at the same time... I guess that it's... it's like a... but it's not like a level playing field. But, of course, I'm coming here because of your expertise, but at the same time that puts me at some kind of insubordinate position in some way, in some sense. I'm coming to you for help and... [17:48]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you talk about what... what does it feel like to be in that subordinate position?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my wife says I don't like to ask for help...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I think it's true. I want to believe, I guess, that I'm like just a rock, self-contained; that I can get... that I could deal with anything. So... I think furthermore that I shouldn't, of course, goes back to that I shouldn't ask other people to give over for me; about some posing or something but... but it's also more than that. I think it's... I have to... an admission of weakness and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say anything about that side right there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was thinking... I don't know. I guess it was sort of exasperation. It was... well, it was like more like... it was like what I'm thinking as I'm speaking, "What... what weakness do I feel or what... "</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can you dwell on that? Can you dwell on that feeling of weakness and see what... what comes up? [20:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well, weakness is... it's vulnerability and weakness is... and vulnerability is something that I want and I don't want in the sense that I want to be able to be vulnerable. I want to be able to be open and open myself up, but I also don't want to be exposed to risk, to... to being hurt or... or in any... in any way being ridiculed or being not accepted, being rejected. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of... can you imagine what it would be like to be vulnerable with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I... I mean, I think I have felt that. I mean, I... I know have and it's... it's a... I don't know. It's very emotional. I don't know. It's very necessary and longing to really give over and to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you stick with that longing? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's... it's like wanting to... well, maybe it's too pat to say like, "return to the womb", but something that... to be just completely enveloped and... in... in a... in some kind of supportive, completely understanding, completely... just feeling that I could abandon myself freely and be loved and be cared for and... and a... [22:51]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A... a wish to feel closely connected and safe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Not have to deal with life's jagged edges or... but... yeah, really, like enveloped in some kind of bubble or something to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Protect it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Protect it, yeah, and not have to worry about what people think or what... what... what I think or... I mean... or just, yeah, very much a... a giving over of... of myself and... and being up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's a real struggle, because part of you has this longing to do this, to take this leap of being vulnerable and connected and... and feeling safe to do that, but then part of you also probably is responding to the reality of the situation that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you have me for 50 minutes a week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. Then it's like... and, I guess, the aspect of it being on schedule lends to my kind of a mechanistic... it's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's artificial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's just... yeah, and it's as if all the things, all the feelings, all the things that go on are my inner life, outer life, I don't know, and I come in here and they kind of... it's like I try and focus them into it. And then I go away and it's... and everything it's like entrophied (ph). [25:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say more about that. You were sort of chuckling a little bit about your experience of when... when the hour's over and you're leaving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no. It's... it's like I'm... well, actually when I was in therapy before, I thought of this before, but it was... I sometimes characterize it as being my haven and my battleground at the same time, which I think this is. It's a haven, but it's also a battleground of a different sort, of course. When I go outside, it's... I'm... when I go back to work, it... of course, it's like I'm just thrust back into that situation and then I'm back in the kind of same mindset. I think that at times I think about what goes on in here, but it's probably really not so pretty small fraction of the time. Most of the time I'm just dealing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, there's like a feeling of like turning it on and off...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...sort of. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sort of makes it more also artificial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I tell my... I'll tell myself on the way out different times that... I tell myself, "I'm going to think about what we've talking about and I'm going to do something about it. I'm going to go out and try and work on some of these things.", but it's not... and... and then sometimes I do think about it, but most of the time I really... I don't. I mean, I'm... I'm there. I'm like... it's like I'm just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Life takes over. [27:12]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Or I'm back in the same kind of rut or way of doing things. It's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that in a way is another dilemma too...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and if you take the risk to sort of be more vulnerable and understand or learn things about yourself, how do you translate that or take that out of here and make... make... have a difference in your life somewhere...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with your wife, with your daughter, with your boss, with your co-workers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And there's... and the... I guess, of course, there's... there's the thing with... it's like if I open myself up too much in here, by the end of the 50 minutes I got to go outside... back out again and I'm feeling like raw or whatever like that. It's like... well, you got to like suddenly... you like throw... douse my head with cold water or... but... and that... I don't... it's felt that way maybe in one or two occasions that I felt like I've allowed myself to open up so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In part because of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so really. I mean, it's not like I'm thinking about that. That it's well, "I'm going to have to get out of here and so I'd better not say anything.", but... but it's... but it is something, I don't know, that... that I'm aware of, I guess on one or two points and then I've left. And... but I... I actually I... I don't know, there's something that I... that's holding me back. I think I find that every thing's holding me back. [29:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That... that's the least of your worries.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, how are you feeling today as... on the vulnerability scale?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel fairly open. I also, of course, feel pretty bleary but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Harder to have your defenses up perhaps?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's... that may be true. I... I... well, that's what I was saying maybe it's not such a bad thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what about the other things? Does it feel safe or dangerous or rejecting or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I... I mean, I feel safe. I think it... it surprised me that... in a way that... that I would feel as comfortable as I do and which I did, I think, fairly from the start. I mean, part of it, of course, is really wanting to have something like that, but at the same time I think I came in having a real... I mean, it'd been a long time since I had been in therapy and had had... and I had questions about having a male therapist in my... I mean, it was actually I wanted a male therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say a little bit about why or what were you thinking there? [31:05]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my... I had a... a woman initially, Rex, and then when I was in counseling...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A couple's treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A couple' treatment, I was also... and... and I thought I, "Well, maybe it would make a difference maybe." I'm hoping. I had a feeling that maybe I was holding back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And having a woman as a therapist was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...probably even making it harder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In some ways perhaps. Just kind of whatever. Male chauvinist tendencies. No, I don't know. Not really, but... but that it would make a difference and my... my feeling would be... and it does, I think, make a difference. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me share with you a little bit sort of what my experience has been sort of in this area. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sort of have felt the struggle also as you sort of described and I think... sometimes I get a sense that there... that you have a lot of feeling behind something and part of me wants to go for that feeling, or wants to try to understand sort of things in a deeper way with you; like what's behind something. But in some... but then part of me also feels like part of you is giving me a signal of like, "That's a little too much and I feel a little too vulnerable. I'm not quite sure I want to go there." So, sometimes I feel that... that I hold back. So, it's kind of a funny paradox I think. </p>

<p>Your experience is you know you're holding a lot of stuff back. It's a real struggle for you to sort of take that leap and let... let that control go, and I think I pick up on that tension within you and I think sometimes it makes me hold back a little bit too; like I don't want to push you too hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, my sense is that you... I mean... I may regret these words, but I mean it... I don't think I'm as... I mean, I... I talk a lot about my vulnerability and what not, but I think the armor there is very, very strong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I can... I can push harder and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I'm not... you're not going to crumble...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And... well, what was I going to say? And it... it's funny. I mean, you point out when I'm talking a lot and I go, "Aaah", or I'll sigh or something like that less frequently. But there I'm like... [33:53]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I take you by surprise or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you do and I think it's good, and it... it's very annoying, but I think in a sense it's... it's good too, because I know that... I don't even... I'm not even conscious of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say what's annoying about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, "Oh, gosh, no. I have to think about what I was thinking about.", or, "Or what was I feeling?", and it's... it's hard for me to sometimes grasp it. Sometimes it's right for me, but other times I don't even know where that came from. </p>

<p>I think the last time I... I was having a real hard time tracking it down. It's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was the pressure to give me an answer even if you don't know what things there is too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Um hm. And I was thinking I think, "God, you have to ask me that again?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, unfortunately it feels like a really short session today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but I'm saying like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like I wish we had more time, because I think we were... we were talking about things that were important, but we do need to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But let me sort of like throw out a pitch for something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I actually think if you can... if you notice yourself having that reaction that you just had; like part of you felt like just saying to me like, "Do you have to ask me that again?"...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I should feel... I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And if you say things like that, take the risk to just sort of like not hold those things back. I think that might give us something very interesting to work with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Yeah. And I was thinking that after; like why don't I just say it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that's it. So, just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I agree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Good. Okay. Great. So, why don't we stop for today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm looking for my bag. I don't...</p>

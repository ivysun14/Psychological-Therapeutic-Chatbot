<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm, sleepy but I'm fine. How are you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh all right. Yeah actually that's all I really care about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where to start-I haven't really thought much about it. Maybe I'll just, relate what's happened to me. The last, couple of weeks it got pretty clear that I was, going to make it. At least in my mind. I don't about (ph) my professor's mind but we'll see about that in a week. But anyhow, it changed-well it changed my outlook on it a lot. And, see they give up practice tests every week, on the test, [62 or 61] (ph). And the last three times like I was the best one in the class, so, of all the people to take the practice exams. So I really felt good about it. </p>

<p>Well anyhow, the night before the exam-first of all in my dreams I must have swum the channel a dozen times. Just to show it is - you know it's the same real attitude that I'm approaching it with, completely. But before I went to sleep I just lay there and cried. I don't know why. Maybe it was-well it was sort of premature relief that it was over, at least the studying was over. And, I think back on that and I try to think of the analogy the night before the swim and I can't. Well there is no analogy I just have trouble going to sleep that night. </p>

<p> But, well anyhow, I don't know I just-it seemed to be, at that point, that I wish I was going to make it. And the fact that it was over, made me happy. Well anyhow, there were three days of it. And of course during it you're just a zombie, I mean I was not-I was not thinking of anything physics so there was nothing to relate to. I did well not so well and well on three successive days. And the last day was yesterday. And that was finished, and then it was over. And one thing I've noticed about this, an amazing presence of time. </p>

<p>I can never, really, tell what other times would be like. I can only tell what now would be like. Like right now I can only describe you the feeling that I feel, the morning after the day I finished my third day of exams. I can't tell you what it was like in the exams, I can't tell you what it's going to be like a week from now. And it just seems like a different world. Well, generally that's not the case with me but, right now it is. [0:02:22.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But today it is, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So anyhow, let me tell you-I think this, might lend some insight into what, how I feel about the whole thing. It's widely cut-throat. Admittedly. It's curved 100 percent, exclusively. If you're in the smart market, you're not going to make it. If you're in the same [amount of physicians] (ph) of the dumb group, you're going to make it. As a matter of fact, even your score is even coded on a strict curve. 100 is the average score. And you don't-well you generally have an idea what your number is, some people know, where it stands relative (ph) to one hundred which is the score to work with. </p>

<p>Well anyhow, because of that you can't feel, you can't with the other guys well, with any sincerity, even though they're your friends. And that really bothered me. Most people, I think realize that but didn't admit it. They'd say, "Good luck." And I didn't wish anyone good luck. I can't wish anyone-if it boils down to luck I want it all. If it's what you know fine. But, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least you didn't kid yourself. [0:03:24.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So I'm kind of disenchanted about the whole thing. But anyhow, well-three of the guys didn't take it at the last minute. And the three were ones-two, one of them got a bleeding ulcer and is in the hospital. That shows you what the system is like. And the other two decided not to take it. And I felt bad about that. I had to!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you thought, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: that raise, that raises the curve. There's no question that those were three dummies. Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt bad that it was set up in such a way, that made you feel bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't-yeah, I don't think that's much of an indictment against me. Because I'm going to know X amount of physics. And there's no question about that. I mean I have certain limit, limitations, as far as what my head can hold at one time. And, it just, it just lowered where X is going to be relative to 100. I mean. And, here's a guy in the hospital, really sick. At least it seems, it seems like it ought to be. And, I couldn't feel bad that he was in the hospital. Not because he was in the hospital, not for him but for me. </p>

<p>But again, that's not me. That's because they set it up this way. If they had a standard and they say, "Well this is what this guy should know." And, to heck with what everyone-who happens to be wanting to know that much now, knows. Well anyhow, so, all the way through my life I've been able to-well I've always been able to get what's due me. Like if I, if I were to pass this-I know that if I were to pass this thing, you know, around 100ish, that I would somehow wrangle. </p>

<p>I'd do really well on my oral and, they'd be impressed with me and I'd make it. So if it's due me, I'm going to get it. But I've also been able to get things more than other people that aren't doing. And, that is to say I can always, you know pull the right strings here and there. And I hadn't even been thinking about it too much this time. But after the exam, we had-well everyone went over to Paddy's, the local bar. The professors treated us all. And I had no idea any of them knew me from Josh. Just, I hadn't-I wasn't going to go there and interact and try to get on the nice side of them or anything. [0:05:32.1] </p>

<p>And one guy came in, Dr. Heitz, the German, the new guy young guy. And he walked right over to me. And he said, "Hi Wes, how are you." I didn't know him. I never saw-I've seen him once or twice. I went to his-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were surprised that he knew you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well it turns out he, is a real close friend of my brother-in-law who came from the same area in Germany together and I worked there. And I found myself talking to him. And it seemed to be the same old me getting back. I was talking to him trying to get chummy with him, rather than-I was just in awe of him the whole time. Had that been any other professor that might have come up to me in a similar situation I was, "Yes sir." "No sir." And everything. But I was, really worried about how I was behaving. To see that, I was coming across properly. [0:06:16.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted to really impress him you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so it's-I mean, see he came from Harvard and that's where my brother-in-law is, my sister too. And they were good chums out there. They met in Harvard but they come from the same area in Germany and that's how they happened to meet. And, he said when he came to the NYU he only knew two things were here. He knew that Dr. Galione (inaudible at 0:06:37.1), and he knew that Wes (inaudible at 0:06:39.7) was here. And I said, "Oh wow!" There's-if I had worked all along, trying to impress someone, and-well, it's how, you know. The things I do are generally I just decided are to impress other people. And here's a case where it, it really you know-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worked. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know if it-yeah. So anyhow I had a few beers and I haven't drunk in months and months and months. So two beers get to you you know. And your tongue loosens up and, oh I was really being-I don't know. I would like to see what I was like. It was either an ass or-but anyhow. It was clear that my entire intent, was to get chummy with the professors at that thing. I mean I wasn't-I was-I. [0:07:18.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not sure whether you feel good about that bad about that, or just noticing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither am I. I don't know. See the thing is I haven't thought much about myself the last couple of weeks. And right now I'm just relating what has happened. So I don't know how I feel. I think, I thing generally I'm going to end up feeling bad about it. I can't, I can't feel bad if I pass this exam, because I deserve to pass. [I mean] (ph) I've done a lot of work. But I can feel bad if, that has a factor. The factor that (ph) I know these guys. The other-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to feel that you've got it on your own merits. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but then when it boils down to going over to Paddy's -  boy there is no one that got in with the professors like I did over there. I mean I was talking to-I ended up talking to the three out of the four of them really, chummy and everything. Of course half the guys can't much anyhow. But that's beside the point. </p>

<p>Yeah well anyhow, so-well let's see. Then I went, I went home last night. I took it easy. Some friends invited me over for dinner. And I, just really felt quite good about the whole thing. We're going to have a session to go over the problems and see how we did. Yeah I well of course-you know they already say that six months before an exam, you look at the type of things you have to know and say, "I can't know all that." </p>

<p>Six months after the exam you look back and say, "How did I ever know all that." So you know, right now I probably know more than I'm ever going to know. Which is a strange feeling because I can't see - well, what I am forgetting between now and two minutes from now. I don't know, nothing I suppose. [0:08:50.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like it, yet. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But-yeah one thing did bother me about the way, at Paddy's. Well first of all, let me explain something else. Lately, I've met some new people lately. And I've avoided like the plague telling them about the channel. I-it's sort of an experiment with me to see how much it really does dominate my life. And, I'm really getting to dislike it because like, there's some people that are-well not dislike it. </p>

<p>You don't dislike any accomplishments you have. But, I dislike the way it enters the conversation sometimes. I'm introduced as Wes Calvert [the guy that] swam the channel to many of my friends. And for the first few minutes of the conversation that's all people want to talk about. Which is kind of bad. [0:09:35.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bad in-now what is it about that that-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm right now working on trying to behave a little differently. And this is exactly the way I behaved all along, is to turn the conversation to myself and impress people right off the bat. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. And it pulls you back to that way of acting as soon as-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The channel comes up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: As a matter of fact there's-I've got a new roommate. and he doesn't know about it yet. And I'm just-I'm going-I told my other roommate, I said, "Look, just don't mention it." You and I can do it very easily, living here. I'm just going to see how much it permeates my other life to see you know, if he's going to find out right away. It will be interesting. And then, well-there's a girl I've seen a couple times. And I haven't mentioned it to her. And, yeah it was really-I was amazed when, that it got into this talk at Jimmy's last night. Apparently all the professors knew it. And there's another thing about that.</p>

<p>We were sitting there and there was a group of rowdy people next to us. So the standard thing was, was to get Wes over there you know and take care of it. I - I mean I was, all I do is swim. I'm not like the super jock that goes around messing around with people and is a big ruffian. [0:10:47.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you got that, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They got that image with all the physicists. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that image. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well. Well anyhow, overall the viewpoints (ph) I really love it. This is what I live for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Love (ph) what. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Working on a goal, really hard and then achieving it, is - well here I am. I'm ahead of myself now. They're going to have a hell of a time flunking me though. You know I, really hated it when I'm doing it. Just like when you're training, you hate going out every day. But you got to. And you hate studying. But boy, I'm  - . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really love it after you accomplish it. [0:11:26.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah this is-see the thing that is really strange now is that I wish I knew today, because now the work is essentially over. I have an order but I (inaudible at 0:11:34.1). This is like right after the swim for me. This is what I live for. I look back at that, that's really enjoyable. Now however it's-well-not that many people know about it now. They will eventually of course. You know, I'll have those letters after my name I hope. This is really something because I might not pass this thing and here we talking about-well. All right I'm just going to - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you feel as if you've already passed it and - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So let's talk about, on an (inaudible at 0:11:58.7) premise. Yeah, and I realize that there's just no other way for me to behave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You-well. Is what you mean you realize how much-how really good it makes you feel that there's something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right you see the thing is-being as-I like things that are well defined I guess. I think that's what it boils down to. Like I can't start out to, my goal in life could not be to spread goodwill.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too vague.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because you don't go like on Thursday, I spread 17 units of good will. You can't do that. But if my goal in life is to swim from here to there or to get a degree, then I will, do the things that require-that are required of me to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You like it very well laid out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and you see now that's a-that's not saying much for me. Because, I know, myself when I've attained certain levels of accomplishment. I know when I know certain things. I know when I can do certain things. And yet, other people don't because other people say, "Well, can he do this? Can he swim from here to there? Can he get this degree?" And they only know that. So I'm not really working for myself. [0:13:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean in like passing the test or swimming the channel you're just showing them. You already knew it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. Wouldn't this be wild if I didn't pass this thing? I'd have to take-erase this whole session and (inaudible at 0:13:31.0). Ah well well well. My aunts called up. They didn't know I was taking the test, on the North Side. About 90 years old and they're both Catholic. And they went to church and lit a candle for me so I, figured I can't miss. Well anyhow, yeah those are the main observations I had. And, this summer I guess I'm just going to play a lot. Try and settle things down and, well-I keep telling myself I deserve the chance to play. And I guess I do. </p>

<p>I mean I've worked hard for... quite a while. And, haven't really had any time off for quite a while. Maybe it'll give me a chance to, think about some things. Other than this god-awful test (inaudible at 0:14:17.8). But you know I really think that, I just said play. I'm not going to be able to, just because there's now nothing in my life that, is to be done. [0:14:26.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you can't-you can't get yourself even play, I mean, unless there's some goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe a week or so. But after that no. You see now I got a dissertation to write. And - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you feel that you've moved from one goal to another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They-they say college education is moving from one crisis to the next. Which indeed it was for me. You let one class slip completely because you got a test coming in another class, and then (inaudible at 0:14:54.1) now you've got another week, you've got another-well it's the same thing with my whole entire life. I just run it from-you know I set up these tests, here and there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You run] (ph) from test to test. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Now, one other thing that-things have really gone well, since I talked to you last, are - . One of the-well all right. This is-I did in full cognizance of how I am and why I behave the way I do but I did it anyhow. It helps when you, after you've taken your oral, if you're working for someone, or have a job [out there] (ph) ready to go. Because, if they are kind of wondering, and you already are in a position of research, they'll say, "Well, he's already at-let him, let him go. Let him finish his work. He's seems to know a little bit. But, if you're at the-you've done the same-accomplished the same things on the test, but you don't have a position they'll say, "Well, you know this guy he doesn't know that much. Why should we throw him into the market when the market is glutted already." </p>

<p>So therefore the standard rule is, be working for someone when you take that oral. A lot of people aren't. Or I would say clearly, two-thirds of the people that were taking this exam, aren't working for anyone. Well so, I went over to see Dr. Galione who is going to Germany of August of '72. And, he's getting rid of all his workers because he doesn't-none of them want to go with him. Of course it's a different country no one speaks the language. Well, he's got all his work figured to terminate in August of '72 here. So I went to him and said, "Well look, why don't you take on a worker and, with the hopes of taking him with you to Germany." And he's going to do it, if I pass the exam. [0:16:32.6]</p>

<p>I'm going to, work for him and then, I'll probably immigrate. I'll end up getting my degree here but that doesn't matter. But, I didn't do that because I wanted to work for Dr. Galione, necessarily. I kind of like going to Germany. And I really-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did it because you knew it was a smart thing to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I, I really, really want to immigrate. It gives me the opportunity to do that. But the, far and way the most important motivation was, because when they said, "Well what are you going to do." I said, "Well I'm going to work for Dr. Galione." Just very certainly and no questions about it. Yeah I did that knowing what I was doing. But -  well the point is at this point, any personal standards that I have have been thrown by the wayside in this test anyhow. When a guy gets ulcers in the hospital and I feel bad because he's not, not taking the test and he's dumb, rather than the fact that he might be on his deathbed. You know what can I say. </p>

<p>That's... he's a nice guy too. (inaudible at 0:17:35.5) Well that's how I've been feeling lately and that's what I've been doing lately. Now I wish I could, reflect up on it, but I haven't had time. It's gone (ph), you know so fast-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're too busy doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so fast and furious. I've lost about ten pounds through (ph) this thing. I just don't want to eat. It's really strange what the human body can, can put up with and do in moments of stress. Not necessarily the human mind, (inaudible at 0:18:03.2). I was amazed at the, when-I feel good about what I know. Because of, well-it used to be when I took it before, I took it-if I didn't -  I hadn't seen a problem before I couldn't do it. </p>

<p>Well yesterday especially, which I think you know I did quite well on, I picked up the test and I was just scared. I felt like walking out or jumping out of a window, you know it's fourth floor. Because there was just, no hope. I knew maybe how to do one problem. So I spent an hour doing the first problem. And then I said, "Well-let's turn that one in and go home." I said, "No well let's try." </p>

<p>I tried and tried and I worked and worked and finally another one broke. The third one broke and a fourth one broke. Four problems you know completely, and then of course two partial credits. And-that really made me feel good! You know, because-that meant that I was no longer-because I had a seen a problem that I could, could do it. But-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It means you could handle problems that you, hadn't seen before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now of course that's says nothing at all about me as a physicist it only talks about me as a test taker. But unfortunately the NYU doesn't really give a damn about what kind of (inaudible at 0:19:12.1) I am. They only care if I can take this, god-awful test. But, what can you say. I think they're going to get rid of the test, which is, they should. I mean look what it's doing to people. I mean, not just putting them in the hospital but making things so cutthroat. And admittedly so. </p>

<p>Admittedly so. You're with a group of people, it's-I don't know. There's probably some examples in literature that, maybe some, science fiction or something on you know that half the people are going to die and you just (inaudible at 0:19:43.2) with, the other half. Someone's going to live someone's going to die. Oh yeah, isn't there one about the-the lottery. Did you ever read the lottery? Yeah, that's the one that I was thinking of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what it feels like, (inaudible at 0:19:56.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so that-you're either going to pick up the stone or you're going to be stoned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You or them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just... and that's the way it works. And everyone, you know everyone admits it. And takes part in it. Everyone picks up that stone, representing the lottery. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I, I, I-I'm trying to figure out how it is you-I guess you view that with a kind of disgusted detachment, that whole system. Or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah you see the thing is I don't know a better way. If-I mean well. I don't know if I told you my idea about failure before. Not not that I (inaudible at 0:20:35.2), well frankly I've never experienced it in anything that I was really working, to any extent. But it's possible now. No question. Failure is good. I mean, if there hadn't have been thousands of people who tried to swim the channel, the fact that I swam it wouldn't mean anything. If everyone that got in tried it. If everyone that came to the NYU could get a Ph.D. in physics, I mean what would the degree mean? Nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So failure gives meaning to success. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, so. Somehow I won't-I'll feel good about it to that extent. The fact that-well I failed at something that might be hard to do but, there will be times that I'll do things that I'll be successful in and I'll be thankful for all the people that fail. Because that will lend some credence to the fact that not everyone that tries whatever I've doing at that time can do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So actually this system seems okay to you. [0:21:21.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems all right -  as far as failing and success is concerned. It does not seem alright that, the standard is not arbit-that it's not well defined. It's only a function of time and that other people that, happen to be wanting to get the degree at that time. If you're in a dumb group you've got a better chance of passing is what it boils down to. So what-instead of putting me against ignorance, or me, you know trying to obtain a certain level of knowledge, it's me against the other people. Which is not the way to go. </p>

<p>The way I look at is, when I say the other failures, other failures at learning something. Not other failures that are taking the test at the same time I'm taking it. That's, that's what I appreciate. Those patterns. Well, I'm sorry that I haven't made any profound observations. It's been so long I should've been able to but, well that's the way life is right now. I'm just too busy. [0:22:17.0]</p>

<p>Oh let me tell you about this girl that I met which was kind of nice. I mentioned to a friend of mine, if he ever-well he and his girl, if she ever had any friends (inaudible at 0:22:30.8). She called me up. She said, "Say there's this girl up on, the north side. Why don't you ring her up. She's - ." I thought, "Well here's another one of those. You never know what you're going to end up with." Well it turns out that, she's a real nice girl. </p>

<p>I've been out with her a couple of times. Very very ill at ease, the first time, both of us though. Really both of us. I look back on it and-I've talked to her oh half a dozen times since then and seen her a couple of times. And it's getting much closer (ph). But I've been-I've been really careful to be, you know trying to (inaudible at 0:23:09.7). Trying to be honest all the way. And I have not-I've been avoiding like the plague telling her about any of my accomplishments. Academic or athletic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've tried to act in a new way with her. [0:23:24.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but boy it really takes a lot of work you know. I'm not the humble sort. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a big effort, to be that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it sure is. Yeah. And you see, she's not quite herself yet either. She's... I don't know what's she's like personally. I mean, you know when she's really free. I mean she's a really nice girl otherwise. But it's really-she's behaving-we're getting along really well together. However it's quite clear that all the fence are not down. But the thing is I'm putting up different kinds, completely of fences. And that's kind of nice to be able to, to go to someone in a diff-as a different person really. </p>

<p>And the other-the way I look at it is, if it's going to be a lasting relationship, and I'm going to know her for a reasonable amount of time, if it's going to mean anything, she'll actually know all about me, anyhow. So why at the initial stages before she gets to know me, should I impress her with any accomplishment, rather than to try and, let her see myself. </p>

<p>But that's-I guess that's getting really hard to me because, hard for me to do because, I am only my accomplishments. I think we've pretty much, decided that. There's very little in me except what I-show other people I can do. [0:24:50.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you-so, since that's so much of you, it's hard to be with her on any other basis. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Besides that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so I started out with all these pretenses and it's hard enough [you know] (ph) because there's really nothing behind the pretense-I'm trying. It's a-yeah it's a really refreshing relationship. Well, going to the zoo with her tomorrow. We'll see, if I can again behave normally. Or not normally-but I can behave this-honestly I guess is best way to put it. Outside of that, life ain't that too exciting. Let's see what else. I'm trying to think of why I was lying and crying in bed. I haven't cried-oh the last time I cried in bed was, the night after I swam, but that was all physical. (inaudible at 0:25:44.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying, "What-I mean what did it mean that I was crying that night." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah-well it was kind of funny, by the way too. I got out all the albums I could that had great songs on them like, "Tall Hopes" and "Impossible Dream". And, it was playing all the psych-up songs to get my spirits ready. This is the night before. And then I went to bed with those tunes in my mind. And, the next morning I got up. I tuned on the radio and they were playing all the-no "More Than you Know", "More Than You'll Ever Know." And I thought, "Ah, all that psyching up and the records and the radio is screwing it all up." Well anyhow, I lay there. </p>

<p>And, well I will tell you something that I got in the habit of doing. When I-if I were walking along-especially this happened quite a bit in England. When I was walking along, if I'd been thinking good old Stone (ph) and his (ph) positive mental attitude, thinking that you can do something. Well of course then it was just the swim. It was very very defined, what I was thinking I could do. I would walk along, and I would sort of rotary breath as I walked along, is the way I would do when I was swimming. And I sort of was doing that, that later on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rotary breathing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah you know (breathes). Is all, stroke stroke. Come on you - just the-drive it into your head that you can do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can do it. [0:27:04.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was the same sort of thing you know. I was lying there thinking-I was really confident that night. And I was thinking, "Well it's over. I've done all the training and, the studying. And tomorrow I begin the test. And tomorrow I prove that I can do it."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like also you were somehow shoring up your confidence, is that part of what you are saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I was crying. I guess-I guess I was crying just because it was such a long haul and it was, open. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A relief, maybe? A release?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah sort of. I'll be doing some more crying if I don't pass this thing too so. Maybe we can talk about that crying too. Yeah. Then I just lay there and as I said, I stopped that, stopped thinking about the test and I, was thinking about swimming. And I swam it over again in my dreams three or four times, went through the things. I was trying to make an analogy between the swim and my studies. And, where I was right then. I sort of said, "Well, I was just coming in because all the work was behind me." And it was just like finishing up. You know coming into Dover. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (ph) all you had to do was just-like show other people you knew it. That's good to, when you think about it. And I thought of the analogy as being, the night before the swim. Everything was left to do. But I didn't. In my mind everything was done. All I had left to do was the last little bit. So this, this I think shows at least in my mind, I knew something. And that I'd accomplished what I'd set out to accomplish. And whether or not I accomplished it in other people's eyes, was (ph) just that last little bit. [0:28:58.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. That's just thinking off the top of my head. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well why is - what are you saying though. What is-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's kind of good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: it's good that it meant something to you. That you had accomplished it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah you see to me the work was done. And, of course I'll really feel bad if I don't, pass it. But I will also know that-well I'd gotten to where I'd wanted to get. I knew what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like-is what you're feeling good about there, that realizing that it did mean something to you that you knew it. And not just had meaning to show other people that you knew it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what I, what I like to say and what I feel are two-it's hard to say. Yeah I think that, I think that it's nice to know that I considered it done now. I enjoy that. I also now that if anyone asked me, that without any qualms I would say, "No it's not done, until I pass." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the part that worries you I guess. [0:29:56.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Both the good parts and bad parts. But the good part is the fact that in my head, it was done. But really, no. It was sort of like -  well... you see the thing is now what's going to happen with me from now on. Am I going to, find more mountains to climb? I don't know. Yeah I can't see the-you see that's me. I can't see getting along without it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you are that mountain climber. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now when you said, "Yeah" you sound really disappointed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess I am. I-I'd really like to be able to go out and spread good will. Whatever that is to use that as, an example of something that's not well defined. But, I don't think I could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the way you say it you don't even sound very invested in it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just now that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say, "Well I'd kind of like to." But you don't sound-you sound fairly indifferent to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah maybe I do. Maybe I am I mean. All right I do, sound indifferent. Maybe I am indifferent. Yeah, it'd be nice-you see I call myself an idealist and everything. Worried about you know, the loftier things in life and mankind in general and all these little clich�s. But, when it boils right down to it, my life is not going to revolve around, that type of quest or goal. It's going to revolve around something, very well defined in other people's eyes. [0:31:52.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In, in -  in what was the last thing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: In other people's eyes. Yeah, I'd like to be that way. Maybe I should try-see the thing is, I don't know how to try it. Well I guess maybe I do. I just I don't really know how to try it. What could I do? See now I'm tied up in this thing. And now if I pass this exam it's going to take me maybe a year to get the thesis done and out of the way, and then where will I be. Well then I'll probably in a job somewhere and I'll be working, you know, trying to work my way up in the job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you see you life kind of laid out before you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where it's going to go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Although then again I could just-that'd be nice to do. See the-so-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see what I'm trying to figure out, is you're talking about, "Yeah I really like this idealistic thing." I'm trying to figure out if it's really that you would like it if you liked that. But you feel that you don't? Or if it's really that you don't know how to do it. I don't know which of those two is it. [0:32:59.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I tell you. Neither do I. I like to think, that I could, you know do it. Well see the thing is, I like to say that I've retired from swimming. You know I swam the channel. I retired from swimming. I'd also-it'd also be really cool if I could get my doctorate and say, "I'm not a physicist anymore. I proved it to myself that I can be a physicist." And then go out and do something else. I might be able to do that. That would be the way I would. you know, do it. If there were a way for me to prove to myself that I'm, you know... I'm really honest to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would, that would-prove to yourself that you were honest. That would somehow-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: To myself yeah rather than to other people. Of course I know a lot of people-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would make you feel you had integrity I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not doing this-you know, for a quest of knowledge. Or because I'm going to be some Nobel prize winning work. I'm doing this to prove I can do it. There's no other reason. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing it somewhat cynically I guess you're saying. [0:34:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I lie through my teeth is what I do. I mean I don't want, I don't really want to be a physicist. When I went to Dr. Fritchey, to tell him I wanted to work for him, and he asked me, "Why'd you come?" I said, "Well I really enjoy your work in a (inaudible at 0:34:25.6) semi-conductor (inaudible at 0:34:27.1)." I don't want to work with semi-conductors-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was-yeah. That was a bunch of lies. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was just bullshit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's going to let me work for him so it's all right. So, yeah it's-well I don't know. It's going to be interesting. The sad thing is, you see you should -  if you could only be for a few years, then-or that I could-then you know two years from now something is going to happen. Like I say, "Look if I could only see you a couple more years, it'd be great." And it'd go on forever. Well it can't go on that way can I. I mean I have to decide right now what I'm going to do. Or at least have an idea, why I'm going to do what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what is it like if you-the fact that you can't see me for a couple years-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you see the thing is, the way I'm setting up my life now, it looks like there will always be a goal way out there, a couple years from now. Right now, after the exam is done it'll be to write the thesis. And I'm sure between now and the time I get my degree, I will have defined another goal. I will have, got something else to do. It might be a line (ph) to physics, it might not be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:35:30.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, that will then encompass my entire life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -  you know I'm talking now about not having anything anymore but I can't see not having anything any more. So that if I said, "Well look, why-look we waited until after the test right?"</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying. You're saying, "Well if we could just wait around until after I finish my degree-"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Then maybe I'd change."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Half of you says, "I wouldn't really. I'd find another goal." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well more than the half I think-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By the time, well yeah. So that, you see, it's kind of funny that we stopped talking for a while. Well we stopped seeing each other because, I had to talk some time out and put my (inaudible at 0:36:15.0) into this test. Which I suppose, is good, now that I probably did better. Because you know you wasted all morning with tiny (inaudible at 0:36:20.8) and everything. But, it's kind of funny. Because-well now that's out of the way. So now, now you're supposed to, you know, help me and make me  - - it's no different, my life is still the same. Because, it's just, it's that now have passed this particular - -</p>

<p>(crosstalk</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just move (ph) on to another goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Sure I'll just find another one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this really won't touch you, you were saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No so that my little statement earlier about you should be around a couple of years now, that isn't going to help. We got to do something between now and the last time I see you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's got to be now you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like time really isn't going to change anything. You're-I guess you're saying, "I'm fooling myself, if I think just waiting, to get certain goal over and then change is going to do it." [0:37:01.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wonder what the next one is going to be. (inaudible at 0:37:07.8) I don't know. It's hard to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're saying it's really a thing, like half the time I feel like I really want to get rid of this goal bit, do something different with my life. And part of the time I really love these goals. I like accomplishing-</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I live for yeah. There's no doubt in my mind that's what I live for. I, yeah, I'm in euphoria right now. I just passed the test-well. Saying it with reservation because they haven't decided that yet but I have. Yeah and boy once I get that, that piece of paper that says it, that's going be like one of the best weeks of my life. It's going to be like the week I came back here after the channel. And you know, just going around collecting all the kudos.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you really love that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to give that up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And the thing I don't really, it doesn't-doesn't, you see, I don't want to go around, say-everyone say, "Nice, you passed the test and everything." That isn't what I'm going to do that week. I'm just going to sit and enjoy knowing it. Because, eventually I'll see everyone and they'll say, "Well, you know, you passed it." But, just to sit alone, and to, bask in my accomplishment. That's-that's going to be great. Just lie on the beach and think about it, "Well you did it." [0:38:23.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Think how really well you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wouldn't it be amazing after all this talk if I didn't pass it, just to have to re-hash it all over again. If I didn't pass it, it'd be a lot easier for me to stop setting goals. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying, "If I weren't so good at all this, then I could stop it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty-yeah. That's pretty-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "You know, it's so easy for me." </p>

<p>CLIENT: I never said-did I say that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. I may have implied (ph) that but I don't mean that at all. It wasn't easy at all. I don't have a physical mind at all. I'm very-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, possible. I guess. But you're saying somehow, well you were saying earlier, "I usually can get, what I deserve and what I don't deserve."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I can get the-well I deserve this. I worked-I would say, I have worked harder on this exam than, than anyone in that room. But I am bucking, more, on the lack of physical intuition. And the lack of a mathematical mind than they are. I fell into physics, and the natural science. They went into it because there was that spark in their mind. They enjoyed it. And they could do it well. So yeah if I get this degree, I'll deserve it. There's no question. I've put a lot of work in, and I know as much as most of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I guess what I was getting at was, I thought you were saying that, "The fact that I, work hard, and can get the goals I want, then makes it hard when I say I want to change the way I do things to change it, because I-you know, it's kind of pleasant-"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "To get the goals. And like, I can do it, and succeed." [0:39:58.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know-did you ever. Well, we just you build forts and build stuff with our finger toys and things. And once we got them built, we just let them sit. And not anything with it. It's the same sort of thing. I really live for the building and the doing and the accomplishing. It's just like-well like the swimming thing. I love the fact to be retired from swimming. I can't -  I don't want to get back in shape again. Why should I. And it's-it's sort of like building up to the peak of your career and then saying, "Well that's nice. I just don't want that anymore."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The building is the part that's fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and-although it's really hell when you're doing it. I mean-I was really distraught, those last couple of weeks. I was just working like all the time. Pounding things into my head. But wow, that's what it's all about, as far as my life is concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really a strict (inaudible at 0:40:53.0). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and when it's over-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know whether you're saying it's fun doing it, or it's fun to look back afterwards. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well is childbirth fun for a mother you know? I don't know. I think she might say, yeah it's probably one of the most enjoyable experiences of her life, although it's probably the most painful. But it was that pain and that joy that brought her her child.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They go together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the way you-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isn't there-what is that the Lamaze method or something, that changes all that pain to joy. Well that's-that could be what it's-as far as-I think it's a pretty good analogy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it's all about for you, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Going through all that pain to, to achieve that accomplishment. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds pretty different from what you were saying before, that you only do it to-for what other people will feel about it (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I don't know about that. Well you see, no. Let's go back to the analogy again. If I, If I were a mother raising a beautiful intelligent well-mannered child, then I wouldn't sit around in my house with my beautiful intelligent well-mannered child. I would go out and people would say, "Wow! What a beautiful, intelligent, well-mannered child." And I would be happy about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right but that sounds-but it sounds like what you're saying, now is like "I'm happy when other people like what I do, but I also enjoy doing it myself." [0:42:27.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I would only go and do it unless I enjoyed it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess it sounded to me like earlier you were saying, "I only do it for other people." And now I'm hearing you say, "But I also do it-."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only do it for other people but I really enjoy other people recognizing it, okay? That's why I-that's the enjoyment I get out of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. There's no joy intrinsic in doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Now-but is there anything I could do that would be intrinsically joyful for me. I don't know. I'd very sincerely doubt it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like nothing, that you could do that you would enjoy, not attached to how other people feel about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean-if I were to say, well what-if tomorrow, you could decide, what you were going to do, the rest of life. What would you be? Would you be a sea captain, or an astronaut or whatever the, little kids might say. I don't know what I'd say. But it wouldn't really matter. Because the important thing I think to me would be working hard, to achieve in that particular field, what other people consider excellence. And, that I would enjoy. [0:43:43.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would enjoy for their, standards, of what's really - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's just- my life is now boiling down to an admission, of that. And living with that, as best I can. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you mean what you're reaching for is admitting that to yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And now... I'm trying to take that back to why I came in here initially. Because I felt bad about behaving that way. I guess. I'd like to listen to the last couple of tapes. I think they were completely different from this weren't they? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't remember. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they were. I've gone through a few cycles. No, I think by the time a guy is my age, it might sound like I'm old now. But you know a quarter of a century is old. He's not going to really turn around his life too much. I don't think. And, the way I behave the way I do is pretty much determined. I mean the way I behave is pretty much determined. The reason why I think is something for me to start to realize. [0:45:06.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying, "What I'm trying to do now is accept it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Or understand it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean why should-remember I came in here because I was feeling bad about, about how I behaved with other people, especially new people you know, and the false fa�ade and everything. Well I think I realize now that's the way I'm going to behave. And if I'm going to feel-I should not feel bad about that. Because, that, that is me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it isn't a fa�ade. Or, or-no, I see. You're saying, "It's me to act that way with new people." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It would be nice if I were more honest. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I can-I'm just going to-you're saying, "That's what I want to accept, is that I'm not." </p>

<p>CLIENT: That, that I am-well yeah. We went through this cycle before too, didn't we? I don't know-it's going to be really interesting to see what happens with this girl I've been seeing lately because we've both, want to play a lot this summer. And that is to say we both have been through crises of a sort. And are looking for someone to just enjoy a good you know, sand and going to the zoo type things, this summer. </p>

<p>And I'm sure I'm going to see a lot of her. So that in seeing a lot of her it will be interesting to see how this develops, now that I have a cognizance of how I'm behaving. And now that I'm, anytime-I have, I develop a certain behavior pattern there seems - there will be a reason behind it. So it will be interesting to see if, if the ultimate, person that I am with her, is, the one I have been with everyone else for most of my life. If it is, I'm just going to have to say, "Well, that's me." If not, I would have to come in here and thank you profusely. For, well-maybe taking care of the problem that I initially came in here with. That is a, disenchantment with my own dishonestly. [0:47:08.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what you're saying has like, "How do I feel about my dishonesty. Do I want to change it? Or, accept it or-just whatever I'm going to do with it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's kind of hard. Well I don't know if- you see dishonesty has got such a bad connotation I wonder if we should use that word. Yeah, now you see, the reason I probably just said that was because, I realize that I'm going to end up being dishonest. And it is dishonest, no question about it. But it's so bad-running your life-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: With such a bad sounding word sounding word, yes. So-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So can't we find a better word for it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well let's not but let's just throw out the old connotation okay because it's probably wise (ph) now. So yeah. Will I end up being dishonest I don't know. I don't know if dishonesty is bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean with-let's say with the girl. What is being dishonest with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you see I have not, I have not really-I haven't walked-I haven't been with her, at any time, where all the fences were down. And I was just behaving. Anytime I've been with her, I've been extremely conscious of behavior, of my behavior. And it's clear that she is too. [0:48:19.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So self-conscious, is what you've been. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, and not behave-well, not behaving as reflex might have it. But thinking, "Well, this is the stimulus, what should be the response be?" And programming and coming out with a response. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Planning it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I'm sure you know, if you're close to someone long enough, that eventually that will break down. I don't know. Maybe not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you acting here? Do you act planned or not planned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here? No, unplanned. I'm prob-this is the honest, as honest as I've been. As a matter of act it's so honest, I'm not saying this to impress you, but-it is honest. I don't want to make you think that you know, you know-it is honest, okay? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't really behave this way with other people. Any time I try to be honest with anyone else it always gets all screwed up. But anyhow. Yeah that is kind of strange statement. I'm not saying it that to impress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I don't (ph) quite understand what you meant by that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's-as a matter of fact, what I was going to say is, as a matter of fact. It's so honest that it's really kind of stream of consciousness honest. There is very little thought-there is very little controlled thought between a thought in my mind and, the words that come out. And that's why sometimes probably-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel in here, to do that. [0:49:53.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh good. It feels good. Yeah it's-yeah it's really nice coming in here. Sometimes of course it's-nothing has transpired between one time and the other and I feel, uneasy to take up your time with-that's the only time I really feel, I might have a different feeling than what I'm, portraying to you. Is when I feel bad about coming in here with-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And don't say that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah with-I guess I haven't a couple times haven't I? Yeah, so even then. Yeah but I don't behave this way with anyone else, really. I don't think. No. I suppose I talk to Ted. I haven't seen her in months, by the way. I just thought I'd throw that in. Not that it matters one way or the other. But I suppose when I was talking with her I'd talk to her, honestly. But that was after months and months and months of being dishonest. </p>

<p>It was kind of strange, the first time I walked in here. You know well, I had decided that that was the way to be. I mean it just, it just-it didn't make any sense for me to go into this thing without being that way. I don't know, I-yeah now that there are world of yous out there it would be really nice wouldn't it. That's really good. I'm glad you brought that up. Because that's-that says something. If there were a world of yous out there, I think I could walk out and feel a hell of a lot better. I really would. [0:51:32.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the difference between, the way I act or-and the way the world acts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't-I don't have any pretenses with you. I mean I always say exactly what I feel. But-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what I was getting at, you were saying like if there were a world of yous out there, I was saying, well what, what is that quality that makes is, possible for you to do that in here but not out there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the-oh what makes it possible? Well, now again I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, but I only-it might. It's the opposite of course. I don't think it's as much a function of you which I-not saying one way or the other anything about you, but about the situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About the situation. [0:52:09.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just-doesn't make any sense for me to do this thing, and not be that way. Yeah that's really good. I'm glad you brought that up because you see I'm going to a different world, in a year. I'm going to Germany. And hopefully to emigrate. And if I could just-that'd be really great. If I could start out over there, that way. It would be very hard I think. Although it wasn't-you see it wasn't hard for me to come in here that first time and be honest. Because I said, "Well, I'll be honest. There's no question." And-but how would I be able to do it in 24 hours around the clock with anyone I confronted. That would be-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess what I don't understand is what that is that makes it hard out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll tell you. Why don't you answer that one. I think that's a good question. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't I answer that one? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What is it? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what it is for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that's what it all boils down to isn't it. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know whether you're saying, "I can't be honest in the world because, it's threatening and people will do me in, because I'm honest." Or, "It's no fun." Or "I can't get what I want if I'm honest." </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the best way to look at it is not so much-to answer your question by saying it's because of this that, or the other thing. But because of the fact that I was always brought up, with, a complete dishonest involved in the world. My parents brought me up with a certain way to behave when we left the house. And then I just sort of took that same, I mean you behave-you talk about people one way. And-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is what you're saying that, like in the house you acted one way. But when you went out into the world, like there was a whole other way, sort of to act. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You'd hear your parents talking at the dinner table about someone and saying some god-awful things. And then next time they'd' come into the house and they'd just be behaving nicely and everything like that. And it's just an extension of that, which I'm sure I saw from time zero until whenever it's all over. Twelve or so, and you're pretty much determined anyhow. I just, took that exact same thing. I took it inside myself, my own house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe it's just-it's not so much-it's just habit I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you picked up that one way of making a big separation between, what you do of yourself and what you do outside. [0:54:54.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah the more I think about that. Yeah, because there were some people in particular, that-as a matter of fact-well I'm sure it's reciprocal. My aunt Marla), who my parents, when she's not around, they just lambaste her. But just as nice and sweet as everything when she's around. And they see her a lot! I mean, she lives in the same city, just down the street. And there's never a good word said about her. And I'm sure that-since they haven't been down the street since I've been alive, I'm sure that that was the case. </p>

<p>That that was the table talk when I was first picking out words here and there and recognizing that Aunt Marla meant that lady. And, that was probably a problem with me, realizing that-didn't we just talk about her badly and now here we are being so nice to her. So yeah. I think it's just habit, an extension of that. (inaudible at 0:55:47.8) little kid, you just take the same thing. Put it right in yourself. No big problem there. So now all I have to do, is-anytime-what I have to do is anytime I'll just decide it's Marcy. And I'll be all set. It's going to hard for me to be honest, much less be dishonest in German. I don't know how to talk that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really worried about that. I'll go over there and I don't know what a pliers is in German. How could I possibly work in a laboratory. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll go, "Oh, this is what I need."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they'll give me two hands (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give you scissors. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see, I find out on Friday, in the evening, or the late afternoon. That's a week from-is today Friday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My goodness. A week from today. I will have recovered on Saturday. Would you like to see me on Saturday, is that out of the question?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I wouldn't like to see you on Saturday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, balderdash. Monday I guess huh? [0:56:55.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uhm, well first I'm thinking about a reaction I, I just had out there.  Uh, I don't know, i, it's sort of typical, I often felt in a similar position, but maybe I'm thinking about it more because I've never felt this way, uhm, in connection with you before, that I, that I can recall.  But uhm, when I came in, MLWZ had said something about he hadn't had a chance to get chairs out, because of the various meetings, and classes, and so forth, and I sa—, because I knew that it was probably time for me here, I said, "Well, that's alright, I don't mind standing.  And then the fellow who was waiting in the office said, "You want to sit down?  And I said, "No."  He was sitting in there.</p>

<p>Uhm, so that when you went by and said, "No chairs," uhm, I don't know, I felt I had to defend MLWZ for, you know — well actually he went and got one anyway, even though I'd said, "No, don't bother."  But uhm, I don't now, I felt as if somehow, you were going to be critical of the fact he hadn't put a chair out there, even though, and then I felt guilty because I had told him not to bother.</p>

<p>There's something anyway, I felt a—, as if uhm, I had to defend him, or you know, (Pause) I don't know, I mean, I took it very much that way, a, and then I was thinking, I could have taken it just simply, you were making a comment to make me feel better in case I'd wanted a chair, or uhm, or even if you were commenting on, there should be chairs out there and there weren't, I didn't have to feel guilty, and yet I did.  Or, you know, somehow, somehow as if I were responsible, or involved in it.  And uhm, (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So what does that make you think of?  That you feel responsible and guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, and, and I felt very much that it was sort of, you could, you know, feel, he should have had them out, and therefore be angry at him, or feel he wasn't doing his job, and, and somehow, that he could be in trouble and I was going to have to side with him, or defend him, or you know, somehow, it was uhm, you know, sort of lining up, the two of us against you, or, i—, in some kind of, I can't quite figure it out, except I don't know how much the fact I had said to him, don't bother, uhm, made me feel more involved.  But I think I might have anyway.</p>

<p>And uhm, so it's somehow this feeling of, of your being on one side, and then the two of us on the other.  A, and I me—, a—, it makes me think of 2 children to a parent, or 2 students to a teacher, or you know, something like that, anyway, where you were the position of authority, and, and the two of us were, were not, were somehow lesser, in lesser positions.  And uhm,</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Last week you were talking about 2 to a teacher, 2 to an analyst.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Well, because that has been on my mind, I, I, I guess I kind of purposely tried not to think about it over the weekend.  Uhm, but I saw FHYZ on Friday, and I don't think it was anything to do with that I didn't like seeing her, whereas I had questioned that over the summer, I didn't bother, uhm, but I was bothered by it.  And it didn't bother me when we ta—, when sh, she wanted very much to talk about herself and be quite open.  I didn't have to ask any questions.  Uhm, and I don't know, her marriage with MDRZ was s, so mismatched, I'd always felt it.  MSCZ had always felt it, and I'd always thought FHYZ was considering divorce, because of jokes she'd make, even though I said something to her like that on Friday, and she s—, she was surprised, because she hadn't been aware of doing it.  But ever since I've known her, she's joked about w—, if MDRZ and I ever get a divorce, or, you know, all sorts of things in that line.</p>

<p>And uhm, so I do—, I, I didn't, I don't think, felt, I didn't feel threatened at the time by what she's done, except I can't imagine doing it myself, being alone.  And she's totally alone, she has no family.  Because I asked her about her mother, she said she didn't even know if she were alive, but she's completely severed her relationship with her mother.  And uhm, her mother may be dead, she doesn't know.  And I don't know, th—, she's just completely alone, and she's taken a certain responsibility for herself, that uhm, I guess I'm thinking I would like to be able to feel that way, and I, I, I, on the other hand, would like to feel that way without having to go to the extreme step she's done, but I can't imagine it, right now. Certainly not in the way she's done it.</p>

<p>And uhm, so I don't know if I felt threatened so much, as you know, maybe envious of her for feeling that if that were her solution, which I would agree with her, it was, that she was able to do it.  It took a lot of courage.  Uhm, but what really disturbed me, was when we got on to me, at all.  And uh, (Sigh) I don't know, it, I realize, you know, I co—, I still couldn't remember what I had told her last year, but uhm, at some point it was appropriate for me, if I were ever going to say anything further, to say that I was going into a—, that I was in analysis, and going 5 days.  And she said she had guessed that, because of the times, but that I h—, not actually told her.</p>

<p>And then she asked me some questions, uhm, you know, because she kind of used me as ideally happy, ideally situated.  She's always been, loved to hear about my family, and even though she recognizes that I've had some problems with them, to her it sounds wonderful.  And uhm, she views the fact that MSCZ and I are married, and have FSO, and you know, everything is in her mind, ideal.  And I don't know, I did not mention my specific problem, you know, sexual problems, uhm, but I don't know whether she has an idea of that, or not.</p>

<p>But, it was just, and I didn't want to, because it's part—, it's almost as if I'm putting myself, uhm, or, I don't know, seeing that one of the main problems in her marriage was the fact that MDRZ was  impotent.  Uhm, you know, somehow I felt as if, well, I'm going to say, well, I'm almost as bad as MDRZ.  And I didn't want to, I didn't want to admit, I guess.  I j—, I just felt very inferior.  Because here she has had all kinds of problems, but the one thing that she doesn't seem to have a problem with, or at least in her affair didn't, other than inexperience, is sexual problems.  And uhm, I mean, at least her attitude is, she wants to enjoy sex, that's what led her to do that.  And she somehow, somehow, anyway, I was feeling that I was more inadequate, just on that basis, than her.  And even though I've had more experience sexually, and uhm, so I didn't feel I could talk about that.</p>

<p>But the things that we did talk about, partly maybe that, what frustrated me was that I wasn't really dealing with being honest about what we were really talking about, so she couldn't respond in a way that I would like.  But, but she still kind of took charge of me, and uhm, and you know, almost lectured me.  And I really didn't want to talk about it, it was more, we'd been talking about her, and then she was asking questions about me.  And I think I felt, I can't really just say I'm not going to talk about myself at all, you know, that somehow that was having a very one-way relationship with her.  Uhm, but I really didn't want to talk about it with her.</p>

<p>And, then I didn't w—, a,a, and in part, because I didn't like her response.  It wasn't listening and hearing how I see things.  It was more, she would hear what I said, and then tell me how wrong I really was, in effect, or how everybody feels that way, or uhm, or how pretty soon, I won't, or from her experience how she knows pretty soon, I won't.  Or I don't know, just different things that, she was just taking charge of me.</p>

<p>And, and I think I came away feeling very much the way sometimes I felt with my mother when I was really bothered by something, and I would try to talk to her.  And she would sort of say, don't worry, and it will be alright.  And I would have the feeling she hadn't really heard me, hadn't really understood.  And of course, FHYZ really couldn't, because I wasn't being completely direct with her, or honest, or you know, complete, or whatever.  Uhm, but somehow, I had the feeling that I couldn't be.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why not?  Except, as you said, that it's a way to hide things from yourself, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well I, that's true, I hadn't, I, I wasn't thinking of it just now, but I'd had, when I left her, and I was thinking about it, I did think, well why can't I talk about it.  I've come closest talking about it with FRA, but I didn't even then, really.  But I have a feeling that FRA can hear me better than FHYZ, in part maybe because she's uhm — I mean, FHYZ j—, somehow takes the position of, "Oh I've been going to therapists, or analysts," or whatever she's done, I'm not too sure exactly, for enough years so she kind of talks from a point of experience, and FRA doesn't.</p>

<p>But uhm, with FHYZ, on Friday, I think I came away having the feeling, and it's probably true with FRA, that if I really talked to her about it, then I'd have to really face it.  And I was trying to evade thinking about it.  And, but then I thought, well, uhm, (Sniff) sometimes I try to avoid thinking about it here, too, or don't think about it completely.  But I do think about more here, than I do in a situation like with FHYZ.  And I don't quite know, I mean, I don't, uhm, I guess I, I just didn't know quite how to understand that.  Uhm, because I didn't think it was just, just because you would, you know, keep at me and try to make me think about it, although that's probably part of it.  Or, or on the other hand, a feeling that I should be.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I think I began to wonder again, something we've talked about before, of how much I'm using coming here, still.  And wondering how much am I really thinking about it, or is it, am I doing it just enough to pretend to myself I am.  Uhm, (Sniff) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, enough to recognize you have fantasies about me, for example.  But uh, when you really get down to understanding how real they seem to you, and how real your wishes are, and how strong, then you back off.  And this sounds very much related.  You, you just don't want to face the central things that you feel, and want.  Because it's not just games.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, Pause) I don't know, I, I've come up against again the feeling of, if I do face it, or you know, start trying to, I have this feeling that then it means the first step in it is to say, I don't want MSCZ, I don't want our marriage.  And uhm, in fact, I almost have this feeling I was thinking about on Friday that, u—, you know, I avoided saying specifically what my problems are, why I have been going to analysis, to FHYZ.  But uhm, at some point I did say, it was not clear yet to me if our marriage would survive this.</p>

<p>And, you know, FHYZ kind of, oh, of course it will.  If you can talk about things with MSCZ, or, you know, just sort of, oh, I'm sure it will, kind of thing.  And tha—, at that point, I just felt I can't go on talking with her.  Because to me, u—, I don't know if I'm using it some way that I'm just not recognizing, but uhm, I guess I have the feeling, if I, if I uhm, decide that, I mean, it seems like i, if I recognize what my feelings are, then that is a part of it.  And then I will be doing what FHYZ has actually done, and I don't feel I can.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, but then I was just thinking about one aspect of it, you know, which, well, a couple.  Because I was thinking of the fact that, when I asked FHYZ how things were going, and how things seemed to be for MDRZ, how he'd react, and so forth, everything she said indicated that both of them feel as if, you know, there's hardly any difference in their life.  That they were each so unimportant to the other, that the fact they're living separately, if, if anything is just sort of a relief.  Because there isn't, you know, the tensions that there were when they were living together.  But that other than that, they don't miss each other, it's hardly any difference.</p>

<p>And uhm, yet FHYZ used to do all kind of things.  You know, little finicky things for MDRZ, and th—, it makes me think of how, uhm, some of these times when MSCZ and I recently have talked about my doing things to please him, and concentrating our relationship that way, and his saying, well that isn't showing me love, necessarily.  And uhm, because she would be doing things to please him, h—, doing things the way he wanted things to be done.  And in the end it was clearly quite meaningless.</p>

<p>And uhm, but then, and then I started thinking, well uh, (Sigh) I don't know, I have this feeling I'm using MSCZ somehow, and using thinking I can't think about this enough to consider the possibility of uh, giving MSCZ up, or you know, whatever it would mean.  But you know, I always sort of block on that.  That if I think of these things, it will mean that then I don't want MSCZ, or uhm, that I'm going to be on my own.  And somehow, I don't know, I can't get at it exactly, except I have this feeling just now, that uhm, (Sigh) it's a fear of being on my own 2 feet, and being on my own, having my own decisions to make, and nobody else to make them, and uhm, deciding what I want.  And it would then mean facing feelings that I won't now face.  And uhm, but, I don't know, so many times, I think I think well, MSCZ wants it this way.  So then, it's not me deciding anything, or uhm, being independent in any way.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well I, I don't know, this seems to be really kind of a side issue than the main thing, or, I mean, it's kind of part of it, I guess.  But uhm, I was just thinking about, we went to dinner last night at the VKT's.  They're the parents of one of FSO's friends, and they came up to PTN this summer.  We'd become, I guess fairly friendly with them, but we don't know them as well as the other people who were at the dinner party know them.  But it was a very pleasant dinner party, and the thing I'm thinking about is that, uhm, the women were all very articulate.  Except I didn't feel, I don't think I am, maybe some day I can be, but I'm, I'm not yet, in a situation like that.</p>

<p>And on the one hand, I'm thinking, you know, for the whole thing, I was wishing I could be as articulate as them, because often I knew I had some ideas, but I couldn't articulate them.  And also, whenever I did start to, I couldn't stand to have the attention that, on the other hand, I wanted, you know, sort of undivided attention.  For a period of time I still much prefer, you know, sort of throwing a few things out, very short comments, or making, you know, sort of joking remarks.  Or something that u—, very short, rather than having any kind of sustained attention.  And uhm, yet on the other hand, I was jealous of the other women who were more articulate, and who would hold the attention for longer, and could.  Uhm, and could sort of stand their own 2 feet on what they uhm, and what they wanted to say.</p>

<p>And it also makes me think of something FHYZ and I were talking about on Friday, connected with saying what you think, and not worrying about people liking you, or what impression you were making.  And you know, feelings it's more important to say what you feel, not necessarily untactfully.  But knowing that you might be saying something that's not popular, and going ahead and saying it.  Because I felt torn last night, and when I finally did say something with uhm, one of the men, it was uh, regarding roles.  And he was talking about how they try to carefully divide things up in the home, or sometimes it doesn't work, but they are very conscious of wanting to, and you know, very much sort of these new liberal ideas, which I don't totally agree with.  But on the other hand, I would love it if MSCZ wanted to do more in the house.</p>

<p>Except when I was talking to this man, I came across the other way, and felt what he was saying was then encroaching on my role as a woman.  Because I guess, I still can't see it any other way in, except in sort of a traditional view of, you know, the women, woman's place is in her home, and then she can work, too.  And it's definitely MSCZ's view.  And uhm, but I also have, I don't know, I just, I had a very strong feeling that he was not right about something, and it had to do with, you know, just sort of dividing the roles up.  Because that was what you better do.  And it was the right thing to do, and it, it was sort of the being "with it" kind of thing to do.  And uhm, at, right at that point, even though I don't always live this way, I h—, I had a very strong feeling that unless you're enjoying doing it.  Uhm, well, I guess, then I would think, but sometimes I don't enjoy some things I have to do, because somebody has to take the final responsibility if you have children.  And i—, this was all talking about in relationship to children.</p>

<p>And uhm, but I don't know, I just had this feeling you're giving the wrong message if you're doing something just to do it, and you don't like doing it.  Uhm, And I said something along these lines.  And he quite quickly closed the conservation, I, and I had this feeling, well I've said something really unpopular, and I've come on too strong, and I should have kept my mouth shut.  And I'm clearly, not completely sure of my feelings about it anyway.</p>

<p>But uhm, I sometimes th—, think too that I am more sure of my feelings than I'll let myself see.  And of course I suppose it's really true for what I won't face here.  But it all makes me get back to —  then I have this feeling I'll have to stand on my own 2 feet, and I can't lean on anybody and you know, sort of say, well, MSCZ wants it this way.  So this is why I do it, and I'm pleasing him.  Or even, you know, some of the things last night.  I was just very aware of certain things I haven't even really thought about.  I just know what MSCZ thinks, from talking with him or from what other people said.</p>

<p>And I used to do this with my father, uh, you know, sort of asking him what he thought, or bringing up something, you know, especially in politics, and then I would never think it out myself.  I would just kind of parrot what he'd said.  And I didn't say so much last night when the politics came up, which happened a good deal.  But my reaction was to think things the same way MSCZ did.  And then I just had this very strong feeling, maybe in the end I would agree, but I hadn't thought things out myself.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well then I was just thinking about (Sigh) FHYZ again and uhm, I don't, I mean it seems like it's a different side of it, although it involves her standing on her own 2 feet and really taking responsibility for herself.  And being completely alone as far as having what she wants, and what she does, and everything.  Uhm, but in deciding to have this affair with her professor, she decided what she wanted to do was just go out and have the physical experience of intercourse, because she didn't even know what it was like, or whether she would like it, or not.</p>

<p>  And then once she st—, once she was involved in it, she knew she liked it a, and that's all she wanted.  And she even made some comments, that she never wants to marry again.  But she would like to have affairs, because she likes having that kind of physical relationship.  And uhm, but she doesn't want it to become any kind of emotional entanglement, or anything, and you know, beyond, I guess she realizes it can to some extent.  Because if you like it, and you like it with a certain person, you'd want it to continue.  But uhm, I mean, she's just totally looking at it from, I don't know what word to use, except physical side, or you know, she just wants the pleasure of it.  And I, when I was first thinking about it, I couldn't stand to think of it.  Because uhm, you know, I just couldn't stand to recognize that that could become an overwhelming part of it, just the physical pleasure.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know why, except that in that case I kept concentrating on well, she doesn't really know this man, and she knows she might never see him again.  And she's doing something —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I'm not asking about FHYZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  — so i—, yeah.  (Pause, Sigh) Well, the only thing I can think it can be, because I just keep covering it up and all sorts of things, is uhm, that I don't want to recognize I have those strong feelings.  (2-minute silence) And I, I don't know, I mean I've been thinking about, well, why don't I want to recognize I have them.  And uhm, the first thing I was thinking, well, it seems like the most obvious thing would be because then I'd be afraid that they couldn't be fulfilled, and so then I'd feel terrific frustrations.  It's easier to deny them.</p>

<p>But uhm, but then I was thinking of, well we were talking about, I think last week, but other times of uh, (Sigh) well I can't remember exactly how we were talking about it, except it had to do with the strength of my wish, and then my trying to deny it, uhm, the denial, I me—, you know, sort of uhm, uh, well, all I can think of is being afraid if I really think it, it'll happen.  Why would I be afraid it would happen if I really want it?  (Pause)</p>

<p>And at this point it seems to me, it would be better to admit it than to, and take the chance it won't happen.  Except uhm, then I deny that that's got anything to do with it.  Uhm, (Sigh, Pause) and I also just have this feeling, thinking about it today, that it's uhm, you know, denying I have these strong feelings is a reaction that is going all by itself now.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I wonder why you haven't mentioned anything about my cancelling yesterday.  Ordinarily, when I cancel an hour, you talk at some length about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Mm, well, it was one of the things on my mind when I got in here, but then there are other things that uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, but, but, (Sigh) I just thought of something.  The way I phrased it, MSCZ was out, I guess he was parking the car, because we'd just gotten back when FEN called, and uh, she didn't get me until around 2:30 or so, because we, Z,,,,, I had somebody coming at 3:30 for an interview for the job.</p>

<p>And uh, I in fact thought that it was the girl calling, because I'd asked her to call and make sure we were home before she came.  And so I was totally, it was totally unexpected and when MSCZ came in I said, you know, you had cancelled.  And I put it, sort of, I can't go.  FEN called to tell me I can't come, or something like that, you know, I put it in a strange way.</p>

<p>And then I had the usual kind of problem, of almost, functioning, that I've had before, when, you know, sometimes, it's been at times when I knew ahead you were not going to be here.  But I'd always go through it during the time I would normally be here.  And uhm, I kept thinking at first it was because of the interview with this girl, which left me feeling indecisive, because I just had a feeling about her, that I didn't think it would really work well.  But it was nothing specific, and her reference was good.  And uhm, but, and I also felt how c—, I, you know, if she would really be good, I can't turn her down.  But on the other hand, I didn't want to accept her, and I didn't want that to be my only choice.  And I kept thinking, well, that's why I'm feeling this way, but I really think it was because sh—, you know,  I didn't, I couldn't come.  And I kept thinking of it that way, I can't come.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I was just thinking about the way I was seeing things yesterday, uhm, I think I wanted to be home in time to see the girl because over the phone she'd sounded like she might be quite good.  And in fact she sounded more direct, and energetic, and I don't know, just in every way, more what I would like to have, find, in somebody, than she did when I saw her in person.  But yet, on the other hand, I really think what was more important to me was that I could get home in time so I could come here.</p>

<p>And uh, I don't know, since sometimes I'm doing anything to be late, or to cancel, I, I don't quite know why particularly then I would, except one thing was on my mind.  And I don't think it's this directly, but I can't get at what it is.  Uhm, but this weekend in PTN, I had a lot of trouble sleeping again, and having all those fantasies I had when I was up there alone.  Uhm, and one of the 2 nights we were up there, my parents were there.  And we were there 3 nights, and 1 night of the three, my parents were there.  And the first night it was so late when we got up there, and I was so tired that I just slept, and I never gave it a thought.</p>

<p>But the second night my parents were there, and I kept waking up and having all kinds of fantasies.  My uhm, mother had decided not to lock one of the doors.  She'd locked the, well, sort of like, we put a storm door on, but it was the outside door, which is kind of a flimsy lock.  And then, the key was not right there for the uhm, more solid door, and she decided not to lock it, because we were all there.  Uhm, and I just had this feeling, well, my parents were no protection, MSCZ was no protection, and we were all going to be killed like the people were in "In Cold Blood."  And I don't think it's — MSCZ at one point, because I said something, he said, "I knew you should have never have read that."  Well I don't think it's that, because I have this feeling, there've been other things I've read in newspapers and so forth that I could think of instead of uhm, it's just I've chosen that particular one.  But (Sigh) this feeling of being so vulnerable, and, and that it's going to happen.  But I don't feel that way at home, it's only in PTN.  (Stomach growls, Pause) I guess I keep thinking, well it must have something to do with, it's my way of punishing myself, but — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I think it's just another way to express the same idea that you keep pushing away, keep denying, being afraid to face.  It shows up in a number of ways, but it's the same idea.  You want me to attack you and assault you, sexually.  And it shows up in this way, especially, I think, when you're separated from me up there.  But it showed up in your fantasies about, that I was the professor having the affair with FHYZ, that I'm FHYZ's analyst.  It's just another way to express your own wish.  You had fears of being attacked like this when you were a little girl.  These are the same kinds of ways you're expressing it now, because you don't dare to really face it, what you really want from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, the next question I have, is what happens if I really face it.  (Silence) And I know sometimes I've thought, when I've asked myself that, well, I couldn't handle it if you actually did act according to my wishes and attacked me, if I really admitted that's what I wanted.  And uhm, yet now I'm thinking, but if I really want it, then that isn't what would bother me, and it must be that it's the thought that you might not.  And so how can I admit I really want something as strongly as that would be?  Because I can't stand, I know from other things that I, I don't like to ever admit I want something, unless it's possible to have it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

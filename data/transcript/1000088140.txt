<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just not that important to her [inaudible at 00:12] let's put it that way. If she had learned how to say well, comes a time you have to stop thinking about it. She's works 6 hours a week, and for those 6 hours I guess she's been at least 24 to 36 hours separation. And suddenly she feels like she has to so that she's comfortable. You know, you've taught enough to know that you get out there and you're performing, and unless you're prepared to perform it can be just gruesome; time seems to inch by. But she's felt real good about her work. She had a very bad experience earlier and she's felt real good about her work, but it's also really taking a lot of time where that kind of claims her head over the weekend, and also it began to come to her head yesterday morning. And the combination of plain tiredness, fatigue and it's kind of upsetting; she's beginning to want to be the housewife instead of the [inaudible at 01:23]. I told her to slow down some.

</p><p>You get involved with people and there comes a time when you want to rest.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want to go out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Go out in the world, right. It's exactly what I feel right now Jacquelyn. It's like, this seems the heights of their problems; Susan has problems, several people at work have problems and I get pretty tired. I just feel so illogical, but I feel a sense of responsibility.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can't just turn them off and say sorry I'm tired.

</p><p>PATIENT: I can, I probably can, but I don't think they'd ever turn back on. That's the other thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to lose them in some way. You just want a rest.

</p><p>PATIENT: Just want a rest. There's Heather, a divorce, a friend of the family, she's kind of both Susan's and mine. She's more Susan's friend than she is mine. And she had a problem, and so that coupled with the ongoing problems with the kiddies, and you just really kind of want to get away from them. But I don't feel that I can. I feel that if I do kind of just shut people out, that I'll never get back in. It could [inaudible at 3:20] insensitive people; I'm beginning to question it. The more I question it gets a very bad look about it. It looks like the only reason why you listen to people, talk with people, is for my own gratification and that doesn't sound very good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't like that [inaudible at 03:40] 

</p><p>PATIENT: And yet I don't know is there some of that in all of what you do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, thanks. If you didn't get something out of it, you really wouldn't do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I just want to feel comfortable about that because I know it sounds so devious, you know, like oh, here I'm going to get my own gratification out of your problems. 

</p><p>Yesterday I went to an... it was Tuesday and Tuesdays are always fun because I go to work from about eight in the morning until about noontime. I come home, and then I have to baby-sit from noon until three, and then I go back at 3:15, 3:30 and I get out at 4:30, 5:30, 6:00, whenever I feel like, you know I've put in my time. And they're crazy down there. So it's the only time I work and get anything constructively done is in the morning. And yesterday in the morning there were three people, three separate people who broke into my mornings. They broke into my mornings with their own problems, you know. It really just drives you up the wall. I don't ever consider myself a fair person, it's not my point of view and yet I don't feel the compulsion to say this is not a direct business problem so I don't have anything to do with it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like you're feeling interest and concern and you didn't like to problem-solve, you also like to get something done and you need some kind of solid block of time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, the way I'm describing it is that, it's not aimless but it's really not [inaudible at 06:04]. It really makes me ticked. I'm very, very ticked about the thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel like it's building up and building up kind of thing. Somewhere I have to get things done.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't. Short of just, you know, beginning to chop people. In the past when I've chopped people off it has been very brutal. I mean they never come back. There's no way I can let them down easily, I just don't have time. Period. That's why there's no in-between. That's not very much fun. You've got people falling away. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want to just find some way to do it when you're not cutting them off forever, but also getting what you need.

</p><p>PATIENT: There's another very real sign of it too. This office is very nice, it is private and you can [inaudible at 07:15] the work do not disturb, and kilted in that is the fact that you're talking. I have a morning like yesterday morning, and no less than four people have me in an affair with each of the different people that I saw yesterday. That isn't very comfortable either, no privacy over there and it's a matter of sitting and talking around somebody, some third person listening. It's worse than nothing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That would be very hard.

</p><p>PATIENT: It is really. And I think that's one of the things that drive you up the wall. But when I had an office, it was even more of an enticement if you were talking to somebody to close your door. It was a complete enticement you know. Of the fact that you had to be doing something that was devious. And that takes a while to realize that. And the people [inaudible at 08:24] about it, you know, they're all, oh I see you were carrying on with so and so. There must be something going there. And that begins to reflect on me, it begins to reflect on my family, and more importantly it begins to reflect on my relationships because I begin to get paranoid about a relationship. I get scared, and it kind of makes me feel like I have to be sneaky. I can't cope with that kind of judgmental thing; I don't know what to say, I don't know what's appropriate term. I sometimes feel like saying, fuck you, man. But that in itself is not... because the response I make to that comment is critical, is very critical, because if they throw that comment out they're not sure of what's going on, and they, from the comment I respond with, they will become more sure something was going on. [09:33]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's really got you in a bind.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's really a bind. There's no place that I can sit down and have any kind of privacy with anybody without somebody looking in the door. It's really been destructive; it's really hurt people. [Inaudible at 09:55]. 

</p><p>One, a technician that we had over there who was married and she got to know one of the interns real well. The intern was not married. The intern stayed on to do a residency in something he really didn't care about doing, but what happened was what started out to be what - you know, I had talked to the intern and I had talked to the girl - what started out to be a nice relationship between two people was destroyed by all this Mickey Mouse stuff. And inadvertently, eventually those two people were destroyed. Here's a resident that's unhappy with what he's doing, here's a girl who's finally getting a divorce and going out to live I think San Francisco, and I'm not saying that the little snipes got both of them, but they didn't help anyone. The fact that people have problems is something that's very real, and yet I don't know how to, in my own mind... what I'm trying to do I guess in my own mind I can go ahead and do it, and the comments are not going to bother me. But the comments do bother me as a matter of fact. Okay? If that's not realistic that the comments are not going to bother me then how do I handle comments because the comments have to do with shameful and guilt. If they make me feel guilty I might be able to handle that but for the shame, the dirty, all that's implied by saying a lecherous old man... It's my father. It's a whole lot of things. [11:38]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you must be feeling all that whenever you're talking to someone. [inaudible at 11:52]

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. That is the crucial thing. Who is listening, who is watching, who's making the judgment on this? I guess the more you get to know people, I know quite a few people now at [inaudible at 12:09]. It's that same thing, it's not just at the hospital, there's no way I can walk out to the skating rink say, and sit on a bench and talk with this person without fear that some do-gooder coming bobbing by and seeing me sitting on the bench talking to this person and saying, ah-ha! And eventually that's maybe getting back to Susan who by the interpretation of this person who tells her, makes it very difficult. And I don't think that at this time we need that sort of challenge in our marriage. I'm not sure. I'm just beginning to feel comfortable enough to be able to talk with a person who's not the same sex. It's all right talking to people of the same sex, and you'd sit with a male and talk with him forever, and you can talk about the most basic things you want to talk about, that's fine. But if it's the opposite sex then it really drives you straight up the wall. I know that intellectually I can say it's their hang-ups, you know. [13:19]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that doesn't solve...

</p><p>PATIENT: That doesn't solve [inaudible at 13:27]. I guess there would be less strain, less of a feeling like I wanted to pull out, if I didn't have somebody looking over my shoulder.

</p><p>PATIENT: You really felt free to talk to a female in some way.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well my problem is, is that me? This is something that's first time Jacquelyn, is it me or is it this other situation? Is it really my hang-up or is it really something that's outside? Or is it a combination of both? And if it's a combination of both then how can I act on mine so that I can alleviate some of the mess? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can put it another way of course and say; do you feel guilty and shameful some way talking with a woman, with a woman that way? 

</p><p>PATIENT: This has happened many, many times before where eventually this allows me to go ahead and have an ongoing relationship. On any given day I can work well and effectively, and still have an hour or two hours to just sit and talk with someone. So it's not just that. I could have gotten a hell of a lot done yesterday I think if I hadn't felt the compulsion to every time I got situated with one of these three people, had to move somewhere where somebody can't hear. So this is something that's a very real problem. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you could imagine how you'd feel if you were in a place like here where everybody shuts the door and puts a sign up.

</p><p>PATIENT: Nobody bothers with you. You can turn it all so there are no disturbances at all. It's just something that I really want to have. I felt the same thing. I can't stand conversely, talking to someone like my advisor. When he's reading I'll sit down and start talking with him, he'll get out his mail and start reading and say, go ahead, I'm listening. Well, go ahead, I'm listening is a bunch of bullshit, because he's not listening and that makes me very, very angry. So that I would like to not only have the physical facility but since I can't have that to have then a mental facility for handling that. So if you have the compulsion to have to walk out and go somewhere else, or just kind of like be pushed from one side to another, which provides just the most immeasurable amount of frustration. And that really is frustrating.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now, they're coming to you about personal problems?

</p><p>PATIENT: There's some other very real problem that three, people, none of them, are unattractive. I mean, you know, [inaudible at 17:28] is a teacher assistant in this math course, and she is really just a beautiful young woman, I mean just really outstanding. Well, part of the reason that I have no privacy is everybody, they want to look at her, and then they want to know about her. Because that's not where it's at for me. If you have a conversation like this I can't sit there and you know... I don't even have any idea what her breast measurements are and I really couldn't care a less. That's not where it's at for me it's someplace else.

</p><p>Like last Thursday night one of the girls that I work with in town said that she wanted to speak to me after lecture, or speak to me sometime. And so we have a break - I work for three hours solid - we have a break, a fifteen-minute break. And we were sitting out there and she said, well I went to Chicago yesterday and to a hospital and I need to find somebody here that can do the post-operative observations. But I mean, I went to Chicago and I went to the hospital, well that could mean a hell of a lot of things, but you're back here tonight so obviously we know what you did. It's like a real surprise. And so I know some people who are involved with this abortion counsel here and I got through that, I got her to the right person all that sort of thing. It's that type of thing that you keep getting these things and it's affirming you, it's gratifying that you can help, it's really neat that you can help, you know that, but it also really kind of drains you. There was no frustration there because simply privacy was no problem. And we could sit on the bench and talk, and that was fine. It happened this morning; it sort of drives me up the wall. You're finally getting to the depth of the problem and in walks someone and it's this game of, well about that thing let me say this, and about that other thing let me we say this. And talking in a funny language, which I know must sound very funny to the person in the room and they probably have a good basis for thinking whatever they might. [20:32]

</p><p>Partly an alternative, the best way to get privacy is out in the hall.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you have to go stand in the hall and talk.

</p><p>PATIENT: At least she was seeing that people weren't going to come around in front of you and stand there and listen. That's not very conducive.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like there's a real need for it, and people see you as someone who really is willing and interested. So they gravitate to you and you feel it's [inaudible at 21:28] 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the big joke around there that well if they can't get the history then they call me. I don't even articulate all the emotions that that bring up in me. It's flattering and it's sick and it's the most backhanded compliment, it's emasculating, it's screwy. You know, it's got all that kind of crap attached. You know, we're going to ship all the patients off; it's the same thing as the patients that have cancer. Well, he's somebody that will talk to them. Will you talk to my patient and tell him what the situation really is? Well, why can't you talk to him? Well, I just can't talk to him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it must feel very, well, can't think of a word, but anyway, awful... because it's something you value very much. You get kind of treated lightly by them, and they're laughingly saying, well you can talk to them. And this is something very important. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And it makes people feel [inaudible at 23:03], the people who are not involved. It makes them feel terribly [inaudible at 23:09]. I feel like sometimes they would like to get involved statements like, well close the psychiatric clinic for the day or can I come out. It's really something. I can't tell you between what happened with Susan, and what happened with these other people, I just... really I went to bed last night at eight o'clock and I didn't get to sleep until about 10:30 because we talked and Susan was having more problems with Heather. Susan was uptight about going uptown today to see another program like hers with her. But I just really [inaudible at 24:20]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you went to bed to get a little peace and quiet. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I was amazed because it used to be even in final exam time when I was a freshman in college that I could knock off 15 to 20 minutes of sleep anytime I felt like it. I'd just lie down in bed and go to sleep. And this is the first time I can really say that I have not been able to get to sleep rather rapidly. And on top of this I'm taking two courses, of course. And these two courses are demanding, very demanding. And on top of that I have to present a research seminar in February to the department. It's the first one I've done for them; they're expecting something from that, obviously. It's sort of the little rabbit doing this kind of art display, like a coming out party. Before you're ready to do dissertations you've got to do a couple of these. It's good because it's like a dissertation; you defend everything you say. The other thing is I have to talk to a group of optometry assistants and their association and there's so damn many things that I'm just not sure, I probably want to talk to them about it, the fact that optometry assistants, or the optometry nurse, are having an expansion of their duties. That kind of meets the demand for optometry care for a patient, and that's just skyrocketing. They're going to be doing a lot more with patients, and you'll see less of your optometrist and more of your optometry nurse, much like in a hospital where the person who really cares for you is the nurse. So they're going through all this remodeling of these people, upgrading their educational standards and all that jazz. 

</p><p>And I have to speak before them and I have no idea what [inaudible at 26:48]. I have no idea what to speak to them about so I'm going to about five minutes of real short jazz about the fact that they're going to have to be looking for disease of the occipital nerve not just the eyes; the same story that I talk to optometrists about. And then, I'm going to talk about caring for the patient using three examples: using loves story, using on death and dying, and using Dr. Wendell. Do you know Dr. Wendell? He's this kind of kooky pediatric surgeon out of New York and he was sent to prison for failing to file income tax.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I must have read about him.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sure you did. It turns out this is an epitaph. He died a month after. It really appears that he was a person that really didn't care anything about money; he cared about people, he didn't care about money.

</p><p>The thing about this is that it's so opposite from anything I've ever heard anybody talk about. Never. I never heard anybody talk about caring for people. And that's scary. I don't want to be the person [inaudible at 28:34]. So there's some kind of tension that kind of hangs in the air.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like what will they do to me?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, what are they going to do to me, and it gets worse, Jacquelyn? There is a time I mean thankfully with some stroke of luck Susan knew how to respond, and I was scared to death, I was so scared to tell her about it. The most appropriate ending, I thought, for the whole thing was to sing "Bridge Over Troubled Water". [Inaudible at 29:10] It seemed like such an appropriate thing to do so why shouldn't we do it. 

</p><p>I'm really kind of scared it's such a departure because [inaudible at 29:33] that was fine. I was able to speak and speak well, but I am speaking about something that I never, from all practical aspects, never straight and narrow. I was talking about my research and I was talking about how hard it was, or the frustrations in research. Which is what I've always talked about something that is tangible. And this is something that is completely intangible.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel you're really sticking your neck out.

</p><p>PATIENT: That is the word; I'm really sticking my neck out. And Susan didn't laugh, but Susan didn't say, oh no don't do that. You know, I actually just picked her up and carried her around the room and showed her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you felt good that you could see what you meant. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I have a feeling that it will either be received well, or it just won't be. Where if I'd struck to the straight and narrow, talked about how to diagnose occipital diseases, that would have been much more appropriate. I didn't think [inaudible at 31:19]. The subject, what does it mean in 1971. It's kind of scary. I didn't want to put myself out, but I never really quite, you know, philosophy because of it is the typical stand up there and read word for word your speech. That's putting myself out on a limb and it may have given me too much confidence. I maybe really [inaudible at 32:05] but I guess what I want to do is prepare myself. This may sound crazy but I want to prepare myself if this doesn't work out this time [inaudible at 32:16].

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It may be something really important but they may not be able to take, or they may, but you feel [inaudible at 32:31]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess that's it. I want to still be able to talk about the intangible thing. I didn't know how hyper I was about all these things, I really am. 

</p><p>In all of this, in every bit of it, I am pushing so hard that I begin to get, sometimes an upset stomach. I [inaudible at 33:23] and I got acute rheumatoid, really chronic pain that I have. I've got a kid playing lacrosse and there's nothing worse than acute rheumatoid. It wasn't that painful it was just this joint right here. So when you talk and when you close you don't close together right. I close on this side first, and then this side closes. It's great for grinding your teeth. 

</p><p>But you know, little incidental things, like upset stomach, a little diarrhea, something like that, make me feel like death is imminent.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You must think what's happening to my body?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like this is really obscuring a little someone, somewhere, or this is really obscuring Lou Gehrig's disease. I have an annual [inaudible at 34:37] of the salivary gland because I'm still holding it down to a pack a day, under a pack a day, and a few pipes. But I begin to get that queasy feeling about it; I'm terminal. That upsets me that really upset me. I wish I could go ahead and do these things. When I look at it intellectually, it's crazy. I have a very good friend in Virginia; people who we had at Christmas, and this guy was telling me one time that before each class he literally threw up. I mean, you know, it's not quite that bad. When I was playing baseball, they would all be throwing up. That's not any good for any of the trap [inaudible at 35:35]. Anyway, so I know I'm not quite that bad, but I can't understand why these entire phenomenons tend to bring up that death idea.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow this kind of pressure or this kind of pressure brings it up when you feel this kind of pressure, and also you start feeling well that's another time [inaudible at 36:07].

</p><p>PATIENT: There could be an element about that; I never thought about that. You know, that's like a conversation the other day; one lady said that her cousin, who's a Podiatrist, he died when he was 34 of a heart attack. That would be in a couple years that I could be dying of a heart attack. I guess all this pressure, all these things to do, make me feel like I don't want to die yet. Please I hope I don't have a [inaudible at 36:54], please I hope I don't have Lou Gehrig's disease, but I don't want to die yet.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You have a fear of dying too soon.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I'm really not ready. There's also this constant fear of it. [inaudible at 37:11]

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 37:25 it crops up, death is coming. When things ease a little bit it's there too, like when I come home Thursday night, pull into the alley [inaudible at 37:49] here's this crazy person who was just looking for a white person to shoot. 

</p><p>That kind of fear it doesn't add anything to all the other pressures that I have. I don't have to handle that. What am I really saying Jacquelyn? Is it that I'm really so frightened of dying, and I really don't want to die because I want to be [inaudible at 38:52]? It gives me a very funny feeling about God; I always felt like God was okay but he was going to [inaudible at 38:45] when you really got going. The story of Job is the classis example of the cold clocking God. Moses is just a beautiful story, because Moses walks one time he couldn't go to the Promised Land. What kind of God does that? A crappy God if you ask me. And yet I have still have been raised so much in the ethic to know that God is in control. And for me to say that's a crappy God, I may end up back in hospital with the sky falling on top of me. I feel like I'm going to be punished once a month and these things I say. I just now started using the word Jesus Christ, or God, as a cussword and I always thought, because they said, thou shall not use the Lord's name in vain, that boy God must be going wild up there with [inaudible at 39:50]. A person's almost 30 to be talking about God up there with his big book, with as much educational background as I have is ludicrous, but that's still the things that I was raised and lived them. It's like Santa Claus and all his stupid fairies everywhere watching me during the Christmas holidays to make sure that I was worthy of all the gifts that he brought me, which is a bunch of crap, a crazy thing to be raised on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like does it feel like right now, for example, that death is some kind of punishment from God? So it's imminent because there are a lot of things to be punished for.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because there are only two or three of those Ten Commandments that I haven't broken. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I keep from feeling scared, I keep from feeling worrying about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I know I can't keep from feeling scared. I guess what I'm looking for is a way to go ahead and feel scared and then feel all right, if I cry. I don't want to never cry. I'd like to feel if I'm going to cry and feel okay about crying. That's when I'm healthy. That's when I cannot have the pressures of living. I could by being a hermit but I would be so terribly bored. But yet how can I go ahead and live through these things, and live them to their fullest, without having to think about... even with having the things like the death [inaudible at 42:09]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: For one thing it feels like you're really trying inaudible at 42:47] you're really trying to feel what death means all the way down you reason out of it completely. You get the whole sense, almost like it's [inaudible at 42:47]

</p><p>PATIENT: And then coming back and saying, oh yeah, it's not so bad. You could chop most of the things I like about the Bible and put them on one page, and I guess the one thing, the visitation after the resurrection, of course you know that's all been [inaudible at 43:08] scientifically acceptable to believe in something like that. He really had come back. But I'd like to believe that he came back. It's not the end, that's what he said. Those parts I mean the parts like, the virgin birth, the feasibility of resurrection, are not scientifically accepted and yet those are the parts that give a certain degree of confidence, a certain degree of okay feeling about it knowing that when I took my last breath that it didn't all stop, that I wouldn't be just some way hurled out of everything. [44:08]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 44:12] that made you feel so awful. I won't be here any more, I won't exist any more, and I won't know any more, all of it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I really am trying to explore that. I'm really trying to look into myself because I think many of the things that I talked about earlier today, about the privacy and things like that, I have to feel all the things like that, just sitting around and talking and I don't give a damn who hears. And it comes back to the intelligent part of me and says that's not too realistic is it? Because there are times when you are able to feel comfortable and that's when you have privacy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean to not being able to do it and ignore all the people around who don't see it the same way. Or you'd like to have complete privacy where you don't have [inaudible at 45:50]. It sounds like you wish you could feel the way you do with complete privacy in an un-private situation, like in a way that's impossible.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, is impossible, yeah. In any event that I'm saying is possible and really feasible, slowly, gradually becoming some sort of unrealistic person, losing grasp with reality. As this talk that's going to happen Thursday night, is that in fact unrealistic? Is it just a complete departure from reality? It certainly is a departure from tradition, but is it a departure from reality? If you define reality in terms of tradition, and these are questions that I have. And they're scary questions. The loss of reality in the mind is the big "s" word. That is [inaudible at 47:00] and they lock people up for those "s" words. I don't want to be locked up, I really don't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're saying I want to do something different because I feel it's important and I feel it's a way out. But I don't want to do something crazy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, in the back of my mind how much of this is for my own gratification? How much of this is really flare, unusual for unusual sake? Gimmicky, how much of it's really a gimmick and how much of it's really real? I'm very critical of [inaudible at 47:46] gimmick than that's my life. And that's the black of it. If it's real then that's the white of it and there, therefore, are no shades of gray. It's really funny, it's almost comical; I'm glad you're not laughing. I fell sort of like laughing about it. It's scary.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not funny it's scary.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's scary as hell. If you say that you don't think I'd have gone through with it, if I met somebody on the street and they [inaudible at 48:32], then I probably wouldn't. It's that scary.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like at this moment anyway, anybody could tip the balance.

</p><p>PATIENT: Sure. Susan would put it down. She says, ooh, that's really something, you're going to actually stand up there and do that. And I reply and say, no, I'm actually going to sit down and [inaudible at 48:49] It's really, really frightening. [inaudible at 49:18] I can do that without too much trouble and do it well. But this departure is certainly something that I'm not very sure of. It's exciting.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I sense the excitement and the churning feeling, scary feeling, and the questions and the doubts; they're all there.

</p><p>PATIENT: They really are. Now you see that's just an example of the whole problem. The scariness that I feel about the people [inaudible at 49:59]. I have no special training; I've never in my whole life taken a psychology course. In all this fancy education I've never had a psychology course. I've never had a sociology course. I don't know any of the great theories on anything in this area. I'm just completely blank. That's why I think that a book like what David Reuben wrote is the... I had to work through that. There was a lot of working through that. I worked real hard to not take it as gospel. But the question of should I be where these people are? Should I listen to them, which inadvertently encourages them? Or should I take the more traditional tact of going to work, doing my thing, and weather it as impersonal as possible? That doesn't feel right. That really doesn't feel comfortable to me. So again this departure from tradition is a very lonely, a very lonely place. There is little understanding by a great many people and that still has a tremendous weight of importance and may never, not be important because I live in this world. I live in the world with those people and what they say can ultimately get piddly, no matter how strong and how firm I feel about what is going on. And the questions that I just talked about with the talk Thursday night have to do with the whole thing when I end it. [Inaudible at 52:13] and a good teacher, someone who can talk well. I'm well trained, as I mentioned, in the art of talking: speech classes, the toastmasters, and all sorts of things. I concentrate very heavily on not over-using a word so that when I start saying, uh, uh, uh, that's a no-no. I'm into one now saying, you know, you know this, you know that. I'm correcting that. I know how to speak well and I sometimes just think I'll stick with that. It has such a real appeal it's controversial. I don't even know all the words for it. I sometimes think I'm crazy to examine all of those words.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 53:17]

</p><p>PATIENT: If look at it too carefully the obvious answer is going to come up. It isn't worth it; it really isn't worth any effort it takes. So its kind of fun to be rather romantic about it and saying it isn't perfect. So that I guess these are the questions that I'm asking myself and asking when I sit here and talk. It's great to sit here and talk, because I really ask those questions here. I sit and ask those questions.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 53:58]

</p><p>PATIENT: The answers don't come so easily as the questions. I'm not quite prepared; I've got to re-write that speech. So I'll go home and copy it again, and I'll be scared [inaudible at 54:21] a much more influential group of people. 

</p><p>Oh Jacquelyn, it's time for us to go. I used to know this guy, let me tell you about him that used to tell me that at times like this it's okay; you're doing all right. That was a very nice guy to have.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: You think you follow this all by yourself, if I hadn't been there, you would have never thought about this. It's my work. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's kind of in there.

</p><p>PATIENT: If I get into trouble I can always say, the doctor told me to do this. Something like Flip Wilson says, the devil made me do this. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That feels good too.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all I have. That's really all I have, because I never could quite live up to the standards of the people around me, the people who were very close to me: my parents, my brother. My brother and his wife always felt that I was just the most basic person in the world. My father, I think, saw in me some of the feature of him. He may have been scared that he saw a lot of him and that he had hurt a lot. But I had to have somebody so I made this God.

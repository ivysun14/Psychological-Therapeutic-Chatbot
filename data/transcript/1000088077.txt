<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: And even then my wife seems to be able to figure out why.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you've been more than just incidentally tired, like it's been a thing big enough for you and your wife to notice and wonder about and...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, just last night she said something...or what got it all started was the fact while we were in bed together I just stopped in the middle of everything. And she says, "What's the matter?" and I said, "I'm tired." She said, "What have you got to be tired about?" [1:02]

</p><p>She worked from 10:30 till 5:00 yesterday. I didn't do much of anything all day; in fact I took a nap for about two hours in the afternoon and nonetheless I was still tired. 

</p><p>So, well I can get tired just thinking about it. Just I get tired when I am resting which is somewhat of an accomplishment, I guess you might say. I will go down in the annals (ph) of history.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Had you started to make love with her or something? Yeah. It sounds like you started in, and then after you had partly started you realized that you didn't really feel like it. That you wanted to sleep. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well there wasn't the right mood in the first place but nonetheless it had been awhile and so my masculinity says, you better get with it and all of this. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You better get with it - you've been neglecting it. It's about time.

</p><p>PATIENT: That along with the fact that every once in awhile, it just kind of approaches your subconscious you know that you need to - physical release and all this. Like you say, nonetheless I keep thinking that I don't keep her occupied some other guy is going to so. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's a lot of things entering in. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said, there just wasn't the mood for it. She wasn't really in the mood at all. I wasn't completely in the mood. So, it was a comedy of errors? [3:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know when you first started talking about it, I thought it was just you who wasn't in the mood, and now that you say more about it I sounds like - it's more that your responding to her not being in the mood.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think she was less in the mood for it than I was, but like I say, from my own standpoint I felt [well it's time] (ph) for another go around and nonetheless it didn't seem to be any more pleasing to either one of us, you might say...so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It wasn't very good, so you quit. I don't see why you're shaking your head there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, we go to a consummation regardless of how enjoyable it is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh you're sort of smiling at the way you do it whether, you know - you have sex whether you like it or not. But it was...it was that that was sort of amusing that fact that...ok.

</p><p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) (inaudible at 4:36)...like I was thinking there last night even. It would be almost funny to a lot of people probably to have a motion picture of this and be able to view it you know, in a sort of fighting atmosphere that goes on. Not from a love fighting, it's more of a...you know [Ralphiano and Jerry Lewis] (ph) type fighting you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's a real fight not a...

</p><p>PATIENT: One of these days, I'm going to haul off and belt her right in the mouth - type fighting. A lot of things that entered into it. In the afternoon I had read this article in the magazine section of the paper about divorce. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me a second, it may not be bothering you but the tape recorder is driving me nuts. So if you don't mind I'll take a minute to switch recorders. [5:36]

</p><p>PATIENT: Need some help?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ah...

</p><p>PATIENT: Can I help?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, would you... (inaudible)

</p><p>(audio gap while tape switches)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think you were - you were telling me you had this real knock down, feel like falling off and slugging her type of fight as before.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah she just...like I say, she wasn't in the mood and she wouldn't even...as far as I could see mentally enter into the situation at all. Like I say, I was only in the mood slightly and I guess I was hoping that she'd get me more in the mood but then that didn't...wasn't really feasible (ph) then to expect that I guess.

</p><p>But like I said, I read this article on divorce and...the article started to take my thinking on divorce from the realm of impossibility and put it in the fairly probable realms you know.

</p><p>Also the night before she had this Redbook or some magazine that she was - "Here I want you to read this article" and it was about some women who was writing in how she was suspicious of her husband all the time. And every time he talked to another woman she always got ideas about what was going on behind her back and...

</p><p>I read the thing and I got through with it about 10:30 - 11:00 you know, and by this time she'd gone to bed and I went upstairs and I threw it down on top of her and I said, "It doesn't fit." Of course she came awake you know and I said, "If you don't know why, why then forget it" and I walked out. [7:48]

</p><p>So the next day I told her I said, "It just didn't fit because this husband had never given his wife any inclinations that she should be jealous or suspicious of him on anything...and yet she was." And I said that, "If you think that I have no reasons to be suspicious of you then you have another thing coming." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you were angry because she seemed to be blaming you and showing you the article and implying that (inaudible) you wanted to tolerate it...ah you know...if anyone's to blame here...you know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Reading the article, why I got this "it doesn't fit" idea long before I finished the article and [I sat there] (ph) and I kept saying - "I'm going upstairs, I'm going to throw this right in her face." 

</p><p>And of course I wouldn't be so violent, and when I got up there I just kind of threw it down on top of the covers on top of her which started to wake her up; which is what I wanted to do anyway. So like I said, this - things like this enter into the idea of not being in the mood. (inaudible at 8:58)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How did you like...and that's a change for me the way you usually operate I guess. I guess you usually go through with it whether you're in the mood or not and I just wondered how you liked operating this way...that is stopping when you're not in the mood.

</p><p>PATIENT: From my stand point I'd rather go all the way through with it, then to stop in the middle because it clearly frustrates me to just stop and say, "ah [heck with it] (ph)" and roll over and go to sleep type thing. 

</p><p>I'd rather go ahead and consummate the active (ph) and if you don't have a mental preparation or mental inclination or whatever you want to call it. But the few times that we have stopped and just said, "Oh, to heck with it" - and quit...have been more frustrating than like I said, going on and not really caring (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's more frustrating...

</p><p>PATIENT: There have been times when I guess we're mad at each other and just stop right in the middle of everything. (inaudible).

</p><p>Last night she came home from work about 5:30 and the first thing I do is jump all over her about the dirty dishes in the sink which I had put in the sink Saturday morning to soak. I thought well, she'd finish them up and wash the dishes Saturday night or maybe Sunday morning at the latest you know.

</p><p>But then I came home Sunday afternoon - or Sunday at noon from church with the two kids and I had to feed them some dinner and I couldn't find any dishes because they were all in the sink dirty. It's thoroughly disgusting and I told the minute she got home that, "The next time I put dishes in the sink on a Saturday morning and they were still there on a Sunday evening when I brought the kids home to feed them - the kids were going to go to bed hungry." (inaudible)...we weren't going to have it anymore because we had to scrounge around, wash a dish here and wash a dish there. [11:07]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just...weren't going to scrounge around like that anymore.

</p><p>PATIENT: But then Sunday night I was going to stay home and watch TV. And she had the idea that she wanted to go to church, since she didn't get to go to church Sunday morning because she had to go to work. 

</p><p>So I said, "Ok you go ahead and just take the kids with you." You know...I said if she takes the kids with her she can't do too much you know...running around idea. (ph) 

</p><p>And so I went on down stairs and ate my supper and came back and said, "You heard what I said didn't you about taking the kids with you?" She said, "If I go, you're going with me." I said, "Why?" She said, "Well because I don't trust you." 

</p><p>And this to me was just want I wanted to hear. I wanted her to say she didn't trust me. So I got dressed and went to church with her. I asked her later why she didn't trust me and she said, "I'm just going to treat you the same way you treated me." 

</p><p>I said, "Oh fine." That's to me...that's the way I want it. As crazy as that may sound that's the way I want her to treat me - I want her to not trust me because then I feel like there's some love there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah...like if she cares enough not to trust you - she's involved. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and maybe she will understand how I feel. Something like that I don't know. But anyway, I wanted her to say she didn't trust me and she did so. This was encouraging but not enough to really smooth over all the things that had gone on. [12:44]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Gone on...yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sitting here thinking about my job (inaudible), in case you're wondering what I'm daydreaming about. I go from one subject to what seems to be the opposite (snap) just like that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you move from subject to subject too fast?

</p><p>PATIENT: Seems that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what part of it you don't like? [14:29]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well the part that I don't think of anything long enough to really give it a complete thought, I guess you might say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I see what you mean.

</p><p>PATIENT: My mind jumps around [so I have] (ph) instability I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not only does it prevent you from going into a topic as deeply as you'd like but also it makes you wonder if it's a recent (ph) sign of instability I guess. I don't know like if you were a healthy person you wouldn't do that or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: This past week I've been thinking about this suicide idea - all week long. The other day I was laying there watching TV, the kids were upstairs asleep I think. Anyway...every once in while it comes to me. 

</p><p>I wish I had the ambition or intestinal fortitude or whatever it takes to kind of get out of this mess. Then this women bright and early (inaudible)...having a dream really. Then I wait downstairs and...something about...

</p><p>I don't know I must have been about 18, 19 or so - number. And I was transferring to a new school or something and I came to this town and got in with some guys, and the first thing they did was kill five people. They had to be actors of something, and they took their bodies to this school and they set them up in the back of the school yard - and it was my car they were driving around in. 

</p><p>The next day I checked into the school and I was enrolling in classes or whatever - I don't know what it was all about. I can't really figure out what brought that whole thing on. [16:52]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, scary though.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah kind of but things I'm thinking about...this may not be a dream.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Do you feel like trying something (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Trying something? What do you mean?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um...well there're some things - some techniques I've heard about to go over dreams. Sometimes they seem to be valuable to people.

</p><p>PATIENT: Analyzing dreams?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not...maybe I should just tell you about it. It's like - it's not analyzing - it's like experiencing it again. The first step is to tell the dream again but to imagine it as literally as you can and to speak about it in the present tense. 

</p><p>Like not; that is instead of saying, "I was about 18."...say, "I'm a young man. I'm about 18."..."I am going to a new school." 

</p><p>PATIENT: It sounds alright to me. I don't know that I can get it all straight or not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well don't worry if you miss a detail of something. It's not crucial.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I had the same dream again. One time I had a dream that I had three or four times and it got to bugging me after awhile. Ah, let's see going back and starting over again.

</p><p>As I can see it I'm 18, 19 somewhere in there and I can recall that I was supposed to be transferring from the University of Virginia to what seemed to a high school. And seemed like to me I have about 70 or 80 hours and I only had a few - 20, 30, 40 hours left total to get a degree. But nonetheless... 


</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were almost (inaudible at 18:59) ready to graduate.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm say a sophomore level college student and I'm transferring to a high school, and I come to this town where this high school is - transferring in as a student of course. And somehow I get in with these three or four guys, and the next thing I know we have killed five people I think it was. All of them actors, and to the best I can recall all of them male...and taking these bodies to what seemed to be a schoolyard. 

</p><p>And there was this street that goes around the school; starts on one side and it goes up along the school and turns and goes along behind the school and then goes straight in back of the school. And there's this little corner here where there's a brick wall and there's some businesses next door to the corner. So we pulled the car in to this little yard - sports field. We take the bodies out and we set them up in this corner.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The bodies are dead now and you're setting them up in the corner.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, we set them up in this corner and while we're doing this as I recall...a car comes along and [we start bobbing] (ph) and we duck down of course out of sight. And nonetheless it was my car that we were using.

</p><p>And then we get this all done and the scene changes to the next day and I'm at this class; [I'm going to] (ph) a class and you just give them your name and address or something you know...then roll right there in the class instead of going into an administration building. 

</p><p>And the class doesn't seem to me, it was too far from this grade school. But nonetheless these bodies have been discovered and the talk of the town is these five bodies that they've discovered and they're trying to figure out who did it. [21:13]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you hear them talking about what you did [in the past days.] (ph) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Of course in the back of my mind is the - why I was in on this. I didn't actually do the killing of course as I recall, but nonetheless I helped them transport it and all this. (inaudible at 21:31)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're an accessory. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah [they'll hang me just as high as they hang] (ph) the others so... (inaudible). In the back of your mind you say...well I know all about this but still you can't talk about it because of course it is a crime. To this town it's the crime of the century.

</p><p>And the atmosphere in this class is kind of somber. And one guy which you can more or less...ah one of the three guys that you were with last night when you did all this...that you were more associated with than the others, happens to be in this class. 

</p><p>And of course you pretend you don't know each other because you just might shed some light on previous experience - why did you know this guy and all this. And after I enroll in the class and the class gets started, then that's about the time that I wake up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok. The second step in this thinking is to go through the dream again. But this time don't tell from the point of view that was your own point of view in the dream. Tell it from...as if you were one of the other characters in the dream. Maybe the best character to be would be the guy who was associated with you. Like...

</p><p>PATIENT: Why? The one I knew that was in this class then. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like talk...say, "I" for him and say, "him" for who was you in the dream. [23:30]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like I said before, this guy that I'm going to portray now is about oh I don't know...15 I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "I'm a young kid." "I'm about 15."

</p><p>PATIENT: Ok I'm a young kid about 15. I seem to be pretty smart...have lots of friends in town and in school and what have you. I'm going to get a hold of this guy who has come into town to enroll in school, show him a few of the places in town, have a few drinks, decide on some fun - turns out to be killing some people. This guy has a new car so we'll use his car.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you...How do you feel about this new guy who's come into town?

</p><p>PATIENT: He's just another guy...like I say he's got a new car...why you never can tell when I might need to impress some date...I'll just be his friend from the standpoint of someone to use. It seems to not worry me at all about this killing and what can come of it and everything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're just out for a good time and that seems like (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible) the next day you see this guy again and...yeah maybe I better not say anything to him till we've go a chance to kind of get our stories straight. Make sure we both have the same story on what happened in case we're ever asked. [25:31]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's it?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's about it. The other two guys...I can't really shed any more light on those guys standpoint then I can from the previous one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Did anything happen to you, as you were telling this (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Except for the fact that I maybe realized that this other face. It seemed to me this might have been somebody that I knew in high school or something. It kind of...maybe even grade school or something. 

</p><p>But this face and personality kind of strikes me as being somebody I might have known years ago. In fact I think I can even remember the guy's name now that I might have been thinking about him. Well it could've been several people that I've known. 

</p><p>I kind of see now what this does. It kind of makes you go back and think of why you had...why you chummed around with this person, or how you feel this person felt about you when you were friends. 

</p><p>Seemed like to me this was a guy that maybe I ran around with in grade school or high school or something...we were what you might call superficial friends. They're your friends as long as you're there and hear them and everything...and then you get out of earshot why you're just a another guy. And if they had to do anything for you it wouldn't be anything that would be out of their way. If it was a convenient - fine but if it wasn't then they weren't there for you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you were used by him not really...he didn't give you any real friendship. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see I look at it now...you know....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's kind of a fun loving but destructive person.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it seemed like a - now that you go back and think of it you can think of several people that you ran around with that as times pasted that just - what might have been seemingly destructive.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think I've known people like that and I've always felt like they weren't good people and yet in a way I had a just a little bit of admiration and envy about them. Is it like that for you? [28:36]

</p><p>PATIENT: Uh huh. Back in high school and grade school...maybe even college and service life...in fact maybe even today, I don't know...I am more of a follower than I am a leader. And it seemed like I'd have friends, and they'd say, "Let's go do this, let's go do that" and I'd do it. And 99.9 percent of the time it was never me initiating it, it was always them saying, "Let's do something or let's do this."

</p><p>And this being destructive aspect really comes out when you think about the...well mine comes out in me (inaudible) when I think of some of the things I did right after I got out of high school. We used to get out in cars and drive around. 

</p><p>One of our favorite sports was driving down the street and all these cars parked in on the street had their rear view mirror, you know. We'd get a little club or railroad spike about yea (sp?) long and take that (inaudible at 29:44)...hang out the window and chi-chi-chi-chi-chi; break all the rear view mirrors...which was something to do. Then we'd go see if we could siphon gas out of a car. 

</p><p>One time we were in a guy's driveway standing right next to his house; siphoning gas out and the lights in the house came on...so we made a B line for the car. And the guy comes out the door, he sees us or he saw one of us getting in the car or something and starts towards us. So we start the car up and take off down the street. It's a bloomin (ph) wonder we didn't get our little behinds thrown in jail. But we seemed to luck out...we were out of there before we got thrown in jail or something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Was it kind of exciting and adventurous at the time?

</p><p>PATIENT: A little bit. We'd go out and see if we could break 100 mirrors in one night - or something like this you know. Nothing...it wasn't something that we tried to see if we couldn't get our name in the paper or anything like that. Because it'd probably scared the daylights out of us if they'd said there were 150 mirrors broken on such and such a street...some night.

</p><p>We even side swiped a car one night and took off. I guess things like this kind of come back to me...you wonder why in the hell you're not sitting in some jail cell...twenty to life basis. [31:08]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And like now when you think about it....phew. If what had happened had been what you might have expected to happen, there you'd be in jail...quite the long stretch.

</p><p>PATIENT: I look at it from the stand point that if they'd thrown me in jail for breaking mirrors, I'd have gone out and tried to do something more destructive next time...and if they caught me on that why I'd been one of these guys that who was 25 I'd of had a 100 year sentence against me maybe. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you'd have been caught you would have been very angry and gone out to do more.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I used to get traffic tickets all the time - speeding, reckless driving, running red lights - just about anything. You know I used to have a string of traffic tickets against me there and a string of traffic violations on my record. And every time I'd get caught I'd want to go out and do some destruction if the guy gave me a ticket.

</p><p>And he stopped me and just chewed me out and let me go...then I would either...wouldn't do anything you know, I'd go get me a coke or go home or something like that. But if I got a ticket I'd want to take out some revenge on somebody or something. So I'd say I got tickets (inaudible).

</p><p>Maybe things like this go back into your subconscious and then you start dreaming about it, and they come out you know as a very destructive. Some of your dreams are now being... [along each life.] (ph) [33:05]

</p><p>And again like I say when I woke up I got to thinking about...well there's this thing out here in California...well that kind of influenced me. [Trying to understand what was] (ph) coming out of my subconscious what I'd read in the papers about the Sharon Tate murders and everything like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: At times you're implying that there is a small, not very active but still real part of you that's destructive and angry and vengeful. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can do more work when I'm mad then I can when I'm not mad. And I know this from experience. When I get mad I'll go and blab and I can sit there and do a test that would be a tease. But I will sit there and do the test and think about things and be able to put out the work - whereas, if I'm not mad then I can't keep my mind on it and I won't want to do it if it's a long tedious thing. I think subconsciously I try to save all this tedious work to do when I'm in a mad state.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you can just attack it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I've got all my frustrations on this thing called a job. 

</p><p>This idea of a wife not entering into the sex life like I would like for it to do is...it gets to the point where I think about (inaudible) so-and-so (inaudible) intercourse and she really entered into it and I wasn't stimulating her any more than I'd stimulated my wife. So something like this and [things like this got me thinking] (ph) that...

</p><p>My wife plays the typical female part where she just says, "Ok here I am" and lays there you know and doesn't participate, she's just, "Well it's my wifely duty." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I have had an image with her - you just taking her by the shoulders and shaking her. [35:58]

</p><p>PATIENT: If she wasn't bigger then me, I might. But like I say I haul off and slap the (inaudible) out of her only when I'm feeling really brave because she's got five or ten pounds on me and she's just about as tall as I am. 

</p><p>She may just haul off and whop (sp?) me twice as hard as I whopped (sp?) her when she's done. I keep saying well now, that the ideal wife would be one that's only about 5'0 tall and weighs about 110 sopping wet. Well you haul off and slap her and she wouldn't be able to slap you back as hard if she tries. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah there's no outlet for your frustration in your marriage. 

</p><p>PATIENT: In the back of my mind I keep saying maybe I've got a brain tumor like this guy down south at some University - (inaudible) shot 40 people and killed about 10 (inaudible) or something like that? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've got something hidden in you that's...

</p><p>PATIENT: I've got something driving me that I really don't have any control over. At times like last night coming home from work - or, coming home from church - my wife and I got in an argument over whether this girl who lives down the street was at work or not. 

</p><p>My wife takes this, "I know it all. You're not going to tell me anything" type of attitude. And I was so mad I gripped the wheel and thought I'd...if it was made out of anything less than what it was I'd have busted it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like you feel that the rage welling up in you...like it could destroy anything destroyable. [37:57]

</p><p>PATIENT: Right now between us there seems to be some kind of little wall of...well I don't know just how to describe it. Nonetheless it seems to be there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're cut off from each other.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and not completely being able to communicate enough to...maybe not really wanting to, to a great extent. Everything has to be with what she said (inaudible at 38:38)...nothing was improved by it. She wants that divorce that she should have gotten ten years ago.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe there is a connection to that?

</p><p>PATIENT: [Who knows?] (ph) Then again maybe its not there, maybe I just think it's there. This wall I mean. It doesn't seem to be very thick; it seems like it's made of about two sheets of paper and if I really tried I could penetrate it. At least that's the way I see it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it's a real block, but it would take only...like it really would be possible for you to get through it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I keep in the back of my mind; I feel like I should get more sympathy from her from the standpoint that I'm trying to change the situation it's just that I don't know what the problem is. And she seems to be with this impression that she's not going to do anything and it's just going to have to be me that does it all the time. And I don't even get the satisfaction or a slight bit of encouragement, you might say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I think I see what you mean, like if you felt like she was reaching over the wall and waving at you or she was digging away with her fingernails on the other side, like then you might feel like really going at the wall. But if...you don't want to do it all. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said, I think there's about two sheets of paper and I am willing to tear down one of the sheets of paper if she'll tear down the other one. But it doesn't seem like she cares if the wall comes down or not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel bitter? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like for instance this morning...usually Sundays are pretty good days; she gets lots of tips you know and everything. Last week she came home and she had oh - 12, 13, 14 dollars in tips that she'd made on Sunday. So being almost flat broke I stole a couple of dollars out of her purse yesterday morning, and I had a dollar of that which I had survived on. I had to. 

</p><p>And nonetheless this morning I asked her if I could have some money. She didn't want to give me any at first and then she said, oh well she'd give me a couple dollars for lunch. And it seemed to me that she'd probably made 12, 13, 14 dollars this time you know and she just didn't want to give me any of that. But if she had to, she'd give me a couple of dollars. [41:28]

</p><p>And so I asked her about it and she said they had a slow day yesterday and she only made about 7 dollars in tips or something like that so. She was keeping five of it to buy groceries and like I say, I don't really believe her.

</p><p>This, is the great part you know; I keep looking (inaudible). And so I just kind of pass it off, I don't look very much. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It feels freer.

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel a little freer that way. There are so many other things that you don't know that (inaudible at 42:27). [We'll meet at a hole in the wall with a tape recorder] (ph) but there's a microphone under the telephone, so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I've got it completely out of your sight.

</p><p>PATIENT: Since this way, I feel that I said...well, now...remember I said something about you needing to come out and have dinner and meet the family and all this and 

</p><p>(inaudible) maybe I can ask her if she can come out and have dinner one of these nights, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you want to ask me that, but you feel that you shouldn't or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was thinking that (inaudible) that it would be completely...open you might say. I feel like I should say whatever I'm thinking and a lot of times I think well... besides that fact that I'd like you to meet her and see the house and see the kids at all this you know. 

</p><p>In the back of my mind, I say well it's another female that I can make another pass at. But on the pretext that maybe it will help the therapy, but then I keep saying, "No, now I've got to keep this separate. This, is might be adverse influence on me." A therapist pictured relationship, so you better not say things like this. Don't try to complicate the issue with making passes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So like it occurs to you that you'd kind of like to make a pass at me, but like you're I don't know...sort of cautiousness or something tells you that, "no, no you don't want to interfere with the therapy." [44:54]

</p><p>PATIENT: This, is a different type of situation now if it were somebody at work - and you'd say, "Well now I'd like to go on out and a have a drink with her, you know." It wouldn't be - it just wouldn't influence my therapy then in the back of my mind...whereas here it enters my mind that this, is going to influence the therapy and have adverse (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess you're saying that the therapy is pretty important to you and you don't want to do anything that might mess it up or make it less useful for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: As I said before, I want it to succeed and they aren't for the same reasons that I wanted it to succeed in the beginning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah?

</p><p>PATIENT: At first I wanted it to succeed so it could save my marriage, so that all these other problems that might enter in - in divorce court and all that would be out of the way. Now I don't know, maybe I've gotten the impression that it's not going to succeed today...its dead. 

</p><p>Nonetheless I still want it to succeed from the standpoint that I will be a different individual when it's over with than I was when it started...for my own benefit.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like regardless of what happens to your marriage, there's ways that you want to change for yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said before, one of the reasons I kind of like to bring somebody home every once in while is to get the house cleaned up. Because it seems like the only time the house really gets straightened up is when there is somebody coming to visit. 

</p><p>And maybe to a certain extent I try to keep this idea in my wife's mind all the time you know. Oh, "I may bring somebody home tonight you know and you better clean this house up so...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Keep her on her toes. [47:14]

</p><p>PATIENT: Keep her on her toes. But I think I have worn it out. Now it doesn't seem to work as well as it used to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: My mind is sort of going back to what you said about sometimes you think about making a pass at me...and let me ask you one thing about that, if I may. 

</p><p>I wondered if maybe it wasn't only you know, sort of a sexy looking young girl...but also maybe you wanted to get more involved with me - get closer or something like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said before, I can sit and talk to a girl and I can...I don't know...I can talk and say things, maybe understand myself, all kinds of improvements it seems like that I just can't seem to do when I talk to a guy.

</p><p>This, is one thing. Also from the standpoint, in the back of my mind...I keep going back to this idea that came to me whenever I first got this whole story played out to me that my wife had had some boyfriends and she had one there that was sort of - to me - a lingering love affair. 

</p><p>And so the first thing that I said was, "Ok then I'm free to go out and find me a love affair other than you" and it's still not completely out of my mind. Maybe someday I'll meet a girl that I can go out and have a little affair with and that ah...well see what this having an affair outside of your home life is like.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well you'd kind of like to use your freedom...see what it's like. Maybe it'll be good and also like, in your relationships to women before you've gotten something. Something that you can't get from a man.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, a type of friendship that you just can't get from a man. If you go out and talk to a guy, ok so you're two guys you have problems and you sit and tell each other your problems - he can't really see what your problems are, and maybe you can't really see what his problems are. 

</p><p>Whereas when you talk to a woman she can understand more of what you're problems are it seems like to me. Maybe it's just a fallacy that I have built up in my mind. [50:08]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it seems like with a woman, like she can really understand what you're telling her.

</p><p>PATIENT: It seems like to me that most my problems have to do with love and companionship and this, is more knowledgeable to a woman than it is to a man. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's valuable to talk about your problems with love and companionship to someone who is tuned in on you, tuned in on that kind of problem too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah to me I could talk to a wall and get as much back from it as I could talking to another guy on the subject of love. Because I don't fell there's anybody that can...well there are maybe guys that could be better lovers than I am, but to communicate this to me is just a waste of time on their part. 

</p><p>But for a woman to tell me how to be a better lover, I think I could really accept it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your somewhat...I don't know like somehow it'd be...a women would say it in a way that you could hear it and also it would be easier to take from a women somehow. Is that right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well when a guy wants to know how to make better love to his wife, like I say you'd think another women would be the natural authority on what a women expects...what a women wants. 

</p><p>Whereas some guy would say, "Now look you've got to treat them like this." So like I said, I wouldn't pay a bit of attention to them. If a woman was to tell me the same thing I probably would accept it and say, "Well we'll try it and see how it works." [52:30]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because it's like a woman can speak for women.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's kind of like you are blocked off from asking your wife [or woman at work] (ph) or something but like you could find out from another women.

</p><p>PATIENT: I've asked my wife it seems like a lot of times things and I've really not gotten the answer that I wanted or expected or something - I don't know. But we just don't have a complete ability to communicate things to each other because it seems like she's got this partially closed mind to certain ideas that I have.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't want to move in the directions you want to move. (inaudible at 54:04) I don't know. Maybe you can say it better than that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it goes back to like I said; in the beginning of our marriage and how things didn't go the route that I thought they should have and all the reasons why they didn't. And it seems like now that there's a lack of desire to even pick up and try these things on both of our parts because of the fact that past experiences have made things I don't know - stale. It's gotten to the point now where it's a, "what's the use" type of idea you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's been so much bad stuff going on between you that you can't just go back and pick up the loose ends and do - what might have been good to do then. Like it's beyond that point.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe that's why I say; well now I'll talk to somebody else because I feel that they'd start out with an open mind on the subject at least whereas she starts out with a halfway closed or maybe worse. 

</p><p>I get this reception (ph) of a...there's only certain things we can do now because we've tried all this other stuff and it's failed. Seems like to me that there's this, "We can't try that again. We tried it back in 1967 and it didn't work, so forget that."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: With you it seems like she's closed doors that really shouldn't be closed.

</p><p>PATIENT: If she wants things to improve it seems like to me there's going to have to be a complete retrying of anything. [56:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess if her mind is half closed it makes you wonder if she wants to improve things.

</p><p>PATIENT: I almost see it to the extent that she doesn't want to, rather then wonder if she wants to because...ok she doesn't want these things to succeed; she doesn't want things to improve.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: We should be quitting for today.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did that make you sad when you said that?

</p><p>PATIENT: No (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were kind of prepared for it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I keep sitting here wondering if I set up an appointment for Wednesday whether I'll be able to keep it or not. Because it looks like I might be able to try and get that trip to Missouri going this week but I'm not real sure. But well go ahead and set it up and if I have to break it why I will call and let you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How long will you be gone? (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh just a couple days but it might be Wednesday, Thursday - or something like that, so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you get back on Friday you could call me and we could set one up for like Friday afternoon. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why don't we go ahead and set it up for Wednesday...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wednesday...fine.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...on the chance that there be some reason that it will fall through again so. And if something happens I'll call and change it to Friday or something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's good. Yeah. Is 3:00 ok with you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Alright.

</p><p>PATIENT: See you later.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Bye Bye.

</p><p>PATIENT: Bye Bye. [58:21]

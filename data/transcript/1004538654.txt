<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...I don't remember where we left off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were talking about Kyle...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and how he feels about balancing kind of being cool with the guys but also being ready to be done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not really want...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he also, ya know they are all good students, ya know, but he has a 4.0 and he's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and he's totally, ya know, obsessed with doing well in school, so, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's paying a lot for school...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...so these changes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, he parties a lot less than, ya know, the rest of them because he spends most of his time, ya know, either knowing in the morning that he has to get up or, ya know, that night. So, um, he goes back and forth, ya know, about it. Um, and he feels a lot more pressure to like be cool (nervous laugh), ya know, and not...then I don't care if they hate me, ya know (nervous laugh). I have to get up and work in the morning. So, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you got pulled into this group, because they were his...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...buddies to begin with, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you sort of already are...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ya know, the girlfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. So, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a couple more months. [00:01:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They appreciate me when the dishwasher is empty and the floors are mopped and, ya know, um, but I'm sure I get on their nerves just like they get on mine, so (nervous laugh), um, I know. We move end of July, or last week of July, so (pause) and one of my roommates is moving out in May and subletting his room for the summer and (inaudible at 00:02:01)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Subletting till last year when we did that it was awesome. I wish the girl never left anyway (nervous laugh) and, ya know, everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes that can be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, yeah, though I mean we knew her from, um, through him actually. She went to Wellesley and, um, and she was just looking. She had a summer job and was she was going to stay in the city, and she...we've like grown to be friends since...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, well that's nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even after she left. Um, but she's going home for the summer too and I was hoping she would want to sublet again, but so I don't know who he's going to find. I hope it's someone we know a little bit, ya know (nervous laugh), um (pause) so that will be happening soon, cuz I think he's leaving the first week of May when school gets out. Um, and then his girlfriend will probably be leaving too, so (pause) we lose two people, ya know, in one. (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one less person. [00:03:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, (pause) uhh, (pause) I hate living there (nervous laugh), but it's just the way it is (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you always hated it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, no. Not, I mean not in the beginning. Um, I mean it's, ya know my junior year when we moved in uh I was working only maybe 15 hours a week and then I had school but my class load was really easy for that semester for some reason. Um, my first semester of junior year. And so my schedule was a lot lighter. So I could, ya know...I could, ya know, do thing with him, but, um (pause) but now that I work. Last week I worked 55 hours and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh) and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All for the same family because the mom is away or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was away, yeah. So I mean when I say I worked, I slept there, ya know, two nights, but I didn't really count those hours. Um, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do the kids sleep through the night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that is working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, I mean I count...they are usually pretty good but one day it was just like ahh! They were up all night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So absolutely counts...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I get paid for those hours but, um, yeah I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:05:05) I mean, it sounds like you don't sleep through the night anyway...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...there's a difference between being woken up, rolling over and falling right back asleep and being woken up having to take care of a child, get a child back to sleep, you go back to sleep. That's really disruptive and it, ya know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...changes how you feel the next day. Changes your coping resources.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah (nervous laugh). And I'm exhausted. Um (pause) yeah (pause) I'm seeing a light at the end of tunnel though with this (nervous laugh) interview. Yet...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I, I love...I enjoy my job being able to, ya know, spend a beautiful day at the park, ya know, and not at a desk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one of the benefits.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Ya know we go to the museum and you know we go to ballet class and then we go out for lunch, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And those are things that are great, ya know, but ahh! It's just (inaudible at 00:06:10) with a desk job you'd have until...at 5 o'clock you tend to leave...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...your job and then you go home to your personal life. This really meshes together (nervous laugh), ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, ya know I'll have the day off but then she'll call and say can you come over for like 2 hours. I just gotta rest, so (pause) I don't know. I'll be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The boundaries are not quite clear. [00:06:38 ]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there really aren't any (nervous laugh), so, um, so it'll be nice to have hopefully more of a structured...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...schedule. Um, (pause) but I'm sure I'll miss...you know I have had an office job, but I mean I hated this job. I hated everything about this job, so it's...I'm kind of, ya know (nervous laugh), but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, before I started nannying, so it was my...I worked there for two years sophomore and most of the junior year. Um, it was at a law firm and it was the most miserable environment and I used to leave and just cry about how much I hated it, ya know (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was...ahh! It was the worst job. Just the dynamic of the office and the work I was doing. Well, the work I was doing was just...it was all, ya know, scheduling, and ya know very repetitive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing the same thing 400 times a day, ya know, and I was just bored out of my mind, and, um...but I stayed there because, ya know, it was good money and they worked with my school schedule and, and then they had, ya know, layoffs and I felt bad because I, ya know my job was cut but, ya know, and...well my job was cut because they paid me far less than what everyone was paid there. I was only working, ya know, part time. Um, and then one other girl had left and they were short-staffed...and it ended up being 2 years that I was there, ya know? (nervous laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:08:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, ahh! So I just don't want to ever go back to a job, ya know, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like wasn't necessarily the office...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that you hated...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but the environment and it wasn't, it wasn't an engaging desk job...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...not all desk jobs are the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This...I remember just sitting like I had moved my printer across the office because if I didn't I wouldn't have to get out of my chair...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...all day, ya know (nervous laugh), so I called the IT department and had them, ya know, hook my computer up to one that...because I could do...like this is how people gain, ya know, are obese...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...who work because I can...I have a mini fridge. I have, ya know (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you just don't have...I hated that part. So, um, um, so I ended up going from that to being a nanny where you don't sit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At all. [00:09:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...for, yeah. Um, but I mean it makes my days fly by, ya know. So, (pause) um, I don't know. But I'm ready for a change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been studying something different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm excited to...and nervous to actually apply. Ya know (inaudible at 00:10:08) I've learned in school to, ya know real life. But then I feel like how am I going to actually, ya know (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...do that? So like I studied all these things like for an exam. Do I really remember them, ya know? Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet they'll come back to you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...as you need to use them. [00:10:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh) I know. I just wish that it wasn't this Monday and, ya know. (nervous laugh) because I have so many...like I just don't know how...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's more unknowns.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (whispers) Yeah. Ya know they're saying, well I got an e-mail from their scheduler saying leave, ya know, ample time because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know you don't know how long it's going to take, so I, ya know, I wrote back asking, um, ya know, if she could give me any sort of..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because I mean do I leave an hour? Do I leave...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she said, ya know, really leave 45 minutes additional too, which means, though, that I'd have to leave...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have that in your schedule?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'd have to leave before they went down for a nap, so this, ya know, mom would be responsible for both of them going down for a nap which is like sometimes it can be, ya know, fine and then other times it just would be a nightmare. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's a special occasion. [00:11:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably don't ask...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for those types of favors very often. This might be a time to lean on somebody else...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't wait until like 3:30 (nervous laugh) so it's over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be a big relief to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, (pause) I just hope it goes well and I really hope they don't quiz me on Excel or html because, ya know, if I get the job I'll be doing a ton more research and, ya know, all of those and in both of those fields, and I knowledge...I mean I know for html I know the basic, ya know what works, but if they were to ask me to come up with some code, ya know, for...I don't know...without doing any research I don't know if I'd be able to do it, so, um (pause) I don't know. (sighs) (whispers) I just hope it goes well (nervous laugh). (pause) I was talking, ya know, one of the...I was talking to this woman from HR and then just meeting people through Kelly, the, um...they're just so smart, ya know, and they have, like they just...it's not like they just know, ya know, so much, but I mean they're all, ya know, in their 40s and 50s and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, and have been...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...working in for a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...working in it. I just feel like they don't compare, ya know, and I like try...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you compare to a 40-year-old that has been working in the field for 20 years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (nervous laugh)...I don't know, ya know, and that's what I was telling her, ya know. I just feel like I don't, I mean I can't...you guys just know so much about the industry and about PR and it was like no, you haven't even graduated yet (nervous laugh), so I...I'm that I felt I should have done so much more research and I keep saying especially if it was tomorrow, so I would have another night. Because this day wasn't supposed to be this stressful because I was getting out of work today at 6, um, because she, the mom gets home. So it's like 4 hours, like, because I don't have class tonight because of the holiday, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We will be very (inaudible at 00:14:07) six.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. Mm hmm and I was going to get a bottle of wine. I was going to make dinner and then (nervous laugh) that was going to be my night, um...ahh! Nope I can't do that because I have an assignment due tomorrow that I haven't finished yet...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ohh. [00:14:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's important to think about rather than comparing yourself to other people, especially comparing yourself to people that are not...are not your peer group...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and just thinking about what you would bring to the job. Why should they choose you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ohh...I hate interviews (nervous laugh), ya know. I'm trying to focus on, think about it as a conversation, building a relationship, ya know, rather than...you know she said that the interview is not a traditional interview where, ya know, they shoot off the interview...shoot off questions...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know, it's more, ya know, my first...the first part of the interview is, um, an introduction to the company culture. That was what it was called.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, whatever that means, ya know. Um, then she said...then we have a tour around the office, and then I meet with the...I have a like a whole itinerary. I'm going to be there for a couple hours, um...meet with the head of retail and then, um, the operations manager and I think that's it. And these are all like half hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. So it sounds like the beginning part of the day will get you a chance to get acclimated, see what it's like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel how you fit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, yeah...then hopefully by that point I'll be less...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, be a little bit relaxed and can kind of show them who you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (sighs), ya know...everyone gets nervous around interviews so (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. If you weren't a little bit nervous there would be something wrong...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it would mean that you weren't interested and of course you're a little bit nervous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a really good opportunity to practice to see what it's like. This is your first one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (pause) I brought like, you should see my car right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) [00:16:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Full of clothes. It's my entire closet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm (chuckles). You didn't have time to pick...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was (inaudible at 00:16:59) this morning and...good thing I was like productive last weekend and did my ironing because I just went like this and pulled out (inaudible at 00:17:08) the, um so Kelly will be able to, ya know, help me hopefully. Um, but (pause) I mean when I had my phone interview, ya know it went really, really well. The head of HR, at the end of the conversation she goes I think you're our company's dream come true, so (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's really nice feedback.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. But I just...I don't want to...I wish she never said that because then I don't want 'em, ya know, to think that (pause) I don't know. Then if I don't get the job I'll be like well, what did I do, ya know, wrong in the interview process, ya know, so, um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of what made you such a good fit in her mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I talked to her a lot about being able to balance work and school, ya know, and having...always having a full-time job...well, at least almost full time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...through my, ya know, entire...through college and then my work history goes back to when I had a paper route when I was 9 and I haven't stopped working since, so, um, ya know, she kept asking questions about that and the skills I used to maintain both a high GPA and, um...and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a lot of life experience...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...in, ya know, in a lot of aspects, but ya know that a typical, ya know, person coming right out of undergrad doesn't have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I mean just looking at you and your roommates...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ya know, just from a responsibility and maturity standpoint, who would you rather employ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh) (sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You bring a lot maturity, ya know, to your age that a lot of people don't. I think that's, ya know, that's a harder thing to learn...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...than if you're missing something in your background of what you know in Excel or what you know in html.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The skills that you have with being able to relate to people and being able to balance a lot of responsibility...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...in figuring out how to...how to show up on time for things and be where you need to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are skills that are harder to learn. They take more time. They're not as coachable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've developed those already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so, it sounds like you were able to demonstrate that on the phone interview. She picked up on something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah, we had a really, really good conversation. [00:19:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's a good thing to keep in mind when you interview, ya know. I understand not wanting to have your hopes up too much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, carrying some confidence into it from that feedback is, uh, that is a good thing. People respond to confidence. They want you to...they want to know that you feel like you can do a great job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't, ya know...who wants to take a chance on someone who thinks they might be able to do the job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh). That's very true. (sigh) I just can't wait until it's 4 o'clock (nervous laugh) (sigh). I just hate being in a rush (inaudible at 00:20:36)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know rushing all day, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And try to breathe slow even as you rush...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...so that you can fool your body into thinking that you're relaxed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laugh). What time is it over? Do you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whenever that last person...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Finishes. It's like ahh!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean the bulk of people are done in a few hours but there are those people that, ya know, are not professionals that are doing it, although I would imagine...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ya know, that, ya know the the bulk of people are done the street crossings and things like may get easier, but that's probably not until later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially cuz you're gonna try to go earlier than 2.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And plan for it to be busy. But you did your homework, I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you checked street crossings and you checked train stops and those are the things that end up taking extra time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya know I remember one day, ya know, having to get off the train than getting off and then trying to walk. Ya know it wouldn't have been a bad walk. It's not that far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you couldn't cross over (inaudible at 00:21:51).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, so (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I had to walk (chuckles)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but you were a lot smarter than I was and you thought about (chuckles) um that if you can get to symphony...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (whispers) I know. (pause) I mean I usually get to interviews like 40 minutes early anyway and then just, ya know, sit at a coffee shop, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's what you'll do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you'll see a little bit of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can go watch it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh). What time is it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we have a couple more minutes, but if you're ready to...if you feel like you're ready to move on you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (deep breathe)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go do some deep breathing on your way out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, maybe I should because what I haven't researched is getting from here to Lily's house which I'm hoping is...they're right in, in downtown and I hope nothing is closed because (sigh)...it's gonna be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckles). Are you going to do the train?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I drive to L...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I'm just gonna park down the street and then go get her and then I'll just leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'll let you go starting your day. (inaudible at 00:23:17) that, see if it will work and, um, I wish you good luck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll be sending good vibes your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm certain you'll do really good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Keep our fingers crossed. Bye.</p>

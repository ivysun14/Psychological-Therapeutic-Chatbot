<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>Bugental 1: Gina, I find it best when starting something like this to make a transition.</p>

<p>Gina 1: Okay.</p>

<p>Bugental 2: And what I am going to do and encourage you to try is just to breath inside and, and get quiet inside.</p>

<p>Gina 2: Okay.</p>

<p>Bugental 3: So we start from a level playing ground or whatever that means.</p>

<p>Gina 3: Okay. Neutrality, okay. All right. (Pause)</p>

<p>Bugental 4: How'd it go? Could you do it?</p>

<p>Gina 4: No. It's weird.</p>

<p>Bugental 5: It's hard, isn't it. Yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 5: It's, someone had asked me "What do you do during your quiet time?" I'm like, what time? [Bugental: Mhm] Quiet time? What is that? I don't have quiet time. I mean my quiet time is usually after the kids go to bed, and then I'm grading papers or cleaning house, or doing something else. It's still not quiet. [Bugental: Still not quiet time] There is no noise from other people, but, [Bugental: Inside it's fairly noisy] Yeah. The only time that's real quiet time is when I actually go to sleep. Yeah, I think that's it. Although I like times when it is quiet. [Bugental: Mhm] You know, [Bugental: Mhm] and I do know those times. Like "Ooo, you know, I didn't do anything." You know, it's kind of quiet and I, I need to have more of those I think. [Bugental: Mhm] I need time like that.</p>

<p>Bugental 6: I think they're important.</p>

<p>Gina 6 : Yeah, yeah. They are.</p>

<p>Bugental 7: Try this.</p>

<p>Gina 7: Okay.</p>

<p>Bugental 8: Just go into your center and don't try to be quiet. Just see what's, what's going on there. What's spontaneously going on in you.</p>

<p>Gina 8: Okay. (laughter) [Bugental: Mm] A lot. There is a lot.</p>

<p>Bugental 9: A lot. (Kind of a wry laugh.)</p>

<p>Gina 9: Yeah, yeah. Because it's like, oh, how could I not, there's a lot of things going on, you know. [Bugental: Mhm] Yeah. Inside, probably outside. [Bugental: Mhm] Yeah, a lot of things on my mind. A lot.</p>

<p>Bugental 10: Does it have a common denominator, a theme, a music?</p>

<p>Gina 10: Um, yeah. Pretty much survival.</p>

<p>Bugental 11: Survival? Say more.</p>

<p>Gina 11: Mhm. [Bugental: Uh huh] Yeah. Being able to, to be productive in the world. [Bugental: Mhm] To be successful [Bugental: Mhm] with as few failures as possible. [Bugental: Mhm] I don't, no, I really don't like that.</p>

<p>Bugental 12: These sound like instructions. Like survive, be productive, don't fail. [Gina: Yeah] Is it that kind of . . . <BR>Gina 12: Yeah, it's, um, it's instructions, but it's, I want to say it's natural, but not really, um. It's just something that I've been trying to do pretty much all my life, I guess. [Bugental: Mhm] Um, even when I was a kid. When I think about it, trying to succeed [Bugental: Mhm] even if it was playing double Dutch or if it's my grades or if it's doing the best cleaning up job in the house to please my mom and dad, [Bugental: Mhm, Mhm] I always wanted to be on top. [Bugental: Mm] And nobody said I had to be on top.</p>

<p>Bugental 13: Mhm, mhm. Except inside.</p>

<p>Gina 13: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 14: Inside it said you had to.</p>

<p>Gina 14: Yeah. Inside said I got to be perfect. And it's something I'm just, I realized 'cause I have a girlfriend who, I told her my oldest son had to get glasses. He's had them about maybe three weeks now. And the minute I heard he had to wear glasses I felt like I failed. [Bugental: Ahh] And I know it had nothing to do with me, [Bugental: Ahh, yeah] but it was one of those like I sort of didn't do something I was supposed to do [Bugental: Mhm] to help him out in this world. And I told my girlfriend that and she says "Are you serious?" I said uh huh. I was serious that it did feel like I did something wrong, [Bugental: Mhm] I didn't do what I was supposed to do.</p>

<p>Bugental 15: Boy, really.</p>

<p>Gina 15: And she was like, I never knew that about you. Now we've been pretty close now for maybe five years so, it's still a new friendship. We're still learning about each other and things, but she was quite surprised to hear.</p>

<p>Bugental 16: Mhm. What strikes me is how ready you were to point the finger at <BR>yourself and find fault with you.</p>

<p>Gina 16: Yeah, I do that.</p>

<p>Bugental 17: You do that.</p>

<p>Gina 17: Mhm.</p>

<p>Bugental 18: Otherwise too?</p>

<p>Gina 18: Yeah, I, I do. I mean, I try to find good in me, too. Don't get me wrong. [Bugental: Mhm, mhm] But yeah, I kind of, I want to find a mistake before somebody else [Bugental: Ahh] does so that I can sort of take care of them, at least get ready, [Bugental: Uh huh huh] so I'm prepared for when somebody notices them.</p>

<p>Bugental 19: Mhm. That's funny. That brought a little laugh twice. Did you hear it?</p>

<p>Gina 19: A little bit, maybe, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 20: What's that?</p>

<p>Gina 20: 'Cause I know it's stupid for me to feel this way.</p>

<p>Bugental 21: Oh, see, now there you found fault with, you called yourself stupid.</p>

<p>Gina 21: Yeah, yeah, I did. I know that to be perfect is impossible. [Bugental: Yeah] That humans aren't supposed to be perfect. That's the science and logic behind me and, but I can't help but want to be perfect even though I know that it's not normal. I mean, you're supposed to make mistakes. How else do you learn if you don't make mistakes. But I just don't want to make any mistakes. [Bugental: Mhm] And especially I don't want mistakes for my kids. I don't want them to make any mistakes. I want to try to cushion every corner I can to make sure they don't run into problems, [Bugental: Mhm] and I think my mom kind of wanted to do the same thing for me too, [Bugental: Mhm] but yet I fought it. [Bugental: Mhm] Typical, you know. Don't do this. I'm going to do this anyway. Just to see, you know, the testing and all of that. But she was kind of protective, I guess. [Bugental: Mhm] And I'm protective too.</p>

<p>Bugental 22: Kind of protective I guess. How come "I guess?"</p>

<p>Gina 22: Yeah, well I was able to do some things, but I guess not a lot of things.</p>

<p>Bugental 23: There's another guess. Do you have to guess about Gina?</p>

<p>Gina 23: Yeah, now I do. Especially because so many things are . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 24: You just kind of bit your lip when you thought about that. What's that about?</p>

<p>Gina 24: (laughter) Mm, I don't know. Just, just something I guess I do. I poke my lip out . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 25: See, did you hear the guess there? Something I guess I do.</p>

<p>Gina 25: Something I guess I do. That's my, probably that's a word I use to cover myself.</p>

<p>Bugental 26: That's a probably. That's like a guess. [Gina: Mhm] You know we use those things sometimes so we don't get caught just standing firmly in some way. [Gina: Mhm] Does that feel right?</p>

<p>Gina 26: Mhm. Yeah, it does, yeah. It goes back to I have to be ready for anything that comes up. [Bugental: Mmm] So I'm covering myself so if I can say I guess, that sort of gives me the chance of saying yup or maybe no.</p>

<p>Bugental 27: Maybe not.</p>

<p>Gina 27: Yeah, mhm. So that I do. And it has to do with whether I agree with like when I was being raised by my mom, being protective and things like that. In a way I agree with some of the things that she did, and in a way I don't agree. [Bugental: Yeah] So that's why that word guess comes in, because it's giving her some flexibility. Yeah, she did okay, but she wasn't perfect,although she never tried to be perfect. [Bugental: Mhm] She said that.</p>

<p>Bugental 28: You're the one who tries to be perfect.</p>

<p>Gina 28: Yup. Yeah, I do, I know.</p>

<p>Bugental 29: Mhm. What happened that time?</p>

<p>Gina 29: Cause I know I shouldn't, that it's okay to be who I am, that there's nothing wrong with who I am, and it's okay to make mistakes. [Bugental: Mhm] I tell my two boys that all the time. It's all right to make a mistake, but yet, it's hard to swallow that myself.</p>

<p>Bugental 30: Mhm. You don't give yourself the permission you give them.</p>

<p>Gina 31: Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't. [Bugental: Mhm] But yet when I do make a mistake . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 32: What do you think about that? What do you think about Gina?</p>

<p>Gina 32: Probably it causes more . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 33: No, that's probably. See that's like a guess.</p>

<p>Gina 33: (laughter) Yeah.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bugental 34: Let's think, you're better, you give your boys more freedom to make mistakes than you give Gina. [Gina: Mhm] Sort of chew that one for a minute and see what comes.</p>

<p>Gina 34: I'm responsible for them, that's why I can't make mistakes. They're still learning.</p>

<p>Bugental 35: No laugh this time.</p>

<p>Gina 35: No, no, no laugh this time, 'cause I take the raising of them very seriously.</p>

<p>Bugental 36: Very serious.</p>

<p>Gina 36: Yeah, 'cause I brought them into this world. And I always said growing up that if I'm going to bring children into the world, I'm the one that's supposed to be responsible. Nobody else, me, you know. And so I do take it very seriously. [Bugental: Mhm] Sometimes I don't even enjoy being a mom, 'cause I take it so seriously, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 37: Ahh, it spoils some of the good times.</p>

<p>Gina 37: Yeah. Some of the fun that we should have we don't have probably.</p>

<p>Bugental 38:For example. . .</p>

<p>Gina 38: Oh like I'll go home from work, [Bugental: Mhm] and I've been away from them all day, and I miss them, but instead of me just being kind of jovial like, hey guys, how are you doing, da da, da da, I sort of jump into the, okay, did you put your book bag away, did you put coat away? Did you start your homework? Did you do. . . [Bugental: Ahh] And, and that is part of me. Organized, have everything in place. Because if it is then they have less problems in their life.</p>

<p>Bugental 39: True.</p>

<p>Gina 39: They don't wake up in the morning wondering where's my book bag or where's my coat or where's this. So that keeps them sort of organized, but it does create a situation where it's like dang, I wish we'd just sort of not worry about it for a while. [Bugental: Mhm] You know, so I've tried sometimes to not do that. I call it nagging, 'cause it falls into that category, you know, but. . .</p>

<p>Bugental 40: But how's it going?</p>

<p>Gina 40: Mm. There are days when it's good and days when it's bad. I'm beginning to recognize it though now. When I feel tension I realize okay, wait, whoa, stop for a minute. Let's just chill for a while, and then I think okay, you didn't come in and do this, this and this. [Bugental: Mhm] You came in and did this and this. And then I have to think about what happened with them. And then sometimes I, the general statement is, well, how did school go? Oh fine. But that's the typical response that they are going to give me. But later on in the evening, I'll hear about something that happened at recess, or something else. [Bugental: Mhm] But see if I don't hear that at first, then I jump into my thing that I've got. I have my agenda, and they might not be quite there because they are still dealing with what happened at school, [Bugental: Yes] and so that I have to, I'm catching myself more on now, you know and . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 41: Well, one thing I can see is you don't stop on Gina. You're teaching her new things and keeping on top of her.</p>

<p>Gina 41: Yeah, yeah, um.</p>

<p>Bugental 42: Kind of a look when you hear that.</p>

<p>Gina 42: I'm changing. I'm growing. I'm, I'm definitely not stagnant.</p>

<p>Bugental 43: You're not stagnant.</p>

<p>Gina 43: No, I was a while ago.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bugental 44: Were you? Oh.</p>

<p>Gina 44: Yeah, mhm. For about a couple of years I was pretty much stuck in the same spot. [Bugental: Mhm] But I'm not going to be there for much longer. Well, actually I'm out of it. Well, not that I'm out of it, I'm working my way out of it, cause it is going to be ongoing.</p>

<p>Bugental 45: Say more. It sounds like something important is going on in you.</p>

<p>Gina 45: Yeah, yeah. I'm getting a divorce so (laughter) that is pretty, pretty important.</p>

<p>Bugental 46: Yeah, it is, yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 46: Yeah. I'll be taking care of the boys. I'll be the custodian for the boys, so there's a lot on my mind and, as I said, there's a lot, there's a lot going on. Quiet time is like . . . no quiet time. Although I'm trying to find times where it's quiet, you know, and it's working out pretty good, you know. But, as it gets closer to that time where it's about to end. It's shaky. It's, it's a lot going on, you know, in my mind, and . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 47: You're shaky?</p>

<p>Gina 47: Yeah, I'm shaky, [Bugental: Mhm] meaning that I have some doubts now that maybe I didn't have before. I have some concerns that I didn't have before, as you get closer to that point where everything is like over. You wonder, did I do the right thing? Am I doing the right thing? All along I was thinking that, but as it gets to the end, there goes that what if I'm making a mistake. [Bugental: Uh huh] Or what if I'm not doing the right thing. That goes back to being perfect again.</p>

<p>Bugental 48: Yes it sure does.</p>

<p>Gina 48: And it's something I've been thinking about for a couple of weeks now. [Bugental: Mhm] Especially after my son getting the glasses, I thought about how I felt, but it was like, hm, this is, you know . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 49: That showed you how judgmental you are.</p>

<p>Gina 49: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 50: About yourself, yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 50: Yeah, yeah. I am. Although, I like myself. [Bugental; Mhm] I do. [Bugental: Mhm] Um, I don't know, I don't know. I still don't know why I had to be so perfect. I don't know. It's just, I try to pinpoint when did it start, and I don't know when. It just sort of, you know, started happening.</p>

<p>Bugental 51: That's a hard question to answer, yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 51: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 52: What is it, are you most apt to be judgmental, under what conditions?</p>

<p>Gina 52: Hmm. Probably in terms of raising my boys to make sure I'm doing the very best that I can. [Bugental: Mhm] As far as making the right decisions and giving them the right opportunities or consequences, and things like that. Um. I wonder. [Bugental: Mhm] Especially being a female raising two boys. [Bugental: Mhm] There I tend to be a little more judgmental. [Bugental: Mhm] Probably with relationships with men I am going to be very judgmental. [Bugental: Mhm] Um, that's going to be interesting.</p>

<p>Bugental 53: Your mouth, what, when you said relations, what goes on when you do that?</p>

<p>Gina 53: (laughter) I poked my lip out when I did that. Well, I don't want to make the same mistakes I made the first time around. That's the first thing with me, yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>Bugental 54: I heard it.</p>

<p>Gina 54: Goes back to being perfect again. Not perfect, but just making sure that I go about it the right way this time and that I don't go into it thinking certain things are going to happen and they're not. I don't want to go into another relationship thinking I am going to change that person because that's what I thought at first. [Bugental: Mhm] And you can't really do that. [Bugental: Mm] I'm stuck on how much I want them to take care of me. [Bugental: Mhm] See I grew up with my dad taking care of us. [Bugental: Mhm] My mom stayed home for most of the time, but then she started to work. But dad was the major breadwinner and mom was the one that we came home and she was there cooking meals and things like that. [Bugental: Mhm] And even when she started working, she became a teacher, so she had the same hours that we did. [Bugental: Mhm] But I grew up with dad was the one, the male was the one, who was supposed to take care of everything. [Bugental :Mhm] And in my marriage that has not been the case at all. [Bugental: Mhm] So, it's totally different. [Bugental: Big grin] Well, I can accept that now. I fought it for a while, and I didn't like it for a long time.</p>

<p>Bugental 55: Past tense?</p>

<p>Gina 55 : Yeah. 'Cause in a way for me not to like it is going against me of taking charge and being responsible and doing things and not waiting for somebody else to do it. [Bugental: Mhm] So, I don't know if I want someone to quote-unquote take care of me in a relationship. [Bugental: Mhm] I'm at a point now where I don't need anybody to take care of me. I can do this myself.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bugental 56: You're kind of mocking yourself right now, quote-unquote take care of me. What's, what's, how come?</p>

<p>Gina 56: Anger still probably from the relationship.</p>

<p>Bugental 57: Ahh, that's a probably, ahh, okay.</p>

<p>Gina 57: No that's definite. No, I am still angry that a lot of responsibilities fell on me when it shouldn't have. When it should have been more of a partnership. [Bugental: Mhm] So, yeah. There's no problem. Definite about that. So . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 58: Yeah, you sound very different now.</p>

<p>Gina 58: Yeah, a little. Yeah, different things play back in my mind. The time when I have to take charge and when I didn't, you know. It's few, you know, but at the same time where I say that, I have to look at how I am as a person. [Bugental: Mhm] And, again, it's not, it takes two people to make a relationship, [Bugental: Mhm] and as much as you come together, it takes two to make it fall apart. I even think that part of the reason that we are not going to be together anymore is because of me and the way that I am, the fact that I do take charge and do things and sort of like to fix stuff. I like to solve problems for other people. Why? I don't know.It's just sort of my nature. But, it's like there will be a problem and I just automatically start fixing it. It's not my problem, you know, it belongs to somebody else, [Bugental: Yeah] but, in this relationship, in the marriage, I thought, oh, well I'm supposed to do this, and do this and do this. And then it became well you're going to do it so why do I have to do it. And then I, sort of like I dug myself a hole because I started doing that. Then my husband thought well, I don't have to do that thing, you've got to do it. And then that goes back until you feel taken for granted, don't feel appreciated, but yet you're the one that did it. You're the one that started jumping up and doing this, this, and this and this.</p>

<p>Bugental 59: Was that a hard thing to learn?</p>

<p>Gina 59: Yeah. To admit that I might have. . .</p>

<p>Bugental 60: 'Cause the way you mocked again, every once in a . . . you mock yourself about something that isn't really very funny.</p>

<p>Gina 60: I never noticed that, I never noticed that. [Bugental: Mhm] But, yeah, I guess, yeah, I do.</p>

<p>Bugental 61: Mhm. My hunch is that there must be a lot of hurt under there someplace. The mocking keeps the hurt down. Does that seem right?</p>

<p>Gina 61: (tears) Yeah, yeah. Probably, because if you find humor in it, it tends to lessen it a bit. If you can find the joke behind it or the . . . I'm glad that's there (Kleenex).</p>

<p>Bugental 62: It's all right.</p>

<p>Gina 62: Yeah. It's much easier to laugh about things than to cry about them. But. . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bugental 63: Mhm. But sometimes if we laugh about instead of cry, we don't deal with the real issue.</p>

<p>Gina 63: Yeah. And I do that sometimes.</p>

<p>Bugental 64: Yeah. You're doing your work, yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 64: Yeah. I haven't done this in a while. (Tears) Been too busy doing things. Probably I haven't because I make sure that I don't for the boys. [Bugental: Mhm] Because I know it's a change for them, and if I was strong, then they'll be able to get through it with as little pain as possible. 'Cause that's probably the only regret I have with it. If it was just me and him, snap. I really wouldn't think about it too much. But with kids it's . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 65: It's another thing.</p>

<p>Gina 65: Yeah, it is, it is, you know. But I feel strong enough about what I'm doing that I am going to still do it. Because I tried the other way too where, oh, for the kids, don't get divorced. And that's not good either.</p>

<p>Bugental 66: That didn't work.</p>

<p>Gina 66: No, that's not good either, because you still stop being a person. [Bugental: Mhm] You still stop being who you are, and then you're no good for the kids. You're no good for yourself first of all and then you're no good for them. [Bugental: Mhm] So, you know, as it's getting closer to the point where the divorce will be final, yeah, a lot of things are going on in my head. [Bugental :Mhm] And I don't think I want quiet time 'cause this will happen.</p>

<p>Bugental 67: Uh huh. But sometimes that cleans the slate, you know. You'd be more <BR>real with yourself.</p>

<p>Gina 67: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 68: 'Cause it's kind of fooling yourself if you laugh instead of letting you know your pain.</p>

<p>Gina 68: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. [Bugental: Mhm] Because when you do you have to accept everything, your faults, your good things. [Bugental: Mhm] You may have to work with things that you, you know you try to avoid some things and you realize, man, there is no way I can avoid it.</p>

<p>Bugental 69: Yeah, they don't go away.</p>

<p>Gina 69: No, they don't, no they don't. You're going to have to deal with it to the best of your ability, so . . . I have real good support, I have real good support with my friends and with my family. [Bugental: Mhm] So, they've helped me go through it.</p>

<p>Bugental 70: Good enough.</p>

<p>Gina 70: Yeah, it helps, yeah, it helps. But I do beat myself up. I know I do.</p>

<p>Bugental 71: Yeah, I was just going to say, they don't beat you up, you do.</p>

<p>Gina 71: No, they don't. You know, when I think about it, I mean, they tease me about stuff, but basically, no. They pretty much have sat back and let me try to figure everything out on my own. But they've always reassured me that they're there, you know, and I'm the one that's pretty much done that. I'm the one that beats myself up. I'm more critical of myself probably than they are, you know.</p>

<p>Bugental 72: Now you say that, and it sounds right, but how do you feel about that fact? Does it matter?</p>

<p>Gina 72: That I'm critical of myself?</p>

<p>Bugental 73: Mhm. More than other people.</p>

<p>Gina 73: I shouldn't be, more so than other people.</p>

<p>Bugental 74: Does it matter? You didn't answer that question.</p>

<p>Gina 74: Well, probably, no it shouldn't matter.</p>

<p>Bugental 75: Why all the (facial gestures)?</p>

<p>Gina 75: I don't know because I'm not sure, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Bugental 76: Yeah, I think that's an important question. Yeah, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Gina 76: I think we should self analyze, you know, figure things out.</p>

<p>Bugental 77: You bet.</p>

<p>Gina 77: We should admit our mistakes. That we should do because if you don't, they are going to keep coming back, and you're never going to grow.</p>

<p>Bugental 78: You betcha.</p>

<p>Gina 78: So that in one way I do believe that you should be critical of yourself. But it shouldn't be distractive. [Bugental: Mhm] It shouldn't get you into depression and you shouldn't lose your self esteem over it. You shouldn't stop functioning because of it.</p>

<p>Bugental 79: Now I'm going to play mean [Gina: Okay] and point out you suddenly switched to the second person. You're saying "you" shouldn't.</p>

<p>Gina 79: Okay, meaning that . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bugental 80: What about Gina, first person.</p>

<p>Gina 80: First person. I . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 81: Ahh, the faces come back. [Gina: (laughter)] Did you see it?</p>

<p>Gina 81: Yeah. I thought, uh oh, making faces again. Um, I could say with me, yeah, that I shouldn't be so critical of myself.</p>

<p>Bugental 82: What can you do about it?</p>

<p>Gina 82: I should totally accept who I am.</p>

<p>Bugental 83: Can you?</p>

<p>Gina 83: Most of the time, yeah, I think I can.</p>

<p>Bugental 84: Yeah, this brings a grin.</p>

<p>Gina 84: But I know I have my ways that sometimes aren't the nicest or sometimes I can be stubborn and don't want to give in.</p>

<p>Bugental 85: Mhm. But you are making beating yourself up and finding fault or finding things that you wish were different the same thing. I don't know whether they are or not. Do you think they are?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Gina 85: That if my faults are . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 86: If you do something, if you are stubborn. Let's take that.</p>

<p>Gina 86: That's not a bad trait. [Bugental: Mhm] I don't think that's a bad trait.</p>

<p>Bugental 87: Okay.</p>

<p>Gina 87: I think it's a good trait.</p>

<p>Bugental 88: Now you're not beating yourself up.</p>

<p>Gina 88: Right. Yeah. [Bugental: Yeah] I see what you did. You switched it. Yeah. It's a good trait to have. I like being stubborn. [Bugental: Mhm] I do. [Bugental: Mhm] But I'm also flexible. [Bugental: Mm] I have to be because of my kids.</p>

<p>Bugental 89: They teach you.</p>

<p>Gina 89: Yeah they do, they do. And then not even just the kids, though, but I even like to be flexible. Me. I do. Because then it then allows me some leeway, here or there. [Bugental: Mhm] So maybe it goes back so I don't make a mistake [Bugental: Mhm] or so I can end up figuring things out and still being, like in control of things. [Bugental: Mhm] So, yes, so no, it's, I shouldn't beat myself up about it. You're right, I really shouldn't. It's actually sort of a good quality, you know, yeah, um . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 90: Yeah. You look reflective now. Just stay with that and find out where it takes you.</p>

<p>Gina 90: Okay, um. Being stubborn eventually people will see it my way. They will go the way that I want to go so that I end up still in charge. Um, but the first thing I am thinking now is what if I make a mistake. See, that thought came in.</p>

<p>Bugental 91: I know.</p>

<p>Gina 91: That thought came in. [Bugental: Good, yeah] Just as I got done saying I'm in charge, but what if I mess up. That is always there.</p>

<p>Bugental 92: Always there.</p>

<p>Gina 92: Yeah. That fear of making a mistake [Bugental: Yeah] or you know. I don't know. I've made mistakes. [Bugental: You] A lot. [Bugental: Mmm] And I've come out okay from them. [Bugental: Mmm] I mean, there's some I wish I didn't do, [Bugental: Yeah] but I'm still here and still doing things. So why does it matter? I don't know why it matters so much.</p>

<p>Bugental 93: You're doing your work. Just stay in there. What if you make a mistake?</p>

<p>Gina 93: Well, if I make a mistake it could mean I end up paying for it meaning that more time has to be put into something, and right now it's like I'm already going five different directions, but I think I kind of like that. [Bugental: Ahh] My personality. I think I like a lot of things going on at once. [Bugental: Ah huh] If I make a mistake, it costs me time, it costs maybe money, and that's a concern to me. Sure, I have enough money to take care of everything, um, if I make a mistake it means I'm human.</p>

<p>Bugental 94: Oh, you grit your teeth when you say that. (laughter)</p>

<p>Gina 94: I like being human, I do. But I want to be on the upper end of that.</p>

<p>Bugental 95: I see, okay.</p>

<p>Gina 95: I want to be on the upper end of that. Um, making a mistake means that maybe somebody else was right [Bugental: Mhm] and you weren't and [Bugental: Ooo] being able to say okay, you were right. It's kind of hard.</p>

<p>Bugental 96: Now that has a little tag on it, doesn't it. I could see you sort of (gesture).</p>

<p>Gina 96: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 97: See, just explore that feeling a little bit.</p>

<p>Gina 97: Well, I always have to be right or letting someone else be right [Bugental: Mhm] um, gives up some of my control [Bugental: Mm] of a situation. [Bugental: Mhm] It means that maybe I'm not the one that's responsible. [Bugental: Mhm] Maybe it means I get some freedom [Bugental: Mm], which I actually do want sometimes.</p>

<p>Bugental 98: Sometimes.</p>

<p>Gina 98: Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of nice when I do it. [Bugental: Yeah] When I admit okay you were right and I was wrong. But it, it staggers out, it doesn't come out real smooth. [Bugental: Yeah] It doesn't come out with a smile. It's like okay, all right, all right. But it is getting better. [Bugental: Mhm] But, it is, it's kind of tough.</p>

<p>Bugental 99: Yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 99: It's kind of tough, but I make a mistake, hm, life goes on. It doesn't stop.</p>

<p>Bugental 100: Nope.</p>

<p>Gina 100: It might mean things get prolonged a bit or [Bugental: Mhm] I have to think a little bit more about something, [Bugental: Mhm] but I'm not going to give up. That's something I don't do.</p>

<p>Bugental 101: Yeah, you don't do that.</p>

<p>Gina 101: No. Mm, I complain maybe in the process of facing that mistake, but I've never given up on something.</p>

<p>Bugental 102: When you say that you're quite sure.</p>

<p>Gina 102: Yeah, [Bugental: Yeah] yeah. I figure things where I know it was tough [Bugental: Mhm] but I kept going, then I could put my head up when it was done. [Bugental: Mhm] It feels good, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 103: So there's that side of Gina too. <BR>Gina 103: Oh yeah. [Bugental: Yeah] Yeah. I like success. [Bugental: Mhm] I do. I like working hard and getting that success. I do. [Bugental: Mhm] I like it. I mean I live for those days sometimes.</p>

<p>Bugental 104: That's it.</p>

<p>Gina 104: Yeah. I do. Um, I see it in my oldest, too. I'm very competitive. [Bugental: Uh huh] Um, that drives my girlfriend crazy. Well, it doesn't drive her crazy but we're so different. She is not competitive at all, and I am. But I think that comes from my family. With four brothers and sisters and always competing to get your point across and say what you want to say. We're all headstrong. [Bugental: Yeah] It comes a lot from that. [Bugental: Uh huh] When I am competitive, I push myself [Bugental: Mhm] to work the very hardest that I can and then I do exactly what I want to do. [ Bugental: Mhm] I see the end result, [Bugental: I see] and I like it.</p>

<p>Bugental 105: When you talk about being competitive, there's a, a little spark comes into you.</p>

<p>Gina 105: Yeah. 'Cause I'm good when I'm competitive. I mean there are things I'm really good at, and I know it's all because I worked at it. [Bugental: Mhm] And I like that. [Bugental: Mhm] I just started playing tennis again. [Bugental: Uh huh] I played for years and then I had kids. And then, naturally, you stop because you have to stay with them, you don't have money, and then I kind of lost interest in it, I think. And I started back Thanksgiving. And I'm good. I'm good now. I like it. [Bugental: Ahh] I feel comfortable with it. I'm better now than I was 12 years ago, [Bugental: Ahh] but I'm working at it. And I know exactly what I want to do with it. [Bugental: Mhm] And it's got a certain spot in my life, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 106: There's that sureness.</p>

<p>Gina 106: I know exactly what I want from [Bugental: Mhm] tennis in my life. Whereas, before I didn't. I think that's why I kind of, I think I kind of backed out of it because of that. [Bugental: Mhm] Um, but now, you know, I know exactly what I want.</p>

<p>Bugental 107: Mhm. I'm reflecting that you called yourself stubborn. But normally it's having an idea of what you want to do and going for it and staying through it. [Gina Yeah] It isn't just stubborn, it's . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Gina 107: No, it's determination.</p>

<p>Bugental 108: Determination, yeah.</p>

<p>Gina 108: I know what I want to do. [Bugental: Mhm] It's like I knew I wanted to do certain things in my life.</p>

<p>Bugental 109: Mhm. Like what?</p>

<p>Gina 109: I wanted to get married. [Bugental: Mhm] That's a big joke, now I'm getting divorced, but that's okay. That's all right. I did it, [Bugental: You did it] that was okay. I wanted to have kids. I wanted to have a job that I liked going to at least three days out of five. [Bugental: Mhm] I wanted to make enough money to be comfortable. Um, I wanted to be healthy enough to be able to do anything. Like if you say, let's go climb a mountain tomorrow, I want to be healthy enough to make it a third of the way up. Not all the way, [Bugental: Okay] because I know you can't, don't do that, but healthy enough to do, to not have any limitations. With anything that you want to do. [Bugental: Uh huh] And I've pretty much have done those things.</p>

<p>Bugental 110: Sounds like you checked them off.</p>

<p>Gina 110: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 111: What's ahead? What do you want to do now?</p>

<p>Gina 111: Oh man. Now you know . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 112: Oh man, huh?</p>

<p>Gina 112: I haven't made that list yet. I haven't, um . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 113: See what's percolating in there.</p>

<p>Gina 113: Yeah. What do I want to do now? Um, hm, okay, mom is the first thing that comes into my head. I want to have, well, I want to be a better mom, okay. That's the goal. [Bugental: Mhm] Especially since . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 114: We've come back to that theme a couple times.</p>

<p>Gina 114: Okay, I want to be a better mom. [Bugental: Okay] Um, I want to continue being close to my family, spending time with them, and doing things with them.</p>

<p>Bugental 115: Who's your family?</p>

<p>Gina 115: My mom, my dad, my sister and two brothers, a niece. Yeah. Those are my immediate family.</p>

<p>Bugental 116: I got you.</p>

<p>Gina 116: Yeah. Um, I want to continue to give in my friendship with my girlfriend, actually with a couple of my girlfriends. [Bugental: Mhm] I want to do more for them, because they've done a lot for me. [Bugental: Ah huh] And I want to sort of be there for them. [Bugental: Yeah] So that means I got to get other things of my life straight so that when they need me I can go right there and be okay for them. [Bugental: Mhm] Um. There is a possibility that I might go on to get my Ph.D., but I don't know. [Bugental: Mhm] I don't know about that. But that's sort of there. My mom probably wants me to do it more than I want to do it. [Bugental: Ahh] And I don't know, I might.</p>

<p>Bugental 117: What happened, you just (gesture).</p>

<p>Gina 117: I was thinking well, my job is okay. I'm a pretty good teacher. I could probably get better at that year by year. Um, I thought about a relationship. Like getting involved with a man again is like, well, I don't want to make the same mistake I did before, um...</p>

<p>Bugental 118: Sort of grope?</p>

<p>Gina 118: Yeah. Probably a goal with that would be to communicate better. [Bugental: Mhm] Definitely communicate better in a relationship. [Bugental: Mhm] To talk openly about how I feel. Not to hold back, not worry about saying something, they're not going to like or say something they disagree with.</p>

<p>Bugental 119: Mhm. Can you do that?</p>

<p>Gina 119: Yes. I can.</p>

<p>Bugental 120: Mhm. You, you paused a minute to really consider. [Gina: Mhm] Can you say anything about what happened in that minute when you were considering?What did you, what went through . . .</p>

<p>Gina 120: Well, I thought, I've accomplished other things in my life. I should be able to do this. [Bugental: Mhm] That's . . . it's not something that's impossible, [Bugental: Mhm] so that the hesitation was I should be able to do this. I know I've done it in the past. It still involves another person and how they're going to respond. So that's why it's like well, I could do it, but I don't know if the other person can. [Bugental: Mhm] And that goes into you can only contribute so much to a relationship. You can only give yourself. [Bugental: Mhm] You can't really expect the other person, you can't change the other person. You've got to go into it accepting the person as they are, [Bugental: Mhm] and hopefully, you will be able to work that out. [Bugental: Mmm] But communication is definitely something that I have to do. I have to be selfish. That's a goal. That's the goal. Now that's a big one.</p>

<p>Bugental 121: That is.</p>

<p>Gina 121: That's probably more so than all of them.</p>

<p>Bugental 122: Say more about what that means.</p>

<p>Gina 122: I need to put myself first. [Bugental: Mhm] I need to put myself first even before my kids. [Bugental: Mmm] Because there were times when I didn't. And I lost myself a little bit when I did that. Um, being selfish does not mean I can't be a good mother.</p>

<p>Bugental 123: No.</p>

<p>Gina 123: Or a good friend, [Bugental: Mhm] or a good family member. [Bugental: Mhm] I thought it was though. [Bugental: Mmm] Which is why I wasn't selfish. Which is why I gave and gave and allowed things to happen. [Bugental: Mhm] Then I woke up and said I do this.</p>

<p>Bugental 124: What would be an example, where that happened?</p>

<p>Gina 124: Oh, well, okay, if say, like my girlfriend and I go out, [Bugental: All right] and I always pay. Sometimes I can say no, I don't want to pay. [Bugental: Mhm] I couldn't do that before. I could do it now. I could do it now.</p>

<p>Bugental 125: What's different?</p>

<p>Gina 125: Well, first thing, I got to watch my money now because I have to take care of the two boys without my husband. [Bugental: Mhm] So that is the driving force.[Bugental: Okay] But also it, I can do it because I know that I have a right to say that. [Bugental: Mhm] That it's okay for me.</p>

<p>Bugental 126: Didn't you know that before?</p>

<p>Gina 126: Way back here. [Bugental: Mhm] It wasn't up front. [Bugental: Mhm] No.</p>

<p>Bugental 127: What was up front?</p>

<p>Gina 127: Doing whatever it takes to please people.</p>

<p>Bugental 128: Do whatever it takes to please people. Wow.</p>

<p>Gina 128: And not disappoint them.</p>

<p>Bugental 129: Mmm.</p>

<p>Gina 129: Yeah. That's a big thing.</p>

<p>Bugental 130: That is a big one.</p>

<p>Gina 130: Real big. And that's the one I've got to, that's the first, that's the goal to think about myself.</p>

<p>Bugental 131: So that's what you call selfish, if you don't do whatever it takes to please people, that's selfish?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Gina 131: If I don't please, yeah. If people don't like me. Yeah, mhm. It has to do with I want people to like me. [Bugental: Mhm] I want you to like me and you don't even know me. I don't want you to not like me. I don't even know who you are.</p>

<p>Bugental 132: I know.</p>

<p>Gina 132: But that's there, [Bugental: Yeah] that's there. Like being perfect.</p>

<p>Bugental 133: Can you give up that? You've been doing that a while.</p>

<p>Gina 133: It's going to be hard. I've been doing it for 37 years, well maybe not quite that long, but, yeah, long time. I'll slip up. I slipped up lately, you know, a couple of times doing it, but . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 134: Now there's where the question, when you slipped up, how are you going to be with yourself?</p>

<p>Gina 134: Well, I'm not going to beat myself up about it, [Bugental: Mhm] 'cause I am going to say, ah, you know, that's, that's how you are. Okay. Next time, let's do this instead, so that, yeah, no, I'm not going to beat myself.</p>

<p>Bugental 135: Can you, can you really do that? Can you . . .</p>

<p>Gina 135: I want to do it.</p>

<p>Bugental 136: I know you do.</p>

<p>Gina 136: And because I'm determined to do it, [Bugental: Mhm] yeah. Can I do it immediately? No. [Bugental: No] But I think in a few years I will be able to. [Bugental: Mhm] Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 137: You've got to be patient with yourself in between.</p>

<p>Gina 137: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 138: That's been hard.</p>

<p>Gina 138: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have to be patient. I'm patient probably with a lot of things but me. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 139: You're kind of recognizing that right now. What came with that?</p>

<p>Gina 139: Oh, well, I thought about being patient with the kids, for the boys. But I am patient with them. But then myself, I'm not patient with [Bugental: There you are] my, my job. You know, I've got to get things done, or don't put it off. Do it now. Um, with relationships, oh, it's got to be just right now or forget it, and you've got to be a little flexible. Um, I'm thinking it's like, you don't agree. After watching like a television program, [Bugental: Mhm, mhm] walk away and think about it. You don't have to agree at that moment. [Bugental: Mhm] You don't have to convince that person at that moment. You may never agree, and that's okay. [Bugental: Yeah] That's, I got, that's, I've got to work on, I have to work on that. And that's just being patient or understanding that everybody is entitled to their own thought and . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 140: Including you.</p>

<p>Gina 140: Yeah, including me, too. Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 141: Sounds like a good program.</p>

<p>Gina 141: Yeah, hey, I didn't think about that. That's pretty good. To really put me first. Yeah. I like doing that. I really do. When I do put myself first, boy I feel really good. [Bugental: Mhm] I can tackle anything. [Bugental: Mhm] I mean I can tackle kids turning in assignments late at school, coming up with five million excuses. I can take my kids bickering with each other. When I feel good about me, it's like okay, no big problem. No, I've got patience, flexible, and I think about instances where I did that. Where I put myself first, and I remember how I felt with that, and the, the problems that happened right after that - it's a piece of cake. [Bugental: Ah huh] Why can't I remember that all the time. I don't know.</p>

<p>Bugental 142: Let's slow down. Why can't I remember that all the time. That's not just your question. Stay with that question inside you.</p>

<p>Gina 142: Well, I've got some patterns that I've developed over a long period of time. [Bugental: Mhm] And it's going to take some time to totally break out of them. [Bugental: Mhm] I wonder if I'll even ever really be able to totally break free. I still think there will be a little bit there, but it won't be predominant. [Bugental: Mhm] It won't be as predominant. Um . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 143: Most of these things aren't all or none.</p>

<p>Gina 143: Yeah. I'm learning that. [Bugental: Yeah] There's a big area in the middle. Very big area in the middle [Bugental: Right] that most things fall into.</p>

<p>Bugental 144: Well, as a teacher, you know about learning curves. They go like this. They don't go zoom.</p>

<p>Gina 144: I'm finding that if I use my teaching strategies with my personal life, I'm a lot happier. [Bugental: Mhm] It works out pretty good. It's like, because I do think that. I take into consideration they're kids, they make mistakes, things happen. I take that into consideration for everybody but me.</p>

<p>Bugental 145: There you go. Now it's time for you.</p>

<p>Gina 145: Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental 146: Our time's just about up. Anything you want to say?</p>

<p>Gina 146: Gosh, it goes fast.</p>

<p>Bugental 147: Anything you'd like to say to me?</p>

<p>Gina 147: Thank you.</p>

<p>Bugental 148: You're welcome, Ma'am.</p>

<p>Gina 148: Thank you because it, I needed to self reflect, [Bugental: Mhm] and I enjoy it.</p>

<p>Bugental 149: Make time for Gina.</p>

<p>Gina 149: Yeah, to sort of just chill. Just sit back and think, add up, not really take a checklist, but . . .</p>

<p>Bugental 150: No, more just like it turned out tonight. Just take, take time to listen.</p>

<p>Gina 150: Appreciate yourself. Yeah, to listen to myself, too. Because sometimes I do shut myself up. I do.</p>

<p>Bugental 151: There go those faces.</p>

<p>Gina 151: I know, I know. (laughter)</p>

<p>Bugental 152: That's all right. Maybe sometimes you ought to do it looking in the mirror.</p>

<p>Gina 152: I should, I should, because everybody sees them and I don't even know I'm doing it. Yeah. But no, I will reflect. [Bugental: Good] That will be good. Thank you.</p>

<p>Bugental 153: You're welcome, and very good fortune to you.</p>

<p>Gina 153: Thank you, thank you very much.</p>

<center><p><b>Treatment Plan for Gina</b></p></center>

<p>In future sessions with Gina, Bugental would follow Gina's lead in terms of content, dealing with whatever issues she brought to counseling. These might include reviewing her decision to divorce, examining her parenting skills, or some other area of concern. As he worked with Gina, he would pay attention to her resistance patterns. These might include her tendency to pose a problem and then quickly "solve" or dismiss it; her impulse to quickly explain away any hesitation, misunderstanding or difference; and her avoidance of concern about being a single parent with sole responsibility for her children. His initial tasks in working with Gina would be to help her ground more fully so that she is able to work more effectively with the real issues she faces in her life. As she becomes more fully attuned to herself and her issues, he would hope to begin to teach her how to use her inner searching capacity more effectively.</p>

<p>Although Gina faces many challenges, by learning to pay attention to her own needs and powers, she has the capacity to develop into an even more effective professional and achieve a more satisfying inner life.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I strained my arm, and it just feels weird. I think too much mousing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know, not surprisingly this week has been sucky at work. One of the things that stress me out all week was, um... So I get stuck with writing documentation a lot. And I've been struck writing documentation for the newest room (inaudible at 00:00:54). And I've just been really blocked on writing it. And part of it is that... So they way they have the controller set up, it is like a touch screen is really confusing and non-intuitive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that the controller for... [00:01:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's like a... This is a room with the terribly expensive table. So there's a little touch-screen controller that allows you to send your laptop's image to each table.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Something you have to document. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's only like, the previous room I'd done it also had the added [00:01:41] of that touch-screen controller but it was really clear what was going on, on the thing and I was just like, "Press computer." "Press screen 1, bam." And, like I showed everyone how to do it, but it was pretty easy. With this new room it's just... It just doesn't work very well. And part of the problem is there's no instructor or computer like front of the room, so it's hard to say, "Go to the side of the room that's opposite the door and the first one will play and then..." And so that's kind of difficult. And the things that it does aren't necessarily what people actually want to do, so there's sort of that. And we had a technician come in because it wasn't working very well and ended up stuck in the room with him teaching it for three hours with no lunch, which is horrible. And he was going through how everything worked and it was just, I mean I was tired and I was hungry. But also thinking, "God this just sucks." It was confusing me. Harry who was part of my team, Chet were right there, and they clearly didn't know what was going on either, really. And I'm trying to figure out how to teach it and I'm not sure if I'm not remembering everything, or if it just doesn't work. So that just frustrating. [00:03:43]</p>

<p>And so I'd written up something early and then it was kind of whatever. And then Harry, who's my team manager, said, "Oh,..." This is sort of like I was feeling, was very hostile and it was just an e-mail, "I need you to make a documentation within the next three days. And I want you to schedule time to train the rest of the department on this. And why isn't this already done?" Which, like I don't know. After the e-mail I just felt like, "Oh god, he's mad at me. He saying I should do it immediately and I just don't want to." I don't want to and also it's difficult in a sort of vague way. Like some things are just hard to describe in words, and some of them I'm just like, "Mm press the button and the other button and the other button."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I hear you saying is that it's actually a pretty difficult task. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And on the one hand no one takes it seriously, but on the other hand it's kind of something difficult. So I feel like people are saying, "Oh just write this up, it will take you like 15 minutes, why aren't you done yet?" And that just really not the case. If it were that easy I would have just done it. It's difficult. And I can't get any help out of... So because I'm not IT I can't use the room, so I can't get any help from them. I'd ask Chet for help and his usual response is like, "Well it's just easy to work, use. Just write it up." So I feel really adrift. Like I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, I feel like I don't know how to complete this task successfully and no one is helping me. [00:06:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, one way that would be helpful would be to have somebody who knew how to use the room to really walk you through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it still wouldn't be an easy task to write the documentation because the way things in the room work, it can be difficult to describe to people who actually want to be doing other things than what it does? (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And the other problem I run into is there are some people who are like, "Oh, it does X,Y,Z." And then I go try to do that, I'm like, "Well it doesn't seem entirely accurate." But I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right, if they oversold it, or like some combination. I can't get an answer. [00:07:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And am I on the right that you kind of feel like this is really just your fault? I mean you're laying out the reasons why it actually really isn't, and why this is unfair that you're getting pushed on this way for something you haven't been shown how to use to you can write it up. But, I guess I know what you're saying to me, but I also get the sense that you feel like you're fucking up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I feel like it should already be done. And it's difficult, but I don't think it's impossible. But when I try to sit down and write something, or just even like plan out... Like I kind of outline it, the documentation, and it's mostly done now. But sitting down to actually write it, I just feel stuck. Like I don't know what to say. But I don't want to say I just can't write. Like I'm standing in front of the computer and I'm like, "Okay I should start working on this." And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying like the outline mostly? [00:08:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I took and outlined what I think the order or like what I like starting with, opening the room and then what you would set up and then closing the room. So I outlined that, and that was relatively easy. And I got some images that I needed like screenshots, but the actual filling in the content has been really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's not clear to me, and I wonder whether it's clear to you, is whether or how much it's because you don't know well enough how the room works, and how much it's because you're scared, upset and pissed off about a lot of things going on at work, including everything that happened with this room?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean I think that's part of why I feel guilty about not being able to get this done, is that I'm not sure if I'm not making it more of a problem than it actually is because I don't want to do it. Or if it's because I'm stressed about work or everything else. (pause)</p>

<p>So instead of, I guess, doing it or not doing it, I just end up feeling paralyzed about it and spending a lot of time at my desk just not working on anything. Which I also feel bad about. Like, sitting around doing nothing is really boring after a while. And I find that sometimes kind of stressful. And it's especially stressful when I think there are, like I have this documentation of all these things that Chet wants me to write out, or that Harry wants me to write out. And I just — Chet's had me write up a couple of documents that, as far as I can tell, have gone... Like he hasn't printed them out, he hasn't put them anywhere. I don't know why I'm writing them. But he's really on my case. He's been really on my case about one of them. So whenever we have these weekly meetings he's like, "Well is this done yet? Why isn't it done?" And I mean the answer is, I just feel like it's busy work. I can see how it would be useful to have documentation on how to download a video from online, etc, but it doesn't seem to go anywhere. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a waste of your time. [00:12:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't know why, I really don't know why he wants me to do this if he's not going to get something is going to happen from it. It's a waste of my time, and also it's a waste of everyone's time. Like, why is he bothering me about it? I don't know. It just feels very... I mean, it's not just a waste of my time, and it's something that could be actually useful, except that it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like it's possible that writing it up, if the right things were done with it after you wrote it up it could actually be helpful to some people. [00:13:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So like at first, the first time I did is I just assumed that he printed out what I wrote and stapled it and put it in the media lab, or stuck it on the wall, or what you would do with any other directions. And he hasn't. I think he put it on our department webpage that no one looks at. Yeah. I think it totally would be useful if it was somewhere where patrons could look at it, or would look at it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, I don't know in a way it sounds just as bad the way everything works, that sort of, purely being something useless. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel that way. It's like; here's this thing I did and spent time on, and you're putting it essentially in a file cabinet and ignoring it. And I could have used that time for anything else. I don't know. It's also something like, I only like doing documentation if people actually use it, or when it feels like interaction with people. I'm like, "Oh, you're going to read this and give me feedback, or if you're having a problem I can refer you to look at the thing I wrote and then get back to me." And then it feels like it's an active document. It is helpful and it was a good use of my time because instead of having to ask every question, someone can look at this and be, whatever.</p>

<p>But with this I feel like I'm sort of like doing nothing. And it's stressful to — I mean sitting around at work in my office is just really stressful. And not working makes me feel like I'm going to be like off. But working is difficult because most of the things I'm supposed to be doing are long term projects that won't matter if I get laid off. (pause) So everyday when I'm at work I just feel really frustrated and then nothing... It feels like a huge waste of time. That's there's very little I'm going to do at work that's going to be, I don't know, interesting. Done well. Or kind of anything. And also that no one else is in my cube most of the day, or my cube area. It just makes me feel a little... Normally I like it, but right now it just feels really isolating and then it's really easy to just lose a half hour staring at the wall because no, just there's no one else there. [00:17:09]</p>

<p>My other option, Chet has offered a couple of times that I could share his office/firm with him, which I don't want to do. (pause) Every time I complain about my office to Chet that's his response, is, "You could share mine." (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see as though the various levels of pointlessness in what you're doing and being asked to do sort of lead you into oblivion there. Where you end up sort of trying to do work, but a lot of times staring off into space and whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or I start doing other really mindless things. Like it's funny because someone's like, oh I should be able to catch up on the blogs I read. But I feel bad spending hours reading blogs or whatever at work. But I don't feel motivated to do anything else. And I still feel like... I feel I'm like in this holding pattern of; get laid off, not get laid off. Job restructured, not job restructured. And it's just taking so long. (sigh) I mean, right now I really just want to... I'd would much rather get laid off than sit around waiting. If there were some way I could say, "Lay me off. Give me severance, unemployment. Fuck I want to be done." I would do it. I'm just really like... I'm just really thinking of going to work and have it be really meaningless. And it's hard to get anything... And the hard part is it's hard to get anything done because no one can make decisions, or is willing to make decisions. Which makes things more frustrating and more pointless because if it's something that just I'm doing, then it could go forward. But if it involves anyone else, no one wants to approve any projects. No one wants to give guidance or direction. So it's just hard to know what to do.[ 00:21:04]</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess you don't feel any urgency in any of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don want to continue feeling that way, but I don't know that there's a lot I can do about that. (long pause) [00:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have emotional reaction to all of this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did have. Like today I was feeling very much I just wanted to leave work. And I was feeling very, like, weepy about it. I just felt very overwhelmed and not sure what to do and feel like if I ask for help I won't get any help. I mean, that's been my main reaction this whole week, to getting any e-mails from the department. I begin to feel like they're saying I'm incompetent or that I should have everything behind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't. Do you think they are all related to emotional reactions, or evidence of those? Because I don't think what you're describing are reactions, how you feel about what's going on. Like, you feel like leaving, you feel like you've been treated badly — which clearly you are. You feel upset, weepy. I don't know. Maybe it just sounds like I'm just talking about semantics, but I don't think that those are actually descriptions of what you feel. Am I being fair?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:24:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say, "I feel like getting up and leaving." Is that a reaction? And you're using the work 'feel', I understand. But you're not actually talking about the feeling that you have such as being sad, or being angry, or being scared. It's like an action you envision yourself taking to alleviate how you're feeling. But it's not really — I don't think that's what you are feeling at the moment. It could, it's related to this reaction to that, but it's not the description of it. I think the other thing you're saying is, well like, when you're talking about feeling criticized. That's a description of your experience of what' happening to you, but it's not... And clearly there is something that is happening that is stirring up your emotions, but it's not a description of what those emotions are, which I think is very important. [00:26:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think primarily how I feel is just really despairing when I'm at work. Like,... (pause, sigh). And one of the reasons why I was thinking about how I want to get laid off is I feel like, I mean I go in and I just feel crappy. I feel stressed and sometimes I just feel very sad or I feel like, just kind of hopeless. I just don't feel like any day is going to be any better. And for a while I was kind of caught up in my world, and it was just a deadline for when they were going to announce early retirement and another retirement immediately after that for several days. But then I end up being like, "Oh god, that means that all of March I have no idea what's going to happen." And I don't want to think that anyone is going to... I know that Chet and Karl and not going to give any information if they had any. (sigh) It feels like no one at work cares. I could be doing nothing, I could be working really, really hard, and just no one cares. [00:28:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what is that like for you to...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like... I makes me feel kind of invisible. On the one hand I feel like nothing I'm doing, nobody cares what I'm doing. I could be doing nothing. I could take an hour for lunch, no one would notice, no one would care. But on the other hand, I'll get an e-mail and I'll be like, "Oh god. The only thing they notice is what I'm not doing." (sniffs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's hard for you to really... You know, (inaudible at 00:29:43) it feels like you're doing, but I think it's hard for you to talk about how you actually feel. And you're telling me what's happening, and it's clear that's awful, that comes across very clearly. And I guess the ... (pause). I think you're feelings are more than anything the way that you are there, even when you're being treated like you're not. Which is why I think about that. If that makes sense. [00:30:40] (pause)</p>

<p>I think considering how you feel probably says the most about how what's happening to you really matters. As much as you're being treated (inaudible at 00:31:02). (long pause)</p>

<p>I think it's hard because it's so painful. You're so, so unhappy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I think I feel like I've wasted a long time. Well, because I've worked for Cambridge for 15 years, which is good because I could get a really good severance. But I feel like I put a lot of — I guess it feels like that's 15 years that doesn't matter. Having spent all this time working for Cambridge and doing all this crap, and in the end it's anyone's as to whether anyone will listen to me at work or even care what's going on. (crying)</p>

<p>I mean I guess I want people at work to pay attention to me, to care what I'm doing or notice what I'm doing. [00:33:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Probably that makes you feel so hurt and so sad when they don't over and over and over again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At this point I feel like there's no one. Like my management is like I'm done. They don't care. And when I try talking to Chet and Karl, they just don't care. Or, I don't know. And so I feel like there's no one else to really talk to at work about it. I mean, I do like my job, it's all the sort of crappy pranks of guys in the department who, probably they aren't glad (inaudible at 00:34:11), but don't have a lot of empathy, can't communicate, are really brusque. And it's something that I really dislike that. I see that in the department. I see so many people who just kind of rough shod over other people and don't... (sigh). They don't care if what they did makes somebody sad. And they don't care about having anything to do with it, having emotions or feelings. It's very much like, "Well why did you do that? It doesn't make any sense." [00:35:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you've been dealing your whole life, certainly working this job, but I think an important thing is your parents too. As much more well-meaning as they are, with people who don't take what your feeling at face value. Or who don't believe you on the basis of what you feel, or take you seriously on the basis of what you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I actually haven't told my parents anything about (inaudible at 00:36:10) or even stuff that's happening. And I'm pretty sure it would be a disaster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't imagine you having the opportunity to be upset about that with them, and have them be supportive about it. I know that in their way they would be well-meaning in their reaction, but they (inaudible at 00:36:10). [00:36:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just harder that I'm not talking to them, which you know makes that more anxious and worry. And actually like if they happened to call today, it's been really rough at work, I feel like I can't really say anything and I don't want to start that conversation. And I was thinking today kind of what I want is — I feel like calling her to be like, "Could you just come up for the weekend and do something nice?" But it wouldn't. It would just be really stressful. And my parents badgering me. And the idea or their actually coming just seems horrible. But the theoretical idea of them coming seems really nice. [00:38:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The way I understand that is like the idea of having them be really here for you is perfect. It would be great. But it's so bad that when you think about what it would actually be like, I think it's a very different...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Part of it is that I think we would have endless arguments about what I should or shouldn't be doing at work, about should I be looking for other jobs and all these things. And my father's main thing is like, in his work life, has been loyalty to the company and feeling like... I mean he said to me is, "What you should do with people is like outlast them. So just keep on doing the job until they leave, or just keep on showing that you're a hard worker and (inaudible at 00:39:29)." And I feel like what's happening now at work is proving that wrong. I don't think my parents believe that it's difficult, or like... [00:40:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that would be true, that's really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it's one of the, sort of... When I talk to my dad about work stuff and then he can be really insightful, but he has that mentality that if you're loyal to the company, there's just a certain amount of loyalty that they'll give back. And... (pause). I don't know how to have that conversation with him. Crying really not that anymore too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's hurting, it already feels bad. Take a risk and do it all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that if called her and told them anything, my mom would be really freaked out that I'm depressed and would be really angry about it and tell me not to... And keep on calling. And she'd just keep on calling until she decided that I wasn't depressed any more. Which is as before. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we'll stop for today.</p>

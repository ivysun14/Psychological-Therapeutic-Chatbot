<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last time we spoke I was talking of lowering my antidepressant because it does have some sexual side effects and I think that I've been getting better. So I talked to Millie and she's like, okay, if I'm at 20mg now we'll reduce it to 15 very subtly. But when she gave me the new prescription I was switching birth controls and that tends to make me very emotional because there are hormonal changes, which cause emotions on themselves; and they also cause breakouts, which cause emotions, so it's a vicious cycle. Eventually, now that this is the second month that I'm repeating the same birth control, I've switched to the lower dose of antidepressant, so I'm going to see how that goes. Yesterday, I don't know if it takes effect that quickly but I did notice sort of feeling anxious, or it could even be the placebo effect, (laughs) sort of scared. [00:01:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Remind me which one are you taking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm taking Citalopram. I did get an iPhone for my birthday because my other phone was dying. I was tired of paying $70 for a dumb phone and I wasn't getting much. I was up for an update and the update is not going to last much longer so I was like, "well you know . . . " Actually, in a sense, I got the Kindle installed on my iPhone because I can read on the bus. With the old phone I was just playing Tetris, but with this I read all the <u>Hunger Games</u> trilogy in about four days because I was really into it. It was really nice to read.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of reading on a little screen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I know. I started getting really batty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next birthday — Kindle? [00:02:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, I think Jeremy's probably going to get that for me because I'm reading my <u>MS</u> on my phone now. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think <u>Hunger Games</u> is probably a little easier to read. (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's a little bit more addicting at the moment, but that was the one thing over this past week. It felt good to . . . because I really used to be into reading in high school. I'm not a really fast reader, but for some reason when I was going through all this sort of weight problems, reading was a real retreat. It felt like I guess I could retreat from the world and sort of indulge in my own fantasies or thoughts. I guess for bus rides I don't see any harm of it or waiting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Reading is a really healthy coping strategy, you know? There's no harm in reading.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But your eyes go buggy from reading on your phone. [00:03:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I know, I know. It was interesting reading the <u>Hunger Games</u>. I forgot that I do this, but after reading a book or a series of books that I find really moving, I just become sort of like really sad that they're over and I become slightly antisocial. I don't know why I become antisocial. I just don't want to be around people. I just want to . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need some time to prep. It sounds like you get really attached to the characters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Needing some time to process that and kind of say goodbye?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Peeta is on my desktop now. (both laugh) [ ] (overlapping voices at [00:04:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know the characters . . . Miss Everdeen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's on my desktop or on my desktop computer right now. It seems silly because I feel like a teenage girl. I laughed at my sister for putting a video game character guy on her desktop - silently or to myself — but now here I'm doing it. It's like I'm sixteen years old. (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not hurting anyone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I just probably won't let Jeremy see my desktop for a while. (laughs) But then it's interesting how I feel sort of guilty getting attached to a movie star or wanting to put him on my desktop. I've had a picture of me and Jeremy on my desktop, but then he never puts pictures of me and him on his desktop or his Facebook and then I'm like oh, well. Sometimes he whistles when we see pictures or flip through magazines and see Heidi Klum. I don't think he feels guilty for that, but for some reason I just feel sort of guilty. And maybe it's because I've been disloyal in a relationship before. In my past relationship I cheated on them. I guess because I can tell . . . [00:05:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it mean to you to have that picture up there? If you're feeling guilty about it, maybe it's something about what it means to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means that he's really attractive and he gives me fond memories of his sweetness, his representation of his character in the book, and then I feel guilty because I don't always feel - Jeremy is attractive but for some reason this guy is a little more — it's a physical attraction, purely physical. I guess with a book it fills in the other blanks. I feel like I should only feel physically and emotionally attached to one man, my boyfriend, and here this character hasn't been there for me in real life. In fact, he's only been in my life for four days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a fantasy. There's something about the fantasy that feels compelling to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's one thing. I guess I just feel sort of ridiculous, like back when I was a teenager and my peers or my friends would be looking through a teen magazine it would be eye candy and ogling these guys. I never really did that. I just sort of felt nothing. Or when girls would take home Abercrombie bags and hang them up on their wall. I never really did that. I guess because that's more of a physical thing, and here's a physical and sort of a slight emotional attachment because you feel their character. In a sense I extra-attached to him because he was kind of like Jeremy, how he's very steady and logical and he isn't the "fire". Katniss is the "fire". I remember once I told my mom in the beginning when I was dating Jeremy that I was worried that Jeremy doesn't have much fire and he doesn't evoke that in me; and my mom's like, "Oh, it's probably a good thing. She's like, "You've had enough. Your fire's underground and you need someone to make you happy." I guess that's why I found the books so addicting, because I saw that sometimes I'm impulsive. Less so now because I've grown up; and I guess being around Jeremy and being with you I've learned to control these impulses. They're never outward impulses. It is sort of an underground fire and when I'm mad. Sometimes I do things that I don't understand why I do them. I've learned to sort of control those impulses. I guess that's why the books touched me. And I guess that's sort of the things that books do. [00:09:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you saw a bit of yourself in the Katniss character and a bit of Jeremy in Peeta's character. Being able to identify that with characters helps us to express things or experience things that we can't necessarily get to in our real life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I sort of realize that starting from people said that the third book she was a different character and she wasn't so brave and she was whiny. Other reviewers were like "She suffered. She was broken and she's trying to get back after everything that she's been through." I took a moment for me to reflect on my life because when I was going through some of my anxiety and nervous breakdown, for some reason life — the way I felt about school and felt about the color pink — or a lot of things that I felt so strongly about I felt I'm still recovering in a sense still. I guess after that second relationship, that past relationship that I had, I really felt broken, destroyed. I see myself in the past two years that I'm trying to rebuild myself and my relationships with friends and family. And while I do feel like I'm getting better and I'm getting happier, I just sort of feel like that sort of goofy, passionate person is kind of gone. I still feel moments of passion or happiness, but not like I did before. I was really extreme and I did cry a lot, and maybe those are things that should be curbed but I just sort of feel . . . [00:11:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt like you got with the extreme of that, it got erased. You feel like you're missing out on the other end, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel like life is so tedious and repetitive and I don't know if it's just because I'm every day doing pretty much the same thing with my research and looking for . . . maybe a lot of people feel this when they don't like their job. It's so boring and just sort of getting through it, doing the same stuff, fixing something, running the same program. You realize that my mouse doesn't have batteries and run the program again because the program died. It's really sort of boring and kind of . . . [00:12:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What felt exciting to you before? Is it that the things have changed or that your response to it has changed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess back when I started graduate school there was a lot of fear but excitement. There was a whole lot of fear like, "Am I going to get this professor? Am I going to do well? Are we still taking classes?" and learning a lot of physics and scared that I didn't know enough physics. I'd just stay up so late and not sleep and do my homework, and even during undergrad every waking moment I was just doing work and it was crazy. And now I run programs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not as scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) That's true. I guess I'm really driven by fear. In a sense I was trying to prove that I could do it, that I could get into something. There is all this pressure. Trying to get into graduate school when you start out from community college - that's a long way to go. There are a lot of trials to pass, a lot of tests to do well, and I guess now that I have advisor and I guess I sort of felt during the teaching class I would get excited because I had to create a lesson plan. I got a little scared and work really hard on it before it was due because it meant a lot to me, and I guess there are few things that I find now that mean so much to me. I guess Jeremy means a lot to me and I spend a lot of time doing things, making things for Jeremy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I guess, yeah. I mean it just seems every day it gets so ingrained I don't realize a lot of my time is just spent with Jeremy. I didn't realize this until I was reading the <u>Hunger Games</u> all weekend and I didn't want to listen to him play guitar, I just wanted to read the <u>Hunger Games</u>, and I actually got angry at him for playing the guitar while I was trying to read. I waited until he was asleep and finished off the series, so I stayed up an extra three hours and I was grumpy the next morning. He didn't understand. I felt really bad, but I guess it caused me to evaluate because a lot of my time, my energy is centered around Jeremy. Jeremy does like that center of focus; but in another sense, it does make me feel good to be able to help someone and be able to love them. I know that yesterday when I didn't want to go see him play music because I'd popped a zit and made it big and caused a scar. I'm really self-conscious about my face and I didn't want to go out in public. I was tired and grouchy, but then when I went there he said that I was beautiful. I had a fun time and cheered up and had a very good morning this morning. I sort of realized that even though a lot of things are centered around making food for him and coming over, I do enjoy it. It does make me feel happy. Jeremy does mean a lot to me and I think that when I'm not scared . . . I guess everyone sort of starts to . . . just like Katniss sort of didn't appreciate how much Peeta did care for her . . . I guess it's easy and maybe that's sort of sometimes . . . I guess the book really sort of brought home a lot of things that just had happened. [00:17:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because I read it a while ago. I wonder if part of the reason that it was so consuming for you — I know that part of her struggle is between Peeta and the other guy — I forget the other guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gale.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gale, thank you. And from what I remember she kind of had that much more passionate feeling about one than the other, and trying to figure out what was right for her based on the different kinds of feelings that were inspired by both characters. It sounds like you're sort of identifying with her and sort of noticing, not necessarily between one man and another man, but have that more fiery spark and passion that you felt at the beginning of graduate school; and it feels like those edges have been dulled now that you're several years into the program and sort of looking for that spark somewhere maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I haven't really talked about this, but there are some times every now and then - like one of our friends that's one of my colleagues, he's tall and for some reason I'm attracted to east Europeans for God knows why. He's tall and he's also sort of a different build than Jeremy and for some reason my heart starts beating when I talk to him or near him, like I just want to be near him and I feel bad because . . . [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're having this whole reaction to someone who is not your partner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's funny because Jeremy and I we're very low key. I guess sometimes I wonder what is right for me and I sort of feel guilty for asking that question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a question?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I sort of see how it ended up in the end, how she realized that sometimes the things that we sort of need to survive are not always ourselves, not always the fire. I sort of realize that maybe having fire, life will feel very intense, but if I was feeling intense moments when, you know, graduate school was kind of scary but it's not like you're losing your house or a tornado. I guess I sort of realize that the fire of life should be there for certain times and it's not something that you should experience on a daily basis. Sometimes there are a lot of tedious things in life. I guess maybe I'm just more hypersensitive to these bored moments, because it seems like I used to have such an exciting life. In reality I'm just sitting on my bed doing homework and creating [the zone fire] (ph). (inaudible at 00:21:10) And I'm getting more used to it. It's crazy that if sometimes like if I pop a zit and I'll be at home and sometimes I'll be feeling it and I used to have to wash my hands before typing on the computer or doing anything, but I've told myself "There's nothing to worry about. You're safe. You're fine. Nothing is wrong with you," and I can continue typing on my computer. Of course I wouldn't do that if I were going to be baking, but then again, that's just gross if you're baking for someone else. I told my roommate, Brandon. He's the one that's going into medical school next year. For some reason - I don't know why - I feel it's a little bit of an over share, because he was like "Oh, I can give you a chair for sitting outside on the patio, because that one's really dirty." I was like, "Oh, no, I don't worry. I don't care about dirt the way I do blood," and he was like "Why is that? Aren't germaphobes afraid of everything?" I was like "Well, no, you can get more permanent diseases from blood or from other humans," and then I told him about the hookup, how I got tested many times and five months after the event everything was fine and clear. He was like "Well, I don't remember exactly for things like HIV, but I know for four to six months there is a window where you can get . . . " Well, the act that I did was very improbable, but again we add in the fact that my roommate had hooked up with him and she knew that it was safe. And so he's like "Well, you're probably fine." I started to get very anxious of that sort of . . . [00:23:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You started to question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I started questioning things and also I was like "Oh, well now he probably thinks I have it." And I was like I don't even know. I can't even say that he's wrong. For some reason, maybe I was being sarcastic, and I said, "Brandon, thank you for your comforting advice." He was like "Oh, well that's good to hear." (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably over his head, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I did. And he's like "Well, I hope that's what I plan to be. Be able to comfort people in the future." I was like "Oh, this is not comforting at all." I sort of put it out of my head and I was like this is something that was resolved many months ago. I was looking for affirmation from someone that was medical and he doesn't even really have medical training.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I know. He hasn't even gotten to medical school so he's just saying from his experience of working in a hospital, which was radiology for cancer, which is totally different. [00:24:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where he might be an expert in the future, he is not an expert yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then I remember how my sister was scared after she did the same thing with a guy and she got tested two or three months after. Moved out completely. Completely, and that just sort of reassured me. She moved on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and she's married and, hopefully, she'll eventually have kids. I was happy how I sort of just dealt with it. I just had to tell myself "It's okay, you were worrying but your worrying is just what you programmed yourself. That's the lot that you have to deal with." It's a programmed response. I'm getting better at . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Worrying doesn't make it that there is actually something to be worried about. [00:25:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm actually getting better. I was thinking every now and then if I put lotion on my face, not to have to wash my hands again, because if I can touch my face and nothing happens, no [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:21) or anything, then I should be fine. And picking up clean or dirty underwear and not having to wash my hands - I know that first I was touching the makeup bag and not worrying and I've actually gotten really good at that, so now the next step is to push it a little bit further and so I think in that sense . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you've cut down on hand washing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my hands are really soft. I like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What a nice side effect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, and my tummy pains were — I was having them and I was trying to figure out was it a food allergy, was it not eating enough? And when I'm at home it doesn't show up so much, but when I'm . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Home your apartment or home parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Home at my apartment, because I've been working from home. When I'm at school I always get them so I don't know if it's maybe even just the water I'm drinking at the department.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you eating similar foods? When you're at school do you bring lunch from home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I bring lunch from home and sometimes, like today, I have cottage cheese, Fiber One, and banana so that I have my fiber and a grain, protein and some fruit. [00:28:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that differ from what you would eat if you were working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At home I've been doing a tuna salad and a lollipop after, or Tootsie Pop because I need that quick sugar. For some reason I just like lollipops. (chuckles) I guess maybe I have a little more vegetables when I'm at home or like a soup. I sort of see that maybe when I'm at school I don't have as much fiber.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be that. I wonder if you're eating less at school versus at home? Sometimes you can feel a lot of stomach upset when there's a long time between meals or if there's not enough food in your stomach, because there's nothing to absorb the acid if you're not eating as much. I think a good experiment to do is, if you're feeling better when you're at home, to try to mimic that as closely as possible at school with the amount and food choices. You can do it in reverse, too. You can eat at home what you've been bringing to school and see what the difference is. What we're trying to figure out is whether it is the school or are you anxious at work versus home, and is what you're experiencing not so much a result of the food, but is the stomach pain really anxiety? If we can try to control and make things as similar as possible in both places and see how your body reacts, then we can know whether it's the food or the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I think that I'm going to make some soup, which I normally have at home, and then bring it. It's a bean soup with lots of vegetables. I know that's sort of really comforting and mild on my tummy, so I'll bring that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pay attention to how your body does. [00:30:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's also sort of interesting that when I go home, because I know that my mom has a history of a weaker stomach and my sister has IBS. I'm definitely going to see. I'm happy now that Jeremy and I switched to — he gets a new set of peanut butter and new condiments. I try to stay constant on if I'm sitting on the breakfast table how much I'm going to put on my toast, how much jelly or jam. I sort of realized that I should try to get a little more consistent rather than spooning out of certain jars and eating it. Just like maybe a little half or quarter teaspoon at a time, but how many times do I do that? [00:31:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're worried about being careful about the calories?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Calories, yeah. That's something that I did. I was gaining weight and I was like 118. I was like "Okay, what's happening? Why am I gaining weight?" I realized that I was snacking a lot. I cut down the snacking and I realized wow — I must have been snacking a lot and sort of saw that the weight gain was most likely because I was snacking. Now I'm really being cautious of not snacking, which was an anxiety sort of thing in itself to not snack. It's really hard to just . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you hungry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't need to be. Your weight is perfectly appropriate. You don't need to be going hungry during the day. That's hard on your body to have your stomach be empty. Snacking is a perfectly okay thing to do. I know there is a window where you're most comfortable, but you're really not far from that window. [00:32:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I realized that I can have a snack but not keep on whenever I get in the kitchen (munching noises) and not keeping track, because I don't think that's very filling either, and just have a little bit bigger meals. That's sort of what I've been working on. I see that when I'm bored I feel like snacking just because I'm bored, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's a difference between having a snack when you're hungry and having a snack when you're bored. There really isn't a need for you to be keeping yourself hungry during the day. If you're finding that you're snacking because you're bored and you check in with yourself and you see "Am I hungry now?" You answer yes or no. If you're hungry, having a snack is fine. If you're hungry and bored, okay to have a snack. If you're just bored, then maybe you want to wait until you are hungry or feeling like you're starting to get hungry. You don't need to wait until you're ravenous, because that will be harder on your stomach. [00:33:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been better at saying "Okay, it's only been 3½ hours since breakfast so I'll have lunch a little bit early because I'm really hungry." And I feel better. That's something that I'm working on because I just want to figure out my tummy. Then I can sort of feel like I can go back to dance. It's embarrassing when you have to go downstairs and go to the bathroom every forty minutes. Nothing comes out, just sort of fluid. So that's pretty much what's been going on. I have been talking to my parents a little bit more. I've been talking to my mom. It's been a long while since I got a hold of her, but it's very nice to talk to her. We have a lot of fun. For some reason I just get a little scared talking to my family. I guess maybe it's a stimulated sort of response. Number one, I've never been much of a phone talker, but also just because there was a long time where my family and I weren't speaking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got a pretty strong reaction from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I still haven't told them that Jeremy and I are moving in together. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're really worried about what their response will be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think I'll tell them, at least not right before a recital. I don't even know if there is a good time. Things that I talked about with Jeremy just because I feel like there are questions that I might have that are legitimate points. Sometimes when people move in together it's sort of just a continuation that never ends up in marriage. I was talking to him and he said that if you're moving in together it's not just because it's convenient, but it is to see if one or two years of that and you see if you're right for each other, and then you get engaged. That was comforting because that was sort of a fear. I can see why my parents' concerns are legitimate because there is a higher divorce rate among people that do cohabitate before the get married. There is a lot of risk moving in and not having it materialize just because you get so cozy. I sort of realize that in terms of convenience and I want to see what it is to live with him, that it's a lot different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about him in the topic of marriage? How do they fit together for you? [00:36:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been dreaming about it for a long time. I talk about Peeta now (both laugh) but I think about it quite a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been dreaming of marriage to Jeremy or you've been dreaming of marriage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, marriage to Jeremy. Well, marriage to Jeremy, in fact, because I think it would work out nicely because we're both calm, we can solve decisions well, we enjoy spending time with each other and we have a similar background like the importance of family, love and togetherness as opposed to money. He's really fun to travel with. I sort of see that in terms of a long-time partner, these are things that I would be looking for. Yes, he doesn't evoke a fiery passion, but in a sense he really calms me and he's very supportive. So, yeah, I've been thinking this is a man that I do want to marry. This is someone that I do want to become closer to. I know that right now there is the stress of getting my stuff and not having all my stuff over there. I want to see what it's like with that stress removed. My parents really like him, too. Actually I was very tickled because we're going away coming up in May for a business trip, but also kind of like a spa resort thing that they're arranging for them for free and he had to tell them that I was his fiancé. I got like a little tickle. I did get tickled. I do consider it and it seems like a very sort of logical decision because I have been through relationships and both of them really sucked; but I do see there were maybe some redeeming parts like having a partner that is intellectual. My last boyfriend — he was smart, but he was evil and he was mean. And the last boyfriend was dumber than mayonnaise, (both laugh) but he was loyal and very constant and very steady; and this was something where I sort of saw that he didn't evoke a fire, but maybe that's sort of not what I need. In every day, the first boyfriend was sort of what I needed. The second one was just more intellectual. Jeremy is by far [ ] (overlapping voices at 00:39:49) That's sort of something that I'm excited for. I guess maybe the excitement, because there's no fear with it, because it's just sort of a happiness . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is a nice feeling. And I wonder if some of that passion and spark that you're kind of feeling that you're missing — I wonder if some of that is not just in your relationship with Jeremy or partly where you are in school, where right now your work is a lot of competitive running your trials and things like that. And if there is a place maybe where you can find more engagement in your life, and maybe that would be with dance. I don't know. There's some anxiety holding you back there. I think that it might be that there is a space where you can find this kind of passion or spark again. And I also wonder if maybe it's partly affected by the meds, just seeing if there is a difference if you taper down on those. [00:40:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's one thing that I was really excited to see. Learn how to get back a spark and an excitement without the anxiety, and I sort of feel like the drugs really do mellow me out but there's energy, there's life, there's passion for good things that I'm looking for. That's why I'm really curious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As we get closer to August and your insurance renewing, we can think about meeting much more frequently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought twice a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, then you can replace some of the meds with other anxiety-coping techniques to allow you to maybe tap into that engagement, but also be controlling the anxiety and getting a little more support. [00:41:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's one thing I sort of realized, is that talking to people about your problems can reduce them. They can help you see it a different way. It's the same with reading. I was actually really excited that for once I could really focus. Sometimes I can't focus on my physics stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's a harder type of reading.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. I sort of realized that I can do it. I have one paper that I've been putting off reading, but I know I've been doing stuff to get my attention, which is carrying out his calculations to see do I agree with this. Should this be something that raises my concern? I see that it's helping. This is my goal, to go through his 20-page paper, and I have all of today. Of course, I sort of see that it is a struggle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's important to have the ability to focus and knowing that you can sit down with a pleasure reading book shows us that you can focus. Focusing on an academic paper is a wStacy different ball game. You have to set different expectations for that. Your ability to stay focused with really difficult material is going to be different than your ability to focus on easily-digestible material. It's a good technique to kind of keep yourself engaged with what you're reading by asking yourself if you would draw the same conclusion, maybe doing calculations, like you're saying. It helps you to stay engaged with the material, but you're never going to be able to fly through an academic paper the way you flew through the <u>Hunger Games</u>. That's an unrealistic expectation. [00:43:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It's crazy but it's nice to see that I could focus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Reminding yourself that, yes, you do have this ability to focus, but it's going to be somewhat content-specific. It requires a lot more work to focus on a difficult academic paper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. That's one thing I do have to remind myself. It's not because I'm just procrastinating it's just legitimately hard. If you took many pages and crammed it into a paragraph. That's why I sort of realize that when I'm reading a paper the third time I realize I don't remember reading that or I didn't digest it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems so dense. When people talk about having trouble focusing, which comes up a lot, one of my go-to questions is, "Can you watch a movie or read an easy book and stay focused on that for an extended amount of time?" If you can't do that, then you know you have a legitimate problem with attention of focus. I think sometimes we get skewed in our perception. We think we can't focus because you're asking yourself repeatedly to focus on really hard things. So doing that test with yourself of "Well, what if I was doing a much simpler task? Can I watch a sitcom and stay focused for a half hour?" [00:45:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can watch Mad Men pretty well. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's nothing wrong actually with your attention, it's just that you're asking yourself to pay attention to really hard things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess that's just sort of where persistence pays in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and giving yourself a break from it and then going back to it. If you read hard material for 20 minutes, take a 10-minute break from it and then go back, that makes it a little bit easier because you come in with fresh eyes again. You need those breaks. You don't really need those breaks with something that's easy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I read for 10 minutes and take a five-minute break, but I think reading for a little bit longer and taking a little longer break . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything else we should be catching up on that we didn't today? [00:46:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess one thing that's been sort of cropping up is the insecurities of how I look and how I dress. I bought a dress. Jeremy and I are going to a wedding on Memorial Day. I was looking for a dress and I wanted it to be just spectacular, but for $100 you're not going to buy a spectacular dress. You can go on all these sites like gilt.com or ideeli or ruelala and you can find dresses, but they're not that spectacular even though they are on sale. I want to look really nice and so I found there is this site that they are Chinese wholesale dresses of normal dresses and I thought "Yes, this is really cool" because I can find a dress. A lot of dresses these days are not below the knees in length. A lot of them are very short, which would give my boyfriend a heart attack if it were a short mini dress. Plus, I feel like if I'm going into church to see someone's wedding, I wouldn't want a tight miniskirt spandex-y dress. I would think that God would want me to dress appropriately. And so I found a dress and I got it and it came in the wrong color, but to ship it back to China would be $30, especially because I would have to do it in three days, which is not very cheap to ship it back. I realized that sage was an alright color. It wasn't emerald, but then I just wanted to decorate it because it looked very plain. So I showed Jeremy the dress. I haven't tried it on for him. It fits very nicely but it is a little plain. I was looking at trim because I was like "Oh, this dress is going to look so boring." Then finally I showed Jeremy and I was like "What do you think of this trim?" He was like "What's that for? Is that for a medieval dress that you're planning on making or wearing?" and I was like "No, this is for the dress I wanted to wear for Stacy's wedding. I wanted to put some trim on it." He was like "Well, you don't need the trim. What's wrong with simplicity?" and I sort of see that with the things that I wear, they seem like blah and boring, kind of like tedious — like the rest of my life. Sort of like nothing is spectacular, like my hair I actually have to do something to it. My hair is a boring color. Very few times saying "Oh, you're pretty, Janet." That seems vain, but every now and then someone should feel like "I look good". [00:49:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you feel kind of unsatisfied.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel very unsatisfied with life, my appearance, with other people, and I see myself looking for compliments and I don't know why I feel so unsatisfied.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that raises the question "What really is it that you feel like you're missing?" And it seems like even if you face the theme of this session you started in talking about the book and having Peeta up on your desktop. And it was like there is something missing that you are hoping that character would kind of fill for you, that there was something missing and just feeling bored with the repetition of your program. So what really is missing? I'm going to let you ponder that. [00:50:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I really do need to. It is really that. I've been looking for all this sort of pizzazz and bang and Jeremy is just telling me "Why do you need it?" and that's a good question. Why do I feel I need it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I don't want you to resign yourself just yet to boring and no pizzazz but I would like you to sort of let this idea kind of flip around in your brain a little bit. Is there something missing? What is it? Why don't we schedule for next time and you can tell me what you discover.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And by the way, that card really helped out this time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. I'll give you another one.</p>

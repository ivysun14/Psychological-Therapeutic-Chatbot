<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will be my last hitch. I know there have been a lot of changes and hitches lately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay. [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:09) So I was feeling sick. I came home on Friday last week. Did I see you last week? I took a day off. I feigned being sick. I wasn't really sick. It was a mental health day. Then on Monday night I was coughing a little bit and on Tuesday morning was coughing a little bit more; and throughout the day on Tuesday it got progressively worse and I developed a really hoarse, dry, heaving cough. I went home early. Wednesday I had off anyway because it was Yom Kippur, but I was in such bad shape—coughing non-stop, stuffy nose and everything—that I didn't even go to temple, didn't fast, ate soup, the whole thing. [00:01:09] Then I ended up staying home yesterday, but working from home a little bit. Yesterday in the afternoon I went in and saw my doctor because this cough was not letting go. She said it was good that I came in because it was turning into bronchitis so that she's going to treat it as if it was bronchitis. She didn't give me antibiotics. She just gave me an inhaler and told me to get Mucinex to take, sleep with the humidifier, which I had already been doing. So I've been doing that and the inhaler has been helping a little bit, but I'm just not feeling great and I have a sinus headache that will not go away. Just nasty. Maybe it's that somebody in my office was sick and I could have gotten it from him, but he's a little bit different. Also, I had been smoking cigarettes on the weekend with my friends. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want some aspirin? I may have some. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's okay. I took some a little while ago and I already have the Mucinex and I don't want to overload myself. I think it's just resting. Anyway, the doctor asked me if I smoked and I said I don't usually but I have been and Franklin had suggested that that could have lowered my immune system and of course I was like, "You don't know what you're talking about." He was right. (sniggers) She was like, "Yeah, yeah. That's true." That is my inspiration to re-quit smoking, so that's nice. (chuckles) I went into work. I managed to go to class last night because my appointment was at four and I go to [ ]. (inaudible at 00:02:46) Then I went to class and, because I had had the inhaler, I wasn't coughing as much, which is good. Then today I went into work and I drove because my friend loaned me her parking permit because she lives in the zone where my work is. Then I just left. I did as much work as I could and then just left and go home right after this. [00:03:13] I was supposed to go this weekend to go see Amanda and my god-daughter and stuff, but because I'm not feeling well, I'd rather not have to drive. Also, the baby is a month and a half and she was a premie, so it's a double risk for getting sick. My doctor said I'm not contagious. She said I'm fine for class and work, but for the baby, I can't go. So it will be nice to just stay home this weekend and relax. If I don't use the inhaler every four hours, which is the dosage, I'm just coughing, like coughing up a lung. It's a little less dry now, but it's still very uncomfortable. I think the mixture of the guy at my job who was sick probably, plus the changing weather, plus all the stress, plus smoking cigarettes, probably all just added to this. I just hope it doesn't develop into something bacterial or something, so we'll see. [00:04:23] </p>

<p>Otherwise, I've been talking to Franklin. I'm so back-and-forth. Sometimes I'm feeling good about things and then sometimes I'm not. Last night he stayed over, mainly because I was feeling really shitty and asked if he could bring me some soup. He brought me some soup and then I was like, "Just stay over." It was nice to have someone get me water in the middle in the night and whatever. (sighs) I was wondering if I would feel irritated to not have the bed to myself, which I didn't really, or irritated if he wanted to cuddle, but I didn't. It was more comforting, I think. I don't know. I'm sick. It was just comforting to have him there, I guess. [00:05:21] Then I had a really weird dream. I haven't been dreaming about him in the situations all that much or that I can remember, or maybe I dream about it but then once I wake up the details go away really quickly. (chuckles) I had a really weird dream and maybe it was more defined or more pronounced when I remembered the details better. Maybe I had the dream because he was sleeping in my bed or whatever, (chuckles) but I had a dream that he proposed to me and, channeling my inner fat girl, I guess, because he put the ring in the frig. The ring was in the frig hidden behind some cheese or something. His reasoning was that he knew I would go to the frig for a snack after work or something. (chuckles) [00:06:21] A lot of my dreams I don't remember details that well. I remembered exactly what the ring looked liked. I remembered it was a little tight. So he proposes. Oh, my God. Everything must have been good. I guess we made out. It was so pretty. We go to the jeweler's to get it sized (chuckles) and he's showing us options of the bands that could fit with it. Something happens. We left because he was sizing the ring. I remember that. We came back, the ring was sized and on my finger, and we were ready to go. He called Franklin in the back room to show him something. I'm waiting around; maybe I was with a friend. I don't remember. I'm going to preface this by saying that I watched the entire season of True Blood within in a four-day period. (laughs) Franklin comes out, runs out, saying, "We have to go. We have to go." I'm in the dream, then, and I'm like, "What?" He's like, "I didn't want to pay for the ring," and he's holding the band. In my head I turned into Sookie's backup and I was like, "Not again." His issue would be to Bill. This is the main character of True Blood. Sookie backups for the vampire lover, Bill, and like, "Not again." I was like, "Not again, Franklin. Why don't you stop?" (both laugh) It was so weird. We had to run out of the store because the security camera went on and the doors were going to lock. We run out and we're running, and then we get caught. And Franklin is like, "I'm a vampire. It doesn't matter." [00:08:10] (both laugh) It was so weird. What the fuck? I understand the engagement part is like channeling what I hoped or what I still hope or whatever, but turning into a vampire? It was so strange. I had had some True Blood dreams after I had watched like five episodes in a row naturally, like five episodes then go to sleep; but I was actually dreaming of True Blood, those characters. This was like Franklin was a vampire. It was so weird. I can't figure it out for the life of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you remember exactly what the ring looked like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it look like? [00:09:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a cushion-cut diamond and it was not that big, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cushion cut?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's almost like a square or a rectangle, but the corners are kind of round. It used to be called a pillow cut, like you'd see in a lot of vintage rings. That's what I've always said that I want. I remember the cut. I remember the clarity because I happen to know a lot about jewelry just because of my family. I remember the color and the clarity of it, not what color letter it was or anything like that. But I remember looking at it and thinking, "The color is so good." It was platinum and it had little diamonds coming up on one side and little diamonds coming up on the other side and then like a wave design, with the other side platinum. It's weird because it's not like a design of a ring and I remember thinking this in my dream like, "Wow. This doesn't really look like any of the rings I ever showed him, but that's so nice that he thought of it on his own." [00:10:11] But, yeah, that's what it looked like. Then one of the bands that the guy was showing him was cut to a pebble piece to fit the engagement ring next to it. The other one was like an eternity band with diamonds around it. But, yeah, I remember the details of it. It's not something that I've ever seen, either. It's not like a ring that I've ever dreamed of or anything, besides the cut of the diamond like I knew that that's what I wanted. But, yeah, that's what that looked like. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've not seen True Blood. I know there are vampires on it. Can you tell me a little bit about the show? [00:10:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole show is really complicated. There is this girl, Sookie Stackhouse. She's like a 20-something, my age girl. It takes place in a fictitious town called Bon Temps, Louisiana, outside of Shreveport, which is a real place. This is modern times and vampires have come out of the coffin and they're trying to mainstream because some Japanese scientist came up with a substitute to blood that tastes exactly like blood and is used the same as blood, so now they can all be mainstreaming because they don't need to feed on humans and live in shadows. [00:11:43] Sookie Stackhouse becomes involved with vampire, Bill, who is her neighbor. He used to live pre-civil war, was a resident of the town and moved back there after they came out. She has a little romance with him and becomes totally involved in the supernatural world. Later on there are werewolves, there are fairies, there are shape-shifters—all of this stuff—maenads and all sorts of crazy stuff. The vampires use the true blood, but then for willing humans and a lot of times during sex they will feed off of a human or the humans will—whatever. Sometimes they do random attacks and basically the show chronicles the action of that whole situation. So that's what it is. [00:12:46] That's what the show is. So, right. Franklin is like a vampire and I guess, like the jeweler, he had been willing or if Franklin attacked him (laughs) to steal the rings. I don't remember. It just makes me laugh. It's so ridiculous. Maybe that was my subconscious. I don't even know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Franklin, as it turns out, is not a vampire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He's not a vampire. He didn't burn up when he went outside, it was morning, so he's not a vampire overnight. Right? Hopefully, whatever jeweler I was imagining that I know—because I knew him in my dream. It was a jeweler that I was familiar with. Hopefully he's not sucked dry by a vampire this morning. I don't know. I've been thinking about it all day. When I told Franklin the dream he said he dreams all the time. He says he has engagement dreams and marriage dreams all the time. I don't know how actually "all the time" it is because he likes to up the ante on the drama. [00:14:04] But he was like, "I have those dreams all the time, but not with vampires." (laughs) Like, "You're never a vampire in my dreams." I have no idea. Maybe the only thing that I could think of is the idea of, "So, nice. We're getting engaged. We're getting a ring size." But there's a bad part to it or something. I don't know. Or then he ruined it. (both laugh) Maybe. Maybe, actually that could be. It actually makes sense. Just when I think everything is going well, he fucks the jeweler guy and now we're running from the law. I mean it could just totally be an anomaly. [00:15:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any other associations to the elements of the dream? In other words, not how you interpret it or how you understand it, but are there other things from the dream that make you think of memories or things that have happened or that you've seen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess in regards to the engagement, how when we have talked about the possibility of getting married or getting engaged, he's told me that he's thought of how he would want to propose. So there is that, like his clever little "it's in the frig." In regards to the ring, I guess having looked at rings myself or with my friends or that I've showed him like, "Oh, look at this. This is so pretty," back when I was thinking about that more I guess. [00:16:25] I guess the stone, the color and the cut and the clarity, because that's something that I've thought about and researched a little bit and told him. So there is that, but I don't know. I have those associations to those parts of the dream. The vampire aspect—yeah, I watch True Blood. I think if I didn't that would be like, "Whoa." That would be really, really weird. Because I watch True Blood, it's not as weird; it's strange that my unconscious combines those two things. [00:17:32] I mean things have been going well in terms of our conversations and stuff. We had a particularly difficult conversation last Sunday. We had breakfast together and then we started having a conversation about everything, I guess. I was asking for more explanation about what happened with Betty and why and trying to touch on that, even though I haven't had too much success in the past. At first, I got really frustrated because he started talking about all of the things he wasn't feeling attractive. He thought I was cheating on him. He thought I wasn't attracted to him anymore. All of this stuff. He thought I wasn't supporting him, so I immediately got defensive and was like, "Fuck you, then. Again, this is all about me." He was like, "No, wait. I'm realizing that that was my problem, that wasn't anything that you were doing. I was turning all of these things that were going on into 'Oh, you're hiding your phone. You're hiding something.' You got invited to a party by this guy that you knew in high school. Why are all these guys popping up?" He was kind of saying that that was his problem and that it wasn't my fault and that I didn't do anything and he's so sorry and he never wanted to hurt me and he would never want to hurt me again and I'm the only one for him and all of this stuff that's very nice to hear and I think it was a good conversation. We got a little bit further in terms of talking about the whole thing than we had before, I think. [00:19:37] He talked about wanting to be patient and wanting to keep trying no matter what; and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but I'm not going to blah, blah, blah. That's fine, but later on in the week he was sort of sulking again about me. I said I was confused about something or like said we were talking too much or something, and he started sulking again and we started talking again about, "Where are we? I don't really know. If you don't know where we're going, then why are we doing this?" and da, da, da. I don't want him to flip-flop every time I say that I'm having doubts about something. If I'm saying to you that I'm still confused about my thoughts and feelings about whatever, that's not your cue give up. (pause) [00:20:43] Shoot, I thought of something else just now and I can't remember what it is. (sighs) Oh—then yesterday he told me he's going to rent an art studio space, like 400 square feet, $375 a month, and in my head I'm like, "Okay. Just last week you were telling me that you were going to start saving 'x' amount a month. How are you going to do that if you're renting this space?" He says he's going to use it for photography and throwing events. Because I really didn't want to be involved too much, I was like, "Okay, well I hope it works out for you," because I didn't want to say something to make him think I'm not supporting him or whatever. I just didn't really want to be involved, so I was just kind of like, "Okay. Sounds interesting. Sounds like an interesting opportunity." But in my head, I'm like, "Sounds like an idiotic way to spend your money. Pick something, Franklin. Just pick. If you're going to do that, then don't spend the $400 . . . " I just don't know what he's doing. "I thought you were trying to get back into school and you owe them $800 for the class you failed, so you have to pay the money before you get into school?" "Well . . ." "Are you saving for that? But, wait, you're also saving for your personal trainer sort-of vocation, so are you doing that? Are you saving for a car?" Luckily, it's not my problem right now, but if we are trying to work on things, then it ultimately is my problem. [00:22:31] It's just very in-keeping with his dreams of grandeur. I don't know, but it makes me severely doubt that he's going to be able to do the things that he says are important to him, which are also important to me. I feel that he's still drinking way more than he should be, even though he, himself, acknowledged, "I'm drinking way more than I want to be and I don't want to, but that's my fault and I feel like I need to just spend more time doing other things." But he's still drinking. I don't know how much he's drinking. Last night when he came to my house he had gotten himself a soda and had put in two little Nips, which is like a strong cocktail. It's not over the top, but if you're saying you want to stop drinking and you're coming over to your girlfriend's house to bring her soup, why do you need it? He smokes anyway. He smoked a joint, which is fine, cool, whatever. I smoke all the time when I'm not sick. But why also the cocktail? Why? Why? I don't get it. I really don't [00:24:00] Then he said he went out on Saturday night last weekend with his friends, got drunk—fine, whatever. It's the weekend. You're going to do that. But then the next day this friend of his/ours—but his first—who is like an alcoholic; she's an alcoholic. I don't care if she's functioning and she does (ph), she drinks almost every night. She gets shit-faced and drives drunk and she's a mess. They met up at this place near where we live, where he lives and where I live also because we live ten blocks away from each other, and drank all day. They sat and had beers all day, literally, for four hours were sitting in the bar drinking. Like why? I don't get it. If you're trying to be productive, hang out with your friends but don't hang out with your friends if they're just going to sit in the freaking, dingy bar and drink. I don't get it. [00:24:57] All of these things—I feel like two steps forward with these good conversations and I'm hearing good things, and then two steps back because you're so over the place, Franklin. You're still all over the place with your plans, with your money, what he's spending it on, with the drinking. I was almost instinctually like, "If you rent a studio, how are you going to pay for certification and how are you going to pay to get back into your school and how are you going to pay for a car or for anything?" I wanted to say that, but I just zipped it because I was not going to go there right now. This is one of the things that I have to be considering and looking at when thinking about if this is actually going to work moving forward. [00:26:05] (pause) I missed having him at the break fast at my dad's house. I did miss having him there. He had said he missed being at this stuff, even though he was kind of a kvetch about it a little bit before we went. He was like, "I'm sad not being there for the Jewish holidays with you guys." I'm like, "Okay, fine." I've just been feeling like how long am I supposed to wait? I will say this—I am starting to feel a little bit more trusting, which is good for me because it's less stress on my brain. I don't feel ready to forgive him 100 percent for what he's done and feel confident that it would never happen again, but I am feeling a little bit less like he's—I don't know, though. I don't know if I'm feeling this way because of anything he's doing or because of me just wanting to not think about it as much; thinking about girls he's talking to or whatever. Although, in the times we've been hanging out, he's been very conscious of the fact that even if I'm not asking to see his phone, if his phone goes off he'll be like, "It's just an e-mail I just got," and he'll check it and say, "Oh, look. It's just from this . . ." [00:27:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I can take a whack at the dream.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe one way of thinking about it is that there is this vibration all over the place of nurturing and romance, like the ring is in the frig behind the cheese. You were really excited in the dream that the ring was just how you would have wanted, like he's clearly thought of you and done something for you—and that's very exciting. He had come over the night before with soup and to take care of you—again a sort of nurturing, caring thing that's focused on you. That all seems like kind of a piece and you're excited that he got you this ring and to be engaged—again it was very supportive and nurturing of you. That's just the way you would want him to be, so I guess part one is imagining that that says something about what can feel very good in the relationship with him, the way that he can take care of you or look out for you or think of you or do things for you or be very supportive of or nurturing with you. [00:29:38] That's not the newest news ever, but maybe the dream sort of underlines or highlights the ways in which, when it's going well, that can be something that's very nice about being with him. Then there's the part (laughs) about him turning into a vampire, right? I guess I have a couple of ways of thinking about that. The first one is that maybe ["miss you" is his acronym; "getting drained".] (ph at 00:30:12) In a way that in a dream you're not quite aware of. It's not literally you and you don't see what's going on and you don't know that he was a vampire. Maybe that can be a lot of how it feels, like you're not always so aware in the moment of what he's taking from you or how drained you're feeling—or even how dangerous this can be. I don't mean as a beast, I mean how dangerous it can be for you. How much you give up or can not see how he's operating or how it can be draining in ways that you're not necessarily aware of in the moment that it's happening. That has a lot more to do with his needs. Like what's sustaining for him? [00:31:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really interesting that you say that because "drained" is literally the word that I've used during a lot of what's been going on. I haven't really even made the connection so I'm glad that you did. Yeah—that's exactly the word that I have been using. This is so draining. This is so draining on me to have to babysit his feeling and to have him be the martyr in this situation and I have to be the strong one, even though I'm the one that got fucked over in the first place. Yeah. That's a really interesting take on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's sort of like the nurturing side over here and the really draining side over there, and sometimes the draining side is hidden from you until later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the idea of, "Oh, God, Franklin. Not again." And then we have to run and I'm part of this whole thing and we're running and now I'm part of it and I have to stay with him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It blew everything up. [00:32:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It blew everything up and it's a whole lot of work that I'm having to put into it for this guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It sort of reiterates that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like what is this costing me? Monetarily or otherwise, which is a lot of what I've thought of. That's quite the succinct interpretation. Yes. That's interesting to think about. It doesn't really tell me much that I didn't already know. (both laugh) But it is interesting that the details of the dream itself were so clear in terms of how I remember it now that I'm awake—and hours later even. I'm still at the point where I'm not ready to give up on this, but I'm also not ready to put forth a whole bunch of effort because I feel like, yes, he's working on things to better himself and try to figure stuff out, but I'm still seeing similar patterns in terms of his inability to really commit to the things that are important. This art studio endeavor—I really don't know what to say about it. [00:34:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the impression that there's sort of more to the dream. There are a few things in your response to what I was saying that makes me think that. Another aspect—and again this isn't new; the dream just sort of points to it—maybe the vividness, especially as you said with the diamond and how it was so clear. I wonder if there isn't some wish fulfillment going on, not just in engagement and in the ring itself, but how clear you are in remembering that it's exactly what you want and is really nice. Finally, you're clear about all of that. The way that you're feeling actually quite muddled about it—you're confused, you're back and forth, you're not sure. [00:35:48] The dream is something that—this is a repeated theme—you can think literally of the clarity itself of the stone, but also how clearly you remember it and how clearly it's what you wanted. Also the vampire thing—what you said is, of course, funny, but maybe that's also making light of something that's not so funny in the relationship. When you think about it, a vampire in a dream could be any number of things. Sure, it could be funny and it is funny. It could be creepy. It could be scary. It could be gross, but it's funny. I would imagine there is a way that a lot of this is sort of tilting these things towards what you wish them to be. [00:36:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Imagining. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there you are lying in bed and he just brought you soup and it's so nice and it's nice to have him over. I guess that seems like it could stage a fantasy of how things could be really nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then I dream that he's acting literally like a blood-sucking vampire. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. I haven't thought of the draining aspect, like, "This is so draining. This relationship is so draining. Franklin is so draining." That's really actually interestingly spot-on. In terms of the idea of not being the jeweler, but me, that I can't really see and I'm not really there and it's only after that I'm like, "Oh, my God. Not again," which is kind of how things have gone. It's not until I'm knee-deep in it that it's like, "Oh, shit. This is really fucking retarded. This is awful." [00:38:11] Yeah, it is funny. I'm thinking of it more funny because I've never dreamed of someone I know being a vampire, so just the concept is kind of . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's just no way around it, it's . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's comical. It is. It's like a whole parody, but there is a—vampires are scary. Even though True Blood is humanizing them in this whole other way in a fantasized world in that show, even still they're scary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it points to the drinking a little bit, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Like you couldn't just stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's something that has a lot of resonance of something dangerous for you. That's scary, I think. [00:39:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But should I be like, "Ooh. That's so ominous. I should listen to my dream." What do I do with it? Now you've helped me have a nice, little interpretation of what could [] (crosstalk at 00:39:40) which is great and I definitely wouldn't have been able to break that down on my own, what do I do with that information?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me the dream sort of reminds you of or puts you in touch with ways that you feel and points of view that you have on things. Then you go from there. The question is what does it mean to you or what you do with them. [00:40:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: One thing that comes to mind is that it was so nice that he came over, blah, blah, blah. But not so fast—still be careful. I'm really flip-flopping all over the place with this whole situation, which I think is natural and I don't want to pressure myself to decide one way or another because I think either way it would be forced at this point. If I were to say, "Okay, it's okay. Let's just work on this," or if I would be like, "No. I have to give up." I just don't know how it's going to work out yet, but it does feel like every time I feel like he's taking two steps forward, then something like, "You're still drinking more than I think is appropriate or than even you think is appropriate," because even he, himself, said, "I don't want to be drinking this much." Or, "I'm going to rent a studio for $375 a month." [00:41:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you describe it today, I might be hearing "two steps forward and one step back", I don't know how many steps are in either direction, but certainly there was a good conversation and he was nice to bring over the soup and he took some responsibility in the conversation, which was not induced, or a plus on his side of this. That's a big deal, but it sounds like he's been drinking a lot and this studio space doesn't make any sense to you and then the other financial stuff at school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The way that I look at it is don't tell me one day that you're going to start saving all this money and you're going to get a studio apartment so you don't have to live with these awful guys anymore and all of this stuff, and then in the next breath say, "I found an art studio to rent to throw events at." [00:42:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing that strikes me is why this surprises you? He's been doing this . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I felt like he was starting to get on the right track. He was studying for his personal training, he said he was working with the school to figure out how to get that paid off. So I kind of felt like—wow. That's great. I see that that's not the case. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I feel like you told me he says things like that all the time, that he has plans for things that he might take a step or two towards and then they totally go by the wayside. [00:43:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think maybe it's just wishful thinking that this time it would be different because he's so dedicated to getting me back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There it is. It's wishful thinking but it winds up being draining.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. I love him so much and it's hard for me to reconcile those feelings with how frustrating and non-committal he is to the things that matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now but we'll talk more next week at our usual time. Feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully next week this will be gone. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. You, too.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey Catherine. Hi, how are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. I'm good, how are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm okay. I'm having one of those bad mornings, but— (Chuckles) So, I wasn't confused about the last week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I gave you a call, and we forfeited that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So don't worry, you're not going to be charged for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had the same issue with another patient who was going to start doing every other week, and I was confused as well. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, how was your week, or two weeks, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good, nothing really much went on, I'm feeling, so it's just been kind of, I don't know, I haven't any anxiety, or anything like that. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean "nothing much went on?" Did you do much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I finished off the winter semester at school. I went home— I only ended up going home one weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I went out with one my close friends, the one who lives in Michigan, and her boyfriend came down—this is like the second time I met him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were out in the city? 0:01:00.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: No this is in Joliet when I was home. And then, also, the girl who lives in the city and her boyfriend, so it was those four and me. But, it was just like a local bar-type place. So, that's really I feel like all that's — This week I haven't really been doing much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the weekend that you stayed in the city, did anything happen, or did you do anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No nothing really, I guess, went on. I just hung out with my roomie, like we went to Olive Garden.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was nice. But still, we need to— I know it's kind of a hard choice because I understand that you want to relax, and you want to take things easy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, it's still not really testing the limits, and—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. My birthday is coming soon, or something. I don't know, it's the 15th of March, and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm the 18th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And everyone keeps like— You're the 18th? Oh,wow!</p>

<p>My friend from Michigan is the 13th, so the weekend is in between our birthdays. And everyone is like, "what do you want to do?" And I'm like, I don't know. I don't even want to plan anything because when things don't work out, I get very frustrated if it changes, and that happens all the time. So I just— 0:02:12.2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in the past, when you've been planning stuff for your birthday, has that turned into a situation where you've had anxiety before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I've had anxiety, probably, on my past two, at least that I—I know definitely on the past two, I have had anxiety, and then I don't know about the fourth one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So much that you didn't enjoy the birthday, or the party?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, last year was my 22nd birthday, and we went to Grand Victoria with my family, and also my friend from Michigan, her mom, and she brought a friend. We all went together, like my brothers came, my parents, and my grandpa. So it was supposed to be all fun. I was with my family, too, and I had my roomie and then this other girl we're both friends with. And I had anxiety, and then I was very like I hate this birthday, like I don't know. 0:03:07.2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the anxiety has kind of ruined events for you, especially big birthdays.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And the one before that, I didn't even—we just ended up going to dinner, me and two friends, because I was like I don't even want to go out and be part of this because I had anxiety. So I was just like— So it was fine, I didn't have anxiety, but I would have wanted to do more, I guess, and I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. So when this birthday approaches, do you feel like, "oh, I just don't want to do anything at all," or, "I want to do something, but I wish I didn't have anxiety?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm kind of thinking I should just go home and go out to dinner with my family, but then I want to celebrate because I never really celebrated a birthday, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, you really didn't go buck wild on your 22nd.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want to plan anything. Like my friend Valerie, from Michigan, she texted me last night but then I answered her too late because she's a teacher, and she goes to sleep so early. So she didn't answer, but she was asking me what I wanted to do and then my roommate was like, "Oh yea, what do you want to do?" And I was like, "I don't want to plan anything because if things don't work out, then I'll be frustrated, and I won't want to go out." 0:04:20.2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there are two ways to go about this, right? There's the way that I could help you to practically do it so that you don't have to plan it and that someone else can plan it for you, and we could work out all these ways so that you can ignore what is going on and not get stressed out; or we could do it in a way where you do plan it, and you have to tell yourself rational things and really combat this anxiety.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I just feel like I don't know why I get so anxious when the plans change even if it's just like, "oh, we're not going to that place anymore; we're going to this place." I don't know, it just sets off like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you say about that? (Yawn)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry, I'm tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking when the plans change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess because of the anxiety, I would always mentally prepare myself for the situation—and then I guess even just the setting changing, then I don't know what to expect, I guess. It's like oh, I didn't expect this. 0:05:20.6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what if you didn't know what to expect, what would that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel— I don't know because I've been feeling much better; I feel like I haven't anxiety for awhile now. Well, I don't know "for awhile" but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you also haven't been doing much to start the anxiety.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I don't know, like right now, I can't even—I feel like I would have anxiety, I don't know if that makes sense, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay and that's good, but I still think that we need to talk about what you could potentially think about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If things changed, what would that mean, why would that be so upsetting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's hard to think about it when I have a rational mind. (Chuckles) I guess I do try and plan out every aspect, even to going home and how I'm going to get home. So if it changes then I'm just kind of—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like planning stops the anxiety?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or helps contain it? Knowing what's coming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yea, because I like to know exactly what is going to happen, exactly what the situation is going to be like. And I don't know, even if it's an anxiety provoking situation, it's still like I already know ahead of time what is going to come at me, I don't know. 0:06:36.4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you didn't know, what would happen, what was coming at you, it would be awful, or would it be kind of like catastrophic, or both?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess more like, oh no, what am I going to do?</p>

<p>(Loud Beep)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry for that.</p>

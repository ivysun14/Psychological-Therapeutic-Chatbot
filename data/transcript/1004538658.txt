<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully this will be the magic room and he'll just fall asleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how have you been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. I feel like today and yesterday has been coming out of kind of a low point, where I was having a little trouble with breast-feeding, starting last week. He had done really well with latching at the beginning, and then all of a sudden it felt like he wasn't latching correctly. Then I was having to pull him on and off, and I felt like all of our feedings were like battles, where he would latch on and it would hurt me and I would have to pull him off and keep going back and forth. Mostly it would happen at night, and I felt like — I would just cry. So it wasn't a good few days. Now I feel like yesterday all of a sudden — I tried this new little trick trying to get him to latch a little bit better, and since then I feel like that's helped a lot. (crosstalk) [00:01:00]</p>

<p>Then I've been going to a breast-feeding support group over at the Hospital. That's every Tuesday, so we went there this morning. So that's just nice to get —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Busy day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know. It's just been a big day for us. But it's nice to just get reassurance I think. (crosstalk) And it's so funny. The room was packed with moms. So it's nice. Yesterday morning was really when we finally figured out this new little trick to latch him, and since then it's just been such a relief, because it has been a tough few days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's hard, because I know breast-feeding takes up so much of the day when they're really little, and so to have that feel like a struggle — it's like time after time after time you're doing that, and it can get really frustrating and disappointing. [00:01:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly how I felt. I was like, "I'm doing something eight times a day, (crosstalk) but it's frustrating me and frustrating him." I was saying to Todd (sp?) too, I feel like I'm so glad that we're breast-feeding, but it's like this big responsibility I feel like on me, that I'm responsible for feeding him and making sure he's getting everything that he needs. I know there are backup plans, like we could do formula, or I could pump and use a bottle, but it does feel like there's this pressure, because I feel like I get a little bit more stressed out about worrying if he's eaten enough or not than Todd (sp?) has.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because Todd (sp?) has no idea, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So we've talked a lot about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't really have a way to measure, and Todd (sp?) definitely doesn't. But you're basing off if it doesn't feel like a good session then you're sort of making some (inaudible) inferences about, "Well is he eating enough? Or is he uncomfortable?" It is a big responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like that's been hard. It's been helping that Todd (sp?) and I have been talking a lot about it, and he's been so helpful with this. I know it must be hard for him too, because he's saying that he kind of feels helpless in all of this too, like there's nothing he can really do —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. He can't breast-feed for you. [00:03:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except try and support us. So that's helped to just make sure that we're talking about all of it too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you pumped at all? Have you tried a bottle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't. I've only pumped a little just because I — sometimes I'll get so full that I was worried that was the problem with him latching, that I was just so full. So I would pump a tiny bit. But I think that we will. They were recommending between four and six weeks that you start with a bottle. He'll be four weeks this week, which is crazy. So I think that will be good too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may be a way for Todd (sp?) to feel like he can participate, and also, it sounds like the latch thing is working a little bit better the past couple days, but if you do a session where you pump you don't have to worry about that. It can be a little bit of a break for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that will be helpful. It's amazing. I feel like because life is so consumed with breast-feeding right now, on one thing, when that's not working, I just felt like it was hard to get through those days, like it was weighing on me. Now it's one little thing, like "Oh, I think he's got his latch down," and I feel so much better. It's interesting. [00:04:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Life becomes very focused on something totally different than what it was before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think I just need — I think we were talking about this before, but the idea of getting into a routine and figuring out a pattern for him seems so reassuring. Now I'm realizing that once you have a pattern it's going to change to a new pattern. Everyone was talking about that this morning too. So I think I just need to relax a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the age range of the babies that were there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was — the youngest was nine days, all the way to — I think there was like a six-month-old there, and there were probably ten moms at one point, maybe even more because they ran out of chairs. Then last week I went to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're in good company. Lots of people are having some of the same questions, and feeling some of the same experiences. [00:05:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. I went with all these questions in my mind and I had to ask one of them, because other people had been asking. Last week there were three moms who started crying, so I went home and I was like, "So I'm not totally crazy." (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not the only person crying here. (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't even cry there. So it definitely is helping. One of my friends who has a 1-year-old now recommended that group because she went when she was having trouble, and it just makes sense to find other people who are —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. I think the biggest piece of going through any huge transition is finding other people who are feeling some of the same things you're feeling, and struggling with the same things you're struggling with, and questioning some of the same things. It's having support and finding someone who can understand, just to be able to talk about what it's like, because it's such a monumental — in some ways it's a monumental experience because it's so life-changing for you. In other ways, a good half of the world is going through this, or has gone thought it at some point. [00:06:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's funny to think that —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like commonplace and completely extraordinary at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That we think it's such a natural thing, but then it's so hard. It's really —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's both. It is a natural thing, and it's hard. And I think the setup of our society is so focused on the individual family that you don't get some of the same support and experience and exposure that in communities and cultures where women take care of children in groups, and you get so much more exposure to other women that have breast-fed before you, and your mom who may or may not have breast-fed you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: She did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's living with you. So she's not there to give that day-to-day support that if we lived in extended family groups you see a lot more. So you replace it with going to a breast-feeding support group, where you can get some of that same exposure and camaraderie and support. [00:07:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's really been helpful. My friend Stephanie who lives close by now, she doesn't work on Fridays, and she's come up the past two Fridays to have little play dates with us. She breast-fed too, so that's been really helpful. So I definitely feel like I am finding ways to get support.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're reaching out, knowing that you need to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it just is challenging, and I think when one thing goes wrong, I'll let myself get down on it. Todd (sp?) and I were talking about it. I feel like I'm an optimistic person, but when it comes to things with me that I'm in charge of I'll be pessimistic. And Todd (sp?) kept joking. He's like, "You're the optimist in this relationship. Why are you getting so down on that stretch of days where it just wasn't going well?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were your thoughts like? As you were sitting there and struggling to get the latch, what were you thinking? [00:07:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That same feeling of just, "I'm the one responsible for feeding him, and if this isn't going well he's not getting enough food, and then what does that mean?" I think that feeling of responsibility that is on me. And I know there are backup plans, but that I really want to make this work I think is putting pressure on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's look at some of those thoughts and see how you can modify them so that it doesn't become so catastrophic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know we're still figuring this out too. Even my mom has been saying that I'm the perfectionist, so of course I want to go in and be a perfectionist with breast-feeding, and I just don't think that's going to happen right away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is perfect for breast-feeding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I would want him to latch on perfectly and then — we've been talking in that support group that between 20 and 25 minutes is usually for average what a baby would need to nurse for to make sure they're getting enough, so that's what I would want. [00:08:59]</p>

<p>We do get that sometimes, so I know that I'm getting — I'm setting a high standard. But I think from what I hear, that's what I want to be able to do, and that kind of reassures me. But then even today they were saying — one mom was saying, "My baby only goes for seven minutes on either side. Is that okay?" And the woman, the lactation consultant was saying, "Yeah. Maybe she's really efficient." So I think I have this idea in my mind —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) finding a way to monitor what's working by the result rather than the process. If he's growing then he's probably eating enough. I know you're not going in for weight checks every day like you did when he was three days old, but it's also — the weight is not as — it's not sort of as volatile. When they're really little, when they're just born, and sometimes they lose weight, you really want to be on top of it. But he's already a little bit heartier, and you can always — there are actually places you can go and do a weight check that you don't have to go in to your doctor. Probably at your breast-feeding group they probably have a scale somewhere in that hospital. [00:10:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It must be somewhere, because it's not in the actual room. I think that's been the thing—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that might be a thing, like if you're going to go and you need to feel reassured, there's a center that has a lot of mother support type stuff. They will let you come in and weigh your baby at any time you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good to know too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So things like that. Then instead of nitpicking the process, you can be like, "Okay."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know he's gaining weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's gaining weight; then he's eating enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's been one thing that's weighing on me, because we had his two-week checkup — we did like a three-day checkup and then two weeks, but the two-week checkup was early, so instead of Thursday it was on a Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A big difference in terms of — [00:10:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So then it was that Monday to now we don't go again until next week. So I feel like there's been this long stretch. He gained almost a pound, so that beginning one was really good, but I think I was so relieved to know he'd gained a pound. Then to know now — we've had all this long stretch where his patterns, non-patterns have been ups and downs and nothing consistent, to now have to wait until next week to weigh him has kind of been weighing on me.</p>

<p>They did say we could bring him in for a weight check, but part of me was thinking I need to relax and not do that, because I kept thinking, "Oh as soon as I know he's gained weight, I can not worry as much about it." So it's been a long stretch to know that he is gaining weight, and just by looking at him I know he is. And my mom will come and be funny and hold him, and she's like, "Oh, he's definitely much heavier than the last time." (chuckling) So I think we're getting lots of reassurances.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So being able to sit a little bit with the idea that it's not going to — he might not follow that absolute typical pattern. I can tell you neither one of my kids ever nursed for 20 minutes. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're 7 and 5 1/2, so they've reached the critical stage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They've definitely grown. So it means figuring out what's normal for your baby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And not to just base it so much on the average that you hear about or read about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's made up of lots of (crosstalk) —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. A wide range. Yeah. So I feel like now that I've figured out — you know, we got through a hard part and figured out a strategy, and maybe that isn't going to work. Just the way I'm holding him has been — I changed that up a little bit. Now I'm feeling better, and I'm sure there will be a different change in a couple days, but —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's that trust thing again, being able to trust yourself that when what's working right now is no longer working, you can trust yourself that you'll come up with the next thing that works. You'll figure out the next pattern, or the next way to hold him, or the next thing to — whatever it is. A little bit of trust for yourself that you'll figure it out. [00:13:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me is — it's a good challenge too. I really want to get this down because breast-feeding is important to me, and I feel like eventually we will have it. My friend keeps saying — when I tell her now, "I'm holding him in this perfect way and trying not to move when he's on," she's like — I don't know what age her son was — she's like, "I would just throw him on and then I could text message and play games on my phone and read a book or whatever." So I know that —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when he gains head control and can hold his torso upright, he'll take a lot more control over it. Right now he's not able to do any of those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I know there will be this point where it will seem — we'll look back on this time and be like, "Oh wow, that was so hard, and now it's this thing that's coming so natural." So that will be good to get to that too. I feel like to have conquered something that feels really hard will be nice to get to that point. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're talking about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. He knows. So I feel like that has definitely been consuming me mostly. Then I do want to think more about switching those thoughts. Like Todd (sp?) was saying, that I'll let myself just think negative, negative, negative, which is just not like me. But I knew I was doing it. He was right, and I was catching myself doing it, and I think then I was almost going into the next feeding with a bad mindset, and being nervous, and thinking, "Oh I hope this is going to work this time." Especially the nighttime seems to be the hardest for me, when I get the most pessimistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much is he feeding at night? How often are you up? [00:14:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. Either two or three times at night, which isn't too bad. He's really good about sleeping in between feedings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it takes us an hour, hour and a half —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — to feed him, so by the time I put him back down, it's like maybe we have two or two and a half hours. But he went like a three-hour stretch from when he went back to sleep last night, so that's been nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's sad what we think is nice after a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pre-baby, yeah, I wanted you sleeping eight hours. Now three is —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I was saying to one of my friends. I was like, "We're getting two-hour chunks, and it's not so bad." And she's like, "Oh my gosh. That sounds terrible."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh how your standards change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I've noticed that he usually will do one around 11:00, so I've been trying to actually stay up for that one so it's one less that I have to get up for, because that's just the hardest part. Then it's just two, and I've been able to go back to sleep after — we'll do like a 6:30 or around 7, and usually I can get another nap in after that, which we think is funny that we're napping at like 8:00 in the morning. (chuckling) So that seemed to help. At first Todd (sp?) was like, "Oh, we should really try and go to bed," after that around 8 or 9 or 10 feeding. [00:16:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he getting up too when you get up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He'll usually get up to help me change him, and then he'll hand him off to me, especially now that he's back to work. I'm even saying, "Don't even worry about getting up to change him," but I think — especially during that hard stretch, I think he was just wanting to make sure we were all set. So he's been going to bed sometimes a little earlier than me, but I don't really mind trying to keep myself up for that later one, just because it's that one less time to have to get up. But I do notice it's the nighttime ones that seem to be the hardest to keep a positive mindset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Partly that might be because you're probably pretty tired at night, more so than during the day. And I wonder if he actually has a harder time at night because he's sleepy. [00:17:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. Then one of the lactation consultants too was saying that your milk production is like — either heaviest or lightest. I forget what she said. I think she said heaviest at night, so that's why I was feeling so full, (crosstalk) and he was having a hard time latching. So it's interesting that nighttime seems to be just a harder time than in general. But I do think now I'm in a better mindset, so I feel like if I can keep that going forward, and just know that it's okay when things change to just be more okay with going with the flow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has your mood been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like it's been okay. The idea of postpartum depression, like I was sharing with you before, is still definitely in the back of my mind as something I'm really worried about. My friend Stephanie — one of her good friends — we were like a month apart in our due dates, and I'm not that close with her but I just know her through my friend, and we've known each other for a long time — has had a hard time with depression, so that's kind of now like, "Oh, Elizabeth (sp?) has had a hard time with this." Now it's someone tangible that I know. [00:18:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it feels very real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I was saying to Todd, (sp?) I don't feel sad for no reason. It's almost reassuring that I've been upset and crying about this breast-feeding, but it's for a reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're upset over a particular thing. You're not just feeling upset and not knowing. That makes a big difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So in a way I was like, "It kind of makes me feel better to know I'm crying over him not latching than just crying for no reason." I definitely have a reason for why I was crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels focused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the fact that you noticed a definite change in your mood when there was a difference in this specific problem. That also can feel reassuring, because if it was depression you wouldn't feel the range that you felt. Being able to feel so relieved and feel more optimistic when something changed might not be present. You might feel just like a more — one of the hallmarks of depression is the consistency of feeling badly, rather than — mood fluctuation in response to an event is normal. [00:19:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Then that makes me feel better, because I feel like I'm super aware of it. Talking to Todd I feel like he might not even be sharing with me how aware he is of it, like just trying to keep tabs on me, making sure I'm like myself. But I don't feel like I've been sad for no reason. It's felt okay. But it's definitely in the back of my mind of just something to be aware of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think if something is really wrong you will notice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's what you said last time too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't want you looking for things, because you don't — not that looking for it is going to make you depressed if you're not depressed, but you also don't want to preoccupy yourself with worry about something that's not there. You are very in touch with yourself. [00:20:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For better or worse. Maybe too in touch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of your strengths too though, that you're not going to miss it if it's there. And other people are checking up on you, so you can kind of let go and be with what is, knowing that you've got good support that would probably call you out on it if [they're noticing] (ph) something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. I feel like there are those things in my head that I was, even when I was pregnant, like worried about that would be hard for me in terms of just being anxious that haven't come true, which is really nice, but I don't even want to keep thinking about them. It was the idea of the depression, or sleeping was another thing I was worried about. I was having so much trouble sleeping and wondering would that carry over, and that hasn't been a problem at all. I can fall asleep no problem. [00:21:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exhausted enough to fall asleep when you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But that's kind of in the back of my mind of, "Oh, I hope that doesn't come back." And even like the checking things that I finally don't have to do anymore, like checking that door that I used to do —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've let go of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I remember being pregnant and worrying like, "I hope I don't find things with the baby that I'll have to check." I haven't let myself do that at all, and I feel like that's been really good, but that's another thing like, "Oh I hope that doesn't happen down the road," though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have control over these things. Rather than hoping that they're not going to happen, trusting yourself that you're not going to let them become obsessions or compulsions to check, that you have some control over what you fall into, what patterns you create for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like with the — I don't know — I don't want to think of something I would check, because I'm not checking anything, but I think a difference is that Todd (sp?) and I are doing this together, so it's not just me too. [00:22:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not all responsible for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's been such a better feeling, whereas with the door when I'm — or at least thinking that, "Oh I'm coming home late and I'm the last one coming through the door."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that this is really a shared endeavor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just keep thinking of it that way, so that's kind of a nice way to not worry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so if he doesn't need to check something, you don't need to either. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's those things I feel like have been a relief that it hasn't bothered me, that that feels really good, and I just try not to even let myself think about it too much, because I don't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you don't need to go there. They're not useful thoughts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you're doing really well. Clearly you're managing to get out all by yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. This is a monster of a stroller, but yeah, it's been good, and I'm so glad we talked last time about getting out with Todd (sp?) to kind of be practicing lifting everything. [00:23:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now it feels like old routine, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Getting there. Todd (sp?) actually came home for lunch, so he drove us here. But I'll have to take this on the bus home, which I've done once before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the only part that's — you have to kind of rely on the goodness of others to kind of help you lift the stroller, but I used to do that when I saw moms with strollers, so hopefully —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the karma will be repaid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's a big lesson, letting yourself be helped by people, letting someone hold the door for you, letting someone help you get the stroller up the stairs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does feel good to be able to get out. Just getting out really makes a difference for me too, like I make sure I'll go for a walk or something. But now knowing that we can go places without needing anyone too — it's nice to be with Todd (sp?) and to go places with Todd (sp?) —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you've been able to get to things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's felt really good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have your independence. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's been — the past couple of weeks when he was home, he was driving me to the breast-feeding group, but then this morning he drove us and I went home from there with the stroller. It's hard to manage everything. That felt really good. I was like, "Okay, this is awesome that we can just — we're able to get to and from places now on our own," which feels really good. Besides just doing little walks and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you just keep venturing a little further out trying something new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's nice that physically I'm feeling better too, to walk a little further than before. Because before I was kind of doing like circles close by our house. So that's been good too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel physically? I imagine that you're somewhat tired.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, tired, but again even I feel like that has been helpful to know from before when I was having trouble sleeping, that I wake up tired and know that I'll be okay to get through the day, or that I can take a nap or whatever. So that's been —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might not feel great, but —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But (crosstalk). I feel like I'm really looking forward to being able to exercise again. Because I've been doing walks and stuff, but I know that I don't want to push it either with just a month being done. I have a six-week checkup with my OB, so I feel like then I can really — [00:25:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll get the go-ahead. As long as everything is healing properly, you'll probably get the go-ahead then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because that's been one thing — I can just feel my body aching to really move, you know. And especially with breast-feeding. Usually I'll feed him on our couch, or we have a little chair in his room, and it's just so much time sitting on our couch. I'm sick of watching TV. I turn the radio on sometimes, but I'm not used to watching that much TV and just sitting on a couch so much. So that's been interesting too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's probably very safe for you to sit, do a lot of stretching, things like that, especially — I know last time you mentioned just feeling stiff from having to position yourself to feed him. And letting yourself stretch a lot — lay down flat on your back to get just a difference from the sitting position. [00:26:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things like that to give yourself some relief. You can even lay him down on your chest and lay on your back. He's doing tummy time and you're getting a different position, and it might feel good for your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's a really good idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of an easy way to start easing into stuff like that. Totally safe for you to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. We got a big exercise ball too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, those are good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been nice to bounce him on it. We were thinking —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he usually like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it was funny because we were thinking, "Oh, when I go into labor it will be nice to have, because we'll have all this time at home," and we didn't have any time at home. But that will be nice to start using that too I think. The stretching I haven't been doing a ton of, so I should try that out with him too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you're focused on lots of other things, but it might be a way to — before you're able to do more vigorous exercise, it can feel good just to move in different ways and not be hunched up in the same nursing position all the time. [00:27:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything else we should catch up on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's everything. I think it's funny that I don't even bring up school anymore. It's so nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're not in it yet. This is a good break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I am going back. Our last classes are kind of spanning over the end of this week and beginning of next week, so I'm going to try and go back, and I might bring him. My sister is on vacation this week and my mom is on her school vacation next week, so they are probably going to come down and help us. It'll be nice to just check back in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And see people and connect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Then two of them I'm doing — we have presentations that everyone will be giving, but I'm just kind of giving an update, but it's kind of funny because I feel like I haven't thought at all about school, so it will be weird to even give an update on my projects.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A totally different mindset. Do you remember what your projects are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which it will come back to you. When you get in that head space I'm sure it will all come back to you. [00:27:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I think I will kind of need to get back into it a little bit, and it will be funny for me I think to be thinking about school again. It will be nice that I really only have to think about it for this next week and a half, and then I can have the summer. I do want to try and get work I need to finish over the summer done relatively soon, just so it's not hanging over me, because I really want to have that time this summer to not think about school at all. I think we'll have some time, because Todd (sp?) will be able to take a lot of time in June off, and we'll go up to Canada with our families I think. That way we can just hand him off to the grandparents, and I think that (crosstalk) we can get some work done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you guys are doing really well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We actually didn't save any time to do deep breathing and relaxation, but maybe during the next nap you can do some for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, yeah. And he did fall asleep, so that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He looks very peaceful. That's great that he can fall asleep by himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Really nice. We've been keeping little socks on him though. I need to figure out how to clip his nails.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh the nails are so hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We tried like nail files and everything but (inaudible). [00:29:08]</p>

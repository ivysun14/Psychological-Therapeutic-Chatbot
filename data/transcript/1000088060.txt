<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>The same flawless and superb therapist who brought you interviews zero through nine, one through nine, now brings you interview 10 of client 0426002 yield (ph) number 111. That's right. Interview 10 of client 0426002 yield (ph) number 111. 

</p><p>PATIENT: We had real nice interview.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I was (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) (laughter) I feel much better after, you know, while I was there and (inaudible) I can see why folks can't (inaudible) to do this. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I know I was quite agreeing with him, I think that my dad was too interested in making money. That...

</p><p>PATIENT: But it made sense...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Why didn't the boys need to get hired, he wouldn't stop to take care of the dog. (laughter) But these (inaudible) I guess, anyway. And I kind of, I feel sorry for him, really. You know because I think that he feels that that he expects me to leave with something when I'm done. You know? I just feel that he fells that that's only reason that he wanted you and I to [have the interviews] (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (inaudible at 44:42)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I - he obviously doesn't know any of this. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, to think that that's why he thinks that way. He must be so used to looking (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Do you think to that as is seen as mercenary and selfish is (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And I mean that's kind of sad that he doesn't even know it. And here has been for 18 years back or 50 years and, well I wouldn't, I mean if I thought that's what my parents wanted, I think I'd do just the opposite. I'd spend it all or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But he's got to be like that. You know, he's just got to do it, I guess. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean that's just the way he's programmed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. But I think everybody in that era was. Make some money and... You know but I think that's, that's what most of the kids who's parents would be my parents, they're gripping about. You know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Only I kind of feel sorry for them, for them. Because they obviously, they had to make some money for basic (inaudible at 45:45) that we always hear about. You know. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it sounds like you (inaudible) worry about sort of historically you understand how it is when they're used to waking (ph) you (inaudible) grew up and these kinds of this would happen to them. But it also sounds that it's been like, your transit (ph) view that (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No really, [I'm sitting here] (ph) I don't really think it upsets me. I just kind of feel sorry for him. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He was so proud of his boys, that they wanted him to enjoy the money that they, they didn't need any parenting. And it's really kind of sad that he would have to have to say that. You know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I would fell like he's really missed something. But he doesn't really know people. And maybe he has enjoyed making money on it, you know, but it just, it doesn't seem that important leaving your kids money. You know, because that's the raw (ph) I work, it is money (inaudible) I mean it would be nothing like what Jim and earn, but then I know how it is, because I always felt like we were poor. And now I want him [to make] (ph) money and I begin to question that. I mean is that - is that all there is to life? You know, surely there must - I mean there's got to be a head of this, because this can't be all. Not worth it, really. (pause) Get up and go to work and come home and watch TV, or whatever you do, and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And they go to bed (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: It is not true (inaudible). It gives me new hope that there is something after this. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you need me to tell him?

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter)

</p><p>PATIENT: [Rapid here they died and something huh.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Yes, I would think that something was planned for us. It's not that wretched, but it's not all that great either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes

</p><p>PATIENT: So

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 47:44)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what I was treated poorly. I've made a (inaudible) novel and I think that's really true. I expect something, a grand, all the time. You know and I don't - I don't like it hum drum. You know, sometimes I think boy I'm really selfish. And then other times I think I'm not so bad. I guess I'm - it depends on how I feel that day, what I think of myself. You know if I'm tired and I'm grouchy with the children, I think I'm really a rotten mother and I don't want to be a mother. I don't want to be anything else, but don't want to be a mother. I don't want them around me, you know. But its - but then other days it's better. You know, if I have enough rest it's all right, I guess. And sometimes I get, you know, proud of the little things. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you think.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I'm just an average, normal housewife that gets upset, sometimes. But then - then we were talking last time, and I do believe that as far as our sex life goes, I really expect things that happen in novels, you know. Where everything is romantic and these women just fiddle around all day doing what they want to do and they don't, you know, like you'd always be in the mood if you had nothing else to do. But you know I'm going to walk through the rose garden, or whatever, but the garden is in me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Like all sounds like (inaudible at 49:22) the problem with your sex life is you have to many every day concerns.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I think the problem with my sex life is that I feel like I have too many every day concerns. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: That I feel like I everything has to be going just...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Perfectly before I'll ever, and I just cannot ever get into the mood by anything that Jim says. I have to be in the mood and be the aggressive one or it's just nothing ever happens.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't, I don't know how to change that, even though I say to - you know, and finally, you know, it dawned on me that this what I've that's it's supposed to change. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Knowing it isn't enough?

</p><p>PATIENT: No (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then it's kind of like what's not, what gets you admit to rough is not, you have liked for 34 years of your life. It's like things to fit into the average everyday life of a normal housewife. And these things shouldn't tie you up the way that they do. Like you could be able to enjoy sex. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like something without you, but how do you even picture (inaudible at 50:32)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it's (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like individual, you know how (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well there's always something I'd rather be doing, maybe reading, just watching TV. But this, is just getting so nice, but you know it's feeling like I want to get in bed (inaudible). It's like he's trying so hard.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well I do, but I want to climax, I don't want just have intercourse.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: I want - I want to get something out of it and (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not certain you're feeling guilty (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I'm beginning to, well, like I should fake it, or something, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: For him?

</p><p>PATIENT: For him. Because he's just trying everything that he can think of or read about or do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: He thinks I'm trying to be romantic, because everything (inaudible at 51:50) (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And not matter what he does it's never (inaudible) sex on you and (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like he's having sex on you for him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hum. Well at least for him it's not (inaudible). (pause) You know he said one night, well concentrate on what you doing, and didn't even - I don't even know what I'm supposed to be concentrating on. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know exactly (inaudible at 52:54)

</p><p>PATIENT: You know I felt that I could reach a climax if I concentrate, and I didn't know what to, you know, how to work the parts to be thinking about.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What have you done (inaudible) doing that would let you climax.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But I don't know how to do it, I guess. (pause) We've been talking about the fantasies that go along with masturbation and I've been trying to think, you know, how that would affect me. I mean I haven't (inaudible) trying.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Trying to have fantasies?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, trying to see what effect that would have on me while you were having intercourse, (pause) you know, with a real person.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, I don't understand, just trying to - you've been trying to...

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean I've been trying to think these things out. You know,

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: Think about them a little.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why I'm not curious how it was (inaudible at 54:32)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I wondered if, well I wondered where the fantasy set in.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's sort of like I - I don't know about - but I was thinking that there is sort of built in when people masturbate. I would presume that everybody has fantasies at some sort (ph) and how that relates to them having intercourse with a real person.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm wondering if that somehow includes living up to a fantasy.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. That's not it. If there's some - in my fantasies, the people are old and fat and ugly. You know and I have give up, you know, like I am, you know, by comparison of course one of the beautiful people. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So then it sounds like maybe something like you don't come off - you don't cut (ph) as good a figure in real life in comparison as you do in your fantasies. And maybe that's, that has something to do with (inaudible at 55:39).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well there must be a reason why he's and the people are, you know, old and fat (laughter), you know, instead of a handsome debonair fellow that you would think of.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) that seems significant to you but you don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I - I would say that obviously that's, that is, you know, how I want to be dominant. (pause) Or at least be beautiful next to those fellows.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. See it doesn't, the way your saying is not (inaudible) dominance your not a typical (inaudible) I'm not sure that (inaudible) being, I don't know, superior or something like...

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like were to see the picture I'd say, oh yes, she's beautiful and he's ugly. It doesn't sound like dominance, but maybe there's some (inaudible) or maybe that's not how being dominant (inaudible), I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's, still it's like the same thing I said, you know, like anything real life. That I still feel with men, you know, that I would turn them on and that was it. And it's, and it's just, you know, like my whole life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Whole life you've felt dominated or trying to dominate.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or I'd do something that kind of re-groves (ph) my feelings and let them display theirs.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of luring, sort of (inaudible at 57:22).

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know where I want them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pluralized but (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: right and (inaudible) rock.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, it was always my eyes, well I...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: I can remember movies by starlight that, you know, I mean those towns were the only movies I remember, where there was a queen or a princess and all the men were displayed. (inaudible) she had a good thing going there. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you always thinking about (inaudible) (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't really, even, you know, now with Jim trying so hard, that's not really what I want. I would just... (pause) (inaudible) but I won't admit it. I mean it just can't work in a marriage that just won't work. I mean some, he's going to be so frustrated and so, you know, like he's just almost desperate now. He'd do anything to help and [you're thinking to help] (ph). (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that (inaudible) I have him against the ropes and I don't like it. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if that's the way you would describe our situation, it's not, you know, I'll say what anything I'm saying, it's just so that he wants - he wants it to work. So for me, that he - he would probably do anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Anything?

</p><p>PATIENT: He would if he thought it would work. (pause) But he's still like he shouldn't have to put up with all of this. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that like you shouldn't have to have trouble responding (inaudible at 59:47) or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Or he should be able to get into bed with his wife and enjoy intercourse. (inaudible) It's just a simple little thing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really think.

</p><p>PATIENT: Doesn't feel (ph) (pause) Well is there a place where I dreamt (ph) (inaudible) around here, or is that the only one in the city? Something more (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Than (inaudible at 1:01:13) (pause) I don't know of any place with like massive (inaudible) the only I can think of along those lines is stuff that they do (inaudible) call around (inaudible) they assume things like (inaudible) your not (inaudible) climax, sort of anxiety and try to get to (inaudible) they weren't who you thought (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I, yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Where's, I'm not, I'll have to find out (inaudible) (pause) Okay, it sounds like, from that question (pause) that you see the problem as being very much (pause), very much tied in, or very much like sex will, like it sounds like the way your looking at it, the problem right now is almost like a physical thing, or something you kind of removed from everything else. Like the problem is you can't have climax. (pause) You may want to check that out (inaudible) talking about [audio gap at 1:03:22 to 1:03:30] (inaudible) from what we've been talking about. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I would say probably, but I don't know where to go, I mean, you know, what to think about anymore. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It sounds like you feel like you've exhausted all of that and you know you've (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well the thing is, I think that Jim says that he - well I thought I should be given a little more time to kind of work things out. I mean he's just expects me to produce, you know, after we've talked about something and kind of decided, well may that, maybe that's it. You know, then he expects me to climax. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well it's sort of like, well you now you understand why you did that stupid thing, so now come across.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well he's not that wild about it. I didn't think (laughter).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's not that what?

</p><p>PATIENT: He doesn't say it like that. (pause) But, like in the last month he has tried to be more understanding. When I first came here, he was (inaudible) fit. But his attitude has changed so and mine is still the same in the bedroom. You know although I do try harder. And I don't look disgusted when he approaches me, so. (pause) But I haven't, you know, let go up here, something. I don't know what it is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:05:27) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, some - I think something is keeping me from climaxing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well the way (inaudible) from what you just it sounds like (inaudible) is keeping you from wanting to even start in with him. Like, like he comes over to you and okay, so you don't look disgusted, but the invitations from what you've said, that I thought you meant was, but I still have the same feelings. Get away from me. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't. You know, but it's more I'm trying to please him now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And before I had, I just finally decided it wasn't going to do any good, so why even try.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And now I'm coming back, so okay I'm going to try, you know. And he wants to be (inaudible) but it's so frustrating for me now. You know, not to be able to climax. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So frustrating because you want to climax for him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, no, not for him, for me. Now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were saying now you pay attention, pay so much attention to what he wants. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, when he wants to go to bed, I - I am willing to go to bed. But I want to climax. (laughter) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well for him too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:06:49) but it is for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And I feel like, really the other pounds that I had, the clothes that were big and I'd become the more, be easier than it is for me to pass off what Jessica Fennson (ph) said. You know and I just really don't get upset like I used to about what she was doing or any of them. And I don't, I don't feel like I have to get involved because I have something more now, that I didn't used to have. And when Jim was such a, such a dick to me, it was like they were my only contacts with civilization because he would never talk to me. And that - and other than him I had just the girls. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And my (inaudible at 1:07:35) you know, so I feel much better about myself. You know, because he's paying more attention to me and he's talking to me a lot (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's treating you like a human being, and adult human being. He's giving you a kind of strength and validity that (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I really, I mean I can see that when he's attacking myself in a, you know, that she's got problems too and it doesn't get to me like it did. And another thing that helped greatly was while I was away; there was still the screaming and the hollering down there anyway. You know, which kind of proved that there were trials that be instigated. You know (laughter). I mean it wasn't just all roses, well I had been [yell out of the psych house] (ph). You know, and now, you know I feel like...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're vindicated. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, well my daughter has anyway. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't feel the need to go down and just pitter-patter with her since I've been back. You know, I haven't seen her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And about some how you are free of her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And not just her, all of them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, I mean I can be pleasant and visit with them and, but I don't feel quite like I'm missing something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well they something together that you don't have. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Or that if I'm upstairs and they're visiting downstairs I'm wondering what they're talking about or I always feel like I'm missing something doing my work or, you know, or reading a book or something. But I don't anymore. I feel like it's probably not worth going down and visiting about anyways. And I really feel much better about them. I don't know, maybe it was just cleaning the [basket here] (ph at 1:09:33), my money's just like (inaudible). (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Afraid you would be so.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you see yourself as having fun on their every word (inaudible) really terribly concerned about what they said and terribly concerned if you weren't involved some (inaudible). You have to be...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But I mean, I look back and I see how silly one day they were discussing (inaudible) and I wasn't included in the conversation. I don't, you know, (inaudible) but, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But at the time you were really probably (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, but (inaudible) but I didn't know what to say. But even anything they discuss now, I don't feel like I have to come down or that - and I used to be before I went, you know, away for my solitude that I felt if I missed a Tuesday night bridge party it was, you know, the end of the world. And I'm not going tonight because I can think of something I'd rather do. You know, with the family and it's really much better than to be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like much stronger and less frenzied (ph) your both part of your family. Does it feel good to announce with them (inaudible) the girls.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (pause) And if I've been (ph) too far in feeling that way, I don't have to come back for a refresher. (laughter) You know, that all of my real problems are satisfying my husband and myself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you (inaudible at 1:11:15)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) in all that I do. I don't think that it'll stop (inaudible) together, but I don't want to be half normal. But I'm so much better about it that I don't - and I was - I'd been that way, you know, ever since I can remember. I was always afraid I was going to miss something. I would go to a party or a ball game I would be so tired I could hardly see.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) like always just a hair's breath away from being on the outside looking in. And how do I desperately need to be in on everything because if you missed out on one thing you would really miss it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And you know, since we've been here we've - I had to go someplace one night even when Jim didn't feel good and we went out (inaudible) and he, you know, I really kind of coerced him into going. And I got there and it really wasn't any fun, and I would have been much happier if I'd gone home and gone to bed. You know, but I think now I can do that. Where I could not have done that before. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I would have, you know, had a miserable day wondering what went on. And now I, you know, it kind of dawns on me that it doesn't make one damn bit of difference what went on. It wasn't that important anyway.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:12:41)

</p><p>PATIENT: But yes. And another thing, Jack, I don't know what came first, but my mother says, oh yes, you're just like your dad. And my dad is just like that. He really is. Because it...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Being (inaudible) feeling on the outside (ph). Just like what?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like he took us out to eat when he had strep throat, but he should have been, you know, in bed. But he didn't want to miss it either. You know, and he wouldn't say, well we won't go. And think both mother and I would understand, but, you know, it we had (laughter) he'd been laying around all week and (inaudible) but he can't do that. And I never could either. And I just know, I, well I guess I don't just know. But I think it, it is from old (ph) feeling on me. You never know quite how you're going to accept it because of the, of these things (ph). You know, and even though were both have our [teeth clean] (ph) I think we both kind of, it's just a throw back to the days when we were people pointed at you and, and you weren't, maybe accepted. And now, you know, it's like you have key to the Playboy Club. You can get in. Even, you know, maybe you don't even want to go, but you go just to prove to yourself that you are acceptable and you can get through the door.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you've tried to (inaudible at 1:14:05), like when I started getting (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, (laughter) to see if you're going to make it again. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A result of (inaudible) it's almost like the last time (inaudible) something really mattered this time.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it really didn't matter. Maybe that's why, because you went and it was boring. And all the people there with their nice (inaudible) were a bunch of poors (ph) too. (inaudible) just average normal people. I ought to bring my dad here. (laughter) He maybe could relax a little more in his old age. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I've been feel better that goes out, it's that (inaudible) is putting himself just through this. But even then I could understand because I know just how he felt. But he doesn't know. And everything that he says right then has been for everyone else's approval. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you didn't go out, you (inaudible) like it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well maybe there was something going on at the club that night that wouldn't hear of.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They would want that.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) you know, maybe nobody knows who he is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) your protection of him is (inaudible) someone's not going to like him if [you out] (ph) if you or people at the club. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well they need to, I don't know [what we think] (ph) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well they need just to feel like you've missed something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I think it's sad that we just wouldn't want to mingle (ph at 1:15:55). (pause) You'd think I'd be (inaudible) that week I was there when he was still hiding the (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Down here (inaudible) potentially (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't even, and it's not even getting himself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) it isn't that it's potentially important, it's just that he'd damn near kill himself rather than admit anything.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No matter how trivial. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) clearly.

</p><p>PATIENT: And he all - and he says the same thing about me, you know, you'd go to a dog fight in a sewer plant. I've heard many times. (laughter) And I always would, but I think now I can control myself. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the child who just won't go to bed as long their dad won't want to.

</p><p>PATIENT: We haven't. We never did more. I mean, we would stay up and stuff where all the [new days] (ph). But nobody ever forced us to go either. They suggested it kindly. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then let it drop.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. (pause) You know I could really see why people think I'm so much like my dad. Because I am. And now I would (inaudible) learn to relax. Maybe that's why he has took up (inaudible). Maybe it's not until even later (inaudible) know what else to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounds like. Also (inaudible) nervous, your so something. There's all that pushing [fires in] (ph) and no place to put it (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that's very important, but (pause) but I could have, you know, when I did talk to my mother about, you know, are going to give me a kiss, that we were not an affectionate family. And we were told, that we are so awkward when we meet each other. And she says, well I never no - I never knew you wanted to be, in fact we always thought you didn't. And that's why she stopped. You know, so it's really ironic, you know, what you're thinking for other people and it's a bit of anybody saying, well you is this (inaudible) I'll just kind of draw back into yourself. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Assume that you don't want have somebody to (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:18:27)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Never and I guess you kind of like a never test it out. You never say anything.

</p><p>PATIENT: Never, nobody ever says anything. (pause) But I'm - that's not even our family. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) the world.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the world. Nobody's really vocal (pause) at, you know, you just need to talk sometimes. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But anything you do about people, (inaudible at 1:19:08)

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm just not used to it, but I don't think I do anymore. I, I don't know, I haven't been tested, you know, to see whether I'll be offended by something that someone inadvertently has done, you know. Them not meaning it, you know, a slight (ph) or something. Recently, I haven't been tested. I didn't fill (ph) up very good before. But I think (inaudible) a little bit there. I don't think it would bother me. You know, so that you'd think about it all, you know, through the whole day, and well what did they mean by that. And it really feels good, you know, much better about life, people even.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes I have sort of a question (inaudible) in the back of my head, and I hear (inaudible) anything to answer, but let me (inaudible). It sounds like you experience, I'm not sure where the questions is but (inaudible). It sounds like you experienced something very important is having shifted for you, you know, to your home. I'm not, I guess my question is, is that so?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it was sort of like I had time there, you know, where when I'm with Jim all the time and he's kind of pushing me, I don't have time to think about anything. And I didn't have a lot of time, like to think. But I noticed that my actions towards the, all of the people that have always been friends were so much different than it usually is. You know, like I - you'd have to live in that place to believe it. It's (inaudible) the things that go on there, (laughter) you know, but you don't know because you never lived in a small town. 

</p><p>It's just like a taken (ph) place. Somebody is always running around with somebody else. And, you know, their illegitimate children, all over the town. It's only about 3,000. And then kids - it's so wild there. And I would - I think had I lived there I would say, you know, isn't that town, well we'll see what they're doing. And I thought, you know, I begin to feel sorry for some of these people that are really trapped there. And we never - my folks have a neighbor girl who is on the farm all day long with two little girls and the people are complaining about her being on the telephone all day long. And I'm trying to say, look how lonely this girl must be. You know, and all of my attitudes towards these people are, you know, we're much more sympathetic than I would have, say last year. And well, wouldn't you think she'd get off the phone, you know, and attend to her own business (laughter), you know, something derogatory.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And this time I felt more sympathetic and (inaudible at 1:22:13) they're fault. You create, I mean it was really so obvious why they were doing these (laughter) things. I think of myself stuck on a farm with two little kids from morning until night and I wouldn't [sell a pass] that good as she did.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. But it sounds like one thing that would happen for you, like being able to, like when I'm having a clearer notion of someone's (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then other people like making sense to you, so it's (inaudible) oh yes, I'm like, like that. Yes my father's like me that way. Yes that girl...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. You can, yes, you can just see all of these. I don't, maybe it's the quiet, do you suppose, after the hustle and bustle of the city (laughter). You have more time for people out there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No.

</p><p>PATIENT: I wouldn't have, I think had I not come to therapy, you know, it kind of found it talks about myself. But it's so - it's so easy to criticize people. You know, did it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thinking about what they're about,

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: or thinking about how they're like you can...

</p><p>PATIENT: Or why they're doing these things that everyone thinks are crazy, and maybe, you know, maybe it is. But you at least know why they're doing it, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like they have some conventionality to them. Sort of gaps their (inaudible at 1:23:27) they're not just annoying abstractions, but they're lonely. (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: That whole town (pause).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you've seen it through, but

</p><p>PATIENT: Well he was stuck.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sodom and Gomorrah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, it is so pathetic, and said, mother isn't there anyone around here that's deeper? You know because probably wouldn't even speak [to get], you wouldn't want to hear about them, would you? (laughter) I guess that's true.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like your new re-interest in the (inaudible) time.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) I mean why would I want to hear that someone, you know, (inaudible) stay home and minded their own business. That wouldn't be nice.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: As you pour in your...

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) But, you know, and I can't even, like, well I guess I can, you can even see why people would run around in a small town any (inaudible) town. You know after what Jim and I have gone through and are still going through. Yes. They might have much worth (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I - I don't really think

</p><p>PATIENT: Well they're, you know like...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you've wanted to run around, and your problem hasn't been that bad. So imagine you were pregnant.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think it maybe it would be more convenient to run around it (inaudible), Wisconsin, than it would be in New York. I don't, no, I don't think, I haven't ever wanted to run around, but I could sure see how it would happen. (pause) There's, you know, like if you don't, I'm not that wild about men in general. Why would I want another one? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, like you already know grief with the one you have.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) I would just like to get straightened out with just one man, instead of a bunch of them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:25:19)

</p><p>PATIENT: Do you know a guy name Kanter (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Psychology, I think he studied, but I'm (inaudible) Psychology at the NYU.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I've heard the name, but it needs used in the context (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) no I don't.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's really (inaudible) small world.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I think I needed that (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) refreshed

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You also sound like you feel like this (inaudible) sounds like you feel longer and less (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel much better about my place in life (laughter). Thank you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

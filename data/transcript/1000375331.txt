<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: We are going to stay at my parents' house for two or three days together and then he's going to go to Chicago by himself - probably. I can always change my mind. That means I will have time with my parents - be able to talk to them and also be able to...he and they will be able to react together - sort of reacting through me. I can find out how that's happening and what's going on there which should be really good. I think they've had a year to acclimatize themselves and I hope they've grown up a little. I am a little apprehensive about it but I am kind of looking forward to it - it should be nice. We had a really strange evening Saturday. Basically - it was kind of my fault - because I have a habit of taking an evening - or one particular night, or one day - saying, "This is it; this is my big excitement of the week - this is going to be fantastic." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that really being true? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, just kind of building it up and expecting it to fulfill certain things, certain kind of romantic notions. Sometimes that works out and sometimes it doesn't and when it doesn't it is pretty ridiculous and it is pretty awful. I really get very uptight and that's what happened Sunday. I felt kind of ashamed afterwards because it really wasn't my fault - I shouldn't do that sort of thing. It is childish really, I think. It just ruined a perfectly good evening: it started out on the wrong foot and I just didn't let it get back. I was just so mad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you do that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't know. I think a certain degree, a certain amount of it is kind of wished fulfillment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to have things be as exciting as (inaudible 2:53). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I am kind of expecting it to be decided that it is going to be this arbitrarily. 0:03:03.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, not just that you want things to be that exciting but that this is going to be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not going to let yourself be disappointed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We're going to set this up in such a way that it's going to be fine and it is going to be just lovely. It will be this enchanting evening and we will have this fantastically good time, where we can go and do whatever, and we can go and do what we want and be totally relaxed, and there won't be a hassle about money. We will just go out. It's ridiculous. There are times when I can be down and there are times when I can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you should be more discriminating about when you...? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that it either happens or it doesn't - it's not something that can be put in the head. It's not something that I should sit and think about all week and build up - it just may not come through. It's just a matter of circumstances. Usually what happens is that I build up these hopes and if my dream picture is not met at any degree I become very pouty about the whole thing and then I deliberately wreck the rest of the evening and that's really dumb. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are really two kinds of things: there is the thing about how you should be thinking during the whole night - building up into things - and that's what happens, saying you haven't made it, by saying you still have some of those dream things around - and how to deal with that when it doesn't come through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I deal with it very badly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How...why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually what happens, I get really pissed with Murphy as if it were his fault, which it usually isn't, or sometimes it is but, I mean, that's his head. He is out to deliberately wreck my dream evening but I take it that way which is...I'm just amazed. I look back and it is really strange because I don't accept it most of the time but I do do it and I don't like it at all. Like, we started talking about whether he could come to New Hampshire with me or not. I hadn't made up my mind at that time whether I wanted him to or not. He was kind of pressuring me to say that I wanted him to. He was giving me very logical arguments why he shouldn't help me better this way and that way. I was just confused. I didn't know whether his logic was good and helpful or whether his logic was really off. I should think about it and examine it, and find out what's wrong. It was very, very confusing. I was feeling very pressured and I was very tense. 0:06:03.3 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What of this did he hear? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Don't pressure me; I don't want to talk about it right now. It just puts me uptight." But the feeling kind of carried on for the evening; I was just very uptight and very angry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you had gotten very annoyed with him doing that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then in the restaurant he started asking about money. We had picked a particularly dirt cheap restaurant; it's really cheap and it's really nice. I just didn't want to be hassled, whether I was spending a $1.50 or $2. (Inaudible 6:48) was absurd. I was just really pissed - a dollar difference. I did it - like out cold. I was just so annoyed that I just was not nice to him at all. I just withdrew into a shell and that was it. And I was kind of like, "Maybe you will suffer for making me uncomfortable." I did; I made him suffer and it was pretty crappy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now are you saying that you wish you hadn't got annoyed about those things, or what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish I hadn't gotten so annoyed and I wish that when I had gotten annoyed that I'd been able to deal with my annoyance and not gotten pouty and childish about it, which is what I did. And I think that is a matter of my being conscious of it and I've allowed myself to do that. It's just seeing what's happening. It's very self indulgent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I know what you are saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sinking in this big pout when everybody is unjust to you. This kind of pout - it's ridiculous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I gather your judgment is that it shouldn't be hard for you to do that once you've tried to watch yourself? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of resolving what you are going to want yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about the other aspect of it? The building things up? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that is kind of the same sort of thing too; I have to realize that I am doing it. I've noticed it before and Murphy's noticed it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, really you have to do one more thing and realize it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have to. It's more than just realizing it. It's working and talking myself out of that sort of thing; not allowing myself to pin that much erroneous significance to (inaudible 8:55). It's just kind of watching myself and saying, "Hey, look at what you are doing. Don't do that - that's harmful." 0:09:03.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that too is kind of easy, but then again, it's not. It's really nice to dream about all kinds of all wonderful things that you can do. It's kind of a matter of self-control. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know why I keep wondering why you do it because I don't ordinarily. I may just be wondering. It may not be helpful to you to go into that, given that you really don't endorse doing anything unless you can... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I kind of have a few ideas about why I do it but I don't want to go into the detail. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they are of no interest. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, they don't matter because you really don't think you should be doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I don't see the beginning of the end. It's kind of like saying, "Why do you daydream in a daydream fashion?" That's basically what it is, then it gets more emotional significance and it gets nasty. That's kind of all that's been hassling me this week. I think I have my head together about my parents and what I want to have happen and how (inaudible 10:54). It simply a matter of going. I want to get it over with. I'm tired of the hassle and worrying about planning for it and getting this all together. (Inaudible 11:10) Everything that has come up I feel I know how to handle with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about your papers? (laughter) They haven't come up. They are something that bothers you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, as a matter of fact they are but for this week I have set my priorities, very strangely, in terms of...I have this thing where I want to take only new clothes. So I am sewing at the rate of a dress a day which takes a lot of effort because I am sewing some complicated things. I have one dress left and a tie which I promised my father for his birthday before Friday morning. So I am being realistic. 0:12:15.8 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, but why did you choose this priority in the first place over this thing? Given your priority, you may be behaving unrealistically. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; it kind of has to do with my independence thing at the moment - kind of an affirmation that I'm quite okay on my own. He's supporting me; he's taking care of me; I have all of these new clothes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But none of it was true before a week ago. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; it has just gained importance to me as the time has gone. It has just become very important to me. My mother, until about a year ago, knew every single article of my clothing and remembered them. I mean, most of them I made myself or we shopped together and got. She really knew my wardrobe minutely. It's kind of an extension of showing her that I'm my own person and she doesn't know me inside out anymore. I mean, in some ways it is a very shallow manifestation but in other ways, it is going to be a great ego boost for me. I want to be really together. I want to feel really good when I'm there. I want to be able to handle the situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want to (inaudible 13:41) that you can get from them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I'm going to have all new clothes out; if I look good I'm going to feel good. I'm watching my diet. I won't have the exterior hassles with them that I usually have; I just don't want them. I don't want to hassle with them about clothes and I don't want to have the hassle about weight but, of course, they won't ask me about that. I really want to get down to the things that are troubling me and not the crap things that they always throw around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So one way is to remove the occasion. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can just as soon understand that they may not...that that information may not... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I understand perfectly that my father can very much look at three new things and say they are all terrible but, you know, that's fine with me as long as I feel very together. I like everything that I've made and I feel very comfortable in them, and if he doesn't like them, tough, but I want to have a strong stand there to be able to say, "That doesn't matter. Don't tell me my clothes are shabby; they are three days old. Leave me alone about that. Let's talk about whatever." I kind of want that reinforcement too: just having a prompt. 0:15:10.2 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you decided to do this, did you weigh it against your paper and the other things that you could be doing, or did you not - the other things you thought you should be doing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of weighed it against the paper but then it would probably be easier for me to get the clothes finished before I left than it would be to get the paper finished before I left. That was the last thing I wanted to do because I still have about two more days worth of research - I mean, like, all day research - before I sit down and write it. I have completely changed the topic: I have finally found a manageable topic. Last Wednesday I went to (inaudible 16:15) after an appointment and started getting to work again, and it just flashed on me. Now I have to do some research going back in this particular field, not (inaudible 16:30) but my background of that particular organ is not so good, so I've got to work on that. So it's no longer a case of, "Why don't I sit down and write this paper right now?" Because I can't; I have at least 10 more articles on the immediate subject as a background thing to do an it's going to take a while. I am still shooting to finish the paper before leaving my mom. Like, go and spend the afternoon (inaudible 17:03). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So really you didn't make a decision about doing your paper and doing clothes. You didn't weigh the broad implications of the two against each other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of put off the paper, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you think it was; that it wasn't a very considered decision? I mean, it wasn't a considered thinking about this idea of finishing and that it would be important to finish something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't that at all. It was kind of saying, "Look, it's one or the other and it would be easier to do the dresses so I should do the dresses. That has more immediate consequences, so why don't you do the dresses?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what happened? 0:18:00.1 </p>

<p>CLIENT: In a way it's really hard to start and me thinking the whole paper. It's going to take a while, obtaining the background of the (inaudible 18:12) and then sitting down, going through all my cards and reading which ones are essential and which ones aren't - discarding 50 or so. It's going to be very discouraging. I already spent the last six months tickling a wand and I'm not really getting anywhere. But I feel much better now. I feel like I can handle it now, which I didn't feel before. There is a possibility that I may turn out a fairly decent paper which (inaudible 18:39) will be able to use - I mean, give him useful information, which is kind of what I would like this paper to do for him. It is kind of why he was excited that I was doing the paper in the first place. I feel better about it in terms of being able to do it - I may handle this. What were you going to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say: you don't think it is very admirable that you chose these over difficulty, do you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I chose? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Chose the easy thing to do for this week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know whether I think it is or not. I don't think I could have done that paper this week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you could have, of course...one could've done something like a quarter of the research or done the whole research and not written it. You know, dents can be made. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true but it seems to have taken second emotional precedence next to this visit to my parents which I just kind of feel always like that I've just been getting myself into gear for it and this is just one more process for getting myself in gear. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you are changing your mind and saying that it really is justified to have not done anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm of two minds about it. I feel it is justified. Then again, depending on whether I keep myself in a strictly immediate frame of mind - what is necessary for me in this week; to keep myself together; to achieve my immediate goal. But then in the overview, just this month or the following month and how I want myself to work in general, I'm of a completely different view - I'm very ambivalent. The paper showed comforts long before doing anything else; the paper should have been done months ago, and they are not very well synchronized at all. 0:21:03.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know they sound completely similar? </p>

<p>CLIENT: And in a way that should bother me very much but I just don't want to hassle with it right now. Jesus! I mean, that's going into this whole big trip again about organization and self-discipline, and getting things done and procrastinating, and how I set my precedents, and how I won't change them at a moment's notice. That's where a question within myself tends to depress me and dissipate my energies. It is a question of great self doubt, self purpose and how I handle myself. I am feeling really together right now and I don't want to blow it. It's also a question which I have some hassle with which never seems to resolve itself - I mean, it doesn't resolve itself. My personality and organization either changes or it doesn't; it moves towards changing but it hasn't made that enormous change which would turn me into somebody very disciplined and orderly. I don't think I want to do that exactly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can move closer toward it but I don't think I am ever going to be completely 100 per cent self-disciplined and purposeful, and divide my days into eight hours, and divide my hours into four segments of 15 and know what each one is allotted for, which is a certain sort of ideal. I don't think I want to change to that extreme. I can hassle myself with it now and I can browbeat myself and I could worry about it but it is not going to change in the next two days and it would probably keep me from doing anything today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you talk about that - when we talk about that - it doesn't lead to concrete changes really. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It only leads to making more emotional doubt. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes it does lead to concrete changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the short-term usually. I've been thinking about that: what I've been thinking about is that the way we usually talk is really good and correct, but that they're missing kind of...one thing I feel is missing - and you also thought was missing - was a kind of sense of continuity at some point. So there comes one time when you talk about X and then the next time you see me you don't know whatever happened to X. 0:24:26.1 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when that comes up again, you don't know whether your talk before wasn't good or whether other circumstances come up or whatever - unless, of course, they are mentioned, or unless you are this incredible scientist. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you probably can't remember everything anyway. There is a kind of loss of continuity. And the other thing is that...well, there are two other things: one is that, I have really thought for a long time it is important to have concrete criteria for change. You have to make some steps for concrete definitions of problems. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you know what you are talking about. I don't know, maybe that's simply not chronological, but in terms of helping people change, it seems important for a couple of reasons. One is that when you start talking about things in concrete problems, then you find out whether the person really thinks of them - whether they are a problem or not. I think in some ways the way we've talked has done that - some things haven't been problem fixed the other way. Also, changing how...one criticism that's often made of standard psycho therapy is that it's only words and people don't (inaudible 26:11) words, and even if the words change, does that mean anything? People would argue that doesn't mean anything on what happens. There is that separation; there is a kind of way in which words...well, word are really important because they define what problems really are and they come down to the values that you have in examining them and thinking about whether the values you are living by are the ones that you want to have, and think are really important to change. That makes for criteria; that what you want to change and what you really don't think you should because you think you should change your values instead. 0:27:07.0 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there are other steps; like there have to be ways of making (inaudible 27:17) and because people have been living out certain things, whether for a long time or even just for days, there are a lot things involved in changing things, besides just understanding them. Like at the least, probably, the kind of thing you were saying not having to train yourself or catch yourself are the things you don't like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also, things can require much more structured ways of thinking about them so that you can find out what the problems really are, so that you can keep on examining things, and also that they can change. That kind of more structured approach, I think, would fill some of the lax that I've been talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it also would mean that when you talk about something it doesn't just mean it frightens you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I certainly know that it is just, kind of, the ebb and flow of the person's emotions and how they are viewing whatever it is at the particular time. I mean, what bothers me about this particular problem - which is a problem; it's a major problem to me, even when it is not actually bothering me at the particular time to solve a problem - is that I am very clear on what I am doing and how I am doing it. I can talk about it forever; very lucidly and very clearly. I am distinctly aware of what I am doing and how I am fooling myself in this way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in fact you are coming to terms with that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having to talk about concrete behavioral changes makes you come to terms with that because if you are doing the things that we figure you are doing, then we know something that we didn't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the one thing which, of all the other things that we talked about, I have usually been able to institute some concrete change. like last week, I came home and sat down and talked to Murphy, and we were just able to achieve...we sat down and talked about our sexual interactions. He made admissions and I kind of made admissions and had insights into each other - into ourselves - and we were just able to relate much better - much freer. We really have been much happier all week; it's really been fine and just really relaxed. There's been no pressure on me and I've had this really good time - it's so fine. Things like that. It's easier to affect change of that sort because it involves someone else. 0:30:25.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How should that make you feel? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you sit down and once you've taken the initial effort it is not just you who has to keep it up; there is somebody else there. You kind of blank and kind of toss it over to him. When he kind of blanks and...kind of your initiatives, it kind of spells you; you don't have to be conscious of it all the time because the two of you are working at it. And not all the responsibility is yours. But in this, it is me. There is no way out - it is me. And I have to come to terms with myself not making an agreement with somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said one reason that it was more difficult is just because when another person's there, they can keep up the lull and it means you stay on the subject. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. If it in some way fails, the responsibility is no longer yours. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so it is easier to try - to try some solutions? But if you try some solution to your studying, your really afraid it won't work and you will only have yourself to blame. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am afraid I am just...the feeling is that one day they are going to catch up with you. One day they are going to find out that you are really not so bright, and you really don't do very well, and you have just been fooling everybody for the past 14 or 15 years. I don't know if that feeling would be eradicated by being more efficient. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it would be terrible to change your deficiency without dealing with that. That would be like teaching someone who thinks they are a criminal to get away it better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. I would have more self-confidence and then I sort of think, "Well, I am to a certain extent disciplining - I can get this work done." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't think people...your feelings - you described them before - wanting people to find out how you write your papers is on a messy desk. That they would know, right? 0:33:00.8 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or that you write them on a bad schedule and take longer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that the substance would be found lacking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't even know how to hit that. I mean, I have been dancing around with that one for six years. Wow. I've just never been able to reach it; I have just never been able to do it; to in any way feel better by...I do have flashes of great discipline - flashes of a day or two; sometimes even a week - when I do get a lot done, and then it just kind of lapses again. I guess I could do it; I mean, I have done it but I don't seem to do it with any consistency and that's a second part of the problem. I mean, that's how it manifests itself; that's how I know it is kind of a problem. And then once more removed from the central issue is when I start dealing with the central issue, I start to procrastinate. I manage to outsmart myself from dealing with it and then I come up with more immediate goals which I can...all I can just do is in five or six days, then I'll get back to working on the paper or then I'll read that book that I should read for Western Civ. And I will continue to do that - outjump my priority. I supersede it with something that is very immediate - my life feels very rigid at the moment - then it's been shelved and it kind of meanders a lot until I get upset about it and put it as a first priority; work on it a little while, then it jumps the queue and the priority goes on that. And, yeah, it worries me but I feel very (inaudible 35:29) because it has been worrying me for a very long time and it doesn't seem to be able to get better. It gets better but it becomes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It gets better but, you were saying, it doesn't really get better because it doesn't (inaudible 35:41) you control access to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems like a central issue is this thing about getting found out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. 0:36:00.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not a thing where you are very good at convincing yourself that there isn't something to find out. You really do feel that you have a guilty secret and you know what that guilty secret is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you're always afraid that this time it is going to catch up with you. Doesn't it seem now, in the abstract, if a person has a guilty secret that they should either get rid of the thing or - or maybe this is often a combination - if they figure they should be (inaudible 37:09) be wanting to take the consequences of that, which is what I think you were hiding from a lot. That is, you really weren't willing to find out that you really don't have...even though you have these incredible suspicions and (inaudible 37:38) that you are pawning it off on everybody. You don't want to find out that that's really true. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of thinking about that - denying those things. (Inaudible 38:20) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd so hate to find that out that it seems like you are afraid to put yourself in any situation where you would find out; that is the situation with the paper as well. 0:38:51.4 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel that, whether I'm smart or not, I still have to measure up to the same standards and I want to; and my criteria for myself is very high; and whether I have what it takes to meet these standards or not, that I should. That I have to meet the standards; that I accept these standards. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, so it's right to say that you feel you may not be smart like that; maybe you say you may disappoint yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe disappointed in your output. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I started thinking that after I finish my graduate work, what would happen if I didn't get into graduate school? What the f*** would I do with myself? I've always created fantasies about apprenticing myself to a craft, like, working in textiles or apprenticing myself to the antique trade. But they're fantasies; they're hobbies. I don't think I would be happy spending my life that way. The fear is that I will just be in vegetative mediocrity all my life. If I don't have what it takes, I'll find out that - that there is nothing left for me to do, but what I want to do requires that I be that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas what you want to do, your kind of (inaudible 41:36) psychology or your kind of (inaudible 41:39) psychology brilliantly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess brilliantly. I mean, yeah. I mean, I want to start my own field in a way. Psychological biology. Do a lot of research and practice also. Yeah, I really would like to be brilliant and distinguished very much at something. I would like to be really good at something. I very much doubt that I am. Any of the things that I do right now, I'm okay - I'm proficient. I'm a very competent person, period. 0:42:42.7 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've always wanted to be brilliant. I've always been looked at as being special and there are times that I have actual given that impression, but I'm very frightened that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There mightn't be any truth in it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I want it to be very much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You not only want it to be so much, (inaudible 43:15) on the basis that that would make it realer to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah - yes, exactly. Yeah, not even gracing it with a lot of thought, just hoping that it isn't so - not wanting to deal with it at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's very good because you've been talking a while - all the time - (inaudible 43:53) that it really is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's very strange. It's very unsettling; that's why I go in a complete tailspin. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how does it really help you to not think about it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I never said it did (chuckles). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I spoke to you metaphorically. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it is a conscious sort of thing at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't mean that you have a (inaudible 44:27); well maybe I do, but it's so important to say to yourself, "Don't think about this - it might be true. Maybe I do." But I don't think you are conscious of that every time you turn the light off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just kind of automatic; I just don't think about it - I just don't. I do not allow myself to think about it. It's kind of like, I get very wicked; very depressed. So I've come to the ultimate decision that I'm of great mediocrity - fine! Where does that leave me? That still leaves me unable to cope with the fact that I don't want to be mediocre; that I want to be something outside of the ordinary; that I do want to be talented, gifted or especially brilliant to someone. That leaves me just nowhere. 0:45:34.3 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't leave you with the feeling that you can change that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And it seems to me that...I don't know what I think about it but I know what I feel about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is, if I was to finally come to that conclusion I would just have to give up - I would have to stop. I would have to completely change. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why. Because it seems to me that all the things that I want to do demand a certain... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you what I think it seems to me like. You might have to change the kind of thinking that you think you do. None of that is going to work because you don't like it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have to make a complete difference? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would have to be a big difference? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think of your intellectual life that much that you don't know what it would be like if you weren't faking? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, to a very large degree - yes. I would have to do away with the entire tone of voice of which I'm talking right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really, into what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; into something less absurd and less sure. I would kind of have to stop...God, I've become even more (inaudible 47:54) than I am with (inaudible 47:56) right now. It would be impossible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? What I mean is...? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I would be that leisurely with everybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's (inaudible 48:16)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is really difficult for me to say anything to (inaudible 48:28). I play along but I'm very quiet. I speak very softly like this and I become very diminutive and docile. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that because you believe you can see into your heart? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Metaphorically yes, because I feel that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But isn't that a fear that will find you out? What if you were pretending? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I were pretending I wouldn't talk to him at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I just wouldn't talk to him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you wanted to talk to him you would have to think of something different to say. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I do think of a substitute. It's really strange because I do think of them and I do say them, but I feel as if I am faking it, even though I have thought of them and I am saying them. And there are times, yes. Okay, the (inaudible 49:49) thing is just such a mess - 50 per cent fakery and 50 per cent knowledge. I mean, it just eughhh! Every time I think of that speech I gave in class - forget it. I was so confused. I still am about the great body of (inaudible 50:07) hassle. Maybe I'm just paranoid about it at all. Maybe I really don't know too much about it at all. I don't seem to remember all of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you saying? You are confused about whether maybe you actually do have...you are faking it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to a certain degree I am confused. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that is? 0:50:54.7 </p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole crazy bundle of my expectations are running round in cross purposes at different times and altogether. Possibly I did not expect so much out of this paper. I wanted to do well so badly that I would not have the hassle: I would be able do the research and sit down and do it. If I didn't expect myself to a certain degree to be, kind of, hip and counter cultured, I might be able to turn myself into a very hard working, straight student whose main concern was her studies. Things like that. And if I were then to just turn myself into somebody very straight and grindish, I would just produce the papers. But then the question is: would I be happy with myself as a person - not just as a student? If I were to go off and spend the next three years learning to weave gorgeously, when I finished, I think I would be happy with myself as a craftsman and a very practical person but I don't think I would be individually happy at all. I want to be a culmination of all of those things. That to me is the ideal, and to me that comes down to someone being an extremely prude person. Someone who is very capable and very talented and belonging to her feelings - able to do very, very much and do it well. And that's what I want to be, and I don't know if that's possible for me or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you are trying to do is to be that without being it - do you know what I mean? You're trying to see that - not to be it, from the way that you describe what you do. That's where the problem is. And you don't see it like that because you don't say that. You try not to. 0:54:05.6 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, for fear of finding out that I'm not - and it's true. Where do you break (inaudible 54:18)? I am more able to do things than before. I am more able to say I am going do (inaudible 54:32) and get the book and get the (inaudible 54:34) and not just let it lie there for doing. I am more able to say, "I want to do (inaudible 54:43) but I don't really have the time. It's impractical - I will not take leave of absence." Then I think about the (inaudible 54:51) where I know something already, where it will not be this great chunk of time taken out. That I won't do ballet and yoga - that I will do one or the other. I will decide which one I want to do. I am more able to move myself in that general direction. But I'm still left with the basic...but these are all the peripheral things I do. I'm still left with the basic hassle of getting myself together as far as my studies are concerned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how do you deal with them? Basically, I guess you (inaudible 55:53) talking about a problem is formally the same? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I suggest retaining (inaudible 55:59)</p>

<p>CLIENT: By saying you want to do all these things; how can you claim to be a handy type person - a craftsy type person - if you don't do any of that? How can you possibly do that? And I get very material returns from these things which I very much like, and I like the (inaudible 56:24) I make; I like the things that I make cooking; I like the things that I make sewing; I very much like the results of a lot of painting I do around the house - things like that. They are very tangible. They're there. I get myself together. It is in a way production; I can see what I'm doing; I can keep on going. 0:57:09.1 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's different about the papers? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; they mean so much more to me, you know. (Inaudible 57:37). I just know I hate it. The same way I'm not going to take up embroidery; I can't stand hands-on, but I'm (inaudible 57:59). If I fail, so what? If I can't do it, it's too bad - I can do something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like saying you are willing to take risks when they don't really count as much? </p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I know there is an alternative; if I don't knit, I sew. If I don't (inaudible 58:26). If I don't embroider, I (inaudible 58:29). And I know what will happen if I don't do it - nothing! I will find something else to do or I'll rave more. I don't know what's going to happen if I can't (inaudible 58:43) What would I do with myself? Be a housewife? Be a waitress? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that include being merely adequate? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it does or not. That's separate from being merely adequate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that you actually have two kinds of levels of fear? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. One is just completely panning out and having nothing to do with my life, and the second is plodding along and being very mediocre and having a very unsatisfactory life. I mean, just always being disappointed with myself, always feeling that I never achieved anything or lived up to any of my standards. Just being a total non-entity - a nothing. Just plodding from day to day. Achieving nothing and feeling that I've achieved nothing. Feeling meaningless and afraid of having a pretty meaningless life. There are those two levels to my fear. 1:00:25.9 </p>

<p>I'm also kind of in two minds - that's a weird pronunciation - as to my ability to change that; to change the basic with which I work with me. At times when I feel that I have a great deal of control over who I am and what I am and how I do things, and there are other times when I feel I don't really...that I'm dealing with the basic quality that I either have or do not have - a certain type of degree of intelligence. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that to choose between being merely adequate and brilliant or to choose between being merely adequate and nothing at all? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Between being adequate and brilliant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you might not be able to be brilliant? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it is very difficult...it is more of an intellectual fear that I will completely fail. I just never have. I just can't imagine...I can't imagine being refused by every single graduate school that I applied to. I have always been accepted by whatever I have wanted to do. I've gotten into high school; I've gotten into here right away. I've gotten my scholarships when I applied for them. So it is very hard for me to really be frightened of completely failing. I mean, it is a fear that's there but it is not as strong as the fear of being mediocre; of completely not living up to my expectations and kind of how I'd perform in the class, or how I'd be seen to perform in the class. Breaking the pattern and being viewed as just kind of a nobody - just masquerading.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To whom? 1:03:00.4 </p>

<p>CLIENT: To myself; to all of the people who thought I was any good. To my parents. To my father who swears to have a stupid kid. Just the people who have known me and have kind of believed in my talent, intelligence that I've shown. And myself - for whatever I've shown myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you already know that - you have two levels of fear. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for them: is it disappointment or what? Are you trying to keep them from disappointment? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess with my parents, yeah. I kind of have the feeling that they are the people who set the expectations for me in the beginning and that these expectations are very important to them as well as to me. And the other people are kind of...that's just a reflection of myself - of my own embarrassment. It's mainly, I guess, my parents and myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that, sort of, how embarrassing it would be? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. To a degree Murphy; I don't think he expects that much from me. I think he feels I can do it but I don't think it's important to him - except as it is important to me. Whether I get an A or C doesn't make any difference to him, except if it upsets me - which is nice. I guess it matters to me but I don't really know if it matters to me - but it does. I don't know why it should be so harder than what it seems, but it is. 1:06:31.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'd like to know why then? Answer? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know: I just know that I don't want it to be that way. I don't know what would happen. I don't know - I really don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you don't know what it would mean to you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't know how I would react. I don't know why I am afraid of it; I know that I am. I don't know why - I really don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you know what you'd like? Is that the way you see a lot of things? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess... I liked the way that...certain people that I have known, who have a number of, kind of, qualities...I'm thinking of a couple of them in particular. I really like the way they interacted with people. I lied the things that they were able to do with people and for people. I was very impressed with them. I liked the way they interacted with me. I just felt that there were...people who were leading a very fulfilling, useful life, not only to themselves but to other people. They were valuable people but I'd imagine were worthwhile to themselves and to the people around them. I guess a lot of it has to do with other people and interacting with them, and how they see you (inaudible 69:18) eyes, as the case may be, and how they see me. And how they interact with me, and what they expect and how I can fulfill their expectations. Wanting them to have good expectations of me and wanting to be able to fulfill those expectations, and to make those synonymous. And I guess that's what I want and what I am afraid of is that people will have good expectations of me which I will not fulfill, or that people will have bad expectations and people won't trust me, and people won't like me. Therefore my life will be worthless; I would be unhappy. And I think that that's true. That if people don't trust you; people don't like you; then unless you are a certain type of person, you will be unhappy. And that's the way I'd like to achieve it. I remember this really big thing, like as soon as I got away to school - even before then - about I always kept my promise and I just (inaudible 71:28), and it's really, really important to me - and it still is - but I am much more careful with my promises now. It's also to do with trust. 1:11:49.2 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you do want to achieve that and I think it is good to achieve that if you can. I think everybody should try. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which leads me to another feeling that I'm trying wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is pretty different from the norm; to say you want people to trust you and to like you and to say, "Well, you can keep your agreement. You don't seem like a quitter to me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: They aren't me in some ways. It's really funny but last night, I sitting and sewing - it was for a board at the (inaudible 73:00) house - and I asked Murphy to read to me, and he read me with greatest dumb face, which was really funny because I hadn't thought of the connection at all. The Hawthorn Story: it was that kind of that sort of trip; the main character is somebody who is very kind, has a very strong and fine relationship with people. He is an exceptionally brilliant person in his thinking. I don't think they are necessarily exclusive. That's why I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but trying to get people to think you are brilliant, doesn't seem to be a thing that should lead to trust. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, indeed! </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact, it may because probably people are found out much more seldom than they should be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or than they are hiding things, you know what I mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I lost some of it; I lost the subject of the burden!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I correct: being brilliant and kind of trustworthy, is even better than, you know, being kind of trustworthy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where was the difference between that: I don't see it. The problem is whether you want people to trust you or whether you want to be trusted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems to me that people do trust me; people have trusted me and I have always felt trustworthy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should people trust someone who's...how does that fit, is more what I mean, with having the goal of seeing brilliance without being it? 1:15:44.1 </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all wrapped up in how much I want to be brilliant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't, because now you are saying you want to seem brilliant more than you want to be trustworthy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd rather seem brilliant, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd much rather be brilliant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the absence of that, I just want to say one thing: I think it is probably wrong to talk as if your absent from it - as if you are absent from any brilliance. It's more...which we don't know. Now, you may feel that: I just don't want it affirmed; keep on affirming it, so they're more convenient words. You don't know if you are going to, or going to be whatever that thing is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it seems that it comes down to whether you would rather be trustworthy or seem brilliant. It is as if you can't predict the other one. You feel you don't do the other one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're in conflict about that; you're in conflict about whether to change. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be trustworthy and you want to be brilliant. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So (inaudible 77:38). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible 77:47). yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you should think about it. 1:18:04.8 </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. Yeah, I should. Do you want me just to show up? (laughter) Something else is going to be happening. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have no way of telling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we will talk about that after you take your tests; if you come after, we can talk about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you go to therapy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean specifically, just? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, do you disappear in a puff of smoke? (Laughs.) The reason that I am not talking about it know is that...one of these things about these conditions under new testing is that..in general, people haven't made plans for what they are going to do afterwards. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Leave it hanging! </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly. I can tell you are glad you were in this research project. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: To tell you the truth, the idea of going for those tests, you know that...maybe you start really thinking, "I didn't want to be as clinical as I thought. I've got an hour and a half worth of tests, and I shouldn't say this on tape but I am going to say it anyway, that I remember that a lot of the answers I gave for the visual and perception thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what they (inaudible 79:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am not going to decide whether I am simply going to do a bouquet. I remember exactly the frame of mind I was in and how pissed I was after all those tests. I could really, like, ball them up good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 80:02)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did not resent being given the tests. I came in there with a really positive frame of mind, you. The tests themselves pissed me off so much. They were so stupid; it was a fill-out-the-blanks more than what you would expect to get out of therapy. They were so repetitious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 80:22). </p>

<p>CLIENT: What a therapist is and what a therapist does. I just said, "Oh come on; this is an insult to all of our intelligences." You know, "What is this? What do you expect? That a therapist is a rabbit that does magic tricks?" I can understand the problems of formulating these tests but they should understand the problems of taking it. You can say a therapist does such and such only so many times before you want to tear the whole thing apart, which was basically what it came down to. It was not enlightening. In a couple of cases it was. The vast majority was in no way enlightening us; very conscious of the mechanisms involved and what they were trying to get out, and what those tests were. They ask you, "Would you rather go to a museum or help a blind person down the street? (laughter) And then say that if you (inaudible 81:19) you want to be a farmer?" 1:21:20.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would understand if it was pedestrian or understand it if... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really was pedestrian. It was just unbelievable. I'm not looking forward to taking them again. Then there were the ones that I couldn't do at all - they were terrible. Yeah, it was the hour long session that really blew my mind because they had me playing all these word games and just was not in the frame of mind - I was really depressed. Then they had to play word games (inaudible 81:57). It was a really bad battery of tests. I hope they listen and do something; I don't know if they will learn or not but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All you can do is to have a stomach for (inaudible 82:14)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have a pretty strong feeling that I am not going to go and bawl off either - it's just too nasty. Clinical psychologists do some other thing, and clinical psychologists don't give tests; they don't offer what I need! (laughter) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't we make it late in the week? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, fine. You're going away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. How's Friday? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday's fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You could come earlier in the morning: make it 11.30? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I will come earlier if you want; I was up at nine today (chuckles). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you can come at 10. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine - I'll do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye bye. 1:23:32.8</p>

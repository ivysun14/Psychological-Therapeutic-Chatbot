<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence)  I keep thinking of—, somehow they seem to be connected, two things, in a way. Uhm, I was thinking about how today everything—.  Well, I had my hair done, so a_ always I feel as if I'm pushing to get everything done fast so I can get out of school and then to the hairdresser's and out of the hairdresser's in here.  And today I wanted to call the, uhm, doctor's office, because the secretary had thought she might know the results of the test.  And I didn't want to do that at the hairdresser's because it's a very public place, where his phone is.  So I was also pushing to get home at some point, either before I went or after, to ha—, and have time to call.  And, eh, while I think about that, and I was still feeling that kind of tension and so forth when I came in here.</p>

<p>I was also thinking about one of the conferences I had today.  I had two, which just made everything more of a rushed day and—.  It was with a mother, uhm, whose very tense, and I don't know it seemed like in a way I was being just like her today.  And her child is very rigid and he's tense in several ways.  And I don't know he has, he has several problems.  And, uhm, they seem to be getting a lot worse.  And I was thinking, too, in talking with her, uhm, it seemed like she didn't want to take what I was saying, and I didn't want to take what she was saying.  And so we were fighting each other and very rigid on—, each of us thought that whoever was—.  I mean I thought I was right and she was thinking she was right, and we weren't going to give in.  But that's how I felt.  I think I verbally gave in, or at least said, "Maybe you're right on things."  Although she rejected things I said completely and—.  (sniff)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just wondering, too, if I had—, the test result weren't in and if I had found out—, well especially if I had found out I were pregnant, then I wondered how I'd be feeling right now.  Because it seemed like the whole day was geared toward having a chance to call and find out.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you aware of how you tell it to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The only thing I keep being aware of is the way I was seeing it just then was I was in competition with this woman and if I were pregnant I would have won the competition.</p>

<p>ANALYST: If you were pregnant.  No, the point is you, you tell me the whole day is geared to that and various things about it, and, uh, how you tried to get to a phone, etc.  But you never actually say what you'd—, whether you did or didn't or whether you found anything out or you didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I thought I did.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I missed it if you did (laughs).</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I sort of slipped it in. (laughs).  They didn't know.  The results weren't in.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think that left me feeling at loose ends, because, oh, I don't know how I would react if I hear I'm not, but I think of m—, of having tried to prepare myself for hearing that I'm not.  But I hadn't ever thought I wouldn't know today if I got a call, if I did get a chance to call and—.  So that was a surprise to find out they didn't know yet.  (silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I keep thinking about that mother and her child.  Who needs something, and I don't know exactly what it is, and I'm sure not giving it to him.  And I don't think his mother has either.  I think she's been very—.  I think—, I tried to suggest this because the way he acts about himself and has, from many things she's said over past years, he's extremely hard on himself.  And has been acting way beyond his age level, I mean with a self-control and the way he pushes himself. And now he's having almo—, it's like a regression.  He's—, there are aspects of his behavior that are very immature for his age level and they're getting worse.  And I know I'm—, I don't know, I just—.  I react against it, because as a teacher—.  I mean he talks all the time.  He has to have everything that he thinks heard, no matter what it is, however insignificant it is, it's important to him.  And some reason he needs to have it heard right at the moment he's thinking it.  He can't even wait, whereas most of the children can wait now.  And he's very rigid and tense.  Sometimes if you touch his body, he's almost quivering he's so rigid, and he's terrible with other boys now.</p>

<p>And I don't know, I just feel frustrated, because he makes me exasperated or angry, and all these things that I think is just what he makes his mother.  And I think in the conference today I kept feeling that it's not up to me to give this boy the love he needs.  It's up to his mother.  And it makes me think of yesterday, and I don't know, in a way, I think sometimes a teacher has to be able to give some of that when a mother can't.  But then I get mixed up in that feeling, because sometimes I don't feel capable as a teacher of doing it.  Because there are other things you're having to do to and— (deep breath).</p>

<p>But yesterday, something happened on the—, well, I saw something on the subway when I went home that seemed to be hav— or have in it, at least I saw in it what I was feeling and trying to talk about here.  Because there was this fat boy, who w_ was quite unattractive looking who was with his mother, or at least they looked alike so I assumed it was his mother.  And then there was another woman and it looked like her daughter.  And the mother and the other woman were talking.  And the two children were on either side, on the other side, the outsides of their parents, and the boy was leaning against his mother as if he were asleep, but in a very heavy way.  It looked more like he was pushing, trying to make himself known.  And then later he got up, and he tried to talk to his mother and she didn't really pay any attention to him.  And then he got up and looked at a map, and he was making all sorts of noise.  I don't know, then he did some movement things to get attention, and his mother just—.  She'd kind of look at him, but she wouldn't really pay any attention to him.  And he'd go sit down and lean against her again.  Then he'd get up, and I don't, I don't know, I was just feeling sorry for the boy.  And, uhm, then finally the mother paid attention to him once to yell at him, to tell him to button his top button on his shirt, in a very ugly way.  And then that was it, as far as I was on the subway (clears throat) that I saw her pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>And it, it—, I just started thinking what I think—.  When I think my mother didn't—, wasn't a mother to me, the way I want, at least the way I wanted a mother to be, that I w—, and I was thinking more in terms of this boy, but it would be true for me, too, of, "If this woman, who's your mother doesn't love you," and I w—, I don't know, I guess I was thinking that partly because he was unattractive.  She was, too, but then he wanted her attention.  And I don't know here's this person who's stuck with you, the only person in the world who can't get away from a relationship that is already there existing.  And if she doesn't love you, who's going to love you.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think that's (clears throat) maybe I'm being too rational about it now, but that seems to be part of this feeling I had that something started before I would be aware of my mother, in terms of my mother and my father, or of my father that there was this time when it—, there was just my mother and—.  (silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, then I start thinking of my mother being on a time schedule with me, and never playing with me, and I—, it's, I don't know if it's memory or just imagining how I think she probably was (clears throat) but I can't imagine her, as she might have with Nancy, I don't know, but—.  I mean just the way I've seen her (clears throat) all the times I can remember, around the house, she never would stop and play for a while.  It was always work and duty and unpleasant things.  And I think of how sometimes I've talked her about being horrible enough to try to test how far I could go. Was this tie I had with my parents something they couldn't get rid of, and I knew it was in a way.  I mean sometimes they'd threaten things but I was their child and so they had to kind of put up with me.  But I don't know that was—, seems like I didn't think I had love but was I going to be completely on my own, or would I at least have a house and food and things like that.  (pause)</p>

<p> And that makes me think again with food I—, from the time I think I could start doing this, I always had to get things for myself.  I mean there were things that probably if my mother knew I had them or she were asked if I could have them, she'd say no, because they were all fattening and gooey things, but—.  I had to get them and take them up into my room and have them up there.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I've started thinking, too, about something last night.  MSCZ kept talking about whether or not I'd be pregnant, to turn out I'd be pregnant. And I got more and more nervous.  I didn't want to think about it or talk about it.  I wanted to just—, I mean it was on my mind, no matter what I told myself.  But I wanted to put it as much out of my mind as possible until I found out through the tests, and he wanted to talk about and enjoy speculation and all and—.  I don't know, at one point he said, "Well, at least you're, you were able to think about becoming pregnant and maybe have done so."  He said, "Before you started analysis I don't even think you could have done that," and I—.  I mean I think it is true, but I didn't know what he had in mind and I said something like, "Why?"  And he said, "Well, you're so afraid of being dependent."</p>

<p>And in a way I think I am, but, I don't know, I just hadn't thought about not liking being pregnant or leaving work in those terms.  Sometimes I've thought of it as being more on my own, or—.  I mean I won't have that built-in thing, work, at school, as the framework from, from everyday and—.  Oh I know why he said that, too.  Because, eh, one the thing that bothers me terrifically, and in this sense I think it is true, it's the only way I can think of it right now, that the thought of not earning money bothers me terrifically.  And I'm really, I keep really being worried.  I don't, I don't know whether I'm making up these worries, but I really wonder how were going to manage.  And MSCZ keeps telling me, "Of course we can," and I shouldn't worry and—.  I don't think I'm trying to attack his masculinity as being able to earn money for us or not.  I think it's just simply that so far I've used all my salary each year, so I can't image what we'll do when I don't have it.  But then I realized that the way I've used my salary is I've paid for everything that I would pay for, I mean like I would—, I pay all my bills.  My medical bills and everything, and then I pay anything for clothes, which would be natural.  But I also pay anything for household expenses.  So I never have to ask MSCZ for money.  And there's something about I don't think there'll be money there when I have to ask MSCZ for money.  And maybe there's something about I don't want to have to ask him for money.  And in that sense I think I am afraid of feeling dependent.  Because I guess right not I think I'm feeding myself.  (pause)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I don't know w_ why that made me think again about getting food all the time at home, feeling this need for this food that wasn't provided, in normal course of meals and things and— (clears throat).  And then I th—, I thought about 1 thing that bothered me in particular that year in PEC was the family locked up all the food supplies, until I had this terrific urge to be able to take something other than what was given to me.  And I think I really resented that there wasn't th—, an open kitchen that I could go in and get food when I wanted it.  And the few times things were left out at a place where I could get them, and I don't whether they meant for me to get them or not, or anybody, but I felt I had to do it and I felt I was stealing.  (pause)</p>

<p>Maybe that's why I like, well things like animals that are dependent on me, because then it—, somehow I don't feel so dependent.  But yet sometimes when I think about having a baby I think that's the thing that frightens me so much is there will be this thing dependent on me and my reactions and my ability to give.  (silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I just thought of an incident at school today, which I should have understood when it was happening, and I didn't really.  Because the boys, some of the boys, were painting different parts of the scenery for our play, separate things like animals and trees and—.  I had cut out paper, because these all have to be cut out, and, uhm, so I'd give them the paper that was, I don't know, they may have had a different size in mind but that was about the size that—, I didn't know what animals they'd do, but that was about the size they should be.  I mean they should fill the page.  And this is something we've done before, in terms of having paper and filling it with one thing that will be cut out.  And, so at first I didn't think there'd be any problem with anyone not understanding, but one or two did have a problem.  And I straightened them out so they understood.  Partly in just they might have been doing one thing they did it so small it wouldn't have shown up in the auditorium.</p>

<p>But then one boy just couldn't get the idea.  And at first I thought maybe I'm not making myself clear, in the direction, and yet he kept persisting beyond what any boy would have not understood, and he's not that slow usually on things like taking directions, once he's really listening I th—, and I thought after a while he really did care and was trying. And I felt myself getting really exasperated with him as if well he's just not really trying to understand a_, you know, while I was there in the situation.  And, uhm, finally I sort of, in the air—, I didn't draw it for him but I—, he he told me what he wanted to do, and I asked him how it would be.  And then I said well then you'd do 1 wing here and 1 wing here.  And I w_, I was just sort of doing it in the air over the paper to show him spacing, so he'd get the idea of how big.  And then he practically copied my motions from the air on the paper.  And it just struck me now, he's the boy who—.  And th_, and then after this painting, which turned out fine, but he needed a lot of help from me to continue.  It was sort of, "Is this right?  Is this right?"  He went and did one of his design painting which he does often.</p>

<p>And I was just thinking now, he's, he's one of the few boys who has made every painting, whether it's a house, a person, an animal, anything.  They all look the same.  And I've interpreted that before to mean that he's, he's not confident and so he keeps doing the same kind of thing.  And so it struck me just now that he really wasn't confident he could what I was asking and when he thought of doing a bird, he—,what he meant was to do those little marks that look like birds way in a distance, flying, because he knew he could do that.  But a bird—, I mean he does very square shape things, and a bird is round, and he, he just rarely will do a rounded shape.  And I don't know why I didn't understand him in that way, at the time, but I didn't.  Because I was harassed.  I was trying to do too many other things, I think.  And I was thinking, well, having just said that about wondering if I could give to a child in a way that I feel my mother didn't give to me, and here I am being just like my mother.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose that's why I reacted so when this mother, at the conference today—, I don't know if I mentioned this, but one thing she said—, she's divorced, and one thing she said that, I don't know, she was talking on about her husband having remarried and he's already starting a new family, and she thinks this is upsetting her son.  And I said it probably is, but any child in a divorce has problems to handle that a normal child wouldn't, a child of a happy family, anyway, wouldn't.  Or I don't—, I've forgotten how I put it, but implied that there are always problems when there's a divorce.  And, because I've met more people who don't think there are any problems, and they just close their eyes to it.  And she said, "Well, he was too young.  He was 15 months old, and so he just absolutely has had no problem as far as the divorce itself goes."  And I said something about, "Well, there hasn't been a father in the house and this has some effect."  And she just was very angry at me saying any of this.</p>

<p>But then now what I think was on the back of my mind then, but I couldn't ever have said it was that—, well, at one point she said she and her husband, former husband, never agreed on anything.  They should never have married.  And, I mean obviously if they were finally divorced why he was 15 months, things were going on when he was younger.  And this is just the time now that, I don't know, I keep feeling is so important.  And I just imagine how she must have been then.  And I can't imagine that she could have been giving her son what he needed at that time, because she had too many needs then, since she was involved in a div—, divorce and she had 2 small children.  And, and also just because her son is so much—.  One of his things is when he wants your attention, he wants it immediately and he gets—, he—, I mean he'll apparently throw a tantrum apparently at home if he doesn't get it.  At school he just will get very angry, or he'll just keep on talking.  And nobody could be listening, but he, he'll just keep right on talking.  (pause)</p>

<p>And, I don't know, it seems that what's bothering me about him is that, in a way, I think I sense how angry he's feeling and how troubled he is and what needs he must have.  I don't think I understand it fully, but I think I feel sympathetic.  But yet as an adult reacting to him, because of my needs as an adult, and my job and, and my role with all the children, I think I'm doing just the opposite of maybe what I should be with him.  And I don't know, maybe I think this about children I might have, that I might understand that they need things.  Maybe—, well, my mother has said this about me too, but yet I won't be able to give it.  (pause)</p>

<p>Except my mother said it, when I heard her say it in a, in a way that indicate she didn't try to, in, in the sense that she just said, "I'm this way and I can't give it."  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do have any idea why you've been thinking of the things you have today?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause) Well, it seems that the last few days I've wanted to find my mother inadequate.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it seems that anything I've thought of today ties in with thinking of my mother as inadequate.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I, and I, I don't know, I have this question, because I think of how I was finding the mother today inadequate.  And then I was feeling very competitive with her, in that I had one thing to say that she didn't want to take and, she had things to say that she believed, that I didn't want to take, like that business about there being no effect from the divorce.  And, I don't know, maybe she is right, but I didn't want to believe it, and I wanted to fight her on it.  And, so it makes me wonder is just one, this just one way to fight my mother, or to be competitive with her, to find her inadequate.  (pause)</p>

<p>But what I don't know, and I think I've been wondering since I started doing it—.  Except that I know I read something in the book that kind of got me started on thinking about that period of my life, or wondering about it.  But other than that I don't know quite what it is that—, why I want to suddenly attack my mother in this way.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know what strikes me is, uhm, I mean the whole theme of what you're saying is how a mother doesn't give a child what it needs.  One way or another you're afraid you won't be able to, and you see the mothers' boys who don't, but that's the theme.  And what occurs to me is that is follows your asking me on Monday about my giving you something that you conveyed, eh, was very important.  Mother in the subway had no time for her son, paid no attention to his requests.  (silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I remember when, on Monday, you compared my, what I was saying about my mother that day on her keeping to a rigid schedule and so forth to my request and then my fear you would have this attitude of keeping to a rigid schedule.  And, and I don't know, I see it today whereas Monday I think I wouldn't see it, or I, I don't know, I un—, I understood there was that comparison, but I didn't feel it came out of the same feeling.  Whereas today I can see what you're saying more, or feel it more.  But then I, then I start to think but was this really what happened with my mother that's—.  I sort of wanted to go away from you back to my mother, again.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it seems that I'm thinking which, uhm, I sometimes do, and maybe it's a way to avoid confronting something that's more real.  But I keep thinking if it came from there, or if problems came from wherever they came from, it's as if that's where I have to go and think about and work out.  And yet talking about it I just keep remembering that's the way I felt, but I always am left with, "Well, what do I do now?"  (pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe what I'm wondering is if—, and I, I do face that that's how I am feeling about the request with you, but—.  And I'm not sure exactly how I'm asking myself this, but it's sort of, "What do I do next?"  (silence)</p>

<p>Seems like what I'm doing is facing it and saying, "Yes, that's one of those things that's hard for me."  And so I know what I have to steer around, because when I think, "Well, what do I do next?"  one thought comes to me that what I do is, what I really wanted to do, I mean in one sense what I wanted to do, which was to ask you directly, and yet I think I'm afraid to still.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, uhm, there's, uhm, what—, part of what I said that you leave out and I wonder why?  What I was really calling your attention to was that you weren't asking, you were demanding.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't refer to that.  Instead you tell me about a number of little boys who demand in one way or another, by their behavior, by talking or pushing or some way.  But you tell me about them, and you don't refer to yourself.  Because I think you must really must feel like each of these little boys.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  What I think then is that (hesitates) I was still, I guess, really not facing that, or trying to pretend I wasn't, I don't know, somehow demanding.  Because I think that when I was younger, I did demand with my family and nothing happened.  And so then it seemed I covered it up somehow, so it wasn't like demanding anymore, and it was very much more manipulative which is what I tried with you at first and—.  And then it wasn't a demand, and "yes" or "no" answer.  It was—, I could, I don't know—.  If things didn't work out quite right, I could kid myself about how I hadn't really manipulated quite right.  But it was never I asked, and I was refused then.  Or I demanded, and I was refused.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ready?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I usually budget about ten minutes between getting to the Square and finding a spot and I did not. That's usually sufficient but it was not today. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) So what's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Rape. It's been a week for it. Part of the challenge of having activist friends is occasionally all anyone invites (ph) for circle can talk about is whatever horrible thing is going on in the world right now. So yeah, it's really horrible and (pause) unless I disengage entirely from social media it's kind of in my face and I can't avoid seeing people discussing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mostly because of their contents? [00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) (sigh) So a couple of years ago — I guess it was exactly four years ago — I was working Barack Obama's primary campaign against Clinton. My sister was a huge Clinton fan but I was going to do some campaign stuff for a week. My sister invited me to stay with her even though she was the president of her university's chapter of Democrats for Women or whatever it was called. And (sigh) I can't remember how the conversation started. I guess...well she was telling me about how Obama wasn't pro-choice enough and that's why she was supporting Clinton and it started out as a political discussion and then turned into a discussion about rape where she insisted that the majority of women who say they were raped are lying and that rape is over-prosecuted (ph). So I busted out the statistics from the FBI and (inaudible) and the CDC and National Institute of Health and all of these other bodies that say, "No actually it's completely backwards!" [00:02:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I would think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And she said that she couldn't understand why anyone would not go to the police and I tried arguing from the perspective of, you know, "These are the statistics and these are stories about how rape survivors are treated." And she was just not having any of it so I told her my own story hoping that it would establish some kind of empathy or something because she was just like balls (ph) to the wall, "If you didn't go to the police you weren't really raped. People who didn't go to the police but then want to say they were raped, they're all liars and they're looking for attention." (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My goodness! That's craziness! Like, a lot of craziness! There are differences of opinion but that's like a difference of reality. I mean the standard of who's raped is who's gone to the police about it doesn't make any sense. [00:03:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. So I told her my story and she was like, "Well you should have told Dad." And I was like, "What the hell good would that have done?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) Oh my God!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was like, "He would have taken your side and he would have made sure the asshole went to jail." So I was like, "Okay so first of all, no. Second of all, I kept dating the man who raped me so getting Dad involved would not have helped anything. And third of all, I wasn't even really able to name what happened to me as rape until a year after the fact." Maybe longer; I can't remember now. But it was horrible and gross and I felt awful but being able to name it for what it was took some time so (pause)...but anyway. [00:04:41]</p>

<p>That all reminded me of a conversation I had with my dad a couple of months after the rape where there was a news article about these two women in Saudi Arabia who had been abducted off the street while they were walking to the market and raped and how they were being sentenced to stoning for adultery. We were visiting my grandparents and my grandparents brought it up as an example of how barbaric Muslims are and it was this horrible racist thing between them and my dad.</p>

<p>But later I was talking to my dad about it and I was saying, "You know it's really not fair. How could anyone apply this punishment when they were wearing burqas, right?" The social contract in Saudi Arabia says that if you keep covered, you're safe. That's....that's the unspoken social contract, it's not a legal thing. But that's part of the rationale given for why women are required to cover. If you keep covered it protects you from sexual assault and it clearly didn't and I was getting very upset about this. My dad just kept maintaining this position that they must have done something. I was like, "This is the middle of the day, high noon, and they were walking to the market to buy bread for their children. They weren't out alone, they were together. It was two of them walking together. What more could you possibly ask?" And he just kept on going. I was like, "No matter what you do, no one deserves to be raped." And he was like, "Well maybe it wasn't their fault — these two women — but no matter that (ph) if everyone who is raped is asking for it because they wear short skirts and American women are drunk and sluts and whores." And I was just like, "Excuse me?" I was like, "Listen, hypothetically what if you're just in your house and someone breaks in and rapes you?" And my dad said, "Well, what are you wearing?" I said, "It doesn't matter. It's in your house." And he was like, "Well if they saw you through the window and they couldn't help themselves if you were wearing something skimpy." And I was like, "Ok, let's say you're wearing long sleeves, long pants, flannel baggy pajamas, you're in your own house, and your curtains are all closed." And he says, "Well it's your fault because you should have locked the door." I said, "What if the door was locked and they picked the lock?" My dad was like, "Well you should have a deadbolt and a security system." And I said, "Well what if they got in by breaking a window?" And he said, "Well then you should have called the police immediately." And I said, "What if you live far away and the police can't get there in time?" And he was like, "Well you should live closer to the police station." I said, "Well what if there..." [00:07:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) What is this about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "What if there's a hurricane and the phone lines are out and so you can't call the police?" And he says, "Well then you should fight them off. If you don't fight it's your fault if they break in and rape you." And I said, "Well let's say you try to fight but they weigh 250 pounds and they're a football player holding you down." And my dad says, "Well why don't own a gun then?" And I said, "Okay, let's say I do have a gun but the state I live in has gun lock laws and by the time I unlock the gun the rapist has pulled his gun and is shooting me?" My dad says, "Well as soon as you heard the window break you should have gotten out of the house and run." And I said, "Well, what if you were in a car accident and your legs were broken and you can't run?" At which point my dad just spluttered and was like, "Well you should have drawn your gun faster. (pause) Besides, that never happens because nobody would rape someone unless they're asking for it." [00:08:26]</p>

<p>(pause) It was just so ridiculous, the contortions he went to. (pause) And so you know when my sister said, "Why didn't you tell Dad?" it... (sigh). Especially since she was present for that conversation I just recounted. It had been a few years before the conversation I had with her but she was there for it and she grew up in the same house as I did so it's not as if she didn't know Dad's thoughts on victim blaming.</p>

<p>So anyway that's been in my mind today because there's just been so much discussion in my social network among my friends about legitimate rape and how the whole concept of legitimate rape victims is complete bullshit and...(sigh). I don't know. I feel a little bit whiny for dredging this up because it's not as if I don't know that my sister and my parents are horrible human beings. And it's not as if this is new. This conversation with my sister happened in 2008. The conversation with my dad was like five years before that. But it's been really upsetting me, remembering it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Sure!</p>

<p>(silence from [00:10:10] to 00:11:15)</p>

<p>It seems to me — really too bad — that you (pause)...I think so much that you have to fight for or carefully descend your point of view on how you feel about these things - about bringing them up, about what rape involves, about (pause) people just being vulnerable to rape, there being situations, where generally there's really nothing that could have been done or the point isn't at all what could have been done. That's much more accurate I guess.</p>

<p>Like I said, it seems to me really unfortunate that (pause) you feel the need to kind of justify bringing this up when you're upset about it or justifying how awful or how - how about I just go with awful — all of this is.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:13:16] to 00:13:49)</p>

<p>I guess I want to add to make sure I make myself clear on this [as I hope it's clear in my putting it] (ph) I'm certainly not trying to blame you or tell you you're doing anything wrong, if you feel that way. I'm just saying it's really too bad.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:14:05] to 00:14:34)</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) Still mostly thinking that you know, all this stuff with (pause) - I guess I should explain stuff — these horrible conversations I've had with my family and my sister and my father and my sister and their reactions is really small potatoes compared to everything else going on, both in my life and in the world and (pause) I'm a little bit embarrassed that I can't just let it be water under the bridge and let it go. It's just my family being awful in the way that my family is always awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's small potatoes to you at all and expectedly not.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:15:42] to 00:16:26)</p>

<p>When you were in your conversation where your father is telling you it's your fault if you ever get raped and you were asking for it, it kind of means you're a slut. (inaudible) something drunken slut, whatever it is. Like, that's a small thing? I mean, that's a big thing, (pause) in any case but especially in what happened to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right but he didn't know what happened to me. I never told him so it was just his kind of generalized dickishness (sp) going on there as opposed to when he actually called me to my face a whore or when he said that he wished I had never been born or that was the greatest disappointment in his life. Those (sigh) were definitely meant much more personally and directly than this kind of theorizing about some hypothetical perfect virginal princess.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:17:41] to 00:18:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't try to compare which were the worst things he said (chuckle) or which was worse than (inaudible) but in itself this one seems pretty bad. As his daughter I guess I...you know what happened and I suspect this felt like a communication to you. Not because you thought he knew or could know but (pause) because it did indirectly say something about you, whether even right or not, I think.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:19:13] to 00:19:56)</p>

<p>Did it not feel that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also, for what it's worth, I have — I don't know if I said this before — I started working on a [health assess] (ph) about him which I would never say with much certainty never having met him first hand but (pause) I (inaudible) what he was doing felt like a communication to you in a way or (inaudible) plays through my mind been hard (ph) otherwise. I hear him constantly disavowing the possibility of having any vulnerability at all with anything. And I guess that's how I hear his crazy tirade with you as a way of pretending that — I'm going to say the woman but I think he's actually identified with who he's talking about — could be helpless in a situation like that. Do you know if he was ever physically or sexually abused? I would imagine it's not something you would talk about from what you said. [00:21:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was one massive fight we had, I was 17 or 18 and we were...it started out as something small as fights with him always did, like a minor disagreement where I refused to accept his point of view and then he starts throwing the kitchen sink at me. "you did this when you were 15 and you did that when you were 13 and you're a horrible daughter and you people, you Americans, don't understand. You're not my daughter. You're not really blah blah blah." And then I got upset and started screaming. And suddenly, as these things often did, we were both standing up just screaming at the top of our lungs across the kitchen table. And during that fight he screamed out that I didn't understand the sacrifices he made for us, that he sold his body in order to survive in the refugee camps. And that's the only thing he's ever mentioned and he was angry and you know, I'm not entirely sure what he meant by that. The phrase he used was, "sold my body." There's the obvious literal interpretation, right? But on the other hand my dad is known to exaggerate everything, everything. [00:23:03]</p>

<p>So you know, when we were...when I was a child living in Alabama — four, five, six years old — and my dad was earning maybe twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year and getting paid in freshly slaughtered chicken and jars of apple jelly from his patients. He would then describe that as, "We had no money and I never got paid at all and we were eating dirt." And I was like, "No, we didn't eat dirt. You were getting some money. We were poor but we had some money and we definitely weren't eating dirt."</p>

<p>You know, it's really hard to say...or like my dad talks about his sister's first husband who was an abusive asshole who beat his sister and tried to set his sister on fire. So he and his brother and his other brother in law went and beat this guy up. And the story I heard from everyone else in the family is that they beat the guy very badly and told him to stay the hell away from their sister or they would kill him. But my father goes around saying that they killed him. So God only knows what actually happened. [00:24:22]</p>

<p>I know both of my father's parents beat their children pretty badly as well and that's not something that's disputed by anyone in the family if you can even get them to talk about it. So he's got his own damage going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty evident. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He needs help. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The only reason why I said it is I could imagine as a child in the heat of the moment you heard it as most of us (inaudible) as being about you when at least by (inaudible) distance. I'm not at all of course trying to excuse it. Of course I know that's hurtful to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also I wasn't a child when that conversation happened. I think I was 19 or 20. Well into young adulthood. [00:25:30]</p>

<p>I don't understand why I keep wanting to re-litigate these disagreements with my parents. I mean in this particular conversation about rape and how it's always the rape victim's fault is the one that's in the forefront of my mind today and this week really. But this happens all the time that some little thing will remind me of some horrible argument we had and I'll just go over it in my head. Over and over and over again trying to figure out how I could possibly have said things differently to convince him of my point of view.</p>

<p>This happens when I see them also. There was this time when I was three and my sister was a newborn baby and my parents were out of the house and my grandfather was babysitting. He promised he would color with me and I went to get my coloring book and he was refusing to color with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this when he chased you around the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and he kept refusing to color with me and I kept getting more and more frustrated and I didn't understand that he was trying to take care of my baby sister so I threw the coloring book at him and it missed and I hit my sister because three year olds don't have much coordination. You know, he chased me around the house. I ran quite a bit. It felt like forever before he caught me and spanked me fairly hard. And to this day my parents will bring that up. They brought it up this past weekend even, talking about how I always hated my sister ever since she was born. And I was like...and as we were having this conversation Dave kept taking my hand and saying, "Sweetie? Let it go. Sweetie just stop." I just heard "stop." But it was very important to me to convince them that that's not what happened. It's not that I hated my sister. It's that I didn't understand and that I didn't mean to throw the coloring book at her and I was aiming at my grandfather and (sigh). [00:27:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe part of it is (pause) if you're not busy doing something trying to fend them off (pause) you feel like too helpless and vulnerable. In other words (pause) maybe it's sort of — not exactly the same — but kind of like actions (inaudible) to anxiety kind of thing where it just fighting about it or pushing back, not because it's going to get the result that it looks like you want, or maybe that you want, but also because it's just doing something. Is it self (ph) like kind of fantasy that makes you feel a little bit protected rather than so helpless?</p>

<p>(silence from [00:29:01] to 00:29:17)</p>

<p>It may take a little bit of...like when you were three it was clear you were running away from your grandfather because you thought might escape. We can be pretty sure looking back (chuckle) that you're in the house and he's a grown up and stuff. But I guess it makes me think of that...it's more dangerous...makes you feel safer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:30:03] to 00:30:22)</p>

<p>I just desperately want my parents to acknowledge that they made mistakes that hurt me. That's all, and (pause) every time I've tried to address, not the overall picture of you people were shitty parents, but just like individual circumstances where you know, maybe this wasn't fair, maybe we're just a touch over-reactive here. They just shut down and get defensive and tell me that they were good parents and they were better than their parents and I'm horrible and ungrateful. I don't know why I keep trying to wring this acknowledgement out of them. What is it, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different outcome?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you said that from "Unfamous" (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah [it may have been a quote that] (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's crazy and I want to just be able to let it go and (pause) quickly get over it.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:31:58] to 00:33:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I have lots of theories but I don't know. (inaudible)</p>

<p>(silence from [00:33:11] to 00:33:30)</p>

<p>[Are you sitting] (ph) here with sadness and say it was giving up on them or giving up on yourself or you're kind of feeling helplessness and vulnerability [that you're trying to find out? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could be; all of the above maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>(silence from [00:33:59] to 00:34:41)</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm going with vulnerability actually as the first. I don't know if (inaudible) but as the more immediate thing because I think you probably feel so (pause) upset about...I think it protects you from how upset and mistreated and helpless you kind of have still often been at their hand. And you need to cry and my only feeling is how you want to feel this way in general, something in here...(pause) (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. (pause) So I've always been slightly jealous of the people I know who actually left their parent's houses when they were teenagers or were declared emancipated minors. At least cut their parents out of their lives so they could stop having to live with their toxic bullshit because (pause) I don't know, I kind of — not kind of — definitely feel torn between the desire to be a good daughter and be beautiful and all of these cultural values that my parents and sister hold important to them, even though God knows they don't actually live out those values and perspective in their families of origin.</p>

<p>So there's that and then there's the desire not to have toxic people in my life. And I know I've cut peers out of my life for far less provocation because I just don't want bad people in my life. It's too draining and it costs too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:41]</p>

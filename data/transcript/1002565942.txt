<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, how you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  What's new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, everything's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I got into [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got into [DEIDENTIFIED].  Congratulations.  So, have you decided where you're going to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're definitely going.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Congratulations.  That's, that's tough to get in.  So, what was your index score, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what that is?  They have these charts where you take your SAT and GPA to get your score.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I haven't, I haven't sent in my SAT yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Do you know what score you got on your SATs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I just took it like a week ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I'll get the scores online pretty soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what you did on your ACTs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did a thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you did real well, yeah.  Good job.  So, are you excited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So you want to be an engineer, you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I just want to get my bachelor's in engineering, but I want to be a doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, get your bachelor's in engineering, and then switch it over and go to medical school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Med school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'm just thinking.  We had a few engineers in our medical school class.  Some of them had to take a few extra pre req courses, but now I learned they have these programs you can go to if you don't get all your pre reqs for medical school, you can go to these colleges and take an extra year just for pre med, and then get into medical school too.  So, there's all kinds of different ways you can do it if [DEIDENTIFIED] doesn't offer all the pre med courses you need, but, good.  So, when do you start, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, either late August or early September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Good for you.  Now, you know some other people that are there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of my friends, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thought you had some friends there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is funny because she's an identical twin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They both applied and only one of 'em got in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.  I guess she was a better student, and had better grades.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't even know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were in chemistry together, in AP chemistry, and they'd both get like within one point of each other on ever test, and every lab we do.  Like one of 'em got a fifty eight.  One will get a fifty nine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then, you know, we'll get a test, and one will get a hundred and four, and one will get a hundred and three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.  I'm surprised they didn't both get accepted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, well that's really good.  That's the toughest school in the state to get into I understand.  So, good job.  So, how's your mood been?  You been pretty happy then since you learned that, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that Wednesday I got suspended.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no.  What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I copped an attitude with my administrator, and they don't fly too well with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, how long—you got suspended for how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I was going to say you want to be careful.  You don't want to do anything that's going to jeopardize getting in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, 'cause you know, even though you're accepted, they can still withdraw it.  Did you know that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you get into any trouble or anything.  Uh, okay.  I know somebody that that happened to.  They had admitted to a college, and they got into some trouble and they withdrew the acceptance letter, and they had to go somewhere else before they actually started in the fall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, um, so has your mood—last time we talked you were pretty down.  Have you been feeling up most of the time?  Have you been up and down, or how's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been sick this last week.  So, it's been just kinda not really either one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What kind of sickness did you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  My throat hurts, and my glands are all big and that kinda nasal stuff going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have a fever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I did one day, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it hard to swallow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, strep's going around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I haven't been sick in over a year and a half.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you might—yeah, do you have big, swollen lymph glands?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Have you looked in your throat to see if you have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're huge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huge, and do you have white spots or them, or just huge?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might want to get checked for strep.  My son had it.  He had big, swollen red tonsils, and he had strep 'cause that's something you want to get antibiotics for 'cause if you don't, it can affect your kidneys and your heart.  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For something else.  So, I can double check with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would definitely tell him.  What are you going in tomorrow for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, just women stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, so is it your family doctor though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's just the family doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  Yeah, I'd definitely tell him about your sore throat 'cause if you do have strep, you want to get that taken care of.  So, you've been sick for about a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been fluctuating though like.  My brother got sick with bronchitis on Wednesday.  That was the day I stayed home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thursday I felt awful, and then Friday I felt kinda better.  Saturday and Sunday I felt great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then today I just feel awful again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Before you got sick, were you sleeping okay, or were you having trouble?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was sleeping good actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Okay, and before you got sick, how was your energy level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's doing okay, and how about your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before you got sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like my appetite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, what [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've always [INAUDIBLE].  I'm never hungry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so really fluctuates?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, do you know how much you're weighing these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no clue.  My weight changes on a day to day basis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what the range is that it varies with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One thirty five to one forty five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and how tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five six.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, so I guess you're concentrating pretty well in school.  You're getting good grades still.  Okay, so you only have one semester left?  You're getting close, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's something like sixty two days or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somebody's counting, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you having any anxiety or nervousness that's more than you'd expect?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not anything abnormal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you enjoying yourself when you're just hanging out with friends and doing things?  Okay.  Now are you still not on any medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  No, we wanted to change that though.  That's why my Mom's here.  She wanted to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you want me to have her come in when we're done talking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and do you know why she wanted you to go back on medicine?  Did she say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, 'cause that day Wednesday was a really, really bad day for me, like one of the lowest I've had in a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wednesday.  Yeah, it was just last Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Last week.  Okay, and you just got really depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I just woke up and I was in a really angry and aggressive mood, and I went to school.  I went to first period, and then I went to second period, and then I called down to go to the office for truancy stuff.  And I came all the way down to the other building to go to the office, and the administrator, there were three other kids there, and I've always, I've been called down for truancy every semester since I've been there.  I know how it goes, and sometimes I wait an hour and a half just sitting in the office waiting for them to tell me you have detention.  So, this day I was in such a bad mood.  I came in, and I asked if they were waiting for [NAME OTHER] and they said yes, and so I said screw this and left.  They called me back down again.  I came in, waited for fifteen minutes, and then left again.  I wasn't, you know, you're supposed to stay there.  So, he came and found me and we were both just in such a bad mood, and I was really mean, and so he said well, that's defiance and you're suspended.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then after that, I just had a really, really terrible day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's that, who's that like the vice principal or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's the vice principal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Assistant principal.  Okay, so you were suspended for how long that day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, 'cause that was in third period that he came and got me, and so I was supposed to go to fourth period, but I didn't and then I went, and then the next day I was suspended.  Tuesday was when I got in trouble.  Wednesday was when I got, so I guess it was Tuesday then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Do you, I don't know if you can answer this question, but do you think being off the medication has left you feeling more irritable or angry at times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't on it for too long to really notice being on or off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, it's hard to tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Um, what about any recent drug use in the last two weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got high twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, on pot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, alcohol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Anything else in the last couple weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, um, do you want to talk about anything else before I have your Mom come in and we can talk about what to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, then why don't I invite her in, and let's see what she wants to say.  How you doing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think I'm doing good.  Thank you.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm doing pretty well, thanks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good.  Sounds like me, don't I?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I sound like me, don't I?  Like normal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  I had a head cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it turned into a sinus infection, and by the time I went to get antibiotics, it had gone into my chest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I sounded.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's going around.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like a weird person, like almost three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  I just told [PATIENT NAME] she might want to get checked for strep.  She said she's going to the doctor tomorrow, cause it's going around, and she said she's got big, swollen tonsils.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Can I just put this on silent?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sorry, we'll never hear the end of it.  I'll silence it for good as soon as this calls.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So, how's your daughter doing, do you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  I think she goes through one period to relatively stable.  I mean there's that normal range.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then recently she had a pretty big mood swing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, uh, suspension.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I had, I had seen it coming for a few days where she gets quiet, and kinda moody and doesn't say much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ask her if she's okay.  Sometimes yes, but sometimes no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, and she's worried about college I think and finances.  I think, well, it's not what I think, but yeah, we went through a little episode here about a week ago [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it's about a week ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, with, and you said a mood swing [NAME OTHER].  Was it more the low side or the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, low.  Oh, it was low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I had seen it coming on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And sometimes she goes through, you know, kinda the non talkative, non responsive, not really excited about much, but then, you know, it, it comes back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But this time, it took a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bottomed out kind of?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It did bottom out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and have you talked with your Mom [PATIENT NAME] about medication and what you're taking or not taking or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I said that we should start it back up again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So she knew you weren't on it.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I knew she wasn't on it, but I thought it was her choice, and she said, remember the last time, you had changed medication and I couldn't afford it, and I had to really think about that, and I thought it's possible, but usually when she says I have a prescription at the pharmacy, she's talking about birth control, and I don't do that.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And she may be right, but I, I thought there was a conscious choice about a year ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That she just felt like she didn't need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I thought it was still Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But what is it?  What's her most current?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Topamax was the most recent one.  It's a mood stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Okay.  So, if, if that's still current, we can go fill that today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just looking to see.  I may even get you a new one if that's what we said.  [PATIENT NAME] do you want to go back on the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, why don't I get you a new one?  New prescription then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause we're going to have to do a couple of things.  We're going to have to increase it slowly, um, start back on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then make sure there's no problems with it.  Now, with Topamax, again, there usually aren't many side effects with it.  Sometimes it can decrease appetite a little bit.  Um, there's kinda rare side effects like rarely it can increase the risk of kidney stones.  You don't have any history of kidney stones, do you [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, not that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't think so.  No family history of kidney stones?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and if you go up too fast in the dose you can get kinda nauseous with it.  That's why we increase it more slowly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like toes and fingers tingling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, tingling.  Some people get like that feeling when your arms and legs go to sleep and they wake up.  Not that severe, but just that tingling.  Did you get that tingling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my toes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, it's nothing dangerous.  It's just the nerves firing a little bit.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But otherwise, it's a pretty safe medicine.  It just has the benefits of stabling—stabilizing the lows and the highs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you had any highs recently?  High spells where your mood was either up or, you know, euphoric or irritable where you felt tremendous energy, didn't eat or sleep much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not recently.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, it sounds like most of the time doing pretty well, you've been dipping more down the low side than the high side, is that right?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I would say so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any other concerns [NAME OTHER] at all?  Any other problems or observations?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, I think we talked on a Monday night, Tuesday night maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tuesday night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Tuesday night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause Wednesday I was suspended.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And Wednesday we had staffing at my school for a little guy that, he's only in fourth grade, but he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD, and just from reading several articles, I wondered how they were able to distinguish between bipolar because there's so many symptoms, and they say it's often confused with ADHD, but this kid has both diagnoses.  For whatever reason, they don't treat the ADHD.  He takes Seroquel and, um, Depakote and something else.  I mean some significant meds, Tenex maybe is one of them.  Tenex.  Yeah, a half mg.  Anyway, but Ma is very well educated and advocates, and so she had given me another little folder with some articles, and I was reading through it, and I'm thinking about her son, you know, and then I almost, it was like as I'm reading down this little list, and it's a full page list, but it was like I was like almost giddy with excitement because I recognized so many on that list, and at the same time I was just feeling like crying because I thought this is wow, and I shared it with [PATIENT NAME] the next night, not at [DEIDENTIFIED] when we met, but the next night, and I said there's four or five of them [PATIENT NAME] that really are so unusual, not just could be moody, you know, but these are some big red flags that I saw.  She looks at them and she goes, well, there's more than four or five, and I'm diagnosed, you know, didn't she want to have this diagnosis, and I thought I did not know that.  I knew that we were thinking along those lines, but I did not know that it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's not, what I have, and I have major depression rule out bipolar disorder, which means rule out means it's a possibility, but the medication that we're trying, the Topamax, is for bipolar disorder.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I think it's very possible, very possible.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The problem [NAME OTHER] the criteria we have to diagnose bipolar disorder are really designed for adults 'cause when I went through medical school a long time ago, they didn't believe the kids could get bipolar disorder.  They thought it only happened in late teens, early twenties is when it started.  So, they're trying to develop new criteria to diagnose kids because kids present a little differently.  For example, to meet the criteria for bipolar disorder in adults, you'd have to have a manic episode that lasts at least a week, and a depressive episode that lasts at least two weeks, but a lot of times kids have much more rapid mood swings than that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, yeah, that's a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is.  In adults, that happens, but it doesn't always happen in kids.  So, they're working on revising those criteria for kids.  So, right now, we kinda wing it in kids and teenagers, to be honest.  You know, we think does this child have the symptoms of bipolar disorder even if they don't meet the strict criteria, and if they do, we'll try medications, and if the kids respond to the medications, we say they probably do have bipolar disorder.  So, that's why we're trying some of the mood stabilizers to see if [PATIENT NAME] will feel better on them, and if she does that will help kind of helps confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, and that, it was just splitting hairs, but she seemed so sure that oh no, this is, that's old news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They told me that in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Okay, but I, I thought it was, yeah unofficially, but you know, table talk.  I put my money there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I know, I understand why there are reasons that you, it's very, very difficult.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the other thing that'll happen just to warn you, right now the book we use is this book right here called the DSM 4.  It's the diagnosis, yeah, the diagnosis, I mean you may have heard of that, fourth edition.  They're coming out with a fifth edition.  They're going to change the criteria again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ooh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when they do, some people's diagnoses are going to change because all of a sudden we have new criteria as we learn more about it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean this has happened, [PATIENT NAME] just so you know, over the years.  They keep revising this manual as they learn more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you know this.  Yes, they keep revising it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But this one's been around for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's been around a while now, years.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, they need to come up with a new edition that's more up to date, but it's a little confusing for people when they say well, wait a minute, how come I had this diagnosis before and now I have this diagnosis.  I haven't changed, and they're right.  It's just that the criteria changed.  So, that's, um, and really the difference between major depression and bipolar disorder, whether the people have the manic episodes or not, and the reason that's important is treatment is different.  If you just have the lows, people typically do well with an antidepressant.  If people have the lows and the highs, they really need a mood stabilizer and taking antidepressants alone sometimes can make things worse.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, we have to be a little careful.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, that's why I think, you know, we'll probably have to try the mood stabilizers.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if we can level things off.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm on board that we're treating it as if—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	As if it is, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was, I felt like I was like I didn't know something I should have known.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, there's no, there's no test that she's been given, or that I could give her.  I wish there was.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they're actually working on a test, and [PATIENT NAME] I don't know if I mentioned this to you.  This is something you may be interested in if you're going to medical school.  There's a twenty site study going on right now throughout the United States from Johns Hopkins in the east to UC Irvine in the west and Denver's involved, where they're doing something called QEEGs.  It's an electrical mapping of the brain, and looking, they're developing a huge database, ten of thousands of people, and looking at what medications people respond to, and what they're trying to do is come up with better criteria to determine who's going to respond to which medicine.  Now, it's trial and error.  We say okay, I think this one's probably going to work.  Let's try it and see.  With this brain mapping, the hope is that they will be able to do this test and say okay, here's the medicine you're most likely to respond to, and what I read and hear is they're having some success.  It's not refined well enough yet where I can order the test, and say let's try this medicine, but the hope is that with maybe, within maybe five, ten years, we'll be able to do this test and say here's the medicine that's likely to work for you, and here are the ones that probably won't, and when that happens, we'll be even more effective at making diagnoses too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Awesome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, it's a slow process, but, uh, it's getting there, and the important thing in the meantime is to find what's going to work best for you.  So, [PATIENT NAME] it sounds like you're okay getting back on the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me get you a new prescription then, and what we'll do is, um, let's see.  I think you were taking the 100 mg tablets before, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What we might do this time is just have you cut 'em in half, and take a half one for a week, and then a full one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, the quickest way to get it back up to a good dose, and it usually works.  Do you have any questions about the medicine or [NAME OTHER] do you have any questions about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, does it have anything with birth control?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  There's a small chance it could reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills.  So, you just need to let your doctor know if you're using birth control pills, they might need to adjust the dose a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, just let them know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll see him tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, just let them know that you're on it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just happen to have this appointment where—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perfect timing, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She can mention that, and have him peek at her throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good deal, and I think, were you taking this at bedtime before, weren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, it can be taken any time of day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can I do it in the morning though 'cause I take my other one in the morning?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can.  That would be fine as long as it doesn't make you tired, and most people it doesn't.  If it does, just switch and take it at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so here's that.  You're welcome.  So, let's try that and maybe check back in four or five weeks, and make sure it's working.  Does that sound all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, let's see where that will put us.  It's the fourth one.  Somewhere around [DATE] to [DATE].  Um, with their schedules, is there a day of the week that works best?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Spring break, isn't it the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Any time is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, around three thirtyish like this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could do [DATE] a Monday at three thirty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I like having Monday off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're off from school in Mondays?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I was like well, wait a minute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause whenever we schedule appointments, I just take it off.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't even like [INAUDIBLE].  I see.  I get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thought you had a great schedule this semester.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Do you remember [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE] at three thirty.  How does that sound?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE] at three thirty.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I did have a quick question about the rehab thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] mentioned something about rehab, and I told her that if you need it, you need it.  Well, we can't afford it.  That's, that's not it.  That's not the whole point.  I don't want to.  I don't think I need it.  Well, now that would be important, you know, to, you know, have somebody go through that who doesn't think they need it, and doesn't want to be there.  And it's like, you know, the cart before the horse.  You know, do you get the medication to stabilize her mood so that you're not, you know, self medicating with other things.  Do you need to be on that medication and show some self control when it comes to drinking or smoking pot or whatever because I think there's, I think both the kids might have a pre, what is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Disposition.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And Dad is the first one to say that.  He'll say—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [NAME OTHER] there's no one right answer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean the key is to address both issues, mood disorder and substance abuse.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think by getting on the medicine, we can certainly try to stabilize the mood to the degree we can.  If someone continues to use substances while they're taking medicine, the medicine may not be totally effective either.  So, and there are—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or the medicine may be effective with the moods, but they're still gonna go out and do that as well.  I think that's just some conversations we need to keep having.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, and I think the key is to keep an open mind because, um, most kids and most adults don't feel like they need rehab or need help.  If they, they want to stop, they can they think, but I just had a phone call last night with my best friend from high school.  You know, I've been out thirty years now.  He's hooked on cocaine and he can't get off, and he started using it in college, and he said [PHYSICIAN NAME] he said, it's just, I just can't stop.  He said he's been in rehab programs, many of them, but he won't stay.  He always leaves, you know, halfway through it, and he just don't want to stay in treatment, and he's probably going to die one of these days, and it's just so sad when you talk to him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It is sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he's, he just won't get help.  So, that's cocaine.  That's a, that's a horrible drug because it just changes people so badly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, you know, any substance has the, alcohol can do the same thing to people, or pot can do the same thing.  So, um, if at some point you feel like you want to get any kind of help.  I mean there are outpatient treatment programs.  There are inpatient treatment programs.  There's all different kinds of resources, and we can always talk about that, and some of them are free.  Some of them are even paid for.  Okay, so I just want you to know that there's always help out there, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well.  I'll tell you, it's a scary time.  There are a lot of kids dying right now, or having serious consequences.  I just had two kids [INAUDIBLE] last week get arrested for felony charges, distributing marijuana.  Their, their lives are never going to be the same.  They're eighteen years old, and they're going to prison, and they won't be doing a lot of things anymore.  So, and they're—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so, and they're really starting to crack down 'cause they're realizing it's such a huge problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] yesterday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When, you said with the, what's that called when they go through your nose—the bronchis with the bronchoscope?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What is it that goes through the nose, and they said and of course, we numb it up a little bit, and I said well, how do you numb it up?  Cocaine.  I said no you do not.  You are, that is too much.  He goes no, really, and I said oh, so you just have cocaine just laying, well no, we, you know, of course, it's locked and then he said, he named another little thing that they also use that sounds more medicinal, but I just blown away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah it has anesthetic properties.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But holy cow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but, uh, it's like so many things.  It can be used for, in different ways.  Just like alcohol.  They used to give alcohol to women in premature labor intravenously because it stopped their premature contractions before they had other—other medications.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it probably quieted them down a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Let's, it's been used in other ways too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thank you so much [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  You take care of yourself.  Congratulations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I probably won't come with her every time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, um, I just wanted to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any time [NAME OTHER], okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, and are you allowed to,—am I allowed to call you and like ask you things or just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's up to [PATIENT NAME].  At her age, she has to give permission.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Legally or otherwise I can't talk, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, if I got a question, and I told her to give you a call and leave a message.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If she says it's okay, then I can.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  That's what I figured.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You're welcome.  Okay, bye bye.</p>

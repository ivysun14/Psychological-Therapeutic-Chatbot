<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Wednesday, March 24th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is really fun. Ah. I found out something I think. (chuckling) You know how I feel about my grandfather? Well I think I was trying to feel that way about my teacher. It's sort of like a - I don't know whether it's a bad thing. I don't think it is. You know like I don't think it's like a regression. Because like I know I try and take my feelings and give them to somebody else and say, "Well now I'm cured." You know? But like, it's just like we're so close and it's so beautiful. Because like he's an older man...and like he's just - I don't know. Like last night we stayed out with him because he's leaving now for a month, and like I could feel that and see and everything but it was so funny, because I took his hand when he left and I said, "Well have a good trip." And he had tears in his eyes and I had tears in my eyes. It was just so beautiful, because like there was a caring there. But not so much like, like I feel like I had to grab onto him...but it's just like I'm going to miss him when he's gone. And it's beautiful because I think he's going to miss me too, and miss probably Chrissie, my girlfriend, too, because we're all...and then her husband, we're all pretty close. And it's just such a beautiful thing to feel that way again, and like I'm not afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I thought to myself, the only time I probably would feel hurt, if he decided that he didn't want to come back. I said, "Then it would probably hurt, if he says that, "Look, I'm staying down in Texas now." You know. But like I felt to myself, even if he died, say like...God forbid, so I'm saying...like my grandfather did, I don't think it would be that much of a - it would be a hurt but I don't think it would be like it was before... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like a big trauma, because - and then I figured like if I met somebody else like him I could get that grand fatherly love all over again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It's that what you have with him is the same kind of warmth you had... </p>

<p>PATIENT: With my, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with your grandfather, but... [overlapping voices at 0:01:57.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's not - and I'm not trying to make him take the place of my grandfather. I realize when I first started with him that he reminded me of my grandfather in ways. But it's not - I can't really say that I...I analyzed it and I can't really say I like him because he's like my grandfather but, you know. But it's just like...like I said, the first thing I remember, he was like my grandfather. He's older and he's that type of a man...that you can give like a fatherly love to or a grand fatherly love to and it's nice. It's just a...like a really beautiful thing and he's got so much love to give, you know. And then there he is and then there you are, and you're first starting to give and you find somebody like this and it's so - it's kind of a big help because, when you find somebody whose like sharing like that and like, even though there's other people around who might be hurting you or whatever you feel like, they're hurting or you feel like they're whatever...it's like you've found something here but you just, you're just plain honest, you know? (both chuckling) He just comes out and says, "Ah!" You know. And it's so - I don't know. And I really, I really feel like a real closeness to this man, partly because of that. He's just, it's just his honesty and just his love. And he just...he says like, they call me saying - he said, "Well I'm not a smart man but I agree." (chuckling) And he's giving all this philosophy, you know, "I'm not a smart man." "Okay, yeah, okay." (both chuckling) You know because he feels that way because like he's not educated...by the school system, that type of thing. Like he's been into every business you want to...imagine and everything. He's been teaching since he's been 16 years old. And, but it's so funny...like what comes out when he says, he said, "I'm kind of a dumb man." (chuckling) But...like and he just started to laugh, because...he's just being - I think it's more or less humility with him if anything else, because I'm sure he doesn't really think he's dumb, because...you can tell it. I mean he is not dumb. He's very smart. And he's not like a person with an inferiority complex. [0:03:49.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's a beautiful thing. It's not like somebody saying, "Oh well, I'm dumb." You know like, "I can't do any better." You know and you go, "Oh, go...away."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the main thing is that he's really good for you that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the other things I'll - I don't feel, even when I first started there, it was still a bit that I was afraid that he liked me better, you know. I know it was creeping and I could feel it and I knew it. And I said, "Look, you know like..." And I really had the feel too, not just thinking like, "Well you're not supposed to think this way because it's...like it's not right or whatever." But I just felt like, after a while, like I don't care if he - even if he liked her better for certain reasons or whatever, I just didn't care anymore. And the funny thing is, is now that we both have like a really great relationship with him, and he probably feels differently about each one of us and maybe likes us even in different ways, but he likes both of us, so what. You know, so what if say, "Well I think I like her one drop better than you." But so what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As long as he likes you too, who cares? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and that's the way I'm getting to feel about him, like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like being compared or being one upped or one downed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right. It's almost... [overlapping voices at 0:04:52.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's put in perspective for what he... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ... put in like a different type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...for what she did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's why, that's why Chrissie and I get along so well, because it's like that. You know my girlfriend, (hitting desk) again, she's just, she's getting to bug me again about some things. And I realize now through meeting other people and getting other friends that it's not only me...again. And it's like things like, she keeps calling it my 'running thing' and, "You shouldn't be spending so much time on that." Which should - in a way she makes sense. You know like I can't devote my whole life to running. I say, "I don't. I only go twice a week." "But you should be out taking classes so you can make more money quicker and then you can do it." You know and all this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whose saying this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My girlfriend. So I said, "Fine. I'll get a weekend job." Which I'm going to do, because...like I'm moving into an apartment with nothing, (chuckling) no money...whatever...so I have to get extra money. But, okay. So I said, "All right, I'll get some kind of job and then when I'm finished with my reading course I'll take training on Saturdays." "Oh, no, no. You should do it right now. Drop one day of running or both days." But see, because she - the thing is I don't think she wants to realize, she doesn't want me running. She really doesn't I don't think. She says, "Well I dropped one day of aerobics." "Well, you're already an instructor in aerobics. You've taken it for a year. I'm a beginner runner." When you go into anything if you don't devote enough time to it right in the beginning...you may as well not take it. Why start it and then...And I tried to explain it to her and she says, "Well...you going to need this. You need money for that. You need time for this. You need time for that." I said, "Okay, okay." So, (big sigh)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she's been poking at you? [0:06:16.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I told her, I said, "Look, this is the first time I'm really getting other friends besides...you and Eliza, and Eliza is not really that close to me." And I can feel it. She's close to Jodie but not to me, really. And I...it's an honest thing. I just realized, "Look, she's not, so she's not. So what am I going to do, cry about it." You know. So, what I feel like with these new people is that I feel, first of all, I'm not in competition with them and I like it. And I mean, and they're very intelligent and Lee is very pretty and things like this. So it's not, it's not that type of thing. I think, again, like I think part of it is because our personalities are so the same. That she's got a hangup because of her father. I've got a hangup, probably something to do with my father or at least to do with some man that was very close to me. And so...you've got two of us in the same house and Jesus, no wonder! You know. It's like we've both vying for attention. She doesn't realize she - I don't know, maybe she does and she just tells me she's not, but I can see it...she vies for attention. It's so funny. And so I start doing the same thing too, so we're both doing it. And I said, "This is unhealthy for even us both to be together, because we both have the same hangup."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just aggravate each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's it and we egg each other on more or less. I'm probably worse because I'm less secure and I admit it. But I'm saying that there is that element there, because I don't have it with Chrissie. I started to because of a natural defense and then I thought to myself, "Look, I don't have to compete with her." You know like we all go out together and there's certain people who think I'm prettier than...prettier or pretty or whatever, and some people think she's very...like we have all the fellows, and it's so funny, like six fellows and they sit around and they're talking to both of us, you know? And it's just a nice thing, because like I don't feel like, "Now I have to jump in here." So I make some cute remark or whatever, because they're paying more - you know? And that's the way I used to feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like otherwise I was just sitting on the outside. Well partly because Chrissie and I - lets see. Neither one of us are really show stealers. I'm not unless I'm forced into it or unless I feel like nobody's paying any attention to me, and like she's sort of the same way. So I mean we're both fun to be with and fun to have around but we're not - neither one of us wants the center of attention, period, boom! You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't get sneaky about taking it away. [0:08:20.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then, because like I can be very easily slighted when I'm in a situation like that. I start feeling inferior. I say, "Jesus, that was a smart - that was a good remark and I can't come back with it." Or I try to do the same thing in the other person's type way and you can't do that. Because then you end up being...I agree with it, then you end up being second best when you try to imitate. But I found something else though too, that I never used to. I can at least put my finger on it now when I'm doing it. It's like people I admire, like you, like my reading teacher who realized too, she does something that's very feminine, very soft, and I really admired it and didn't realize it until I started to really realize that I was doing it out last night. And like that was like the first time I realized that sometimes I do, do this. You know it was so funny. Because I was, "Oh, this is - now that's a Jodie, don't do it!" And I got back to me. (both chuckling) You know, "Oh, that's a Regina, don't do it! Come back to me." (both chuckling) But I notice it now. You know it's like I do know that like everybody sort of does that a little bit. If there's something that they really admire about somebody, all of the sudden they start taking it into themselves. And again, I don't think it's all that bad if it's natural, but like when you feel yourself all of the sudden playing a role and you say, "Huh-uh. No, no, no." And then stop...because that's not good. But again, it's like - like I don't think Eliza realizes she's doing the same thing Jodie does when they're together. She's not Eliza anymore. She's trying to be, she's another Jodie. And you think - in some ways she's still her contentious (ph) self...she puts her nose (ph)...like that. (chuckling) She's really cute but like sometimes I see it, like she's just like I was doing. And we talked about this last night. And I think it's so funny, because I didn't mention her name, but like I started talking and I realized what I was saying is the way I feel about our relationship now...our friendship relationship that's starting - I don't feel like I'm as close to her. She says...like...like we're still good friends and everything, but like I don't feel as close to her. Like when she goes away I'll write to her and everything but like it's not that real close bond I've felt. And I realized something that that bond I felt was mostly - like we were talking, as I said...like about teachers. And I said, "A teacher is good unless the only reason she can teach, or bring up or whatever, is like a security and like a power over that person." You know like, "You do this, this way because that's the way it's done." " Why?" "Because I say so." And then when you see the person doing this...it's like saying, "Aha! I have the power over them." You know to mold them or whatever you want to call it. And this is not bad unless you get to the point where now you take this person out as a friend, not because of what their natural (ph)...what their own qualities are but because they're still somebody that you can take and maneuver and say, "Do this. Do that. And you shouldn't do this because it's not right. And you should do this and you should do that." You know and the person will do it. And it's sort of like - I feel like this is the way she would feel. And like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way your relationship was before, that she was kind of the teacher then in this light or just... [overlapping voices at 0:11:11.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I would imitate her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you were... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then finally she got mad at that she says...but apparently she says it's mostly for me. I think maybe it was just a little irritating, because I know it irritates me when somebody really imitates me. It just you feel like, "Ah!" (making noise) You know, for a while. But no, it got to the point that - the reason I put that together is because like when I went to run- and I thought this last night too, I said, "Look, I'm into reading now." And the reading was not the kind of reading she took. She took Evelyn Woods. I'm taking from Roosevelt. You know, so all right, so I'm changing it around. I'm doing my way, you know? Then I go running, which is still - it's still it's sort of, you might say it was almost following her and yet, I'd always wanted to take some kind of self defense, so this was something really I wanted to do, but I was afraid of aerobics. This is mostly why I went into it. Not even because she took it. But I was afraid of falling and I thought this is the only way I'm going to get over it, is to take some aerobics. And I didn't even know if I was going to go to, for show it on or just like the first 25 lessons. And then what did I do, just the first 25 lessons. But anyway, I got into running and she keeps cutting it down! You know and like, she might be just doing what she says and trying to see how strong my wings are that I'm testing, which is possible, but I think it's more than that. I think it's she doesn't like the idea that now I'm starting to go out on my own and I'm trying to build my own life. It's hard to do because...like, Jesus, I still got hangups...that I'd like to get rid of and there's...insecurities. Like I'm afraid like somebody's not going to like me and then I'm going to be all left all alone and things like this. There's still that...that creeps up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd like to get rid of them but you're not going to ignore them, and this running thing is really important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And this is it, and like to her it doesn't seem important at all. You know and so this is another thing. This is where she - I said she was yelling and she was like picking on me, because her and her mother were over. And partly I spoke emotionally because this was building up in me...like she kept saying, "That running thing, you shouldn't spend so much time on it. And well you shouldn't come home so late because people are going to..." Because our apartment was robbed. So like the last excuse was, "You shouldn't come home too late because people might follow you home and case the apartment and know you're not home late at night."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess what you were... </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...saying before is like, if you're a friend with somebody then they're not like that. They're not that authoritarian teacher anymore. They're kind of more [with it.] (ph) [overlapping voices at 0:13:19.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See this was it. Can you - what I'm trying to say to her is like, "I am not your student anymore." You know. "I want to be your friend but I want it on an equal but different level." You know, okay, so maybe she's deeper into thought, analytical thought and the whole bit. So maybe she's deeper in meditation. "Okay! So on certain levels you're lots higher than I am. Okay, I admit it." You know, but my abilities in that lie in a different area, not with the same...the same as hers. And so I don't want to compete with her anymore. This is one of the reasons I won't to take voice lessons until she's gone, because she'll think I'm competing with her again. You know, "Oh, I've always wanted to sing since I was knee-high." You know. And it's like, things like, part of the reason I got out of aerobics was the same thing. I didn't like the coordination thing. And you know now she even admits that, like when I was there the head teacher was doing things like, oh, he wanted to take me out to a movie so that he could take me home and see her, you know. And he wanted me to come to a party or something. He said, "Yeah, sure. Are you sure you told Jane about the party?" And all this to my girlfriend. He was trying to get...to her through me, because they had, had a fight. [0:14:25.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said to myself, "Boy, if this is the way he is..." Like my instructor wouldn't do that. If he doesn't like somebody or if he doesn't like what you're doing, (making noise). You know if he doesn't like you he doesn't have you around him. You know, he doesn't use people. And I can't stand that, because that's just what he was doing. He was trying to use me and I won't let anybody use me anymore, you know? And it made me, but I was really kind of proud of myself because I didn't feel hurt when he said that. I didn't, I really didn't feel hurt, because I just felt like, "You're the jackass, not me." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, "If you're going to be like that with people, you're doing it with not just me but lots of people." And like I know he did this to this one fellow when she was around. When he said - no he said something to Eliza and this one fellow who likes Jodie that, he said, "Jodie is high..." - and he didn't say which one he was talking to. And the guy says, "Oh, the way he just looks at him and says, 'Not to you.'" (chuckling) You know, I mean what a thing to say to somebody. It's like the guy's ego went (making noise) right down, you know. And it's like, but he does this, this sneaky, back slighting thing, and that's one of the reasons I got to the point where I said, "Huh-uh." You know? How do you even know when the person's nice to you that they really want to be nice to you or they're just trying to find out what's happening with somebody else, you know? And I said, "I don't need that kind of stuff. Not at all."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's almost like that whole world you don't need that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The aerobics and the - and having Jodie treat you as a pupil and the whole thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're ready just to get rid of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, see what I think might happen is when she comes back, like after I've had some time to develop, again, in my own areas, and she comes back. Well she's going to be all over the world, so she'll have lots of experiences and that's bigger. But I don't believe that it's absolutely necessary to grow...to be traveled. I think you can grow just being right where you are and...like going into whatever area you're interested in. And I think maybe it might be a little bit more, because like first of all, I'll be more mature. I'll be a few years older then. And maybe when she comes back she's not going to think of me as like...like the little student that I have to carry along and pull her along...like - because it really - she says she wants me to stand on my own two feet, but then as soon as I do she tries to knock me down again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I cannot understand it. I don't know whether it's me, whether it's just the way I'm taking it or whether that's the way she means it or whether it's just like a mix up between the communication or what it is. But like, boy, it really, it's really starting to get to me. You know and this is one of the reasons I'm not home. I don't want to be home. I don't want to talk to her about it, because she'll keep saying, you know, "You should do this. You should do that. You should do the other thing." And oh, Christ.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you check that out with her? Can you talk about it with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose I should. Just find what the heck - well of course...like how do you tell her? You know like, "Well hey, do you still think of me as your student?" Because...I don't know how to word it with her, because I don't know how she feels and I don't know, like even how I feel anymore. I just...like I just feel like I don't want to be - one of the things is, I don't like to be with her too much anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well what I meant when I said... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...check it out was, tell her how you feel. That you feel like what you just said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That when you break out on your own she cuts it down and you wonder what's going on. You know, why is she doing that? [0:17:34.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I should just come right out and ask her. Because I started talking about - what was the other one? I had another problem with her and I started to, I started - I did get a little bit more of the idea of what she was trying to present or something. And I guess I was a little bit raw in one area...like I had missed - and I can't remember what it was. - I kind of misconstrued it. But like this is why I spoke so emotionally when her mother and her were over. And I said, "Look, running is the most important thing to me in my life." But I just did it because it was like she kept saying that 'running thing' and this and that, wherever you're going...and...it was just like, "Come off it. I learned aerobics the first day. You can train to run when I..." (chuckling) You know when I started...taking it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like I just felt like...like she didn't want me to be into that. And now, but there's one thing is when she said that...like I felt shunned...like being that way and like not paying any attention to me. This was one of the reasons I left. And one of the reasons that every time I say him, "Oh, how's Jodie? Is she home? Is she going to be coming today?" Like, "How do I know what her schedule is?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, just because I live with her, I know she's going to be in class Monday or...like whatever? And...like part, most of it, actually most of it was him and...that just the whole like attitude of the people there. They had little cliques and...you couldn't permeate them unless you were some kind of a special personality, and I don't have that. I don't like to knock my head against a wall to push myself into a group. I said, "The hell with you." You know. Like we almost have a clique. I must say that. We have like favorite people. But like really, anybody who sits and talks to us, usually, for any length of time, we'll ask to go along with us...but there's not too many people that you want to. (chuckling) That's...so, I think like with cliques or whatever you want to it, like we say we almost have a clique in our...dojo (ph). And that's that if you don't enjoy somebody's company...you're not going to ask them along first of all. And if like the person doesn't like what the...group is or whatever and they don't want to join, and that's...like it's a two-way street, then again, why should they be in? But, if a person would like to get in - like I actually did want to get into some of the groups, and, but part of it too, like just because I wanted to be in what Jodie was in and she was going to all the parties and everything. - and I felt like I wanted to get in. But like actually, most of those people there I didn't care for anyway. I really...like they were either too young or they were too - I don't know - I didn't enjoy them. So...like when I think about it now, I'm with people that I enjoy and I really...just not only the class but the people and the instructor, I really love him...and everything. It's just...wow. But somehow I can't convey that to her or I convey it so that she thinks I'm just living for running and nothing else, which is silly because I do...I do read and things for me reading class. I know I'm just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think that when you had a relationship for a long time that was like, both of you were stuck in certain kinds of roles, and she was the expert and you were the student and both... </p>

<p>PATIENT: All of us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of you bought that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:20:40.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you've been going through is kind of the process of realizing that you don't buy it anymore and you want to be treated differently, and you want her to see that you're different. So like whenever people break out of relationships like that, where they've been stuck in roles like this, it's rough going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard to do, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, for both of sides.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's what I figure too, that...like it's not that she wants to - I don't really think that she wants me to fail. I mean it's not like, I don't think it's malicious...again, like, it's just like she's not used to me being...this way. She just isn't. And I'm starting to get - well I don't know. Maybe I'm not like Eliza. Like she'll come up with things like, "Well Eliza's so aware and she didn't need college and she's the only person I know..." You know like in other words, "Get into college because you're so dumb, you're not aware...get going." And like I don't feel as if I am. But when I try to explain to her some of the things that have happened to me, she just goes, "Ay." You know and it's like I know that now I'm picking up on things. Like I'm picking up on like needs of people that you can just kind of pick out of the air and you know that you shouldn't say this or that you should say this or you should do this or whatever, just to help this person. And you can - like I think that's partly being aware or picking up things, like I never picked up before. Little slants and little...like whatever. And but...I pick them up, too. - Pardon me. - But she doesn't realize I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you're saying that is once again saying, 'I want you to be the way I want you to be and not your way.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not my thing. And like well I think - I don't know. Again, maybe it's just me. It's just the way I take it. But it's just, it's so hard to say. Like...here I was, I was something else and now I'm something different and I'm going on to be something different from that even. Now she did say, like one thing she told me the other day. That like the last two months I've been a better friend. But like I felt, except for when my sister came over, she did help a lot. She...set the table and she made some desert and she did really lots of nice things Sunday and helped me serve. But like in that last two months I have been doing most of the giving. You know like it's always I'm very considerate to her and I'm doing the dishes up when she...she's left them from the night before and I'm going...and I'm doing like all the things that...like would be nice. And I thought to myself, "Wait a minute. You know I'm getting almost like a slave in this place. You're having people over, so I clean and make sure everything is set." And...I come home from running the night before and - or was it, no I was working the night before. Like from ten o'clock at night I come home and I clean until 12:30 or one o'clock, so that her party the next day, which I'm not invited to - which...that was another thing that bugged me. She says like when I finally say I'm going out to dinner with my friends from my running club, I said, "I'm going out to dinner and then we're going out probably drinking." She says, "Oh, why don't you bring your friends back?" But it wasn't like - I wasn't even invited. She has a party in the house and she doesn't even invite me to it. The first thing I say when my friends are coming over, "Ghee, will you be home this day because I'd like you to meet my friends?" You know. But it's like, it's almost like she doesn't want me around anymore either, too, in this way, you know. [0:23:44.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can see that she doesn't care about you the way you care about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or at least maybe it's just...because like another time too, she had some people over and she told me the night before. She says, "Well if you're not doing anything why don't you stay around for dinner?" I mean...like the night before she'd been planning this. At the beginning of the week she says, "I'm having some people over Sunday." Because I wanted my friends to come over Sunday. And so I said, "Okay. You know you made plans, fine. You know I'll make it for some other day." But it's just like - she didn't even ask me. She didn't say, 'Well you know like if you're not anything then?' The night before she says, "Well if you want to stay around..." Because we were pretty...kind of [I guess bound] (ph)...we were home...so she was in a good mood. She says, "Well if you want to stay you can." Well right about that time - well first of all, I'd been at my sister's and gone through all sorts of trauma and I needed to be by myself for a while. Right about that time I said to myself, "I don't want to be here." Not on a last-minute notice. Like you wouldn't do that. If a fellow did that to me I'd tell him to go fly a kite. You know like the last minute, "If you're not doing anything tomorrow you can stay around." And I thought to myself, "Okay, maybe it's just the old inferiority complex coming up again." But I wouldn't do it to her and so I don't expect her to do it to me. Like a passing thing...like, "Well, if you want to stay around you can." So it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Flipping you off kind of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And when I feel like - now maybe it's because that just because I'm just learning to share, maybe she's trying to - I don't know - in some way, not dampen my spirits, but sort of realize that you can't always...somebody won't always give back to you when you give. That's part - maybe she's trying to show me that. Like you have to learn peer giving, whether they give back or not. But...like because you can't really say, "I did this, so you got to do that. So I did this and you have to do that." You know like I guess I still feel that way...like, 'Because I wouldn't do it to you, you shouldn't do it to me.' You know, but I know it ended up that the girl asked me to go out with her to her house, too. You know she says, "Oh, you know, well, yeah, come on along." A real sweet girl...and just, "Oh, yeah." She was still there when I got back. "Yeah, Carolyn's coming out next week, then come on out, too. I'd like you to come." You know and this was nice. Like this could...I knew her slightly but...that was a real sweet thing. And like she's not even a friend and she invites me to her house and everything, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it wasn't like Jodie asking for me like it used to be. Shoot. I used to hate that. Can't get your own date. She'd fix up somebody for you at a party. And she'd...take you out and say, "Well don't worry, we'll..." Like she said in New York. She said, "Don't worry about dates, I'll get them for us." She said, "I'll just make a phone call and I'll have somebody fix up dates for me." Well I would almost rather stay home. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's really taking over and handing out favors.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's the way I always felt. Like, 'I'm taking you along.' Like when we went to the Fur club a few times with some friends when they came in from Connecticutt. Hell, big favor! The last time I said, "I don't even know if I want to go. I don't feel like going out." (chuckling) And I finally ended up, I said, "All right I'll go but I'm not staying late." You know but it was like I finally realized like, 'I don't need you anymore in that way. I want you.' You know like there's a difference. 'I want you as a friend. I don't need you as a somebody' - 'please help me...do whatever for me.' And I don't know whether it's just hard for her to accept that, that I'm no grasping for...love anymore. That I want it but if you're not going to give it I can find it someplace else, you know. And it's like I don't know if she - she says too, like see, we're both insecure see, and this is another thing. And maybe she feels - I don't know why she feels this way. - And maybe she feels because I spend so much time with these people, like she'll come out with things like, "Well, good acquaintances, you have to spend time with. Good friends you don't feel like you have to." I said, "Well when I feel like I want to go home, usually I'm having fun. I don't want to go home." It's not the idea I feel like, "Ghee, me and James are going to feel bad." Because I already did that one time or a couple of times. I said, "Look, I have to go home. I have to go to a party or something and I'll see you." You know and I didn't go out with him. It didn't bother me. I didn't...they didn't go through any great trauma because I wasn't there, you know? And it's like, but it's almost like saying that...like, "Make sure they're not friends now, because if they're..." She's doing the same I do and she doesn't realize it. You know at least that's the way I took it. Like she's saying, "Now those are good acquaintances, those aren't friends." But yet they do and they give and they...like unbelievable, and I can give to them easily, too. So I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen but...like I just, I just feel right now like I'm on a great big precipice and I don't know what the heck is going to happen next. You know like I don't know whether our friendship is just going to end or what it is, you know? [0:28:05.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A precipice that's hurting you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, mostly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like our friendship is just going, do-do-do-do, it's either going to get... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...better or just going to go, (making noise) out the window. And I don't know which way it's going. I mean like that, that robbery brought us pretty close together again, because...like it's a common tragedy. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you were robbed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we were robbed - when was it, Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it was the day before my class. And I remember then that I figured part of it, though I don't think she really meant, I think part of it is she really didn't want to be alone. Because I asked her, I said, "Look, will you be all right here by yourself? Because if not, I'll miss my class and I'll stay home." You know even though it was the last night my instructor was going to be there and I really wanted to see him. But I said...like, "I'll stay home with..." You know, whatever. So she says, "No, no, no. I'll be all right. You don't have to worry about me." I just said, "Okay." So then I'm walking out the door and she says, "Well you'd better stop coming home late on that bus, because it's very easy for somebody to follow you home and realize that...nobody's home at night." Well the robbery, it started at - what was it? - nine o'clock in the morning until 11:00. So what the heck would be the difference if they knew I came home late at night? They didn't rob at night. They robbed in the afternoon or the morning, you know. And so I said, "Okay." But I knew what she meant was, she actually didn't want me out too late, because she was more or less like afraid to be alone I think. But then I thought to myself, "Oh...you're probably wrong. Because like she's very strong and she doesn't need you." So I ended up...I ended up going out, because I wanted to anyway and like I figured she'd go to bed anyway, so what's the big deal, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's like another one, you never found out what she really meant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's, that would have been a good place - what I'm saying is that would have been a good place to check out with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the only thing is, is with her, even - I don't even know if she realized that what she was saying is, 'I really wanted you to come home. I didn't want you to stay out.' And partly, maybe part of it got me kind of mad too...like it was - it got me mad when she said it like...like, "You shouldn't be out too late. And you don't have very good friends if they're not going to take you home in a car." Well Chrissie and James don't have a car. How are they supposed to take me home?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And so I said, I told them that she said, "Well you shouldn't be coming home this late." But see, all of it all together is like, either she wants me there more often to talk to or she just doesn't like the idea of me going out so much on my own. I don't know which it is. [overlapping voices at 0:30:18.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's sort of everything in one thread that seems to be something like that. That she just won't let go of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel that way. Like see, I guess now it's because like I don't feel like I need. She says though she doesn't need anybody, at least that's what she says. You know like she loves lots of people but if they went out of her, like it would hurt a little bit, but not...because she's got lots of self worth. Which I do agree, in like lots of ways she's got lots of self worth. Lots more even that I have...but like I don't know. I'm getting more to feel like, "Okay. So maybe I'm kind of lazy and I've got to do more things." But then I see my girlfriend Eliza, whose working like until two in the morning and she's got sick. She's sick for four or five days. She can't even go to work. And she can't do any of that extra work. And I think to myself, "Is it worth it to run my body down like that, so that I get sick for three or four days or five days and I'm not feeling well and I'm tired all the time? For what?" You know. And again, I always feel like maybe, "Well what's going to happen like the day before I move into my apartment? If I walk across the street and get killed?" So here I am killing myself for some material thing, and it's gone...when I'm gone. But I guess for school it's worth it but like otherwise, it's not worth it. And I just - I don't know, I just, I don't agree with her and when I don't...it's always like, well the connotation is that you're lazy. You know when I try to try and explain, "Look, I need this Sunday or I need this or I need that, because I need to recuperate a little bit. Or I don't want to do secretarial work but it's got more money than probably anything else I could do." So I don't know, I just... [0:31:51.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It sounds like always when you can't do it her way there's something wrong with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well she told me though once, and I guess she's right in that way, that I should look around to some schools and see if I can get four or five months training in something to make good money part-time, and maybe on weekends, and then go to school. See, that way I would be able to put in less hours and make more money, but that made sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well some of her advice does make sense to you though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense to me and it doesn't hurt me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because it's not like saying, "Look, you're wrong. You know you should be doing this. You should be doing that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're saying is, a lot of her comments are that way. They hurt you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. At least that's the way I take them. I don't know whether she means them that way, but that's the way I come out and that's the way that I feel like they're meant. Like, "I want you to branch out but as soon as you do, and I want you to get friends because that's what you're starting..." That's the most important thing right now to me, people...all right, so I've got lots of things, I've got lots of work to do. I admit it. You know like I admit I want to get a college degree to teach and to do other things...but...like right now I can't do them. And so see if I end up being more a secretarial bit...like even more than I do, I work one or two nights a week, but if I put anymore time in secretarial work I'm going to go right up a wall and I know it. I hate it...like I don't hate it but it's like, to me it's such a big waste of time. (chuckling) It's, I shouldn't say that but that's the way I feel about it. I was thinking of becoming a nurse's aid depending on how much they...pay, if they pay a halfway decent amount. I could work maybe a deadman's shift on Saturdays and Sundays. But...like I just feel like, "Okay now, I'll look into my own things now, leave me alone." And then she comes up with some nice things and she says like, "Sometimes you realize you should help somebody but you don't want to help them too much." And that I like. I said that was very nice because like she probably could tell me exactly where I could go and everything, but she's not and that's good. Because then it would be again, like saying, "Now you should do it my way."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's really mixed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean she's good for you in some ways and in other ways she still hurts you and puts you down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like I say, this is why I say that I don't think whatever she's doing is malicious. I don't think she would do that. She doesn't have it in her to be malicious. But it's just that, well the way some of her comments are taken, I feel that...like she's trying to slight (ph) over it, like maybe it's a hurt inside of her that she doesn't even realize. So maybe the best thing to do would be to tell her and maybe she'd realize, too, something, because...you can always grow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because whatever the effect on you is to hurt you and maybe she doesn't know that. [0:34:26.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. And I really, I really can't say what it is exactly. But like when I would feel, like things like when she talks about Eliza, it's almost seeming like she's trying to compare Eliza with me. Again, like I don't want to be compared with her. I want to know how she's doing if she's sick. I said, "Oh, my God." Or if she got like her belt. It took her about a week to tell me about her belt, because I wanted her to tell me before I...whatever, before I congratulated her. I mean but it's always like she's, she puts it - maybe it's just the way I take it again - but she puts it like, "Eliza is very aware and she's probably the only one I know...without college who is." In other words saying, "Look, you don't have college so therefore you're not aware of it, this other one is." You know or, "She's a very smart girl, boy, I'll tell you." You know because she did this and that and the other thing. And then looking at me like, you haven't even made out a budget for yourself, you know. And okay, maybe it's partly because I am aware that I pick up these things. That she maybe doing it constructively but the way it comes out is very snotty like. It's like a sarcastic remark towards me. And okay, again, like that could be a way of helping but that's not the way you help me. It's like with my instructor, he doesn't have to - he can stand in front of that class, he talks very low, in a very, he's got a very low voice and he doesn't speak loudly either, and you have to catch every word he says, and he's very economical with his words. But all he has to do is get your mind thinking and working and you find yourself...together with following the movements, you find yourself doing better than some of these other teachers that will sit there and explain and explain and explain and over explain and reexplain and...and he doesn't do it. It's just enough so that you know the basic and then you apply...like he told you the feeling...he tells you whatever and you apply it. You watch it a few times, you get the technique, and you can apply it, but see this is the way of doing it. If you're going to do something like that, if you're going to give somebody information, come right out and tell them. You know, don't be using other people to compare and things like this. See, this is, I think it's a form of game playing, I don't care what she says. You know she might say, "Well you know you don't want to hurt somebody." And...she knows I'm smart enough to pick up lots of things, but why do it? Why not just come out and say - boom! (chuckling) You know? [0:36:42.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well that's the way you really want to though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If that's what you want to say, say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want people to be that way with you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...really straight and you wouldn't compare people with other people, it's just not a way to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well like I wouldn't compare Eliza with Jodie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there's different qualities in each one of them. Eliza has got some very beautiful qualities and she's got some very cute qualities, like the contestant when she gets drunk, you know, "Nope." (chuckling) She was in the level (ph) of 'nope', she's really cute. And again, this is her own personality. But like I couldn't compare that with Jodie. Jodie's got other buoyancies and other...like whatever in other fields that she's very good in and...like Eliza good at something else. But it's like, I always feel like I'm compared with another friend or with a whatever...and I don't like that, you know? And like she told me once when she was high, and this was about three or four months ago, that I was her best friend. And at the time, I was still at the point where, wow, that made me feel good because I was somebody's best friend. Somebody loved me best as a friend...and now I think to myself, "Look I don't care. I really..." I said though it's so funny because now I feel like Eliza and her are getting closer, partly because I'm pulling away a little bit, too. And I said, "You know it doesn't really make any difference." And I felt like if Chrissie had - Chrissie has lots of friends too, and we talk about her friends and I talk my friends...and like I don't feel badly that she's had a girlfriend maybe for ten years, so what. So maybe this girlfriend is very close to her, so what. [0:38:11.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? But it's almost like, I can almost take it as a parallel with fellows. Like I don't like when I'm with a fellow and he talks about, say like a girl that he liked better or that he at one time liked you and then says, "Well, sorry, I like somebody..." You know what I mean? And it's like, I don't enjoy when somebody puts it right in that context.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like... </p>

<p>PATIENT: That you're either better or somebody else is better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if you just start talking about friends, like, "Oh ghee, I've been friends with this girl since...like I was ten years old or something." You can assume that they're very close. But it's not like she's saying, "And she's my very best friend and I love her the best and I don't...like if you're here...you're okay, but like you can never get to this." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like thinking in terms of 'better' and 'best' and things... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...she's like really petty and clingy and possessive and just a kind of nasty way to be with people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I mean like again, like they say you can feel closer, but why should you have to tell one friend that you like this one better than the other one? You know, only I like you better because of this and...things like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like instead of sort of an easy flowing appreciation of people, it's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's more like a kind of put down. I mean just kind of nasty way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even when you're putting down somebody else. You know what I mean? Even if somebody says you're the best, you know? Like at one time I wanted that, especially from a fellow. I wanted to be his best. And now I feel like I'm my best...and like, okay, so it's - if I find out this fellow is married and he's...he must have some kind of an interest in me. And if it's, even if it's just like - okay, like this one guy, I know it's just sex with him. I, We haven't gone all the way but like I know he wants to. So I figure, fine. This is the way I feel about you. You know? You love your wife in the way that you would want to stay with her, in the way that I would want a relationship with a man if I went into a serious relationship. And I know I couldn't have that. So I figure, all right, so what. So you're using me. Ha, ha, I'm doing the same thing back. And it's not like a malicious thing. It's just like...you're not going to hurt me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I accept that and it doesn't hurt me. Like...if I feel like playing around a little bit, fine. You know if I don't I tell him, "Sorry, I have to go home." (chuckling) You know. But it's like, maybe it's because I haven't been in love either. I don't know. I might turn out to be as possessive again when I fall in love. I don't know. You know. But I don't know if I'll ever get back to the point where it was, like if a guy looks at another girl I'd be, you know, "Oh my God, she must be prettier than I am. Oh my God, he likes her better than me. Oh my God, what happens if he meets her?" You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because now you feel sort of okay about yourself and relaxed about being you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The only thing I do find myself doing though is, I do find myself, I'm still a little bit wary of Jodie because of the way she has an attraction for men. I am attracted to men but not as attractive as she is. I should say in the general mold. I mean all she has to do is look at like nine-tenths of fellows and they'll come...bopping over and they end up...liking her or whatever, and I only get maybe one-tenth. Like I don't care as long as that one-tenth would be...would stay, like my friend. But like I am always - I still have that one fear like with a person like that...not just somebody who is physically pretty or... [0:41:28.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...not somebody who is just...whatever, I don't feel inferior in those grounds, but I do when I see the results. You know like I see... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...girls sitting there and they're, "Hey, where's my boyfriend?" And they're pretty girls, they're nice girls, there's nothing wrong with them, they're not snots or even clingers, but they just...like normal girls. And then all of the sudden you've got somebody that just attracts men like magnets and you're standing there and you really want to introduce your fellow to them? I wouldn't, you know. And to me it's just like, it's like opening the door to something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And why do it to somebody you care about? You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And since Jodie's been so, like enormous in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean like you've been living with that for so long, like it's awful and it's kind of a big fear... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is a big fear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that that's going to happen when you're around... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It still is a fear. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...someone like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It still is a fear and yet I notice the only boyfriend of hers I ever met was that one, and then she was like - it was the funniest thing, because like damn, (hitting desk) if I didn't walk in and she was like the same thing...and it was like, "Here's my so and so, my boyfriend." "Hi, how are you?" (making noise) You know, you could tell, get out of here now. And it was funny because...she says...she shares everybody and everything and the same thing has happened. She's got the same thing. When she really loves somebody, she's very possessive. And since we're sort of alike, I would probably be the same way. And I would like to get to the point where I wouldn't be quite so bad. You know, like I'll probably never get over it, because like heck, if you've got a father who didn't love you...and then all of the sudden you get somebody who does and he's a man...it's like, oh, so I don't know. But... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to linger for a long time... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but it feels like you can do a lot with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well at least I understand it a little bit more. I didn't, I never knew why I was like that...like I would stand on my head when I was with a fellow and there was another girl around or I would just regress, I would just retreat. If some girl started like a little bit of flirtation I would just go, (making noise) and I'd sit there and I'd say, "He doesn't love me. He doesn't want to talk to me." It was a hurt feeling but...it was like, now I want him to come to me, whereas meanwhile, she's making me pass - not passive but like...she's talking to him and getting him to talk to her or whatever. And...like heck, if you're going to be like that, very awkward, and here's this other kid that says, "Oh, shit, he likes her better than me or whatever or...like maybe I'm not as pretty as she is." Or something like that. I don't know exactly what all went through my mind but I remember going through it a couple of times. And I'd end up, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:43:52.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact I remember one cute guy that I met and I couldn't understand why he liked me. You know, I looked down, I says, "My legs are fat and they're ugly." And...because I've been told this ever since I was a little kid, you know, "You've got fat, ugly legs." And I said to myself, "Well why does he like me?" Then he meets my girlfriend...and (making noise) off he went with her and he started liking her. But I don't know. It was just a big mess up and like I just hope to hell I don't have to go through it again. I probably will...it will probably take a few times to get this out of my system that...you don't have to. Because then I get clingy...and I don't want to go through that. Oh, I just, oh. Like now I find I like one of the black folks. Like I think he's kind of sweet like, and he's kind of a smart-off. So what happens is when he gets smart with me, I end up going (making noise), no, you know. And partly it's fear. I know it is because I can feel it in myself, because I'm not normally like that. I'm normally very nice to people. But, and even when they're smart, I'll just start, I just, "Come on, come off it." And I'll get them out of a smart, defensive type way. But he's kind of nervous, he's new at teaching and that. And, I find myself like cutting him down. And part of it is maybe because he's kind of attracted to me, too. Like I'm actually afraid that maybe something's going to grow and I don't want it to because I'm afraid...like I don't want something to happen. Because like what would happen then, you know? I see him talking to this other girl and she's very, oh, she's a beautiful, she's got a beautiful face, she's oriental, gorgeous, gorgeous face on that girl. And like I saw him talking to her today a lot> And I realized to myself, not so much because I really like him that much, but I wanted him to pay some attention to me. But I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then it's two things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The first one was that you kind of can't get started with him because you're afraid you'd lose him already, before you even got started.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then there was this other thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I could, I felt like almost a jealousy already, and like there's nothing there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but then it wasn't, it wasn't so much a jealousy of the man himself. It was the idea that like my girlfriend kept saying, "Boy, I think he likes you. He's keeps looking over here and he keeps..." You know and he always walks up to me to show me things. And he does it in the way like, "Dummy, you know you're not supposed to do it that way." But it's still, like he always comes up to me first. And I realized that, that like there is something there and I'm afraid to let it grow. I really am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's so jittery now you can hardly even start to make anything happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like with this other fellow with this Seth, like I have no worries about him. Like I don't like him. He says he digs me. I know he probably doesn't. If he does, well, so what...I don't dig you and I don't feel like I'm using you...for any way, shape or form. But, like with Ned I really do like Ned and I can feel it. And like I can feel like - but see again, it's not an idea that he likes her better than me. It's an idea, again, maybe I'm not as pretty as she is. That's the first thing I thought. "Well with a face like that I supposed lots of fellows would say..." And then I was thinking to myself, "Well maybe if I get thinner and I start really working on my makeup again." Because I really have a pretty face when it's all made up right and...when I'm thinner. But I think to myself like, "Look, there you go again. It's like you're so afraid that you're not good enough, unless you...like you look the best you possibly can and you put on your best manners and your best this and your best that." And like lots of times it's all out here then. If you work so much on that part of you... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...then that's...like there's no time for the rest of you. [0:47:15.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what worried you is that you saw that going by again, that worrying about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I stopped it right away and it ended up... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that he came over and started doing the same thing again with me, you know. But when I get, if I would have let that grow, he probably wouldn't have even come up to me. Because like you can give off that, like that, that like greens (ph) of jealousy. Who wants to talk a green girl anyway, you know? (both chuckling) It's like you just get like that type of thing...inside. Like it's like, "He's not going to like me or he likes her better or whatever." And it's again, it's not so much the feeling you have for that person. It's just the idea of the thing that somebody else is better than I am, you know? And I think to myself, "Wow...like it's starting all over again." But I stopped it. At least I recognize the feeling, which I couldn't before, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And what was so great about it is that when you do stop it, then things go okay and you can deal with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then you don't have to feel that way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if he were married or he had some...he really turned out to have another girl, so what. I mean you could still like him and there's nothing wrong with that, you know. But because it was so funny when that girl did that last week. Oh, it was so funny. He was working with us, Ned, and then he sat down and - then it was so funny. He sat down and I guess another black fellow sat down and talked to Chrissie and I. All the sudden two more fellows came over. And I was talking to the two fellows and he was talking...like, he wasn't talking much. He just sort of sat there. And this girl came up to him, "Oh, Ned..." It was so funny, because, just the way she did it. She's like the one that's this far from me...and she came up to him and went, "Oh, Ned, could you help me with this?" (mocking voice) And I said, "Oh, Jesus." You know I was talking to somebody else and I could hear this. "Oh my God, he's fooled." You know if you want him that's the worse way to get him. So he says, "Oh, yeah, okay." (chuckling) And he worked with her for five minutes and all of the sudden I turn around and he's sitting right there again...he came back. (chuckling) So it just made me fell like...like you don't have to stand on your head and you don't have to say, "Look, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here." You know? And it was so funny that I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That that's, when you see that happening it looks sort of gamey and artificial and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I realized I'd done the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...just a way that wouldn't, that no one would like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like who would?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like the girls go, "Oh, Jesus." And the fellows...they say, "Well, you know, like look girl." (chuckling) So I mean if she would've sat down and started in the conversation, and even then maybe said...like, "Ned, could you show me how...the hand position or whatever?" But it was like, "Oh, Ned, could you help me?" (mocking voice) I thought, "Oh, shit!" You know because like, well he usually comes up to me and I say, "You again?" (chuckling) You know and things like this. And it's so funny because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...for him, that attracts him I guess, too, partly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And partly it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then you know that when you see her doing that, that probably what the feeling is inside is that she's really scared and has to hang on like that. [0:49:57.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well see, again, like part of my smart remarks are not defensive. Part of it's just funny...I'm just trying to be funny. I said, "Oh, come on." You know (chuckling) put out my arms. "Oh, come on. You're not - and be nice now. Don't be rough." You know and things like this and he'll start to laugh. And it's not a thing like, "Now I think I should say this and I...like then I'll look like attractive or whatever." You know lots of times I'm very serious. And sometimes I'll tell him, I say, "Look, I don't have time to goof around or whatever." Because sometimes he'll...and then I'll come out and, "I want to learn this." And then part of it see, like it's partly because I really want to learn and it's not just that I'm...trying to get him. And yeah, I would like to date him. If he asked me out I'd like to go out with him...but, I don't know. I hope if something does come up that I'm not going to mess it up again like that, by getting so jealous of anybody who looks at him or talks to him, because it's, oh, it's so bad. (big sigh) And I'm kind of afraid sometimes, when guys are there with their wives, to work out with the fellows...you just feel - I even though really, I don't even like to work out with Chrissie's husband. And that's, it's partly maybe a block I have because like I know she's pretty secure but like most women are not that secure and you don't know. And there are times when I feel like I have to fill (ph) a need for her too...with her that...like to know like, "Look, I'm not after James." You know? And I made that very clear at first, which was kind of a breakthrough for me, because usually...any fellow who paid any attention to me, whether it was like, "Hi!" You know, "Oh, he likes me! He wants me!" (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, "He noticed me!" And it's not like that anymore. So, I don't know. I know I got lots of places to go and that I've got to get going to get there. But, I don't know. I just feel like right now it's partly too, I've got time and I have to just think and think things out. And like I can't be going all the time, every day, til 12 o'clock at night or whatever...and I do need at least one day a week to go out. That's what I'm trying to explain to her. "Look, I don't go out on weekends hardly at all. Why is it so awful that like Tuesday nights I stay out?" Like well, last night we stayed out too late, because my instructor was leaving. Or like Friday nights, okay, so I agree that I have a reading class the next day and I should be in by 12, but that doesn't mean I can't stop someplace after class, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then again, it's something that you see that is really good for you, like that you know that you need. And then Jodie is telling you, "No!"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Do something else."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's what it's like. You know like, "You don't have time for that right now." But again I say, "If I give up my love and tomorrow I died or like two months from now I died, and this is like the only thing that I can say that I really..." I'm not saying I'm completely into running and nothing else, but like this my greatest pleasure right now, too, besides the idea of learning. I mean and it does so much for you, because it's like I've been very competitive and very...like, and running is not like that. It's like completely the reverse. You have to work with somebody. Now it's like, it's like a dependence but not the type that's like...clingy. But it's an idea like now you're just leading but you're not trying to kill that person...you're not trying to hurt anybody and you're not trying to be the best dog. You're trying to help them and you're trying to help...just get like a, like...like the one points together we'd call. And this is why I think the whole concept of it is so beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it's exactly where you are right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I want a oneness with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible - overlapping voices at 0:53:25.4]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like the people there too, it's not just the idea of the running itself, it's the people too are so open and gen...like - Well you see a few...complexes, like one of the fellows has got one that like, I know because I'm still getting over. Like he hasn't been to college and he's smart. He's a very...very intelligent fellow. And like he'll come out - like he was so funny. He said to Lee - I'll never forget that. (chuckling) He said, "Chrissie said she had a degree." And she said something to James. Well she didn't say that James has a few of them...(chuckling) she just said, "Well he's got a degree and so do I." "Really! Boy, you're the only college people I can talk to..." He says, "...except maybe Jane." She says, "What do you mean, maybe Jane?" (chuckling) "Jane doesn't have any college?" And he went. (chuckling) You know? But it's like I, it makes me feel like now like, all right, so I have to get to college, more or less, partly for expanding, partly for to get anyplace in the business world. I mean it's just like a reality...you have to have a degree to get anyplace, unless you want to be a secretary, you know? But it's like the idea, like now I don't feel inferior with people who do have a college degree. That I can talk to them. You know like, they're not somebody way up here. They're just somebody who was either like - like and I think Lee had worked her way through college and I don't know about James but I think he did, too. You know and it's like, these people are not so far above me, they're just...like they're just people that are very open and this is what attracts us...the openness that I am starting to get and they have. You know? And like I try to explain that to people and they just...well she did say one thing like, "If you spend too much time you're going to end up losing the very thing that you wanted." And this is true...like I do have to have time for reading and I do have some time...so you have something to talk about when you're with your friends. But, I don't know. I just feel like, why does she keep saying that...like, why is it like a feeling like I'm doing something wrong again almost. You know, "You're taking the wrong way." And...I go well... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when it feels so right to you, what can you say to her? You just, it's like you keep trying to explain and you just can't get to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I can't reach her. And...another thing too, I noticed is that now I do tell my feelings. And she said before, like it was almost like I was selfish. Well it wasn't that. I didn't have time to get a word in edgewise because she'd be constantly talking and talking and talking about, like either what I should be doing or...like what happens when you don't do this, and she'd go on and on and on and on and on and on. And then if I told my feelings, I would either feel like, partly she'd say, "You're lying to yourself." Sometimes she'd cut me off before I was finished. "You're lying to yourself." Boom! You know? And you go, "Wait. Wait. Wait." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) I didn't get a chance to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't explain what I was trying to say. You know like sometimes I get nervous and I can't explain the thoughts I have clearly. And before I have a chance to finish, it's (making noise)...and into another one, and then you forget what you're going to say anyway. (chuckling) And, partly I would just feel like I was so dumb, at least ignorant, that like I couldn't come up her...so, and besides she's already flaunted, like she's got more than 160 IQ...that puts her like a good 30 points ahead of me. So like right away again, you think, well if she's that much smarter than I am or that much more intelligent, and plus the education, and plus the traveling, plus this - she's got to be smarter, you know? But she can't be smarter in everything, you know? It's just the idea, like sometimes, she might be for her. Like running might be the worse thing in the world for her, but it's not for me, you know? [0:56:52.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well people are different you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you want to be able to respect that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I...and whether it's because I'm less intelligent or because of whatever, so what. All right, this is my thing, so why can't I live it in peace...like why can't I do it my way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of trying to, have it thrown up to you all the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Almost like, again, like almost like, "You should do what I say or what I do and like not what you're doing. But yet when you do everything I do, then I get mad because then you're...you're just following along." So you go, "Wait a minute. You know now, so this is... [inaudible at 0:57:20.5] ...and I'm stuck in it again." I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're good. How old is Jodie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Well, lets put it this way. She says she's 25. I say she's about 33, 32. She says to a fellow, she says she's 25. And her birth certificate, which she said had the wrong date on it, says 1944, which makes her - I don't know - like what, 27?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's another thing...I mean she's a lot older than you are. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's, yeah, that's it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you have a lot of years between now and then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it's just so hard you know, because partly it's because of the way I was...there's always a competition. And to sort of separate yourself... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's very hard to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I know. I understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just sort of, I'm just sort of saying that too. I mean... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like bring in, "Look kid, she's got seven years on you or six years." That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's another thing...that you have to bring in that. I don't know. But sometimes I feel like Eliza, well like Eliza's got two or three years on me, too. Plus she started dating when she was 15, which means...like she went to like lots, not just dating but like to really nice places.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she's had like experience in that way...like I haven't. I've been very protected and sheltered. I'm like a 18-year-old at 21...so, I don't know. Well (chuckling) this life is getting a little better anyway in the general sense. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, we'll see you. [0:58:50.7]</p>

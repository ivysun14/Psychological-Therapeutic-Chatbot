<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Long time no see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, right. Sorry I'm late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was rushing around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. I just - I had to go up…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you get my message that I left for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I left you a message. I was like please call me back before five. I left you a message around three - a voice mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I left it on a different number.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think that will - it would say on my phone but sometimes…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god, I'm like thinking did I leave the message for the wrong person? I think I did. That's hilarious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have to check that. I thought I left you a message. No, No, I left her - I left her both messages.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes if I'm on the phone - (inaudible at 0:00:51.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I'm thinking that I left the messages for the wrong person. That would be ridiculous. Oh no, I'm losing my mind, I didn't leave a message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay yeah, because I don't have a message but - no, I said you don't have to call me back. We would talk about…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And you could do it - yeah, you can do it afterwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I figured it would be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I'm done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No - yeah, I can imagine. No, I had to go to my sister's apartment - it's really my apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: LaSalle Street?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the older. The LaSalle Street one we don't get - we don't move until the end of this month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's in Northwest and I have been fixing my resume. Well one, for the Finn thing and two, because I have to start applying to jobs and like whatever.</p>

<p>So I left and I was like I didn't give myself enough time and then whatever. So that's the story.</p>

<p>But yeah, I had - I was thinking of something on the way over here that I wanted to talk about.</p>

<p>I know we said you were going to talk about something else today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we can talk about whatever you want to talk about. [0:01:58.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I have a couple of issues as usual. It was something - okay. Well first I think this control issue of mine that needs to be really like addressed because for example today, I did not hear from Ferñao.</p>

<p>And well I just spoke to him but I didn't hear from him. And it's like its fine - its fine until a certain point but then it gets - I get really annoyed.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say angry or depressed or even anxiety actually. But its annoyance over not being able to control - but you know what it is, it's control because I can't really - like I could call him if I want but I never know if he's able to answer.</p>

<p>Because I told you his family issues and whatever so it's kind of like he's in control of this every day like when to call and whatever.</p>

<p>And I mean it's not a problem, he calls every day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:02:55.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no like I've told you, even those times when I've gone crazy, like he's eventually called. So it's not an issue and it's not like a power struggle where like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So did you eventually hear from him today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This was today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what time were you expecting him to call?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't. I mean he normally calls at the time that he called.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you were thinking…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think it's just the fact that like everything is in his control. Like it's when he wants to call he calls.</p>

<p>And I'm making it sound like he's like a shitty person. Like when I want to call I'll call, it's not like that. But it's annoying for me, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't stand it sometimes. It's not that I can't (inaudible at 0:03:33.9)…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHING)</p>

<p>CLIENT: …and sense it but like it's really frustrating. It's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're telling yourself I can't stand it as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just said it right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, and it's really frustrating. And the thing is like then I start - oh, this is what I wanted to tell you. Then I start thinking like well - so he only calls me - he calls me when he wants.</p>

<p>Well, you know, because he can control the time he can also kind of control the length of the conversation. Because depending upon the time and where he has to go, you know, whatever, that's another thing that's under his control. [0:04:09.0]</p>

<p>And then, you know, what if this like stressful talking on the phone situation added to the fact that we're so far away, added to the fact that we have all these other stressful things like his visa, and the apartment and the blah-blah-blah, you know, what if we're growing apart because of this.</p>

<p>And it's like start - you know, it's the thinking and like the obsessing and the…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:04:29.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: …catastrophic thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The catastrophic thinking. All right, so…</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But I'm trying to figure out what is the main thing that is problematic? Is it that - do you smell something really good? Is that you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my lip gloss.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like - it's not lip gloss it's like ChapStick - I don't know what to call it. Whatever, it smells good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm surprised I can smell it from way over here</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's strong. It's weird, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so is it that he is kind of able to control the situation that's the most problematic? Is that the kind of - what kind of - like what's the activating event here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think - I don't know if this is going too far, but I think like in the end I don't have any control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well not the thoughtful. What's the situation that prompts it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, what prompts it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're waiting for his call and he hasn't called you when you want to be called or it's just that you have to wait for his call?</p>

<p>Is that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I have to wait.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the general idea I have to wait for his call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't know if this like calling thing - I mean it's certainly an issue because I'm getting whatever about it.</p>

<p>But there's also the issue of not having any control over what eventually happens anyway. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, well let's just go with the activating (inaudible at 0:05:59.2) here because that's the… [0:06:00.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …I don't - it starts when…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …I - is it when he calls? I don't control when he calls or I don't control when we get to talk?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both, which one is…</p>

<p>CLIENT: …really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which one causes a bigger reaction out of you? Like the idea that I can't control when he calls or I can control when we talk.</p>

<p>Like I can't talk to him when I want to talk to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I think more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? It's not that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But only until like a certain point - at a certain point in the day. Like when it's like okay - like maybe I have something that I want to ask him, it's like okay, I can't call because.</p>

<p>Well I could but whatever. It's just the whole situations is just annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then how often do you try to call him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't usually because I usually just whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay so…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean I've told him like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever called him before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And has he ever picked up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but - yeah, maybe once or twice. But really 95 percent of the time he's called me or more than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're waiting - you're sitting there waiting and you're saying like I can't talk to my boyfriend, my own boyfriend when I want to talk to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like - and what emotion are you feeling? You're sitting there waiting, you have something to say to him and you can't say it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's anger?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what are your thoughts? Are you saying I should be able to talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah I should be able to talk to him when I want to talk to him at least once in a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not - is it it's not fair?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This is mainly the situation itself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any anger at him like why can't he understand that I…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no because…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You should be able to talk on my - when it's convenient for me as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's not anger towards him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just anger at the situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I felt for a second that he was like abusing this privilege - like I didn't really want to say privilege, whatever - I would be angry towards him. But he's not. [0:08:03.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're just angry at the world?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, today especially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not fair that I am in this relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everybody else gets to talk to their boyfriends all the time and I can't even talk to him when I have something to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's more just like I should be able to talk to him when I want, period, you know.</p>

<p>Or I - at least once in a while, every so often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And logically…</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it's the catastrophic thinking after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And logically you know that you can't talk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't always get what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get whatever you want usually?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No - well yeah. I think that's - well I don't know. I think so actually. I think that's part of the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I don't know if this is the same situation but the whole - like I was thinking about the whole going to Portugal thing. You just assumed that you were going to get what you wanted in that situation which was to go back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right - yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you didn't think about that. Like you knew it was a possibility but you were like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …I'm going to get what I want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's pretty dysfunctional to say I'm going to get what I want and…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …the world can say that that's not possible but I'm going to get what I want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it's - yeah, it's definitely true. There's no doubt about it. And this experience especially like the trying to go back to Portugal and not being able to made it the clearest it's ever been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then if you don't get what you want then - exactly what you want - then it's catastrophic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I want to get what I want and if I don't - because it's initially anger and then anxiety, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well it's - and yeah, it's definitely anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which one would you like to work on today, the anger or the anxiety? Because we've worked on the anxiety before. Would you like to work on the anger today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean not to say that we don't need to work on the anxiety more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just that I don't know - maybe I'm not recognizing it. I don't know how - I guess - yes I do get angry, I do get angry and I'd like to work on that. [0:10:01.2]</p>

<p>I have other…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it's not fair that you've been put in this relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think that. Not that it's not fair that I've been put in this relationship. I think it's not fair that the situation is the way that it is which…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is you have to spend a month away from your boyfriend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty tragic. How are you surviving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because the reason why that's a thought is because of the catastrophic thinking. It's like they go like this. Because then I start thinking this situation is not fair because what could happen is blah-blah-blah-blah, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this isn't a specific situation. This is that I should get what I want with Hyman, if not it's horrible, it's awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you have to get what you want all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know why I feel that way but I think it's - I'd like to blame it on a little expression we have in English that is, where there's a will there's a way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think…</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …if I work hard enough I should get what I want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, which I know is not true. I mean there are plenty of people that work their asses off at things and either don't get it or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they all work. Have you ever worked really hard at something and failed? Not yet?</p>

<p>What happened with your job in finance in the end? I never kind of really knew why you left?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What happened was that - well I started working with this one like group. And the woman that I was like directly under - well I wasn't good at the job.</p>

<p>Well with her specifically because she was this big producer in this field or whatever and I couldn't keep up with work. I didn't understand it. I was thrown into it with no training or whatever.</p>

<p>So I wasn't very good at it and I worked my ass off. Like I was there 12 hours a day or more, like whatever.</p>

<p>So in the end the big boss like we spoke. And basically it was just like, it's not working with her but you're such a great worker and we really like you that you can - maybe you can work with these other people instead. [0:12:01.8]</p>

<p>So while I did fail in some ways because I wasn't good with her, it wasn't like I really failed because I mean it's a pretty - I mean they could have just thrown me out on my ass, like you know what I mean?</p>

<p>So I did something right. So it wasn't like such a big failure in my head.</p>

<p>And then when I worked with the other people it was like - it was mortgage banking and like I mean the industry, I mean it's not the same, you know.</p>

<p>So like these people weren't - they weren't generating enough money and like it was just that issue. So I wasn't making enough money.</p>

<p>And then it was just the fact that I knew I didn't like it. I didn't really want to continue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in the other situation you kind of told yourself well, it kind of worked out which maybe it was a good coping, you know - also you could have been sad or depressed about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there you kind of probably acknowledge that you had the will but there didn't seem to be the way…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …in that situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's true in that situation, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and that can happen to people and it can even happen to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure I can think of other…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you the hardest worker that you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you work hard enough to get what you want most of the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you really want it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. But if I don't care…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you really want a relationship…</p>

<p>CLIENT: …I'm the worst worker in the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you really want your relationship Ferñao to work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're really working really hard but you still can't control your phone conversations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is controlling the phone conversations - is that going to make - like what if you could control it? What if you could control like you say, I want Ferñao to call me now. Would that make your relationship stronger?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know but I think in my brain what I start thinking is that the phone issue like us not being able to speak whenever we want whether it's him calling or me, is a stressor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? And because of that it's not - I mean it's a little bit the control, but it's also just like even if he wanted to call anytime he wanted he couldn't, and it's like a stressor. [0:14:02.3]</p>

<p>And it's like there's so many other stressors. Like and then when we do talk it's always about like this apartment that he's getting or, you know, because we have limited time because you can't spend hours on the phone talking to somebody in Europe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well do you guys have Skype or anything or no it was (inaudible at 0:14:15.2) in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No because number one he doesn't have Internet in his particular room in his house, like it's ridiculous.</p>

<p>And he's not a big Internet person anyway. And because of the time difference it would just be - it's difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you only have a few weeks I guess left of this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But anyway, when we do talk it's always about like the apartment, the visa, and it's like I don't know.</p>

<p>I mean it's not the biggest ((inaudible at 0:14:41.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you sit there waiting for him to call then and he calls and you have to talk about business and stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you get yourself all stressed that you're not going to talk and when you talk it's not even that enjoyable right now. You're kind of going to have to wait for a reward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why are you getting so upset?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because in my very dysfunctional brain I think that if we don't speak then that means because we have spoken every day since we've been separated that something will clear - it means something is clearly wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to talk every day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is it right now it's just stressing you out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not stressing me out. I do want to talk every day. Like I - we don't have stressful conversations even though we are talking about annoying things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can he send you a text message ever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could he ever tell when he's going to call. I mean that's like practical problem solving when I'm solving your problems.</p>

<p>But I mean sometimes so you're not waiting around all day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is though for me to tell him oh, could you send me a message to let me know when you're going to call?</p>

<p>Like we kind of have to acknowledge the fact that I need to know when he's calling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't want him to know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's kind of embarrassing. (LAUGHING)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? He's going to find this out sooner or later. You'd just rather it be later?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the thing is what also pisses me off…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or am I going to cure you by then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm going to cure you by the time he comes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully. No, I'm just kidding. [0:16:02.8]</p>

<p>But I think I'm just going to tell - like just keep talking and I don't know if we're actually going to make any like - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just keep talking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the other thing is that because I don't have a job right now and I have no focus, I feel like this whole thing is becoming my focus.</p>

<p>And also like if I did have a job - like with my friend's store I probably shouldn't - well, she doesn't care.</p>

<p>But if I had a job where I really cared about the boss and my performance, I wouldn't be able to talk to him whenever he was able to call necessarily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well he normally calls you at night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's normally calling at like four o'clock, three o'clock, two o'clock our time which is like six, seven, eight or something like that there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if he called you right now would you excuse yourself and…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, of course not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you say, "Can you call back in an hour?" Would you pick up or just…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I wouldn't pick up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Have you ever done that before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what does he do, he calls back later?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually - yeah, usually. Or whenever I have the time to call him back I'll call him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well I think - I mean some of it you nail on the head with that like you kind of view your relationship as the only thing that's going on in your life right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe that's not so functional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that's like then I start thinking crazily again. Like I can't pick up the phone when he - if he can only call at this particular time because of his situation, and I can't answer at that particular time because of my situation, then when do we speak?</p>

<p>And then do we speak? Will that change things? Will all blah-blah-blah, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you didn't talk for one day would it change things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well have you ever gone one day without talking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you could tell Ferñao like - have you talked yet today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you could tell him like in an e-mail maybe something like; I'm going to be really busy tomorrow. Like I'm going out with my friends tomorrow at four or something or ((inaudible at 0:17:58.9) meeting with somebody and can't talk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you could tell him that the therapist I'm interviewing is like totally neurotic or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just see how you deal and go do something. Don't sit around your apartment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would your relationship fall apart?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I feel like if I'm lying…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so then you don't have to lie. You can - does he know you see a therapist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he knows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know you're a little anxious about the relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so. He knows that I have these worrying problems but not about this in particular.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about revealing yourself a little to your boyfriend. I mean he's moving…</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …across the ocean for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …like I would love to and I don't feel like I can't tell him things or whatever. But because we're not in the same country I feel like - I mean, I don't know. [0:18:55.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think there's like two issues here. It's like the need or the desire to control the things in your life so that things don't get out of hand and you don't lose control of everything, you know.</p>

<p>And then there's also the desire to seem perfect to your boyfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True, true, which is another problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean, most people find, you know, beauty in the details and the imperfections or what makes people lovable.</p>

<p>Does he have imperfections that you like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well actually I don't know if I like those. He - I don't know if it's an imperfection.</p>

<p>I think that he's like immature but not in a bad way. Like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, it can be cute sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's cute. It's kind of cute and kind of not be cute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So maybe you don't love imperfections. Maybe that's a poor expression. But it's the imperfections and we tolerate them and then make the (inaudible at 0:20:06.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but he's not perfect and I still like him even though he's not perfect. And there's a lot of like - for example…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think he could think that about you or do you have to be perfect for somebody to like you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think he can but…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but I think this actually something that goes on in your life because you have the judgments of others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have to be perfect for people to like you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I think of it as perfect, but it's like my best self…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:20:28.6) control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …and in control of any negative things, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you weren't in control ever in (inaudible at 0:20:33.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The things is well I don't know if it's that but if I do make a mistake and it's, you know, not something little and silly, then I'm so hard on myself that I think that even if other people don't care - don't whatever, I punish myself so much that maybe it makes me think that other people look at me that way, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do like you - like if you make a mistake would you tell your friends about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No - I mean I don't know it depends. [0:21:08.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do they know that you are kind of anxious and a little crazy about your boyfriend or no?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, some of them. I mean not all of them but some of them, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of them? Did you tell them or they just kind of figured it out on their own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell them and they probably could figure it out, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about - how would you feel about - because there's two problems at work here.</p>

<p>But I think sometimes the control thing is related to the perfectionism thing because you need to be perfect and in control of everything and then if you're not, you know, everything has to go the way you plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if it's not and people don't see you that way, things don't go that way, then somehow it's your fault and everything's going to fall apart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're not trying hard enough for this relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if - I don't know if you think this is relevant, but what if you in the next conversation that you have or some course over the week, you reveal an imperfection to Ferñao.</p>

<p>I mean he must realize you're a bit - there's something - like with the whole - how do you feel about - because that was the whole thing you didn't want to tell him about the Visa issue and then you guys are back together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a pretty big chance that you were taking and then to not even…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he angry with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wasn't angry with me because of what happened. He was angry the reaction that I had when - after it happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …forget like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like hysterical like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was angry with you about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not angry - he wasn't angry. He never actually got angry with me the entire time but he just felt like it was too extreme.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he not angry? Are you sure he wasn't upset with - not maybe angry but was he not upset that you didn't tell this to him? I mean wouldn't you be upset if he didn't tell you this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm surprised that he wasn't even angry or - because I would have been livid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you apologize to him about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that you could have a conversation with him about a flaw of yours that you're a little insecure about? I mean he's moving here for you. [0:23:16.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's probably - do you think he's still going to move if you reveal an imperfection about yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you like ever farted in front of him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you do - if you did that would he break up with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, I'm sure he wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he do it in front of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can't and it will take me a while, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you know what I mean like things like this. Those are…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course, I mean he knows I'm not perfect. I mean it's clear. And I don't…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he keeps - but you still try all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must be exhausting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can image why you're so anxious all the time and angry with yourself because it's impossible to keep that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just that I don't know how to like not try to be that way, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Like I don't know how to not act the way that I act.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you had to do like - do you even care about what strangers on the street think about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I never thought about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if you had to go up to someone on the street and be like, hi I'm Andrea and I'm really neurotic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would die.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Die?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A stranger you're never going to see again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I couldn't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's what you have to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you going to ever reveal your flaws to your boyfriend who means a lot to you?</p>

<p>Do you think it would be easier to reveal (inaudible at 0:24:34.9) than a stranger?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, a stranger probably. No, I don't know. I don't know. I think that maybe Ferñao…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do people reveal - I mean there's some people who reveal stuff all the time don't they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So like sometimes I'm really insecure and (inaudible at 0:24:58.8). And you know, but I still would fart in front of my boyfriend.</p>

<p>How do you think I don't get embarrassed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean I've done that to - I mean I've done that too. I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how do you not get embarrassed in the situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it's just a comfort thing. [0:25:16.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it? Or maybe it's that you're - the comfort is knowing that this person cares about you and they don't appraise you on one act.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you live in this bubble filled with like all your perfect things and then when an imperfect thing comes along and the whole bubble pops.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I feel like really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well why would one little thing take away from all the other good things about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's - I think it's because when I do even one little thing, I'm so hard on myself that and it's so extreme that in my head it seems like even bigger, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this isn't working for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not - it is not working at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you want to change…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …or are you very committed to…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I want to change it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …just keeping up this perfect image.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to change it. Like for example…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? You really want people to know that you're not perfect? I mean I'm not buying you yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: the thing is I - is I know I'm not perfect. I know it. But obviously I try to be as perfect as possible, you know what I mean, in front of people.</p>

<p>I know when I'm not and I fail then I'm so hard on myself that it's like torturous. So yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wouldn't it be easier - I mean I look at this like, you know, like Jackass.</p>

<p>Like they go out in the street all the time and make complete fools of themselves. So what's the difference between you and them?</p>

<p>Like them doing it and you doing something completely idiotic on the street?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do they think it's funny…</p>

<p>CLIENT: …maybe they just don't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …and you think it's embarrassing and humiliating and life-threatening or ego-threatening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the difference - what makes the difference? [0:27:00.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean they just don't care. They don't…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if they don't care they have some kind of different thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are their thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not doing stupid things that's funny and not a reflection of their whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who they are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As their ability as a human being doesn't depend on the actions of one day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you think, I must be perfect all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if I'm not it's awful and people might see what a mess I am inside?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also, I mean, the things that Jackass people do are like that's voluntary. They're trying to look stupid and be funny or whatever.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I just asked you to try to be funny on the street and you said that that was unbearable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But having an anxiety issue that's not like a one day thing, is different, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. And it's harder if you have to spend a lifetime with these irrational beliefs that you're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think - well here - do you think it's irrational to think, I must be perfect all the time or I must - maybe I'll change it to more, I must behave the best I can all the time. Is that irrational?</p>

<p>You don't think it's irrational.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you want to know what - that seems to be the part they're having difficulty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's irrational to think. I really - I'd prefer if I could present myself the best I could at the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you tell yourself I must…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have to, I should be this way. When you don't you're breaking a law of (inaudible at 0:28:49.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah - I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are you going to be perfect all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you're setting yourself up for disaster.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or failure, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you said, I'd prefer it if I didn't act this way all the - if I could present myself as best I could all the time. But if I can't I know that it's not going to affect the way people really view me. [0:29:08.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if it does maybe they're not people I really need to be around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound like something that you could tell yourself instead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's better. Yeah, it's better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're not going to from I care what other people think to, I don't give a shit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's unrealistic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in some way we all kind of give a shit. Most people do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, I know it's definitely more realistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you could change it from a demand to a preference. And if you change it from a demand to a preference, what would you feel instead of anxiety?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I change it to a preference?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like right now, if you're like I'd prefer it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean no anxiety. Almost no anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably feel maybe a little concern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, concern but I mean not anxiety where it's like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe what would you feel instead of anger at the world and at yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I couldn't - maybe like disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If the world didn't always meet your expectations? Just a little disappointed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of angry and infuriated at the world for not living up to your expectations and perfection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And setting you up to be perfect. You need to not only be perfect for yourself but you think the world should set you up so that you can have a perfect life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You will have expectations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you a god-fearing person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, (inaudible at 0:30:40.7). So like you don't have to like - some people would say, you know, like that's expecting a lot. But that's expecting a lot for nature from the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's unrealistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, is nature all-bowing to you? The weather patterns…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …it's not going to rain on your wedding day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean it might, yeah. No, it's true. It's annoying that I know all of these things but yet I can't - you know, not that I can't but I haven't been able to. [0:31:09.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you need is something new to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you know it. Every time you have to practice these I prefer it to be this way. But if it doesn't line up the way I want it, it's not going to change me, it's not going to make me cure.</p>

<p>Because it's really like you worried that things aren't going to line up perfectly for you and then it's going to present you as poorly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know if Ferñao doesn't call you on time then you might get anxious and it's almost like he's causing you to be anxious and getting mad at him too.</p>

<p>So you want to practice these? But I think - I mean I think that we're hearing something that would be a good exercise. But if you don't feel comfortable with that yet…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I mean I think - I feel like I have like okay - for example this is really 0 you're going tor really think I'm crazy after this. But - so obviously I can speak Portuguese because I've lived in Lisbon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's speaking English and Portuguese together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To - sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ferñao?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:32:10.8) keeps going. We speak English because I was - he was my student, that's how we met or whatever, so yeah.</p>

<p>So we have never spoken Portuguese to each other. And like he's obviously wanted to speak Portuguese and then whatever although his English is great.</p>

<p>And I really was always reluctant to speak Portuguese to anyone in Lisbon except (inaudible at 0:32:37.8) people I wasn't as close with, and he can't understand.</p>

<p>And I still won't speak Portuguese with him. Like there are times when I feel like I'm almost…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you giving yourself a homework assignment today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you giving…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you just did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No (LAUGHING). But you know what I mean, this is similar to what we were saying about just going what to someone on the street and saying, I'm Laura, I'm neurotic.</p>

<p>Truth is I would much more easily do it with a random person than someone I know, you know. [0:33:09.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be so bad about speaking Portuguese to Ferñao? He would know that you're not perfect in Portuguese?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know he's only with you because you've probably got Portuguese, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the reason he even started dating you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's obvious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's like shit, this girl speaks beautiful Portuguese. I could listen to her speak Portuguese but…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's also…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like if she spoke in English I am going to puke.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My Portuguese is crappy because I was always so nervous about practicing that I - I mean I know a time, I can understand whatever. I can speak but it's very difficult because I haven't practiced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and what if you speak Portuguese crappy. Suppose you - suppose it never gets better and you're a crappy Portuguese speaker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so bad about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be the end of the world I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because Ferñao would fall out of love with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all. In fact if I spoke any Spanish to Ferñao he would probably be the happiest person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think it would make his day and yet you're actively going against it and maybe making your relationship worse because he thinks you don't trust him or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably - probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think your homework assignment is for you to call him. If he doesn't pick up give him a message in Portuguese.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't. I couldn't. I won't be able to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. It's - if I could - if we could accomplish one thing like in the next few months or whatever…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's your homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …it would be to - for me to get over it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Laura, well I think I'm going to view you as an imperfect student if you don't do that. I'm going to…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>CLIENT: For some reason I would prefer you to think of me as shitty because I won't do it than for me to actually do it; I don't know why.</p>

<p>I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you think that this is - how is this working for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. It's really not good at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you want to change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then do you think this is going to happen on its own or do you think it's hard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's hard - it's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you going to explode when you do it? Are you going to die? [0:35:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I would die of embarrassment a little bit inside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you'd get over it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'd get over it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what if you never had to do it again? That was the only time you ever did it, could you stand it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know what though, the feeling that you're going to have afterwards might be embarrassment and humiliation.</p>

<p>But I think the feeling that you have afterwards that his opinion hasn't changed of you, maybe it's even…</p>

<p>CLIENT: His opinion if it sucks as the worse Portuguese anyone has ever spoken, he will still be so much happier that I tried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to make your boyfriend happy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I do - I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why is it so hard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just so hard, this particular thing especially. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think - I mean this is the whole idea of there's like behaviorism in psychology and some people are pure behaviorists and say, you know, if you can just change your behavior that's it, you're set.</p>

<p>There's no need to work out the cognitions because the cognitions change when your behavior changes and it's true.</p>

<p>I'm not a pure behaviorist. I think that there's plenty to work on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I don't think that you're going to make the changes that you want to make if you can't do the behavior assignments.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is something for your goal. How much do you want to be better, to be more accepting of yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know that the speaking Portuguese issue if I could work on that…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think you could feel proud? Where there's a will there's a way, Laura?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could feel proud of yourself afterwards for doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it might make it easier to work in ESL.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he would be great person to talk to all the time and help you perfect. I mean you're going to be practically living together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could really improve your Portuguese.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. But then I start thinking like well, I've wasted so much time being worried about it and I could be so much better than I am that now I'm even worse than - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's just (inaudible at 0:36:54.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …that's dwelling on the past, not changing the future. You could dwell on the past forever and then - you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Like you only have what's today forward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you worry about what happened you could spend the rest of your life doing that and everything would be the same, you know.</p>

<p>I don't know; why don't you think about it? I would be impressed. Because we're not going to see each other for two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? [0:37:21.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, I forgot to tell you this. I'm not going to be here next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay, so then the next week. So Thursday, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday at seven, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 27th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know you have a week and a half to get some work done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just - I wish there was a magic answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just keep reading the book, there's a lot of shit - did you get to the part about shameless acts yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big - I think that's a big part - I know that's a big part about your book (inaudible at 0:37:47.5). But he really thinks that these are important things for acknowledging that your self-worth is not dependent on the actions.</p>

<p>I was once at a lecture and, you know, a behavior you have, that doesn't define you. And we tell the little kids that all the time, right?</p>

<p>Like you're not bad, you make a mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't make you a bad person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't make you a stupid person because you have - because, you know, I don't think the situation is even stupid.</p>

<p>I was at a lecture with someone talking about REBT. And he was drinking his water in the lecture and then all of a sudden he takes a class of water and pours it on himself.</p>

<p>It's like (inaudible at 0:38:26.3) and it's like dripping down his sleeve. And the whole audience - you know like.</p>

<p>And he was like okay, I did something completely stupid but do you think I'm stupid now?</p>

<p>You know if I sat here - I'm not going to do it because I don't want to get wet, but if I did that to myself would you think I was stupid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I wouldn't think you were stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I did something that was a little stupid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly, that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you going to still come to me for therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No - I'm kidding yeah. Yeah, of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might think about it a little bit.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, but I know what you mean. No, it's true I wouldn't think you were stupid, I would just, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you think everybody is going to think that about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think the only…</p>

<p>CLIENT: …in certain ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …way you're going to start changing it, you know, we work on the cognitions and then maybe start (inaudible at 0:39:11.5) things. But I think you have a lot of time. You could try something out.</p>

<p>Try doing something with somebody on the street - saying something stupid. Talking to someone in Spanish on the street, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think like leaving - I mean you could even - would it be easier to leave a message or talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Much easier to talk I think. Because a message I would think it…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, you know, call him and see if he picks up. Or when he calls you, answer in Spanish and speak, you know, like for two minutes in Portuguese because it doesn't have to be forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing. I think if I look at it like that like one minute, you know, or two minutes or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And more than hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly - exactly. It seems more bearable. And I think once I get over just a shorter - short time, I could maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you could definitely do it if you had to. If someone pointed a gun to your head and said speak in Portuguese to Ferñao or I'm going to kill you, you'd do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can stand it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can stand the embarrassment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some day it won't be embarrassing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And the thing is like he speaks English far better than my Portuguese but he makes mistakes.</p>

<p>And like - you know what I mean, it's not like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you going to break up with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like I ever - I just think I'm so much of a better person than some other people. (LAUGHING).</p>

<p>Because there are people who laugh, you know. I mean not him or whatever but - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Well we're up but I really think that that's your homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think keep reading the book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to try really heard. I can't make any promises but I really am going to try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Practice the rational statements.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One or two minutes even. Or one - if I could do one sentence - like a full sentence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So no - nothing for next week, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, so the following week Thursday right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. I'm so nervous about my homework.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so you said you can stay, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's going to take a bit of a while like 40 minutes or so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's longer. Maybe if you (inaudible at 0:41:20.4) I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my god. So just this, right? Just me fill in the bubbles? Oh god, it is long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, there's a lot. If you want you can try half today and half next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, I'll see if I have enough time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be worth it to just get it over with so you don't have to do it (inaudible at 0:41:38.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I jut have to get back to my sister's apartment before 6:30 because I stole her boots. And if she finds out…</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I might steal them here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, they're real nice. They're so comfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really, you're tempting me. I need boots. Maybe next week I'll have them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the way out, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you Andrea. Laura, that's fine, thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye.</p>

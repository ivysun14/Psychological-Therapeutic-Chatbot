<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was your week?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Not too bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Yeah you're smiling and you look a little bright...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: [giggles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's a, bring me up to date, what's going on?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, I, I basically I only had really one attack.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum, did you...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: That...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you fill out the forms?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yes, I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah okay. Well, you just give me the uh, the two forms here and take a look at that then you can get (ph) [papers flapping].</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, here, have anxiety is tell me all about huh?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: [sigh]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depression is the same, good. Okay, talk to me, whats, what happened?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, it happened Monday, I was just still in the kitchen and uh, (pause 00:00:49) we just finished supper, and I was putting the dishes in the dishwasher and uh, it started that, my heart started, nothing really is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhm, preceded it uh, and uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sure? You remember anything that has gone through your mind at that time?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhm, I can't think of anything really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: it stands out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhm, and uhm, then the breathing and tonight I started getting of it, that feeling again like "Oh, no..." and, then I remembered that to think about this logically and also the breathing techniques...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...and they seem to work hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? okay, so you got it very early, right?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Pretty early , yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum. And how did you feel after you settled it down?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: (sighs)Uh, pretty good about it actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum. You're surprised? Did you look a little surprised?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah, surprised. Yes I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of things that you've been telling yourself specifically about symptoms like heart rate and breathing and... What kinds of positive or alternative things that you've been telling yourself?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: After having listened to the tapes, so on and so forth, and again remembering to apply logic at this to what was going on and uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...to... practice my breathing..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm.. 'kay, when you say apply logic there, you're saying to, to interpret differently?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Interpret, right, to know that uh, to realize that nothing, I wasn't going to really lose control and uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...that I could get through this and uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. [in a low voice] Okay, One of the common things that people do is tell themselves just because my heart increases or accelerates, doesn't mean that it's gonna go into a full flatter or I'm gonna have a heart attack or...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it's gonna be uncontrollable, and the same thing with the breathing, why you saying is difficult breathing you still...you're still taking an air, I mean you're still breathing.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On regular basis. Okay, good. So, we wanna kind of, continue to do that, and you know you may have some may... back slides at some points when you have more of a panic and than, than you did this week and make it more come out of the blow but, remember that try your best as jump into the mode of the breathing from your nose and exhaling through the mouth and... and, and just kind of uh, try... to deescalate that early. Uhm, and I would like you to try the exercise... use the exercises during the week too, just to, as a practice mode, you can go the higher now this time and let it go a little bit further. Uhm, but, but it shouldn't be that much different than, than what you might experience if you're exercising as well, okay? But the idea is this, to keep in mind that it's something that you can control and you gonna get... get a control.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, Whe- when I was to divert a-a little bit and just talk a little bit about what's been goin' on with regard to your husband. W- we we're talkin' last time before about uh, uh the fact that uh, there was some tension in your house, I'm wondering i- is some of that subside? Or is it...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhm, I'd say it's probably about the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum. Is getting any worse at all?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Possib- okay. Well, as, as you rec- may require, we talked about the idea that at some point you have to begin to, to take a look at some of the underlying issues that maybe contributing to distress in your life. I think, you know, one is the issue with work a... the, little bit of uh, maybe some uncertainty and insecurity on your part but I, I see based on what we've gathered in terms of the information, more so the, the tension is comin' from the, the conflict on your relationship and uhm, yeah, I'm wondering whether not your husband would be open to, possibly seeing someone with the two of you, to address some of that?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes sure..</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he open minded about that kind of thing?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I could talk to him about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum, okay. Well, what I like to do is recommend that you talk to him about it and help if he's open uh, g- give me a call-back and I- I'll give you some names because it's uh, important that you know you see, see somebody together it's probably better that you don't see me because...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I say I was gonna suggest..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, yeah, but he may feel ah, that I'm a little bias cause I've been working with you and ethically that you know it's... be the better thing to do is to refer you on to somebody that can be totally objective from you to start.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum, uhum, makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so would you think about talking to him about that this way?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Sure, I'll talk to him, I don't know how he's going to- how he responses gonna be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, well it's worth you try at least than usually. (crosstalk)...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: It's worth to try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you gonna be addressing the issue.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay. That would be fine.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think that's something you, you really have to be conscientious about because, again as I explain to you about the, the, the- use the analogy of the skin rash, if that is still an open wound area, I mean, it's quite regenerating inside it just gonna have the tendency to come back.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I mean the, the, the techniques are good for helping you to manage the symptoms but it doesn't, this is not a cure.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum, right, (crosstalk) I understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make sure, just take a look of the underlying issues.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so I like you to think about that a little bit. And uh, for homework, I'd like you to continue to keep the Panic log and we're gonna continue the same regime, but I would like you to try the exercises and at the same time I would like you to use the tape. And begin to, uh, expose yourself to some of the, situations that you experience before we had a panic attack to go back to those meetings, to go back to driving home and the car and the route that you took the time, that you had the... uh, the panic attack, to go back into the department store and, and make repurchase.. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...and pick up the packages... [giggles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pick up those packages that you left fallen all over to the s- to the floor..</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: [giggles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...where it happened and uh, kinda back tracks that you can... produce uh, some new footages of the uh... new type of a tape coping... uh, you know coping image. Uhm, alright. Are you beginning to get the feeling like this is something that you c- you can get to handle on?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Alright.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah. Uhm... (crosstalk) sorry I've waited so long actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, alright. But you, you practice some of the exercises during the week?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. It's important that you'd be very faithful with that as much as you can.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: And I wanted to ask you, how long do I have to do that? How, I mean everyday? For...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh well, you, you might want, you know, do at least once a day for a while until you get real, familiar with it and real comfortable with it so that any of those sensations don't wag you out or, or... for you... for a little...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...like that... and then we can increase a little bit like I had you to do some of the symptom induction and home to the point where you started to have a little anxiety, I mean have you pushed it beyond that a little bit more and so that you can bring yourself down of a, a little... bigger high.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...next time, a little bigger (ph) peek... of the anxiety so that you're really get comfortable with that. And uhm, it's gonna be important that sometime you know, to understand, that you may have some back slides periodically okay? To expect that, that's very important...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But uh, yeah, that again just do what we thought, yeah, and the ideas to... to refine constantly, your interpretation so that you reassure yourself at the same time doing the breathing and... and...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: You mean I could actually experience another... very intense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's, it's uh, its possible, that, that could happen and that happen sometimes. People get a little bit relax and it comes back and that's why I'm saying you know, it- you're not completely out of the words and it may happen if it does don't, don't catastrophize about it. Just try to get a hand on those the best you can.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: 'this time after awhile, it's sort of a like a diminishes all together?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's our hope. That's what we hope to... (crosstalk) to see.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: And what time frame what- (crosstalk) the beginning of therapy to... what's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it depends (crosstalk) I mean you gotta remember you've had this for ten years so, it's not gonna be something that we get rid of it overnight and that's why, you know you've, you've had a pretty good grade to success just in this place a couple of weeks. Uhm, again, prepare yourself for the fact that that could happen and if it does don't get out bad of a shape, just go back and take a look at you know, what you did and uh, heading it off with the past very early and lookin' for those keys is very important. So let's uh, we'll touch base. How about we give a couple of weeks for some of that uh, 'till it occur and we'll get back together.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence)  I'm (clears throat) thinking about, again, what you said on Friday, and I think that was on my mind all weekend, in a way.  Because—, and this is something that even while I was here Friday, when I was quiet right before the end, it was already almost as if, I had this feeling when you were saying it, and I don't know if I can r_ even remember everything.  But I remember the feeling of relief that, "Oh, this answers whatever it is that's been troubling me."  And, and then feeling that I was losing it.  Because part of my feeling of relief came out of being rational, and thinking that I didn't need to feel that way toward you or toward MSCZ as I had toward my father, or I didn't need to anticipate the same things again.  But, th_ then all weekend, I guess what I was feeling or thinking, so I didn't really put it into words was that I still have this feeling and—.  It doesn't do any good to be r_, at least it's hard, put it that way, to be rational.  Because the feeling is still there, at least with MSCZ.</p>

<p>I don't know, even when I came in today, and I—, again I don't know whether you look the same as you always do to me, but when you smiled, it seemed like a very warm smile and I w_, I felt like—, I felt happy and I wanted to respond and then it seemed like, eh, temporarily I would, but then later I'd think I shouldn't have, or anyway I would have a reaction against responding.  And this weekend—, I don't know how we started doing this, probably because MSCZ was wanting to make love to me and I was pulling away as usual or wanting to pull away as usual, so we just talked.  Eh, we didn't get to any state where either one of us was mad.  We just started talking about it, and I was just saying that, I don't know, sort of what I was remembering feeling after Friday and what I was thinking, but that I still react the way I do, and I didn't know what to do to start changing.  Because I could see I had to do something.  So he said, "Well, why don't you just, when you start feeling that you're going to react that way do something to counteract it like, if you're feeling like pulling away from me go toward me or touch me or something that would sort of enforce yourself not to let that feeling take over."</p>

<p>And I felt better after we'd had that talk, and it was easier not to pull away and all.  And, and, and in a sense I suppose I was trying it, in that I don't know, it wasn't—, "making an effort" sounds wrong somehow.  I wanted to do what I was doing, but I also could feel that other feeling was there.  So it was easier to have MSCZ make love to me, but I wasn't making love back to him.  And I didn't mind having intercourse, but I didn't really want it.  And I was feeling no feeling like I sometimes have about it.  And I don't know I think in the end I (hesitates) just wondered how long I could keep up that way, and whether I was kidding myself or just what's happening and—.  (silence)</p>

<p> Or maybe what I was feeling is that I was discouraged that after the f_, the feeling I had initially when you were talking, that everything didn't change almost like magic.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>First I was just thinking that I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I feel as if on Friday when I was listening to what you were saying, I was listening to only part of it.  But I'm not sure exactly if I was.  It seemed like I was listening to all of it, but somehow now I have the feeling that there was something else you were saying that I didn't hear, that might help me.  And then—, and then I began to think about school and all the things I have to which made me think that starting with this Friday, the play, and then that you wouldn't be here.  And that made think that my first reaction to your saying you wouldn't be here Thursday and Friday was, again, to be rational and accept it, and I didn't have any reaction, but then I sort of wonder.  Here I was listening to something you were saying, at first I think not thinking anything was going to come that would change my attitude that I've been having lately, and then you did say something that struck me very strongly, and that I saw as helping me.  And then after that you said you wouldn't be here, and I wonder if (hesitates) I don't know, it didn't seem like I did this, but i—, I guess it would make sense if I had, that then I pulled away again from seeing it as help.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, what did you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  About your cancelling?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah, did you have any—, did you think about it all?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well at first I thought, "Well, there are times when you do have to be out."  And then I immediately kind of thought, "And there are times when I want to cancel", sort of like we're even, I guess.  And I also thought right away, "It'll make it easier for me in a way, because Thursday I'm seeing the doctor I'm going to start going to, and he can—, I can only get there at 3:30, which would mean if he is late at all it would have been very tight making it here on time.  So I don't have to worry about that.  But I don't know maybe it was to convince myself that it didn't matter or something.  And Friday, then I'll be free to have lunch with people, if, if I want or—.  I don't know, my first reaction was, "Fine, it's fine with me."</p>

<p>But the thing that I keep wondering about is that I do keep thinking I won't be coming here Thursday, and I won't be coming here Friday.  Even if I'm thinking of it in those terms it does keep reoccurring to me.  So it makes me wonder if I'm really feeling so fine about the whole thing.  And also just the fact that I did have a very strong reaction, of I, I don't know exactly what, but things just seemed quite clear and—.  In some way because I hadn't been able to think that long about it or to be in a situation other than when you just told me that I could see if really did understand something.  But it seemed like when I—, after feeling like that, I would have gone home and been happier and—.  Well things were a little easier this weekend, but yet they weren't quite the way I would have expected, after that feeling.  So that makes me wonder, too.  I don't know, it was as if, I was thinking, "Well, things really aren't any different after all anyway" or "I'm right to feel this way, be distrustful."</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What are you distrustful of me about? Eh, or what were you on Friday?  I mean what are you referring to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  It seems odd, but I'm not sure exactly.  I just seemed like the right word.  But I don't know, almost trusting you with my feelings, and yet I'm telling you—, or it seems like even this last month, I've told you a lot of my feelings that, in a way I'm trusting you with.  But, uhm, somehow trusting that you are helping me, and that you are here to help me.  And looking at it that way and carrying over a feeling of you are helping me when I leave here, seems mo—, to be more trusting than telling you other feelings and I—.</p>

<p>I don't know, I just—, now—, I hadn't thought about this during the weekend.  It just somehow seemed that this could have happened to me over the weekend, now, while I'm thinking about it today.  But it seems like something that—.  Here you told me something, and I was very happy that you'd helped me in that way, and I pulled away from that feeling.  Not completely, because I still saw you smiling at me today when I came in and thought of it as a very nice smile and, and that I wanted to respond to it but—.  On the other hand, in a way I didn't want to think about that.  I don't know, the only comparison I can think of—, because I—, it's hard to get out this—, is just the way I am so often in any relationship with people, of keeping things formal and being reserved for a long time.  (pause)</p>

<p>And just—, when things start loosening up a little, I can often just feel I don't really trust that it should yet somehow and—.  Well, I just pull back.  I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You know, eh, what's, what seems to me, uhm, something missing from what you do say.  And what occurs to me that's missing is that you don't really tell me what the understanding that you feel you had was, in detail.  You alluded to it, eh, but you don't really tell me in detail.  If it was that important a feeling, you must have thought about it.  What you've referred to as things seeming clear must have been more than what you've hinted at.  Because it's possible that maybe, you know there's more to be understood.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well that's the feeling I think I have and—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But, but, see—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  —that's what I'm struck by—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  —is that in s_.  What, what, uhm, happens is not that you bring in what you do understand and then try to enlarge it or—.  It doesn't happen that way, which is—, must mean something.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it makes me think and, I don't know, sometimes, well, talking about this understanding, I might have thought, "Well, I did talk about it Friday in detail, at least I thought it was in detail, and so I don't need to again."  But yet I think my feeling was different in talking about it then.  Because on Friday I felt very much that, in one sense anyway, that I was being one—, or not one sided but that my understanding was just taking in one part of it, the part that struck me than as so important.  But yet I was willing to trust telling you.  I mean I think there was a trusting then and—.  I don't know, today it's almost I don't want to reveal what the understanding I had was, because I know it's not the whole thing.  And I don't want you to know either how much I've missed or how I see it, because somehow again again that's trusting you with something very personal or—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because the part that—, I don't know you said quite a bit before this, or after, too, maybe, but what I got out of what you said then was— (hesitates). I don't know, I-, now I can't remember what I was just about to say which—.  I guess I really don't want to tell you now, but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>There was something just then I was going to tell you, and I don't know what it was, but all I can think of now is almost in more general terms of—.  Had— (exhales), th_ this feeling of understanding came from your saying, "You're reacting in this way like you did with your father and now you are with me and with MSCZ and anticipating the same thing."  And what I thought was, and I know I don't need to anticipate the same thing.  (pause)</p>

<p>But it, but something's odd going on, because the more I try to think about what you said Friday, in order to say something now, the vaguer my memory of it gets.  (pause)</p>

<p>I just thought of a way to put how I seem to be feeling now, which does seem to be, in a way how I was feeling this weekend.  Because in a way I was feeling one thing and then rationally telling myself another like I am here of—.  I remember on Friday I got something out of what you said that told me, I really don't have to be so afraid, and I can trust you, and I can trust MSCZ.  I mean I was feeling it right then when you said it.  So now I know I can, and I can be very—, I mean then I—, that's when I get rational.  I know I can.  And so one—, on the one hand I'm sort of standing over myself saying I know I can be rational now and not feel that way and yet I keep feeling that way.  (pause)</p>

<p> So I don't end up pulling away, certainly in any way, not the way I was before.  And, and maybe a little less so, but I'm still pulling away I think.  (silence)</p>

<p>And it makes me think I'm back to something I think you started with on Friday, which I didn't concentrate on at all (sniff).  Uhm, that, I don't remember your words, but I think the attitude was I'm just sort of giving up and it's—, and saying, "This is the way I am."  Because for some reason I just now was thinking about my fear again of being a mother just like my mother, which involves just thinking, "Well, I'm just like my mother.  It's what always is happening.  I'm always reacting the same way.  There's nothing I can do."  And somehow I—.  And then I remembered you had said something about that Friday, that attitude, I mean it involved more than just thinking that about my mother and me.  And I don't remember now.  And I remember I don't—, I mean I don't recall thinking much of it Friday either.  I was thinking about something else you said.  And that seems to be partly that feeling I had over the weekend, too, of, "Now I'm trying to change and I'm really exercising this rational understanding," or whatever I thought was an understanding, "and yet somehow still the feeling's there and still I'm just the same."  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just found myself, and I don't know how I got here, thinking about, again, things we need to do for the play.  And it just makes me think again that all weekend I would alternate between thinking about, well this problem, how I'm—, my attitude toward things and my feeling toward things.  Then, I don't know, this was one of those weekends where I'd wake up early just sort of running down lists in my mind about how I have to do this and this and this.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I just—, I had the feeling, certainly Sunday, because I woke up early Sunday doing it, and then today when I noticed that things—, I mean I have to be organized now because there isn't that much time, but I mean it isn't quite as serious as the way I was feeling yesterday seems.  And so it seems I—, and I had the feeling yesterday, too, when I got up so early and then, I don't know, do whatever I could do at home connected with school and realized that again there wasn't really that much that I could do.  I mean it was just a matter of always being organized every day, and it just seemed like I was turning to it to get away from something else.  (silence)</p>

<p>I don't know why I was thinking about this, too.  Because I was think—, I think there's something about feeling sympathetic in some way with the boy involved, but this week is the week of a book exhibit at school.  And actually for our year we don't have any special books on exhibit, so we could do this anytime, but it's better to keep it in one week.  All the parents are supposed to come in and look at possible reading for the summer.  And one mother came in today with—, bringing the boy—, this is the boy that's adopted.  And she was very talkative about what this boy likes and what he doesn't like and so forth and yet she never asked him what he wanted.  And, uhm, since he's reading very well in CDP, and they're switching right away next year, I suggested she might want to just use easy-to-read regular books, but thinking, "Well, she can just get those out of libraries near by where they'll be this summer."</p>

<p>And I said, "1st grade does have an exhibit, but I don't know how good it is for what you'd need," and it really wasn't.  But she wanted to but something for him, I guess, to make him feel important in someway or wanted or, I don't know.  Anyway, so she went down there, and again didn't ever say, "Any of these interesting to you."  She just picked up these—, a few books saying, "Well, this is just what we want, and this is what we want or this is what he'd want."  And he was right there, but she was talking as if he weren't.  And then she was debating between 2 books, one of which we do have in CDP, too, and it was clear to me he didn't seem to be very interested in it.  And the way his mother decided not to get one of them wa—, the one that's in CDP was he could read it in CDP if he wanted to, before the summer.  But he just kind of looked like, 'Ugh, I don't want to do that.'  And he's a, he's a very talkative boy and yet, uhm, she just did all the talking for him and I don't know—.  I think in a way I was surprised, because I've always thought of her always saying to him, "What do you want?  What do you want?"  And in a way she does.  I mean in a way he is spoiled, just from things that he's done and said.  But yet in this way I had the feeling she was just smothering him.  She kept patting him on the head as if—.  And that, too, looked like, to me, that it was bothering him, as if, 'Now I'm showing how much I love my boy.'(pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know what it was, whether it was that she didn't ask what he wanted whe—, eh, in a case where it did matter what he wanted or if there was something about her attitude as if he weren't capable of saying what he wanted.  And I don't know, the way she was patting him on the head, it's—, it was as if he were an animal or so young that that was how you would show a child you cared.  But I thi— I_, eh, I felt he was squirmy over it and I just—, I guess I was just feeling sympathetic to him.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  (chuckles)  Well, I guess you really know.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, but I don't.  I keep thinking why do I think of it now?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  (said simultaneously)  No, because that's what you're feeling.  See?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I can't see how I am.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, but that's what you said about the whole thing.  You're—, even though you felt at the time that I was giving you something that was good for you, made you feel better, it didn't really work.  Wasn't really what you needed.  Just like a pat on the head.  Made you feel good for the moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That makes me th—, remember another feeling I had when you said it that I'd forgotten until now.  I think part of that feeling of relief was when you were saying, making that comparison to feelings toward my father or maybe toward my mother, too.  I don't recall exactly how you were doing it now, but—.  In any case, my thinking was I was justifying feeling that way with them.  Because that was what happened.  And so I don't know, it was almost like I—, that feeling of relief came partly out of thinking you're not blaming me.  And I mean it wasn't that you don't have to do anything about it, but just simply that you weren't accusing me.  (pause)</p>

<p>So it seems when I think of having thought of that right after your s_, talking about my reaction to the boy's being patted on the head, and my—.  I'd associated it with being patted on the head.  I think of what you'd said Friday was like a pat on the head, and sort of like encouragement, but yet I got home and found I was still feeling the same way.  So I don't know whether I'm saying that pat on the head didn't do any good or if I'm saying I want some more pats on the head.  I'm not sure which it is.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or if pats on the head leave me the same, I guess maybe I'm saying I want something that will be more than a pat on the head.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I can't think of anything specific, except f_, a feeling that I'll keep when I go home I guess.  Something that will help me—.  (pause)</p>

<p>But as soon as I say that I m_, I think again how I was even feeling at the time.  I wasn't listening to everything you were saying.  And so I think how can I say this when maybe you were helping me more than I let you.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But you know there was something more you asked for last week.  Quite literally.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  And I thought of it today and I thought, "Well, I really don't think I want to think about that for a while."</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Ahh.  Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (deep breath) (pause)  I'm not sure if it's because I'm afraid to know your answer or afraid to really ask. (pause)</p>

<p> And I know when I thought of it today (clears throat) my thinking was, "Oh, I can ask again later.  You know what I want."  It's like I've informed you what I want, and now I'll be really cagey and let it go for awhile, and then bring it up again as if—, I don—, I can't recall anything I used to do, but it seems like it's kind of a technique of mine.  And in fact, it is something—, it's a way of handling my father that my mother once specifically told me about.  Suggesting I think at that time that this is the way men are and, and so if I wanted to handle MSCZ well, this was a good technique.  Because I remember she said something like, "Your father always says no first thing.  So let him get used to the idea and then ask again. " Or bring it up again.  I'm not sure she said "ask."  And that's also the way I react, to new ideas.  I immediately—, not sure I like them, just because they're new and I—.  And it, and—, I feel better about getting a new idea and having time to think about it and then deciding on it later.  So I guess I'm still trying to manage you.  (silence)</p>

<p>And after saying that I found I was thinking that, "Well, I'd like to ask you today."  And then thinking or, eh, it was more almost a feeling than thinking, "No, I can't."  It's just—, I just can't.  And so then I go back and forth on that.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  It seems to me what that suggests really is that the, eh, idea of changing the hour means more than just that to you.  Has some significance beyond that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I was just thinking that I'm (exhales) afraid to know partly because it's what I want, and you know it's what I want.  And so if I don't get it I'll be angry.  I don't know if that's—, if there's another significance that I'm just not thinking of, but—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, that's one you haven't acknowledged—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  —so far.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I haven't?  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You skirted around it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I guess maybe I feel more clearly, today in any case, that that would be—.  I mean I've worked out when I'd like to come best and—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  By God I better do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, or else I'll be angry.  (laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But you see, that isn't what you come out with.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>Interview 15 - Client 0426-002 - Reel No. 111 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I've sort of run out of humorous things to say. I'm sure that you will be relieved by that. Well it's the color of the index cards is pretty.

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) And they don't come all (ph)... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe just [inaudible at 0:00:31.4]... if you want them out. Because I put the winter clothes away.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you put them certainly... in the places you use, in the drawers that... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. [inaudible at 0:00:48.3]... [inaudible]... when it was [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:00:59.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Whenever you're listening to your tapes. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you think they say?

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:01:21.2]... so it's kind of a nice [inaudible]... when it first opens. (chuckling) I don't have much to say today. Do you have anything you want to talk about?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How come?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't have any problems and I figure anything else is going to maybe be about...I mean...like I think we could use it for an hour but I think it's like a waste of my time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:02:18.2]... You could sit here and visit for an hour but that's not, you feel why you're here and, in terms of the things that are not pertinent here today, we've gone electively (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well even, well, I mean, I still can't climax. But I just, I'm not really worried about that, like I used to be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:02:45.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I'm never going to. Because I think that, I mean, I kind of feel like I will and...it's going to take time. And like we just started, like concentrating on that part of me and it's...you don't just do it or else you would have. I mean, there's been no reason to come here because of that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:03:11.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: If you'll notice that...like Dixon, I'm really changing. And I know, well as I think back...like we went to this party and there were two women's libbers there, you know. And I really did, because you saw Eban (ph) was, how Eban attacked them, which was so different from me. And then I get to think, "Well...I should have, was I bad? (chuckling) You know, did I hurt anyone's feelings?" (chuckling) Knowing full well that they don't give a darn whether they do or not. And then they...why should I be concerned about their personal feelings? So... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not [inaudible at 0:03:58.8]... today. That was like, like you see yourself changing but there's still part of the old, like after you come crashing in, then you look around and see where the pieces are?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I didn't realize until the next...like the next day he was saying, "Boy, you really come on strong. I think therapy's been...done a good thing for you." And then I wonder...that was my first style (ph). Well I said, "You know, it's Jessica and we lived in the same building and I don't want to be really nasty to her." It's not, they've been like, like she's been treating me more like [inaudible at 0:04:40.8]... since that night of the party, I think. I don't know if it has anything to do with it or not. But it was kind of a good feeling...because when we first got here I would just sit at parties and not making comment (ph). And what, it really irritates me about her and this other lady, who were really gung-ho women's libbers. It's really a personal problem.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:05:19.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I...and it occurs to me that maybe all women (chuckling) libbers have personal problems at home that are sending them out on the streets to demonstrate or something. I, it was really so obviously personal, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: That I was, a silly kind of a thing. I mean, I like the secrets (ph) now, you know? It makes me feel good that I can see that and realize why and that I'm not really [inaudible at 0:05:56.7]... I don't know. I mean, I'm just, I'm liberated because I feel like I want to stay home...like it's my decision that I made. And like there's something about them that they can't either, accept their role or do something about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's something about them like, they're sort of caught in between [inaudible at 0:06:25.7]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, either stay at home and take care of your wife or your husband and child, or I mean, if you're not going to be happy, make arrangements and go out and...do what you want to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And stop complaining.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's just, it's the same, like it's the same things at every discussion or in every discussion it's the same little things. And I don't even think like it's a matter of money for those particular. I mean, maybe they want everyone to think more money. You know, like they say, well women don't get paid enough. Well...like there are some very successful women who do get paid enough and, like I think both of them are being paid ample for what they do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like you've, I mean, you see these women complaining and in a sense it makes you [inaudible at 0:07:41.7]... feel better off or something. Like you don't have those kind of hangups that you would need to do something like that. Like you're solid and not caught between two worlds and complaining. That you're solid in what you're doing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. On the other hand...like if I had been raised differently and did want to go out and work, I might, like I might be the same, well I'd hate to think I would, I mean, like they're bitter I think. They're just very bitter women. And like they're even a little masculine, when it gets right down to it. I mean, Saturday night Jessica opened the door for my husband. (chuckling) It just seemed...like what I was looking at her, I mean, what I had admired Jessica for was being like a fulfilled woman, and I find...like she's not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you think, not only isn't she a fulfilled woman but there's something distinctly unwomanly [for that to happen to you.] (ph) [0:08:56.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that they're different from how you saw them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I thought that...like there goes a happy little family. And I'm, so like I wonder if...how many people do have happy little families, once you get to know them?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Me too. And then your own people [inaudible at 0:09:22.0]... different people you tend to look up to, being fulfilled or something, that will really if, if you were to know them better... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, they really... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...have flaws.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I think, like I see this going on, I think being envious of all these different people, if I hadn't...sort of solved my own self or something...like my own little problems, which were...looking at everybody else and thinking, "Wow, they're really got a good thing going and where am I?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds, and I'm not clear Jessica. It sort of sounds like you think two things. So it happens for you and the one is, like you don't find your little self saying so often, "Hey, where am I?" And the other thing that happens is, you don't put those people on a pedestal, some of those people you know.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, that's right and this really makes you feel much better about everything. I mean, I can't even remember how I felt. (chuckling) But I know I didn't feel as good as I do now. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're so different that you can't even make contact with what you were like.

</p><p>PATIENT: I know I must be out of here (ph) I'm very happy. I mean, I'm seeing that they're not really very happy and what did I think they had?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't make any sense now.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it really doesn't. It's like...a light suddenly turned on. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like also, it's like, all of the sudden seeing it completely differently. Like something that was very idyllic all of the sudden is all melting wax or something. Like this difference between night and day is.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well... Yeah, I'd always thought I was very clever about people. [0:12:01.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A great judge of character?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, if they're obviously very rotten, I can see that right away. (chuckling) But like if they really have problems that they can't solve...like I mean, everybody does I think, but she puts on such a good show.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe on [your notes she has] (ph) [inaudible at 0:12:48.1]... So it's yes?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you might know if she had problems but she, if she covers, I mean, she's always so bubbly and so outgoing and so this and so that, but maybe she doesn't have time to...come down, so it's...like she realizes and could consider using what she wants out of life, you know. [We all have. and that's her talking.] (ph) I've been cold and hard my whole day. (chuckling) But I feel like I am more able to say what I think and not really, I mean, I used to say what I think and hear (ph) or thought, and then it...kind of bite my tongue because I'd hurt somebody's feelings or offend somebody. And now it's...if you would ask me, then I'm going to tell you and then you're...then you take the consequences, and you don't feel like everybody has to like me...and we get along so much better that way. Because I think in the end they really do...like they care for you more if you're not going along with, I mean, there are a lot of people that want you to argue with them, just because...there's nothing else to do or maybe they want to show you how right they are and it gives them an opportunity [audio blip at 0:14:41.7 to 0:14:53.2]... you know, like I'm getting along better with people even now that I'm, have my own, I mean...it's not like I'm a philosopher or anything...in this great wisdom or that I have a lot of admirers following me, but I just feel that the people that we associate with are looking more at me as a person. And like maybe they even did and I just...suspected them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you don't really, I mean, in some way you don't know if the change is, if they're indifferent or just as you see them differently. So it's, whichever it is, it sounds like you experience yourself as being very different with people, regardless of whether that's the truth.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So ultimately, while you feel much more solid and like you can come out with your own feelings... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...the end result of that is that people like you even better [now you think] (ph) than [overlapping voices at 0:15:58.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or if I...if I do come on with my own and somebody proves that, that's really not the right way to think...that it doesn't offend me so. You know like I can be...in the next two minutes I can say something else that I feel that I don't usually volunteer. It's sitting around listening to other people, I just sit like it's a rehash of the same story. I mean, it used to be, the parties when we first got here, was the Vietnam war and now it's women's lib...and you hear that same thing, with the same groups, the same ideas. And nobody's going to convince anybody because their argument's too staunch (ph)...it's very solid, on either side. And I just don't feel that it's...unless someone is, it's not worth it for me to enter my views or even start the conversation on women's lib, [the students in...] (ph) [0:17:19.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you feel there's sort of a meaningless, like sort of meaningless ritual that you'd rather have the involvement?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really is, because, and maybe it wouldn't be if we had new blood into the group. But it's the same group...you know exactly what they're going to say before they open their mouths. And I'm bored listening to them and I would think...like they'd be bored listening to themselves.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Depends on [inaudible at 0:17:53.8]... and like maybe [inaudible]... pretty serious to you all, going through, oh, picking of animals, the millions you'd go through [inaudible]... you're now requiring another person to go through behaviors you can. The effort to do that maybe sounds like that people [you've been around] (ph) so far and to maybe go forward.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And they try to, I mean, the two women try and [see him] (ph) to that civic group but I don't know what they're trying. I mean, because everyone, I mean, I would suspect that most all of them there have thought, "Yeah, that women's group, we'd pay to be pulling if their wives had wanted...if they want the same thing." Yeah but it seems, it just seems so, well I guess that's what conversation is all about, but it just seems so meaningless to go over and over and over the same thing when nobody's, that's what I hate, is inaction. You want to go out...I like many spaces to a group of young women who are ready to...shoot all over Central Park with literature and doing this or that or if you want to do that. But to sit and go over it and over it, it just seems like kind of a waste of time, although, I mean, what else do you do I mean? [0:19:32.0]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there's a, maybe you don't know what else you do, but it sounds like there's something about their inability to do anything because [inaudible at 0:19:41.9]... that make you terribly impatient with them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, like that's what I feel about everybody. You know, I told you about that old lady on the bus, and everybody standing around there, and nobody will do anything. And it's just, it is, it's very aggravating. And so if you're not going to do anything, and I don't even mind if they...like at one party, if they take the whole evening to tell their tale, but don't do it every party thereafter, for months and months, until some new headline comes back. It just... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like either you do something or shut up?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And these people just... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I'm, there might be something more interesting for the group as a whole.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And certainly for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'd already heard all of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:20:46.5]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think most everybody there had heard most of it. (chuckling) Or probably every single word.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds almost like a planning scene, rehearsed [and they using it again.] (ph) [0:20:59.4] 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't feel like I'm being selfish for wanting to change the tune.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not just you, everyone else is getting weary too.

</p><p>PATIENT: It has. I don't know. You know, like I didn't ask anybody if they were tired of hearing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that it might just be you like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe they're all [inaudible at 0:21:29.1]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe they're all doing pretty, [you all must need help?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Well, I'd have to think that over. You know? No, they're not. They've got a lot more than that going for them. And...like some of them, who are very quiet, have...many interesting things to talk about. And maybe like Jessica, because she's so boisterous...ought to tone it down a little and draw the other people out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In the way you talk about... 

</p><p>PATIENT: It does.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...Jessica (ph) makes it sound like you saw a sort of evil [inaudible at 0:22:19.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: She is. I mean to tell you, that these people moved in next door to her and because of her influence, they are now invited to everything that we...have. And thinking back on it, because of her Jim and I were introduced to that group. Now...that takes quite a person, to get her friends into your parties. I mean, they went to a surprise birthday party for a lady they just met once, because Jessica thought that they should go and meet people. And like the man that was giving it for his wife called and said, "Can we invite them?" You know, to his party, man?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So she's so powerful... 

</p><p>PATIENT: She could really...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...he could have... 

</p><p>PATIENT: ...she could get you into places. And it's...like I'm kind of thankful that we met her and that she was so inclined to bring us along. (chuckling) Yeah, like she really does have her good points. (chuckling) And that's one of them, you're not lonely if you live next door to her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, she's [inaudible at 0:23:34.6]... she's a useful person to know if you're on the right side?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well if she likes you. Like I was, I don't know of anybody that she doesn't like. That...like needs to make more of an effort. And she has something about her, like but even though you know that she's doing this to you, you go along with her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Even though you, you're not sure of this... 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know that she's manipulating you. I mean, we had that bridge party...and I asked her if she could come and she said, "I have guests (ph) coming." And I thought...I really hadn't thought that...her next door neighbors. And then after she mentioned it, I see that I, well I mean, I could have done it without them but...everybody else that plays bridge in [inaudible]... is coming and it wouldn't have been a very nice thing. But I wondered if they weren't coming, would she have come? (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Say if that's sort of a blackmail?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't...no. I don't think she's conscious of it either. But it's just that I've been...kind of stepping back and looking at her, because I was so...in awe of her when I first knew her. I don't know, maybe she does know she has this power, but she's really missing her calling. I mean, it seems to me like, if she could do that, she ought to be in the legislature...something important. Maybe she could get something accomplished.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean be a legislature that pushes women?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't, well, pushing somebody. I mean, you could push some bills past...?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's something [she says] (ph) [0:25:33.6]... that's hitting me, like I don't know if I can quite get at because it hasn't formed in my head, something that... Well, it sounds to me like, this, is a woman, if you've obviously looked up to, obviously admired very much and now there's some warts but I'm not clear what they are. Because it sounds like she's instilled (ph), she still seems like a very powerful woman to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: And she's just, she's pleasing to be around too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's sometimes it's, like I say, she just takes over. And that case you cannot beat her, you have to leave.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:26:22.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I'm, I don't know. To me she is, and I'm not going to fight her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. She's been heard (ph) making that ground hold up.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't feel that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean like, last night I was down visiting my neighbor and she heard us and she came over because she was alone and she had nothing to do. And...like the conversation changed and it focused on her, where before, it had been Jodie and I exchanging a few homey little things, you know? And then it...it got carried away into what Jessica wanted to talk to. And I sat for a while and I thought, "Well I'm not really too interested, I'm not interested in this because I've never been to Europe." And they both had and they were talking about all the [inaudible at 0:27:16.9]... And I think like...you'd have to see them to appreciate them, you can't just hear it. So I left but I didn't feel any malice toward her for coming and breaking up my conversation. She's just like, she just that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like at something that you would be angered. If you were angry with her about it but she didn't do it on purpose, that's just her nature is that way.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But a dog barked and she dominated.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I mean, she's perfectly, it wasn't...like she didn't give me icy stares and say go home or anything, she... I don't know if she likes me. She doesn't care when she meets me. (chuckling) I mean, she seems cordial enough.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And so, I think like, I don't think she could help it if you were a dominating person. I mean, obviously you couldn't help it or you wouldn't be that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm still, maybe we shouldn't... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's just that I don't think...as the saying goes, that her ship doesn't sink. I see that she's human, she's not a God. And when you, and it's much easier to take now, rather than thinking that she's...floated two lives, doing everything perfect.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:28:56.7]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: She's much easier to live by, because she's not perfect. And if she'll accept me, I'll accept her. Accepts me saying [inaudible at 0:29:16.0]... kind of lost that territory now to her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of useful (ph) [inaudible]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And before I think I must have been like a little puppy, following her around. [inaudible at 0:29:33.6]... (chuckling) It leaves a bad taste.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. As the adoring [thick or thin] (ph) view [inaudible]... because you think about hanging on her every word and [overlapping voices at 0:29:54.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That should be allowed.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It already, I mean, I can even remember, she had read a book and she just thought it was so hilarious. And I read it and I tried to laugh. I didn't [overlapping voices at 0:30:08.7]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She thought it was funny, it must be funny.

</p><p>PATIENT: It must be funny.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And there might be something wrong with you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I thought there was something...yeah. And I, just until Jodie moved in and said, "Oh, I really didn't think that was very funny." That I thought, "Geeze, I do have a sense of humor." And...maybe she's not or...I've found somebody my own speed in Jodie. (chuckling) But I think she was like, if she likes you, you can get along a lot better with her. I mean like...I was having trouble with her talking about Jennifer and Sarah, and now we've, like my girls aren't around her anymore and I'm forgetting...how really hurt I was and how she'd hurt Jennifer especially. And I...I really believe that she thought that Jennifer was out of step and that...we were responsible for raising her. And I think that she thought that we were really doing something wrong. And she wasn't considering the age difference. I think maybe she was even trying to help us, because she has a very high opinion of herself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So she wasn't, it's not clear [overlapping voices at 0:32:08.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think she was being malicious.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. But it was in spite of that. My guess is [what I thought she was thinking something about,] (ph) [0:32:18.2] she made all kinds of judgments about Jennifer and about us and I bought them for a while.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I, yeah, I had begun to wonder if my daughter wasn't some sort of [inaudible]... and... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you were to blame?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like she (ph) tried to tell [inaudible]... not like luck (ph) but using different little things she had read...from Dr. Spock or something, trying to set him on the right path...so he could run up and change his daughter's behavior.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And of course that didn't really go over very well, his behavior science. (chuckling) But it's even, yeah, I was, she's normal after all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What a relief that must be.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) Well, yeah. Yeah, it was kind of fun, this fortune, to live next to her...when you're kind of, I don't know, what's the word other than wishy-washy? You know, like she's dominate and I'm... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Submissive?

</p><p>PATIENT: ...submissive. And I think that just doesn't mix.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It doesn't pay to be a doormat when you're, when someone's looking [through all the blinds up liking to see?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I could even...like I'd even think to myself, "Well, I really don't think..." Well...like the book. I really didn't think that was something (ph) that...she seems to know most everything, so maybe it was. And it's...it had been, it was just everyday things and take her word for everything and... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wind up friends. Doubting yourself time and time again.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and really being unhappy because things weren't really going the way I wanted them to go, even in my own house. Well, I mean, I think I was going to be rough on Jennifer, because trying to shape (ph) her up before she went to school...and it was the fact that she had nothing to do but run around with three-year-olds...that was, I think I really gave her a hard time. I mean, she's fine, she's happy now that she's going to school and things are really, as Jennifer says, "It's a groovy day." (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like Jessica really, not only did she make you doubt yourself, but it sounds like she sort of made you act in bad ways and her disapproval and [overlapping voices at 0:35:33.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Her influence, yeah. Yeah, I think like she really, well not she I guess, but...had I continued to be submissive, because she really could have caused some damage to Jennifer.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She really is very harmful.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Something...that wouldn't have been [six stepped] (ph) by the simple fact of going to school, had she started a year before. I feel rather fortunate there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you were, I don't know, like she was luckily saved?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it was lucky that the people didn't move out of the building a year ago and Jessica moved in or...the whole family might have been... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She might have worked you all [inaudible at 0:36:31.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know and I'd even go upstairs and say to myself, "That's wrong." But I'd still act in the way she said and it wasn't, I mean, she didn't even come out and say, "Boy, she's a rotten kid, you'd better do something." It was so subtle it was, "Look at how nicely Wes and Katherine (ph) play." And then it was like, "It's beautiful." Because that was exactly the same thing she said to us before she moved in. "Oh, Wes is always talking about Jennifer and Aaron, and he always wants to go see the girls." And...that just, that puffs the parents up and it's part of her charm. And it's like something she goes through with everybody that has children, that she wants to cultivate their... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of worms her way in with flattery?

</p><p>PATIENT: And we could...like Jim and I could see the same going with Jodie but...like I think she's a little stronger. She's quiet and has her feet on the ground and I don't think that she's going to change because of anything...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's not as susceptible to Jessica's wiles as you were.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. But it was so, I mean, it can't help but puff you up...when anybody says that you just think, "Wow."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You can't help feeling special.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then you look at their child and you think, "Isn't he darling? See how nicely he plays with my daughter." People watching is just fascinating.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And then one thing it sounds like, if you do see yourself [inaudible at 0:38:29.3]... it comes down to just preach this free talk and... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, she needs a new line now. I mean, we've seen this work twice.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because it's kind of cynical and knowing about it now has been.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, we kind of giggle about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Think, "Well, there she goes again." (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, now it's entertaining.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) At the time, we thought that our kids were really neat.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because she has really given them such a good thing. But if they don't get along with Wes, then there's something wrong with them, not Wes, smart little kid. Then to see her going up to the teacher, those teachers don't know what hit them, when he gets into school and momma comes to school. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean she'll take that place apart?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, then it won't be Wes's fault whatever happens but I mean, that's why I say poor little kid.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Poor little kid is momma's really trying to ensure (ph) it for him. [0:40:03.0]

</p><p>PATIENT: I wonder if other people ever see her in the same way that we do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if that's an insight that only you have into her maybe?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I think that if she'd never had...like attacked Jennifer, if we'd ever stopped and...like look at, really look at her. I mean, if things were going along, why bother to see that she is dominate and that she can cause harm to other people? I mean, who would care unless you were her victim?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's it (ph), yeah. So, are you wondering if like you're the only victim?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I was kind of wondering what you would think of her if you met or about people that listen to the tapes? Because you meet her after hearing all this and disregard what you've heard.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And would I see what you've talked to me about? You said, "Could you meet her, like disregard what, everything I've told you, and would you independently arrive at the same conclusion that I do?"

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it would be kind of hard unless you brought one of your children and they played with Wes and hit him. (chuckling) Then you might be in trouble. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's what you're wondering?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess it's not really important, except that I think that like, Jim and I now like her in spite of.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I have an answer to my questions as a hypothesis. [inaudible at 0:43:36.3]... I said, "What does that mean to you?" And it occurred... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, being too, because of... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it occurred to me and I wondered if it was something like, you felt sort of locked into a world that was all yours or yours and Jim's, like a special world and you didn't know, you're not sure if that's so and how much that world corresponds with somebody else's or how much like, it's very unique and [inaudible at 0:44:08.9]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like there's no reason for anybody else to, because like, I don't think they have any close friends. I mean, really close friends that know that you have all of these faults and accept you for that. And like, I don't think we do either. Like there's no one that gives a damn. They're all...if you're fun to be with, that's it. They don't want to go with you through any problems.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're not close to anybody enough, you don't care [inaudible at 0:45:09.0]... so long as it glitters (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And...it's not us though. I mean, it's not only us.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It seems to be that whole group. (yawning) Excuse me. I can't understand that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It puzzles you that everyone should be so sort of standoffish on a deeper emotional level? That no one could really [inaudible at 0:45:44.2]... of that I mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I guess it's not it...like it not really puzzling, because...nobody wants to show some sore spot or...some deficiency in themselves...that the other people haven't already, I mean, if they haven't seen it, that you have a weakness, nobody wants to reveal that. Yeah, like that's not so puzzling. It's just, I wonder if everybody else is satisfied to go on like that?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And the other side of that is, you wonder if other people feel the same about this and as such as you feel about it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but nobody, like that's not anything you would discuss at a party.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's no way for you to get into that, get into your feelings [inaudible at 0:46:48.1]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I mean...I think she's, I'm the [inaudible]... that would be about the only opening line. But it just seems so peculiar to me that everybody else is...just floating along. And I think like, they'd even say, oh, that we do have close friends, but they still wouldn't know them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that in a sense, it's like they don't even know that they're not close to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean...like you come here to see us...you don't really... I mean, like I don't feel anybody knows me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:47:39.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't think that I'm that complicated... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...any more so than any of them would be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it sounds like you may no be very complicated but you sure as hell feel like a censor with them, somebody that's... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't...at the time, but it's like trying to find, sit down and think about it that you... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you have to show?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you have to show for knowing them, in terms of being understood?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just like there should be something more than going someplace with them and having...a nice time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel empty with not knowing this. But when you get triple (ph) ways of level of activity, I'm thinking about liking, you feel pretty empty?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I do. Well, it's not enough to bring me down, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's just like, it occurs to me or Jim and I will be discussing that and we'll feel sorry that...we don't really have close friends that we would discuss different things with. You know and then sometimes you wonder, "Well, will you ever?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you wonder whether you're always focusing, just your life but at in your own world?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or like, what is your definition of a close friend? Maybe that's all it is?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, maybe everybody's like that always?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you have a little secret...and you tell only your best friend. (chuckling) Maybe that's it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you have to remain hidden and that's how life is.

</p><p>PATIENT: I wouldn't want to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You say that's being pretty false with them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I was just thinking...like my mother, who did she have as a close friend? Well, if you don't realize you have, what do you talk about with a close friend that you wouldn't talk about with anybody else? [0:50:31.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure, can you tell me?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, what topics of conversation? It seems like now, in this age, what you'd talk about only with a close friend and not with the whole group.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now are you saying this age is so frank that we would talk about anything with the whole group? I'm not... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know what I would tell a close friend.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh? [inaudible at 0:51:14.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: That I wouldn't and...like announce at a whole, at a gathering...?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I think, it seems to you anyway, that you have no secrets that are... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Maybe it's the fact that I haven't...announced at a card gathering that I'm going to a therapist... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: True.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...and only a select few. (chuckling) But like if you don't go to a therapist then what have you got to tell. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's left? What other secrets are there that you could possibly have?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're not expecting a baby...you're only supposed to tell one person or...and that being your husband.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So maybe it's all me, I'm not clear, see (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe there's nothing to having a close friend. What's it all about?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe but let me just say that back to you. Maybe there's nothing special to having a close friend.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe that. How do you get a person to go to a therapist?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know because I don't know the person and I don't know [inaudible at 0:53:09.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, well Jim's brother is so fouled up. He's adult (ph) never grown up. He is 34 and he's back living with his parents, with his pregnant wife, in a small house. And I think, we just know that he's...like he's eaten up inside and can't find a job. He's more comfortable like working as a construction worker, when he has a chemistry education and he's just about, he's just an odd ball. How do you get him, I mean, Jim feels like he should respect him and you just don't walk up to somebody and say, "You've got to go get yourself straightened out." Is there any sneaky way of doing it?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know, there's, well there's one thing, one thing that it sounds like that you're...one implication of what you say is something like, "I can't do it and Jim can't do it, there's nothing that we can do [inaudible at 0:54:22.5]... you should go to a therapist to deal with [inaudible]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but like he has to want to go into a therapy but how do you even plant this need? I mean, you can force a man to go to a therapist and have him [inaudible at 0:54:42.6]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know Jessica, again, what, all I'm hearing is it sounds like you and Jim have a problem with something. I'm not [overlapping voices]... problem.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, we don't. Oh, no we don't at all. We feel badly that he is so sick.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I'm not hearing that he has a problem. It sounds like he's, and I don't, all I know about him is that he's living with his mother and his pregnant wife in his mother's house, but I don't hear that as much of a, what's the problem?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, his mother is [inaudible at 0:55:23.7]... (chuckling) The problem is that...like it's a small house, they don't want him there, but they, [well there's like issues.] (ph) His mother feels, like she wants him to still be dependent on her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm not, I guess I'm not really that clear, but I don't hear his problem. I hear... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...that Jim has some construction or you have some construction about what's going on.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you'd have to meet him to believe what a problem he has. He's just, he's not a sociable person. He can't be around people. That's what I think, why he's not getting a job, it's he's doing so horribly in his interviews. He's suspicious of people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'll say it again, and I guess I think that you are very hostile on this.

</p><p>PATIENT: You don't think that he has a problem?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know whether he does or not. All I know is that you do...that you're concerned about this guy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if he has a problem or not.

</p><p>PATIENT: But we have a problem with him?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or, yeah, and your problem may simply be, you're concerned about him. And you see him... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...but you don't think he's behaving in a way that he should be happy behaving in or something. But I don't hear his problem. He doesn't sound like he's in any anguish.

</p><p>PATIENT: But he is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'll just, I'll talk about it with you when we have time, but... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you just can't...you can't go along, you can't help with [inaudible at 0:57:11.4]... because you can't watch people functioning normally and not, I don't know, maybe he doesn't wonder, maybe that's his problem, that he doesn't wonder why he's not... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's not?

</p><p>PATIENT: [...close to, I mean, ignoring why either he's feeling guilty.] (ph) (chuckling) You, one of us doesn't understand what the other one's saying.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think I understand what you're saying, you think. You're saying he's behaving in a way that looks sort of cuckoo to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that says to me...like... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, to everybody. I feel like I am understanding some things.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, one for instance was when we moved into this apartment. This little three-year-old girl came up to me, to the door...to say hello, and he like, or she [inaudible at 0:58:12.0]... and Jim and I figured out that her mother had sent her over to spy on us, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're suspicious. I mean, I don't want to make a federal case out of this Jessica, but it sounds like his behavior is distressing to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it distressed me...when he was 26, and now he's 30 and he should be out on his own but he doesn't know how.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, [inaudible at 0:58:45.4]...

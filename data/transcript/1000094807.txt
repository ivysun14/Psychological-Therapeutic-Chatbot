<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Nope, it wasn't me. I read your e-mail that you have got everything set to file the divorce papers and you're just waiting until they are filed and then you will notify Glen.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, I'm going to wait until they come back again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you haven't heard any more from Glen other than that one e-mail. Right?</p>

<p>SARAH: No, and you know what, I'm not going to contact him until I'm ready.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You're getting ready. I'm just in awe. I'm so proud of the way you're handling everything.</p>

<p>SARAH: I was talking to my old boss today.  </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, how did that interview go?</p>

<p>SARAH: I'm not sure yet. Well, he said he'd find out next week about a short term project and the grants are not a lot of money. The grants are only $150,000 which sounds like a lot but it's not.  It was kind of overwhelming and I got it about how much of a second class citizen I am at the university.  I don't have a PhD.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've been married to a PhD and I don't think they are all that way.</p>

<p>SARAH: Well, it wasn't my boss. He doesn't make me feel that way at all. He's really great. It's the system at the university that does that. Job title and like where you can park and all of that. It's very much geared towards PhDs </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: It's Chrissie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi Chrissie.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: It is you and me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope, you and me and Sarah.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Oh Sarah how did your interview go?</p>

<p>SARAH: It was confusing and difficult.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: What?</p>

<p>SARAH: It was confusing to me. Just the reality of working is kind of a shock too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what was the confusing part again?</p>

<p>SARAH: Guess I still have a lot of fantasy about going back. I still have a lot of fantasies about going back there and it was just I don't know I guess I'm still processing everything. They pay less there, I'm going to have to work hard, it's really clear that I'm going to have to work really hard if this grant comes through, and it's going to be temporary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's that?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It's Michelle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi Michelle.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Hi Michelle.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Hello. Who's here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sarah and Chrissie and you and me. I think Marge is out tonight. It's her anniversary.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Marge? Oh neat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think Ana has been sick... the whole family has been battling what was it, the flu and colds and stuff so she said she might be on for a while but she didn't think she would be on the whole time. But I expect Tara and Joan. Am I right?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, Tara told me that she would be on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>SARAH: Did you get your biopsy results?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE:. Yeah, I'll talk about it when everybody is on because I want to talk to Tara. She'll be on. She told me yesterday</p>

<p>MICHELLE: You sound better.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE:. Yeah, I am. I don't have the results yet. It takes till tomorrow or Thursday. Yeah, I'm in physical pain from the surgery, but other than that I'm fine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're online with us and glad you're going to catch us up once everybody is online.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I just hate to repeat myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I totally understand. Yeah, yeah. Michelle do you know anything about Joan? I think she's going to be with us. Does that sound right? </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I didn't read anything about her not being with us but I haven't been on the computer since early this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I think she's going to be with us too? Sometimes I forget when somebody tells us last week but hopefully we'll be hearing a little bit from Ana and Tara will be here.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I can't hear you very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay I was having a little bit of trouble hearing Sarah right at the beginning too.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: So was I with Sarah too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, we can talk about Michelle's question real quick because I think that from the homework about the 21 meals. It was just you know three or four different breakfasts, three or four different lunches so it's three or four different dinners.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Oh I got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Say that again, I don't understand what you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Michelle had said that she didn't understand this one line and it was the one line it was very confusing. Let me see if I can find it real quick.</p>

<p>PARTICIANT: Right, I got it right now.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: It's 21 meals but they don't have to be different. It doesn't have to be 21 different meals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll have enough ideas for 21 meals but they won't be 21 different meals. Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: So I thought what does that mean? I didn't get it but now I get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We don't have seven different breakfasts, seven different lunches.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, we can have like eggs twice and cereal twice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there you go, yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I really don't get it but I get the first part. Four to five breakfasts, four to five lunches, four to seven dinners. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so the goal of this one is to have a once a week shopping plan but  we really do live one day at a time... but we plan. Hi who is it?</p>

<p>TARA: Hi it's Tara.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey Tara. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I had a question about that. Were you finished?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let me finish up quickly Michelle. Hang onto your question for a second. One of the points of the homework was even though we live one day at a time we do kind of plan for the future. You know, we buy a car on payments or we buy a house with a mortgage you know so we do kind of live with some sense of the future and this is trying to get a routine where we shop once a week instead shop daily and so it's kind of working from menus, buy enough breakfast food, buy enough lunch food, buy enough dinner food for the week so that we aren't spending all of our time in grocery stores which is not the best place to be. So that was one of the points in there. So go ahead Michelle.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Well this same thing came up the first time you mentioned this 21 meal planning. I think it was my very first few months of abstinence and the idea of knowing what's going to happen for 21 meals makes me crazy. It's like oh my gosh it's so boring I'd rather die. You know what I mean and what's that about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, sometimes that's about the addiction and sometimes that's just about you being more of a free spirit but my guess is that I know you're a mom who raised a family so you know in general you know it's a little bit easier if you buy enough food for seven breakfasts, seven lunches and seven dinners and that's really all it's about. Who cares when you have which one.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It's about keeping us out of the grocery stores.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's about keeping you out of the stores so the addiction isn't impulsively doing everything.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. My husband does all the grocery shopping </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: But last night I lied in bed and I thought about it and I thought okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The goal is not to know what you are having on Thursday, just that you have food in the house for the planned meals. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, I kind of know what I am having but not on Friday until Friday and that's like a big deal for me but now I know every day what I am having. I wake up in the morning, I go to the bathroom, I go to the computer and I figure out what we're having. I kind of think about it the night before as I'm lying in bed, what's in the refrigerator. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and so what I am encouraging you to do is to shop for your abstinence.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, Don shops but he has my list of standards. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He knows what to have in the house so that you can get up and find one of your breakfasts. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Right, exactly. So yes I am doing that. And you know I was thinking about it, I was thinking it would give me a knot in my stomach to know that for 21 days or 21 meals I'd know way ahead of time. The idea of punching in or having a nine to five job where I punch in I couldn't do it. People like my husband loves the idea though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm kind of a mix. I love the fact that I've been self employed for decades but I also know that I love shopping only once a week and that I have a variety of food in there that I enjoy and find yummy and tasty and so every day I get up and take good care of my body.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, I hear you. I'm pretty much doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know that you probably more than anybody send out an email about your meals and so that tells me somebody shopped knowing that those foods are in your house.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, he knows he knows what I think is good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my second husband was a college professor and he would clips out coupons and he loved cooking and it was wonderful having a "wife" I got to tell you (laughing).</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Well you know what, I'm like your ex-husband. I clip coupons and for instance I had to go to Costco today to pickup my contacts and oh good I can get all my fruit there, my vegetables. They didn't have anything that I wanted so I couldn't even get onions. I have to go out tomorrow and get some berries so I probably and some onions and they didn't have peppers either. So I go to the market about four times a week or do some kind of grocery shopping and I don't like to, to be honest with you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: My suggestion would be to try to use parts of this homework assignment then to kind of figure out how to shop for your menus. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Okay. How do you keep fruits and vegetables fresh for a week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can buy, let's take fruit. The berries you know strawberries, blueberries, bananas would be the first part of the week. The apples, the oranges, the grapefruits would be the end part of the week cause those keep pretty good. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I can't eat apples or grapes unfortunately but you know I like oranges.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I've got a growers produce right down the street from me. I can walk to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very nice. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I mean and I go in there maybe twice a week. I mean they have the finest produce in southern California. Good prices too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very nice. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: So I go in there. You know especially I see 99 cents for blackberries in the middle of winter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, very nice.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Well the Japanese in their culture they shop once a day and they only buy the food for the day so they can have the freshest and I have a good friend that's Japanese and she says that's one of the reasons that Americans are so heavy because they go and buy huge amounts of food and then it's pretty much gone by Wednesday or whenever like halfway through the week and they buy all these snack foods and stuff. In most Japanese families, what's in the refrigerator is what you have the day and the kids don't touch it. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Well that's a very European thing too Michelle. And lot of them even today even with the highest standards of homes they still don't have refrigerators, they have iceboxes and that's because things are really only meant to last a couple of days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know I rented a condo in Paris one time and the gal that I rented it from showed me where the grocery store was and the bakery with all the fresh breads, desserts and stuff, you know the cream and cheese and butter stuff, but she said down here on the corner, it was kind of a block away half a block away, they bring in a fresh market two times a week so most of those people in Paris anyway didn't shop once a day they were a little more once or twice a week with the fresh stuff.  Also too, I know that the additives, preservatives, and growth hormones that we put in our foods in this country, aren't allowed in other countries.  I believe these are a player in our health problems. I think that some numbers came out today about, what was it 10 percent increase in Alzheimer's? In the last five years it's gone up, was it 10 percent you guys? </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I heard something in passing that in the next so many years because of the baby boomers aging the increase is going to be pretty horrific.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They say they finding it earlier and earlier in 50 year olds with symptoms and so I think we are just not very accountable in the U.S. where more is better and I'm not talking about eating addiction. There was a programs on T.V. that a client was telling her group about. She saw a nutritionist who said a half cup of pasta is an appropriate serving of pasta and she said she went into restaurants and found that they served six times as much pasta as would be an appropriate serving and she said that was true if you ordered the kid's portions too. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Like three cups of pasta?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, that's what she said.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I heard that they are doing some studies on the connection between flu shots and Alzheimer's</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Between what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Flu shots and what, Alzheimer's? Well I know they've done some research on autism and the preservative they put in vaccinations. As soon as they started putting in this one preservative, I think I read it's gone up about 800 percent.</p>

<p>SARAH: I wanted to ask again about a comment on what Michelle said about you know it was frightening thinking about knowing what your meals are for the week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>SARAH: For me I'm thinking about for me the addiction, so I had that same thought because if you told me that I was going to have three moderate meals a day...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I can't hear you Sarah.</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: I'm hearing her pretty good now.</p>

<p>SARAH: I was just going to say that abstinence sounded like prison to me in the beginning and it's turned out to be freedom for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's why I laughingly said it's either the addiction or just kind of a free spirit. But the most common thing is the addiction.  It does not want the door closed on impulsivity because that is what keeps it active. That's what keeps it alive.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I don't know if that fits for me. It doesn't resonate with me and it didn't when I was thinking it through. What did resonate with me was that the predictability day after day oh my gosh just thinking about it makes me crazy. I like to keep things open-ended and I like, like I'll have four or five projects at the same time open-ended and I've never really finished with one and</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if that is that part of your nature you just want to make sure that the addiction doesn't use it. That's all. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. Exactly. That's why it's real important for me to do it the night before. When I think about my food the night before and I get up and write it down that feels so good and it feels okay to know I'm making spaghetti and meatballs on Thursday and I'm probably going to have it Thursday and Friday. It feels good because I know that I make sure I take that ground turkey out tomorrow so it's thawed and that kind of thing so it's just that preparedness but you know I had to do that for 21 meals yikes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the truth is you kind you kind of do do it for 21 meals.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Don gets the list and he knows what I need for the week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know Tara you were in my residential center years ago and there was a shopping list that was created for the weekly dinners. Everybody shopped for their own breakfast and their own lunch and they brought they shopped usually once a week and brought in food for the week and then the dinners were shopped, it was posted up there. You knew if they rotated through the kitchen chores you knew if you were cooking on Thursday you knew what you were cooking. And it seemed, I have 45 year old women say this is amazing, I have never done this.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Done what? Shop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Shopped on a planned way. Planned meals in a same way. The addiction loves impulsiveness. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Oh yeah. I shop impulsively in the market. I'm not shopping because I'm hungry but because something is on sale or there is a new item. I go oh yeah I think I'll get that and that's not a good idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not usually. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's usually an open door for the addiction energy.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: It's interesting that this came about this week because today I volunteered. We have our own welfare system in our church and one of the things that you do if you need assistance you go this place called the Bishop's Warehouse or Bishop's Storehouse and basically what it is, is a grocery store. They have everything there everything you could possibly want that they have in a regular store they have there and you make a list and somebody assists you and you get everything on the list and that's it and you can do that every two weeks so these moms that came in you know picking up their stuff they were telling me about these amazing recipes that they make to stretch out their foods and I mean they were telling me what they could do with a fricking can of chicken soup and I was so impressed. One woman was saying that if you just add a little bit of this or that and my kids love it and blah blah blah. It was amazing and I thought you know I could surely plan out a few days if these women with four or five children could go a whole week.</p>

<p>JOAN: Hi this is Joan. Hi everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi</p>

<p>JOAN: I have always struggled with this and what I did, I did it a little while in our group a while back Josephine and I found it really helpful because I had you know these very hungry boys and all their friends. It was just of overwhelming and now I feel like I've gotten away from that and planned shopping. You know I'll know what's for dinner the day of so I'm going to really try and just plan every night. It's not the complicated so it's easy for me to just say I'll come up with something. </p>

<p>So I'm going to really try to do that because I think that will really help me. Is that my phone doing that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know whose that is beeping that is.</p>

<p>JOAN: I think it will really help me not feel so impulsive. To really plan out how I'm going to eat. I guess that's how that would make a difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That compulsive energy feels differently than freedom and lightheartedness that kind of free spirit stuff. It feels that vibrating anxious energy that we don't want and don't like and ends up making us not feel proud of our decisions so even though the energys kind of look like cousins, they're really not the same. </p>

<p>JOAN: I mean do you need to know like I just find it hard to know what I'm going to be making for dinner for five or six nights. That's what you want us to do, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In general you can have in the freezer and in the house dinner so that you don't have to go to the store. You can pick one of those dinners. </p>

<p>JOAN: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do think that's possible.</p>

<p>JOAN: So the idea is not to go to the store so much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you know when you get up in the morning like Michelle talking about getting up in the morning, I kind get up in the morning and kind of have a sense of which breakfast, which lunch and which dinner.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right. Okay so you keep chicken and various things in the house for the week? Freezer whatever?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And Chrissie had asked earlier what do you do about the produce and I said just learn how to make certain things earlier in the especially with fruit you have the berries and bananas and stuff earlier in the month earlier in the week and you have the apples, oranges and grapefruits later in the week cause they last a little longer.</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: So Chrissie, I think everybody is here that is going to be here. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Tara is here?</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: Yeah, Tara is here.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: What happened is that I told Tara a little bit but the surgery went fine yesterday. It was just a breast biopsy and this is what I told the doctor. I said when would I know and he said Wednesday or Thursday at the latest and it's very large, it's about two inches. He couldn't even see it on the ultrasound initially because it took up the entire ultrasound.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: So anyway, long story short, I'm not 100 percent but this is what I told the doctor. I said I have a job offer pending and I don't know whether to follow through with what they want me to do, give them some numbers, etc. and it's all predicated on the outcome of the tests and he said can you hold off till Wednesday or Thursday. I said no, I said they must think I'm a convicted felon because I've been evasive about giving them the information and he said well then go ahead and just do it because it looks good, it looks like it's not cancer and again he said a fibrocystic tumor. And I said how do these things happen and he said it's all hormonal. I said my god I'm menopausal, he said it doesn't matter, he said it happens and cause my mom when through early menopause, I'm already menopausal, I didn't know that until about four or five months ago. Which doesn't bother me in the least so I don't really know guys but the chances are good that it is not cancer.  So that's what is going on? I'm not 100 percent sure. When I know for sure I'll e-mail you guys but in the interim I just about an hour ago got offered the job. I have to drive up there again and take a drug test which I have never done in my life is take a drug test, okay. Well, I'm not going to test positive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I tell you my drug test in the last year?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: No, I want to hear about it. I mean you know what I got to take antidepressants. What if those show up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does show up is poppy seeds and I knew poppy seeds did. I forgot about it. I was doing some consulting at a treatment center. Everybody at the treatment center had to have the drug test and anyway I forgot. I had eaten poppy seeds the day before. So it was within the 24 hours and I tested positive. Thank god I knew the director there. I said oh my god it's the poppy seeds so we just drug tested me again but, yeah, poppy seeds show up as opiates.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Oh, okay. At 24 hours?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, ask them when you go up there and they may or may not know but ask them.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay and you just pee right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay, will antidepressants show up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They probably will but it won't show up as a drug they are worried about. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay, okay, all righty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the job offer that you have got is it something that you are excited about?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I'm both excited and scared to death. I'm full of trepidation because going to be probably initially 60 hours a week for the first two months and I thought to myself who am I kidding I can barely work part time. I talked to a friend and I told him that and he said yeah any job that you do for the first couple of months it's very hard to get used to especially in sales and then I also thought about it I'm in so much fear about finances why don't I just transfer it to fear of working. You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: It's almost like I'm so uncomfortable.. Well you're going to feel miserable either way why don't you at least do it abstinently.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Well you know when I had the lump in my breast years ago I said you know what if I only have another year and half to live I'm not willing to live it in fear. That's not the way I want to live, whatever time I've got left, I don't want it to look like that and that helped me so so much to kind of like you said you know if you're going to do it anyway, why do it in fear. So if you have the fear pop up just say you know what this isn't the way I want to live. </p>

<p>SARAH: I have a really good friend that passed away from skin cancer and when she went in to have it checked the first time it was stage four, it was already stage four and she was feeling great, you know. She lived for about just under a year and her only prayer that whatever happened she didn't want to be afraid. She wanted whatever time she had to be joyful and boy talk about an example of how you know how to transition to the other side, it was amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know that you guys all know that I've had trouble with rental properties this year. Just kind of really being a hole I throw money into and it's really been stressful for me. It's not anything I'm experienced at, and in another state, and I use the same tool that I did with the lump in my breast... I said wait a minute if I go bankrupt do I want to live in fear. No. So even if the worst happens, I don't want to live in fear, I am just not willing to live with that much anxiety, I'm going to live in trust and faith so every time I catch myself kind of going that direction, I tell myself those spiritual truths and it does transition us over to the other feeling. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: What is the spiritual truth for this particular instance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all in God's hands anyway. God already knows the outcome. Whatever outcome it is, is going to be okay. Whatever it is, it's going to be okay. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: That's spiritually so beautiful Josephine and it's so evolved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I don't really know if it's all that evolved frankly. I think it's just a good way to make a decision about living.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: No I agree it's just hard sometimes. I think you're very evolved in how you do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well thank you. Like I said, it's the same thing with the lump in my breast. It didn't feel real evolved, it just felt like the only sane option, and this too, I really have to work at it to but the more I work at it the more I use that muscle, that faith muscle, the easier it gets to move into that arena. I have been dealing with all that for these months and I kind of promised myself that as each of the grandkids turns 12, I'm going to take them on a trip and my son's daughter is turning 12 in June and I decided I had enough frequent flier miles. She wants to go to New York. We have enough frequent flier miles to get us there and I figure even if I have to take money out of my retirement account, I'm happy about that. I mean I don't like it when I don't have enough discretionary income to add to life and to give to others so as soon as I made that decision, well if it has to come out of the retirement, you know $1,500 out of the retirement account, we'll have a good time there you know. I just felt better again. When we live from that fear it just shuts our living down. We end up, I think Chrissie you used that phrase, we live a small life. You know it's been fun trying to plan the trip and I asked her what she wanted to do and she wanted to see the Empire State Bldg, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. I thought she was going to wanted to see 100 plays but she wanted to do all the historical stuff so I'm like totally jazzed so instead of worrying about, you know I've got an empty rental, $2,000 I've got to give the property manager to fix it up plus if it's not rented by April 1st it would be the third month I'm making the mortgages so it's like oh well I'm having fun planning the trip to New York in June. You know God already knows the answer all I can do is suit up and show up and act responsible.</p>

<p>SARAH: That's totally great. What a nice gift to your grandchildren too.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: What a great memory for them to have. It's something for them to look forward to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I've known some families that the grandparents take them anywhere in the world they want to go. That's not my budget but someplace in the U.S can work. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: That's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Tara you're kind of quiet. How are you doing?</p>

<p>TARA: Oh I was just I was going to try and leave work a little early. I always get kind of rushed coming on to the phone group cause I stay too late at work and so I you know eat dinner real quickly but anyways I for the most part I think I'm doing okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think didn't you tell us you've been working really pretty consistently with your sponsor on all the spiritual stuff that you want to get more you know solid.</p>

<p>TARA: Yeah. Not too much, I mean I had a conversation with her because I was thinking I needed to find someone else to kind of be like a spiritual sponsor but what I have been doing is just talking about it at meetings and then I led a meeting last week and it was kind of like trusting God and stuff like that so that's been helpful to kind of hear.   Although the past couple of weeks I have been really focused on working so I haven't hit as many meetings like last week I think I only hit one and this week will probably only be one so but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know the kids out here just had parent teacher conferences. Is that why you've been more focused on work, it's kind of a demand or?</p>

<p>TARA: No. I the timecards here end on the 15th of every month and was going on vacation and I'm just feeling like I want to try and get as many parents in as I can to finish up all the things I need to finish up but also I get money for staying. It's still not balance, I think I need to kind of let go but there's a part of me that's like okay just work really hard this year cause next year's not going to be like this, but it's kind of feeds a little bit of that dynamic of being like overly busy because you know I get home and it's late and I eat dinner.
 
THERAPIST: What was the part about it's not going to be that way next year?</p>

<p>TARA: Oh, because these are funds that are they are probably going to hire someone next year to do all this while as right now they are paying us after school if we want and my partner didn't want to do any of it so he said you could do it all and I said that's fine and I've been working all these hours to take advantage of it. Bit I feel I should go back to trusting God and just knowing that okay... you know just cause this is the only year this is the year this is very rare, doesn't mean you have to you know spend 30 hours.  I mean I've been doing 30 hours a month extra and it doesn't mean I have to continue.   I know it's not good to schedule myself until seven at night which I've done this week. </p>

<p> Also, I'm been working out with a lady at work whose kind of like a personal trainer but we've kind of been working out together so that's been feeling really good doing that and she gave me like a menu planner. I wrote down some of the stuff that I've been eating I think last week and I had a lot of desserts last week, I think it was last week. I was like wow I've had a lot of desserts as I wrote it down and then I sort of noted at the end of the week or when I was ready to give her this, all the times I had dessert, dessert here, dessert here, you know and so anyways I know I'm kind of probably sometimes a little high moderate on desserts. It was a real eye opener. I was like wow. I don't think there was anything exceptional about that week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean what was unusual was you saw how often you ate desserts.</p>

<p>TARA: Right. So she gave me a suggested menu plan and there's a part of me that's like oh this is kind of diseasey, probably because it looks diety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it looked diety?</p>

<p>TARA: Well, just it was like you know she suggested you know picking one green, picking one grain, picking one protein that kind of thing like for lunch or dinner. She like had some suggestions. She said see how it works for you and but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me again what was the diety part cause that just sounds like what a mom would tell you do.</p>

<p>TARA: I know, I know. All of a sudden I was like oh that doesn't look like a lot, so I just told her that but basically she's saying higher protein which I know my body works better on but she was saying maybe move forward from white rice to like a brown rice or a wild rice but I don't know it just seems kind of it looks diety to me. I know it's not, I know .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it's not really a diet but just some dietary changes for the better then I want you to see if whether or not your reaction to it is really the disease's reaction to it or just like earlier when Michelle said she had a particular reaction.  I want to encourage you to look to see if it's the addiction.. Because when we make dietary changes that is when the addiction tries to get in there and you know make it about don't do this and  don't do that it's a diet and so want be as careful as we can that we don't feed the dieting mentality and we don't get on a diet but we do want be aware, responsible to how we are nourishing our body at some level and I know that you know I don't encourage people to do that in their first year but I think you know are you coming up to 13 years or 12? In July it will be.</p>

<p>TARA: Oh, I think it's 12. It was </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, '95 right.</p>

<p>TARA: It was yeah, no, it was, yes, it was '95.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So it will be coming up to 12 so I especially encourage you if you are considering having kids. This is possibly an opportunity to take a look and say what's diety and what's not, what's being the best mom I can to my body and so as you notice what comes up, try to notice where it's coming from.</p>

<p>TARA: Yeah, she has like three different categories and she's not presenting it any way other than see if you like this, check it out, let me know if it's working.  But all of a sudden I'm like oh my god this feels like a diet.  I go wait a second she's just saying you know take from these areas and you know so if you think four ounces isn't enough, then you can do your six ounces or whatever, you can do the amount you've been doing, like I know what a good amount of protein is for me and you know don't trip. You know the lady is suggesting some different things, not a diet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you did what I'm talking about then and kind noticed your reaction and then kind of pulled yourself into realty.</p>

<p>TARA: Yeah and you know when she did say something about calories and I thought oh no, then she said try and keep your calories around this and that and I thought okay and then she talked about dressing but I know what stuff to kind of weed out, you know I don't use an inordinate amount of salad dressing on my salad.  But I definitely had a reaction once and it was interesting because I was sort of asking for her feedback. I wanted her feedback and then once I got it I just you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it does sound like you're okay with it though. You sound like you recognized what was coming from the addiction and what was just some good guidelines you know it sounds like you learned a lot by seeing how often you have desserts in there. </p>

<p>TARA: Yeah, that was helpful. I mean really kind of writing it down, like transferring it from my planner where I write it down onto one page where everything was listed and I go wow you know I had a lot of desserts so and I'm just going through the body image stuff because my weight is okay. I'd be happy if it shifted down another five pounds but I'm really unhappy with how things are fitting and so that's a little bothersome however, I feel better though the past two weeks just working out and I'm even kind of doing stuff on my own like on a Saturday or Sunday I take a little walk or something in addition to what I'm doing with her which feels good and it's moderate. I'm not doing it immoderately but what I told her is I want her to help me do something you know I want her to help with the motivation part you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well just keep bringing God in because I know that is the one thing you have been talking about lately ... knowing that you need that including God in everything so.</p>

<p>TARA: Definitely, yes, definitely.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Can I ask you a question about what you said Josephine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: You were saying to Tara that you want to be careful to know whether it's a diet mentality or a disease. Like what's the difference?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the disease is the other side of the coin just as you know under eating is part of the disease but really it's the overeating is the part of the disease that is the more core part.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah, so if you, it's like with this trainer so Tara she gave you some ideas about eating and you worried that it was a dieting mentality kicking in but Josephine said be sure it's not the addiction so is the addiction coming from the more overeating part? I was asking Josephine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the addiction will want to tell you that's a diet so be careful because it will want to protect its ground so it is hard one for us to find out. What am I here to learn? How to care for my body. This woman is making suggestions on how I might better nourish my body and just keep pulling it back into that. You will hear the addiction chatter that will say that's a diet don't do that... that's a diet or it will say yeah, that's a diet knowing that it will bounce you back into high moderate from being low moderate to high moderate and so it is just continuing to keep ourselves in what's your truth, the truth is Tara is doing this because she wants to be accountable for keeping her fitness level up, she wants to be accountable for possibly nourishing her body better is what I'm hearing and so she has asked this gal questions then she wrote down meals and she was surprised at how often she had desserts and she was surprised at how the addiction energy was trying to respond to that so that she won't make any changes.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I see, well that's really helpful. Could I get that going too?   As you know it's really nice to think that it may not be the dieting mentality, that it may just be the addiction energy that's pushing at me to have more volume, have more volume.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Correct. And so the question again is what I am doing, what are my motives and what's the spiritual principal I am bringing to it. So if it's just about trying to nourish our body, you know how sometimes I'll say just start by putting fruit at least one meal if not two, start by putting a vegetable at least one meal if not two and that's a little bit of what this gal is saying you know take a look at serving sizes you know.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's true about going to the gym too. You know it can kick in lots of anxious emotions and we just have to say why I am I here. You know I'm not here to do body sculpturing, I'm not here to lose weight, I'm here because I'm trying to be the best mom to my body and keep it fit. So, anytime we walk into those arenas that are weight controlled arenas, we can have trouble but it doesn't mean we can't go into those arenas it just means we want to go in as conscious and as honest and committed to no secrets ... so we can make the changes we really want to make. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I actually stopped going to Curves because I just didn't like how they were talking there. There was so much about either dieting or which restaurants had what desserts. It just felt like the whole emphasis was not what I wanted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When I moved to Palm Springs I got a membership at Curves and I found the same thing and so I cancelled my membership and went to Gold's.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: That's exactly what I did Josephine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so much better. There's no talk of dieting there. People are really there just to be fit and work out and a large percentage of seniors are at mine but then I'm in a more senior area.  I remember hearing a guy talk one time and he said that he found the "Y" was the best because it was more seniors than the exercise purging crowd you know. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah. Well my goals I just kind of do what I what. I do elliptical, I do a few weights and then I do Pilates with a private instructor when I can once or twice a week and that's really wonderful cause there's no talking about food whatsoever. I'm just trying to get stronger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There you go.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: And she's helping me I have trouble with my legs, so she's helping me get stronger in my legs and that elliptical has helped a lot with that too. So I just don't want to be around people who are talking about dieting, it gets the disease going. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if I heard Tara right you said you did want her input. Right?</p>

<p>TARA: Yeah, I did ask for her input and then I got to feeling like somebody's telling me what to eat but she's not, she just making suggestions and I can take what I like and leave the rest.   I did remember when I kind of did that Curve thing? You know there was information that I didn't need to have or follow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did good with that one too. Yeah. </p>

<p>TARA: I did and that was the higher protein style of eating as well and so you know so I just have to like you said even if you have good motives, you just have to be careful because like I am feeling better and yet you know my weight isn't where it was when I had my wedding. Some of clothes aren't fitting right but so you're you can kind of get in there but making sure you're in there for the right reasons and not letting that other stuff kind of distract you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I told you my weight kind of stayed in the same range for about 20 years before I went into menopause.  In recovery from 30 years old to 50 and I weighed in a 6 pound range during those years.  Once though, I remember it went to the high end of my range and stayed there. It didn't move around in my range.  It just stayed there maybe a month, two months, I thought that was kind of odd and so I did kind of what you did, I wrote everything down and what I noticed is that I was eating in restaurants a lot and I was eating richer things.  At that I just in the first few months of dating the man that I ended up marrying and you know I wasn't bringing him home to be around the house, we were spending time by grabbing dates in restaurants.  Once I realized that I thought well if I'm going to keep eating in restaurants I need to probably pick a little differently you know. Because every now and then a cream sauce is not a big deal but you're eating out five six times a week then it is going to make a difference. </p>

<p>TARA: Yeah and I'm kind of trying to look at that too.  Like I wanted to go out to lunch today because the other counselors were and I thought you know what, I'm going out on Saturday, I'll probably go on Sunday, you know so part of even planning when you know you're going out and it curbed me a little bit on making different choices too during the week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my point is I was doing kind of what you're doing is trying to get conscious, trying to take a look without it feeding the dieting mentality. So if you're saying you're clothes are a little tight I don't know if I would have said my clothes are tight but I know that I was at the high end of my range which probably meant my clothes would fit tight but I was looking to see what was different, Why wasn't my weight moving around in a range. That was something that I noticed.</p>

<p>TARA: What was frustrating to me is my weight will shift but I don't feel like my inches will shift like my weight will but I have to let go of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, my range was six pounds and if you asked me what I weighed I said the number in the middle so that if it went up three pounds or down three pounds, but I didn't say the number at the bottom so that I would go up five pounds. Do you understand? I said the number in the middle so that was to me much a much more realistic and a much more sane way to approach it. So if five pounds up is really just part of your range but your not coming back down, then you're doing the same thing I was doing you know but you probably move around in a five pound range if I had to guess and if you're saying it's not moving around, it's hanging out, yeah I understand. Well Sarah, when do the papers get filed?</p>

<p>SARAH: I think they got filed on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then is she going to contact him or is she going to have you contact him or is he going to be served?</p>

<p>SARAH: She's going to send him a letter but I'm going to probably contact him before he gets the letter. She says it takes a few days to get processed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's going to keep you posted?</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, she'll keep me posted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm glad you like her that's like so important</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Good for you Sarah. That's a lot, so much growth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I want to ask Chrissie, you're going up to take your drug test and I guess sign the papers so that you're an employee and when do you start?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: .Two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are you going to be traveling around when you work for them?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I'll tell you, initially I'm going to be training in L.A. every day for two weeks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a friend up there that you might stay with?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Well, yes and you what I know something, this is such a God thing, I called I just told a friend of mine and he says oh I know this lady Helen on the program, she's sober about as much time as you are, she has an extra home on the water in Manhattan Beach, maybe she'll let you use it. Do you know who she is? I said no, I have no idea. I was going to pay her to stay up there for my sanity, like 20 minutes from the office. She calls me the other night, she says you're welcome to use my home anytime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sweet.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: If that isn't a God thing, I cannot tell you. It was the night before my biopsy and I felt I could feel God's protection. I don't know this woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but just a little hint, it's all planned out, don't worry about a thing sweetie.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, of course I'm nervous. I'm not used to working that way and I'll have to figure out, and I'll let you guys know and I'll let you know Josephine how I'm going to be able to take care of myself during those two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Because it's not going to be easy for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I believe you can do it I just I really really have a lot of faith in your willingness and in your recovery so anything we can do to help you I'm there.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I just want to say it'll be the first time in outside sales that I've been continually abstinent so that's make a difference too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it will.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I'll be available for work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Would you be willing to shoot us an email when you get your biopsy results?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Absolutely. You guys will be the first to know I guarantee it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I could know as early as tomorrow afternoon but as late as Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Well, I'm sending you a big hug and I'm looking forward to getting that email.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right guys. Lots of love</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay guys. All right. Thanks a lot. Bye</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye.</p>

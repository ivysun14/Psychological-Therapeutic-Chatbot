<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I'd like to explain to you a little bit about the Pillars of Life. And then I'd like for us to go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. This is a technique that was developed by a fellow named Carlos Raimundo He's a psychiatrist. And he argues that all of us have positive experiences in our lives that sustain us and that resist collapse. And these are the things in our lives are built upon. And we don't kill ourselves because we have positive things that we can fall back on. And sometimes as we start working on more difficult aspects of things that are inside of us or traumatic experiences or difficult moments we've lived through, having something that we can remember and fill our minds with positive things can be very useful. And so we'd like to do today is install some of this positive experiences that you've had, so that you can fall back on them if you're in a tense moment or anxious or you know, all of sudden something may come up, and that way you can learn to calm yourself and soothe yourself, and remember that which is good, that which is honorable, those things that are true, those are the things that should we fill our, our minds with. You know that so often we work in psychotherapy about the things that don't work and things that go wrong in our lives, things that are negative and we try to get things straightened out. But today I want us to do something very different. I would like for us to do something that concentrates on what has gone right in your life. All the things that you have that are worth celebrating instead of emphasizing what we lack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we're gonna be working on what works for you, what has happened to you in the past that is good. That's positive, that's ah, can fill your mind with ah, with good things, things of beauty, of celebration and joy. So this is kinda what we're gonna be doing today. This is what I want to walk you through this short protocol so that we can concentrate on that. Does that sound okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR. All right. I'd like for you to get comfortable. And close your eyes a moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.(breathes)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take a couple of deep breathes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (deep breathing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd like for you to kinda of just float back in your mind and think about some of the really good things that happened to you as a child. Things that you cherish, precious moments. Then I want you to try to pull up the earliest one that you can remember. The very first one that you remember, something really positive, something really worth celebrating, that sustains you, something that you can really lean on. I want you think about how old you are in this, in this experience. And kinda look around and see who's with you and what the picture looks like, what context are you in, until you have it almost like a photograph. When you think about this experience, what do you think about yourself that's positive? And once you have that clear, you can reflect on that. And as you reflect on that, what are the positive emotions that come up for you? And where do you feel it in your body? And if this experience were to give you a message, you know, like good advice or a really significant phrase that has stuck with you all these years� what's the message that this experience gives to you? And when you have it really clear, I want you to take a deep breathe and open your eyes. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Got it? Well, I'd like for you to draw for me, on this piece of paper we have - this is what I've put for you. This is when you were born, okay? this is our little timeline. I've gone ahead and drawn it for you. This is where you are today, this is your age today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so this is kinda like your life path. And I want you to think about - how old were you in the experience you pulled up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say about 6 or 7.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And here's a pen and I want you to place yourself on that timeline and I want you to draw a little scribble or a graph or whatever it is, that would represent this photograph of this positive experience. Okay, got it. You wanna tell me about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, this is  my parents' bedroom. And when we were kids, my parents' bedroom and then I, then me and my sisters, I have two sisters; our parents were all kind of together. And on the weekends uhm, in the morning, most of the time, you know we'd wake up to - I don't know the sound of my mom laughing and my dad would sing goofy songs, just to kinda wake us up and to let us know to come in to the room and play. He'd sing like, "Here I come to save the day." Silly things like that and so he'd wake us up and my mom would be laughing. And me and my two sisters,  I'm the middle daughter. I'd always (inaudible)[00:07:09] my sisters. We'd go into the room and it was like Saturday morning and we wouldn't have anything to do. And my dad we would just play and kind of laugh. My dad would like end up getting a "roll-up thing" of socks and like throwing it at us and we end up throwing socks at each other. And my mom and my dad and me and my sisters, and we would just joke around and laugh and you, and throw this, this ball of socks at each other. And we would be up on the bed or running to get the socks. It was just really fun. And, you know, and then my parents like grab us and tickle us, you know, so it's kinda like we're playing and with socks and stuff, but it was really just fun I used to miss(ph) this. Everybody was happy and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In this group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of these expressions that you've mention you say, now I belong or I'm playful or I'm capable of loving or being loved. Which one do you think is the most positive or is it most resonates with your experience?</p>

Uhm, it was this keeshond dog, tiny, little, but really furry and ah, playful, and I just remember being so excited and ah, you know, the dog running around, jumping at everybody and, and, and ah, you know, people trying to calm it and just you know, the excitement and kind of mania of this dog running around...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it was just fun. My sisters and I chasing it around and playing with it. And, and my grandma uhm, having lots of fun but just being like, "Oh my goodness! This is way too much." But she was, like, laughing and you know, I could, I could tell that�you could tell my grandfather really very happy to us playing with the puppy and everything, you know. And you know it was just a really good feeling, I guess, just being with my sisters and my grandparents being there. And just like, I just like loved this puppy and we named it Pepper. And it was my childhood dog for years after that...(crosstalk)</p>

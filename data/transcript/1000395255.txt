<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) I think very much in the back of my mind right now, is uhm, well, yesterday and, a lot of things that were on my mind after I left yesterday, or, or during and after.  And wh_ when I, when I  got home yesterday, I was feeling I had to come today, because there was, there were just so many things I felt I was hanging in the middle of.  And when I had tried 1 or 2 people and I wasn't able to get them, and then when MYJ called this morning to say he had been able to get somebody, I felt first relieved, because I had this feeling — and then I was, before I came here I was thinking well now I can go back to all those things I was feeling, as if w—, I were hanging in the middle of.  And uhm, then it just seemed like, well maybe they all weren't so important, or something. </p>

<p>And so then what I think of instead when I get here, is uhm, well a sort of visualizing, again, the girl that MYJ found.  And I had, I had said to him, I think I would feel this way anyway, but ma—, but especially with FSO being ill, that I didn't want him to, just him to get anybody.  I'd rather he got somebody that was uh, somebody he would think would be trustworthy and all.  Or else, uh, just to forget it. </p>

<p>And so when she came, I'm, I, I don't know whether I — I was in a hurry because she came a little bit late.  But I probably sounded sort of nervous about leaving FSO anyway, because I think I do feel that way.  And uhm, she said something about, oh, I guess I understand why you feel this way, if it's your first.  But it made me — I think I've wondered this before, but I was just thinking about, should I feel this way about leaving her, as if, I think I feel as if there might be some catastrophe that could happen to her.  And since it is my first baby, and I had very little to do with babies when I was growing up, I don't really know what I'm doing, either.  And yet I attach this great importance on people knowing when they come.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, this just comes to my mind.  It seems sort of, I don't know, minor, compared to things like how I feel about FSO, or what I hadn't been admitting.  And but uh, well while I was waiting for the girl to come, I was thinking, how long will I wait before I call?  Because after a certain point I w—, I just would have been so late, it wouldn't have been sensible to try to come.  And uhm, so then when she did get there, and I left, I guess I, maybe because I'd been thinking that, or, I don't know.  Maybe I would have anyway.  I was wondering how late I'd be.  And then thinking I could have called to say I'd be late, but I was coming.  And then I wondered why I'd even think of doing that.  And thinking well, I'll be coming at some point within my time, and it, it just seemed to me, what I wanted was to know that you'd be keeping this particular time open for me, even if I weren't here.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I began to think about what I, I think, I really want to think at least.  I don't know, I really want to and yet I apparently don't in a way, because I don't get at it.  But uhm, my feelings about FSO.  And, th_ the thing I was, I, I, I don't know, it sort of, it was a strong impression when I was thinking about this last night, or r—, m—, memory, or maybe I'm continuing to do it.  Although I don't think I'm doing it as much as I did when she was first born. </p>

<p>But (Sniff) of looking at her, and especially at times when I was breast-feeding her and (Clears throat), somehow, I mean I'd be seeing her, but in a way I wouldn't be.  It was a very odd sensation.  I don't know how to explain it, except, I mean, sometimes I guess I'd be thinking, or people would ask how things were.  And sometimes I'd say, well she doesn't seem real to me yet, and that would be one way to describe it.  But.  It was almost as if I'd be looking at her, but I'd refuse to really see her, or something. (Pause)</p>

<p>And one thing I was remembering too, when I got home last night, uhm, or some point anyway, after I left, it occurred to me that, maybe I even mentioned it before, a number of pe—, well, my sister-in-law said that she hoped we'd have a girl, because so many — well FYC's had 2 boys and then 1 girl.  And FNA just had a boy.  And, so she was thinking it would be nice to have a girl for a change, in the family.  Uhm, then, a relative of MSCZ's informed me that MSCZ's mother wanted a girl, because she has 2 grandsons.  And so she hoped we'd have a girl. </p>

<p>And both of those occasions, especially when I was told that MSCZ's mother wanted a girl, wanted us to have a girl, I felt very angry.  I think when FHF said that — this is my sister-in-law — I felt sort of well, that's too bad that you want that, because it won't happen.  But when MSCZ's mother said it, or when the person said it to me, because MSCZ's mother did later, but I heard it first through somebody else, I felt extremely angry that well, I don't want a girl, I want a boy.  And she's not considering what I want.  And then I, all along I think, felt very strongly that I'd be having a boy.  I mean, I kept telling myself, well it might be a girl.  But that was just sort of verbalizing, I don't think I ever really felt that that was so. </p>

<p>And I, I don't know, uhm, I was wondering how much, well in a way, it seems like I would have wanted a boy no matter what FYC and FNA had had first.  But the fact that they both had boys first, I wondered how much that's affected how I feel about it, too.  Because I think my feeling that I keep trying to pretend I don't really believe it, is that I'm inferior because I didn't produce a boy first.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why do you imagine you feel that uh, you know, you are afraid that some catastrophe would happen to FSO when you're not there?  How do you explain that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sigh) Well first I was thinking well, it would be, a catastrophe could only happen if a person weren't paying attention to her.  Because that's the only thing I do that maybe somebody else wouldn't do.  Because I certainly don't know much about babies.  Uh, but then, I don't know, it just seemed like most people who would take a job like this who are young, who would come alone, would pay some, I mean uh, certainly enough attention.  They might not hang over the crib looking at her, but uh, I don't know, so then it just seemed something to do with the fact that I'm leaving her.  And I suppose it's connected w_ with feelings that I'm not, still not fully admitting about uhm, feeling antagonistic to her.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Unclear) Uhm.  Z____ think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) It's funny, because I can think about being disappointed that she was a girl, and not a boy, sort of at the moment when I found out.  And think about how I did really want a boy.  And uhm, but then when I get to thinking I'm still feeling antagonistic, I find that, I find that very hard to admit.  And I keep thinking that, well I mean, several things, I think first that she's done nothing.  And so then I feel guilty that I'm feeling that way.  And I suppose I feel guilty too, because of what it might lead me to do if I don't watch myself.  And then sometimes it just seems like it's 2 separate things, and that, I don't know, sometimes I just feel as if I'm seeing her for what she is, and I'm very happy because she's what she is.  But that is unrelated to this other feeling of, well, having wanted a boy.  And I don't know, it's a very strange thing.  (Sigh)</p>

<p>But I also had this feeling of something would happen, uh, over something else that I have it anyway, about myself.  But now it's, it increased terrifically.  MSCZ was talking a little bit about different possibilities for a vacation, and because that is p—, one of the things he loves always to talk about.  And he was wondering if we might not want to go down to PWN some time in the spring, late spring, after my parents came back, for a short time.  And then he's talked a lot about wanting this summer, to go to PBRD.  And maybe rent a house for awhile over there.  And both those things, well the summer one, I just thought well, I won't think about it right now.  It's too far, it's so far away I don't have to.  But the going to PWN is closer. </p>

<p>And I was just thinking, I really don't want to go.  And the main reason why I didn't want to go, was because we'd have to take a plane.  And I was — all I could think of was something would happen and either the plane would crash, and we'd all be killed, or at least I wouldn't be able to take care of FSO.  Or else, the plane would have to do a crash landing in the water, w_ which is something that happened last year to a plane going down in that area.  And we had w_ well, I don't r_ remember these people, but my parents knew some people on the plane, so they heard about it.  And it was in the papers, too.  And, a_ and, there was a lot of description of how people got out and everything, and I was th—, and then they were in the water for a long time. </p>

<p>And I kept thinking then that I wouldn't be able to take care of her, I wouldn't be able to keep myself and FSO above water if we had to stay in the water for a long time.  And, and I just couldn't think of anything else, except if we took a plane there would be something horrible that would happen. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So who would go down?  Who would stay above water, in your fantasy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she'd go first.  (Pause) Because in that fantasy, I couldn't even conceive how uhm, I could even ever keep her head above water.  (Pause) Well, it makes me think of something else, too, that uh, she was a very easy baby in the hospital and, and there were just no problems at all.  Except one thing that was a problem to me, but I don't know that it was really a problem, she apparently had more mucus than some babies do, and certainly than any of the other babies in the room.  Uh, so she had, well first of all she had trouble, and they had to suck out more the second day, or the day after she was born. </p>

<p>And then, uhm, I, I don't know, a short while after that, maybe that same day, she was lying there, because we had them in our rooms during the day.  And suddenly she just began choking and not making a sound, but opening her mouth and getting very red, and look—, looking like she couldn't breathe and couldn't do anything.  And it really frightened me, and then I picked her up, and I don't know whether she would have cleared herself up anyway, at that point.  Or whether my changing her position made a difference, but she got better.  And then, a short while after that she was back lying down, and she did it again.  And it really scared me.  So then I held her until a nurse came in.  Because she was alright again, a—, when I'd pick her up. </p>

<p>And the thing that concer—, the nurse just, I don't know, was almost like she couldn't understand what I was talking about, because she couldn't understand my feelings in connection with what I was describing had happened, because to her, something like that happening wasn't anything.  So she was thinking perhaps, that it was worse than that, and I wasn't describing it well.</p>

<p>But the thing that I wanted to be reassured of, and it obsessed me almost, because I asked my, the pediatrician when he came by, and I asked just about every nurse, was uh, if she does that, can she take care of herself?  And it was almost like, no matter what I do to her, can she take care of herself and live?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What answer did you get?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From the nurses?  Uhm, well they'd all kind of acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   How do you understand that?  I mean, how do you explain the discrepancy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well right now, I'm thinking that I was making much more of it than was true, and so the nurses thought they'd maybe had never seen whatever I was talking about.  When I asked the pediatrician, he just said, "Oh, don't worry about it." </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so in effect, what you've described so far then, are 3 different kinds of situations and each of which you really strongly imagine, even as you say, were obsessed with the idea that some disaster would befall FSO.  She would drown if she were with you, you would have to drown her, or let her down.  You wouldn't be able to save her.  That she would choke to death if you didn't do something.  If you leave her with a baby-sitter, something catastrophic will happen.  And yet you say you don't feel antagonistic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Mm, that just makes me think again of (Sniff) the feeling I find very hard to describe of, that was certainly stronger in the few weeks a—, right after I came out of the hospital, than it is now.  But of when I was nursing her and looking at her, and almost looking at her, looking at her, thinking, I've got to be able to see her, and feeling I just couldn't.  And I suppose that was partly because I thought by looking at her, I'd feel a warm feeling toward her, and I just really couldn't. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, you know, I c—, you've, you mentioned this before now, this, this feeling of this seeing and not being able to really see her.  But it occurs to me that you might state it a little differently.  That really you keep looking for something that you're not finding.  It isn't there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   An exterior sign, as you said yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how th—, I think of this.  I'm not sure how it fits in, exactly.  Uhm, because when you say that, I'm thinking well, one exterior sign if I really wanted her to be a boy, would be to see her as a boy.  And yet, uhm, one thing that, well I'm not sure exactly what I was doing, except I'm aware I was always looking for a resemblance, either to MSCZ or to me.  And when she was first born, she looked to me very much like baby pictures I'd seen of well, MSCZ and his sister, not so much his brother.  And I was disappointed that she looked that way, at first.  And then, I don't know whether it was because people kept telling me how pretty she was, or else whether I just got used to it, or what, but I began to think she really was kind of pretty. </p>

<p>And then, uh, when we got home, she began to change as all babies do.  And so then I began looking for a resemblance again. And sh—, in a way, she doesn't look like either of us, now.  But in a way I keep thinking, not so much that I see a resemblance to MSCZ, but that I see a resemblance either to me, f—, when, just f—, certain things.  Or, to uh, FYC's first child, who was a boy.  (Pause, Sigh) And her — she's very strong, and things like that, and I'm pleased about that, because I suppose that again — well I think of MDI, who was very strong.  And he's the one that sometimes I think she reminds me of, a little bit. </p>

<p>And, but then there are other things about her that is very feminine, and certainly unlike anyone in the family I've ever had contact with.  But I didn't have any contact with FYC's girl.  And I'm pleased about that, and it seems like that's where the separation comes when I, I, i—, I mean then it seems like I'm seeing her for what she is.  And, but I don't know if you really could, if you're feeling antagonistic underneath, all the time.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And I also wonder a little, I haven't really thought about it that much, but I do wonder if just the fact she's female, regardless of what my feelings were before she was born, uh, has to do with the feelings that I have because it's 2 females and MSCZ now.  And I, sort of like I have a competitor.  And I like MSCZ paying attention to her, but I'm, I think I'm, ah, I like him to do it under my tutelage, sort of, or uhm, as long as it's at times when I want him to, then it's fine.  So in a way, I, I mean I'm controlling it.  Because I'm saying, now you can pay attention to her, now you can't, kind of thing.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that whatever, I mean, it seems like there are a number of things that are part of my feeling antagonistic.  And th—,  they all lead me to blame her for being what she is.  And, and to blame her for my feelings, because she's there.  And, and then I get a feeling, and I don't know exactly what it is, except it's running away from all that.  And, and thinking I can't, I can't do that.  I mean, she's just a little baby and how can I go around feeling antagonistic?  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose too, uhm, part of what enters into it, then, is well, a strong feeling on my part that I don't want her to be, well, I don't know, it's kind of hard to say, unhappy, the way I think I was when I was growing up.  I mean, I certainly was at a certain point, but not this, no—, not that I recall, anyway, this early.  And yet, somehow I have this feeling that I can, I don't want to do things the same way my parents did, so that she — I don't want her to feel the same way I have been. </p>

<p>And yet it seems to me that feeling antagonistic toward her was exactly probably what my mother felt.  And that I am doing exactly the same thing and hiding it, and being very efficient, and taking excellent care of her in sort of a material kind of way.  Or uhm, I don't know, in all the routine things.  She's healthy, she'll be fed well, and clothed well, and so forth.  And I'm breast-feeding her the way psychologists say you should, and things like that.  And yet, there's something lacking, there's some feeling that's not there. </p>

<p>And I think I'm feeling too, that if I admit it, then it's — I'm afraid I'll never get it.  And if I don't admit it, maybe I'll get it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So you mean, the safest thing seems to be to keep how you feel carefully hidden.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just from about every standpoint.  (Silence, Sniff) And I never really, I don't know, admitted this to myself, but j—, j— in light of what I've been saying, it occurs to me, uhm, in the room that I was in at the hospital, there were four of us and two had girls and two had boys.  And one of the girls who had a boy, I think she was BFN, I'm not sure.  But anyway, her — she looked a little bit as if that's what she was, and her name sounded it, and her boy looked it.  And she had one of the 2 boys.  And so I didn't, I mean he was cute, but I didn't feel any identification particularly, with it. </p>

<p>But then there was another girl, the other girl who had a boy, uhm, was of the kind of person I'm used to associating with.  I mean she's (Stammers) actually CHN, but aside from that, I suppose I mean just, she's white, and uhm, also I guess, middle, I don't know, middle-class, I guess.  Or anyway, I, I just felt comfortable with her, and that we had similar backgrounds, even though she was CHN.  And her little boy was very cute.  And I think I felt very jealous.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I've spent a lot of time thinking, since FSO was born, that well, what's so great about a boy, I mean, a girl is very nice, too.  Just in, just thinking in terms of little children as they're growing up.  And of course, that's true.  And, and yet there's something, I don't know what th—, what it is that makes having a boy special, but, I mean, it seems unrelated to what they really are.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose then, I wonder if there's anything to do with when I was little and MLWZ was born, and then somehow feeling everything would be made alright if I had a boy of my own.  As if somehow, then I'd be getting the kind of attention I wanted, that went MLWZ's way, or I don't know, it's almost if then I'd be what I want to be, if I had a boy.  And, or at least get what I want, or some—, something like that. </p>

<p>And, and this just makes me remember too, yesterday I found, and I still am having trouble handling the idea, or whatever has been going on in my mind, in connection with my mother's having an operation after MLWZ was born, and my assuming that it was a hysterectomy, and then my having the feeling I did about what the doctor did when he sewed me up, my vagina.  (Sigh) I don't know, I just keep, ah, my thinking k—, just has been, last night and then just now, too, goes back to that, as if I just, I don't know, there's something I don't understand.  I suppose probably I don't understand, because I keep thinking, but my mother had a boy.  So of course, she'd have the operation so she couldn't have any more children.  Because she'd had what anybody would want.  And I had a girl, so why would I think the same thing was being done to me?  (Silence)</p>

<p>Because another thing that uhm, I was thinking of this last night, because I was, I don't know, when we were talking I, uhm, I don't remember what we were talking about.  I think I wanted to think of some new hors d'oeuvre to have when we have some people over this weekend.  And then MSCZ was mentioning something we had this summer, when we were at a friend's house.  And, and then it just, sort of like a warm memory came to me of, that was when I was pregnant, that nice time.  Even though I had such mixed feelings when I was pregnant, and certainly there were lots of times when I wasn't feeling very happy, or that it was so nice.  But now when I think back on it, it was that wonderful time.  And I don't know whether it's entirely because then I was carrying the baby, and I imagine that in itself, as part of it. </p>

<p>And also then I could fantasize that it was going to be a boy, and I can't now.  And there was something, too, about, I don't know, just the fact that I was pregnant, and that the kind of attention that people give you, or that I at least could think people were giving me.  I suppose it's probably because then the baby isn't separate from you, and once the baby's born, that's what people are interested in.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

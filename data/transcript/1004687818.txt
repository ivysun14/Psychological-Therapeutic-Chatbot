<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had a sort of upsetting incident last night. Okay, so my bedroom is right next to another bedroom which used to be the guest bedroom. In between these two bedrooms is a door. Originally the door that was between these two bedrooms had maybe about an inch or so between where the door was and where the floor was.</p>

<p>And since it was becoming a bedroom and stuff, both me and Aaron agreed that we should get like a real door that went down all the way so that I could have privacy and Ryan (ph), who is the new person moving into that room, could have privacy. At the same time I also decided to redo my door because like it used to be like the doorknob was here and there was this hole around the doorknob (inaudible at 01:01.6) not enough privacy.</p>

<p>[01:05.2]</p>

<p>Of course Aaron scheduled the door guy for a day he wasn't around and I was around. Also, when the door guy came he was like "Oh yes, one of these knobs has a lock and the other one doesn't because one is supposed to go to a closet." I was like "Uh, I don't think so." You know, I was expecting like a lock with two locks or something because there should be a lock between my room and Ryan's (ph) room. There should be.</p>

<p>And so I was shocked but I was just like "No, just put it up, whatever. We'll put sliding locks on it later." And I thought he got my instructions. At the very end when he was all packed up and stuff, he was like "Take a look." It turned out he had put in the doorknob for the one that was between my room and the outside room, which did have a — my room and the hall which did, and did not put in the knob between mine and Ryan's (ph) room. And I was like "Wait, you didn't put it in." He was like "Oh, well, you could totally — like if you guys want to get a knob with a lock" and I'm like "No."</p>

<p>[02:09.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it he put up between the two rooms? Anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A door.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With no doorknob?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No doorknob. A door with no doorknob. He was like "Well, you can install it. It's all set. There are four screws it in and it has all the instructions. You will be able to do it." I'm like "Are you sure?" He's like "Yes." I'm like "You don't need to get anything else?" and he said "Yes." So he left.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that — and also he had come, like the window was from one to four or something and he came at five. So he had already missed the window and was running late, and I felt bad making him stay longer and telling him "No, do the door." I didn't feel like I had the power to do that. So I was under the impression that what he said was true.</p>

<p>[02:57.4]</p>

<p>We then tried installing the doorknob a few days later, and it would not install. Like it was not actually cut correctly and it did not fit. And it's not like I could have called the door guy because I didn't have the door guy's contact information, Aaron did. Also the door guy left an extension cord and also probably — I think he still has my parking pass. This was on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, mind you, and it took us a few days to install the doorknob because I was like going to do it myself but Sydney was being depressed. I couldn't do it by myself and I needed his help. When we finally got around to it, we found out we couldn't and Aaron was heading out.</p>

<p>So when I wrote him about it, he was all — Aaron wrote me an e-mail yesterday being like "I'm aggravated about this because I have to spend my time and my money to go out and get new hardware to put in the door that you requested" blah blah blah blah.</p>

<p>[03:57.9]</p>

<p>Well first of all, I don't remember if it was me or Aaron who requested it, but it's his property. I deserve privacy. Ryan (ph) deserves privacy. We both deserve privacy, and it's not my fault that I couldn't install the lock. I believed the guy. The only thing I did wrong was believing. (crying) He said I botched the job. I'm like "I'm sorry, but I had told the guy to go ahead and install the lock."</p>

<p>The guy was given incorrect information. Like he was telling me this was supposed to go to a closet and I'm like "No, it's between two bedrooms." Of course I was going to be surprised. I guess it was my fault that I was surprised about it and didn't just say "Okay, yes, put the lock on this one door and put the one without the lock on this door." Like I had no — you know, like the one for my room leading out was my idea, but the one between mine and Ryan's (ph) was like his idea, and that's the one that got botched.</p>

<p>[05:02.5]</p>

<p>And it shouldn't be my money or my responsibility. It's not just for me. It's for me and Ryan (ph) because theoretically I could just stay at Sydney' place all the time. It was fine up until then because Ryan (ph) hadn't moved in, and the door from Ryan's (ph) room to the outside still closed. There was a hole between the two rooms but no one was living in the other room, so it was okay, and not it's not okay anymore.</p>

<p>And I'm pissed off that Aaron told me I botched it and that it was my fault. He was also like "You have to get your synthesizer out of the room and clean up your yarn in the basement. It's not fair that your hobby takes up so much space and I have no space to store my stuff." My yarn used to — like this isn't my stash. This is my stuff from my Etsy store, so it's not actually my hobby. It's my store, mind you. Which I guess is my hobby, but it's things I'm selling. It's my stock. The reason it's all in a pile in the basement is because it was originally living in the guest bedroom, and then it couldn't.</p>

<p>[06:02.1]</p>

<p>I don't have a place for it in my bedroom. I don't have a yarn desk anymore. I just have a regular desk that is piled with yarn in my room. I have no space for anything. I still have some of Sydney' stuff in my room. I have no place to put these piles of yarn. (inaudible at 06:16.6), but I have no space. I have absolutely no space for anything, and I feel like I'm not welcome in the house anymore. I asked him about the keyboard. I'm like "Well, can I put it in the new guest bedroom?" and he said "No."</p>

<p>You know, I got the keyboard originally — like, I didn't buy it. It's my dad's and he wasn't using it. I got it with the original understanding that the guest bedroom was also the music room, because it was. I wouldn't have gotten it if it just had to be in my bedroom. Now I have no clue where that keyboard is going to go because I have no space in my room for anything. Maybe I'll put it in the TV room and see if Aaron objects. I got it with the understanding that we had a music room. (sniffling) And now we don't have a music room.</p>

<p>[07:01.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did other people do with other musical things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aimee's (sp?) harp was in that room. You mean after the room got — I don't know what happened to Aimee's (sp?) harp. The guitars are currently in the closet that was once my closet. That closet now has (inaudible at 07:21.0) and guitars. But the guitar cases go straight up and down and the keyboard goes horizontally, so I can't — I don't think it will fit in that closet. (pause)</p>

<p>I guess I have to sell the keyboard or something. I mean, it's not like I use it that much, but I can't bring that down to the basement either. I just feel like on attack and everything, and he didn't acknowledge, you know — and I can't ask for an apology. This was all through e-mail. I feel like I can't ask Aaron for an apology even though it wasn't — it's his property. He shouldn't have put me in charge of it in the first place. Just because it's something I requested doesn't mean it's not his responsibility when it's his property.</p>

<p>[08:06.8]</p>

<p>(crying) And it wasn't like it was this unreasonable request for some super duper fantastic random thing in my room that had useful value for me and no one else and wasn't actually strictly necessary. It's necessary. (sniffling) We deserve privacy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he say you didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) No, but he said that I was the one who requested it, therefore, it was my fault. Even though I was requesting it for a good reason, and I think Ryan (ph) probably would request it too if I had just left the door the way it was. And I don't even think it was. I think he was the one who suggested it, like "We need a real door between them." I'm like "Oh, if we're getting that, can I get a door for my room outside too because the doorknob doesn't cover the door." But he was the one who had originally — I think he was the one who suggested that we needed to replace the door between mine and Ryan's (ph) room.</p>

<p>[09:03.9]</p>

<p>Really what we need to do is put a wall there, but that was going to be too expensive and too much construction. But I don't know why there's a door between those two rooms to begin with. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sharing space can be so complicated sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I'm getting to a point — and I just freaked out yesterday, like oh my God, I have to move out of the house. But I have nowhere to go because I have no job, and I'm not going to move to my parents' house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you get to moving out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel not comfortable because I don't have space for my stuff and clearly my hobby is attacking everyone. I can't put my yarn anywhere and I don't have a place in my room to put anything; therefore, I need to move out because Aaron hates me. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He hates you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) He sent me an angry e-mail. (sniffling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not the same as hating someone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He blamed me for something that wasn't my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you hate Aaron?</p>

<p>[10:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you hate Aaron?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you angry with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am, but I didn't send him back an angry e-mail. I sent him back maybe a slightly defensive e-mail, but just a, you know, like "Okay, I'll get my synthesizer out and stuff." It's just a blame-me-for-all-things e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're angry with one another, just like you can be angry at him and feel like he's being —</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like I'm being judged for everything, and it's not like even — like [inaudible] jewelry takes up pretty much just as much space as my yarn. Also in the basement. (pause) I don't have space and there aren't shelves. We were going to build shelves but the shelves never got built. So there's this lumber in the basement but there aren't shelves, and now I'm like okay, fine, I'll go to Target and buy shelving things and put everything in that. (pause) (sniffling) Okay, fine, maybe Aaron doesn't hate me but it feels like he hates me.</p>

<p>[11:05.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really uncomfortable. He's mad. It sounds like he's mad about the time and the expense of doing some upkeep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some upkeep that wasn't my fault. Like it wasn't like I told the guy not to install the knob. I told him to install the knob. (crying) And if Aaron wanted it done right in the first place, he should have done it himself anyway. Like he should have been the one to supervise it, you know? The only thing I did wrong was to believe the guy when he told me I could install the knob myself. That's the only thing I did wrong. (sniffling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not necessarily something you did wrong. You didn't necessarily do anything wrong, but the job wasn't done correctly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but he said "You botched it. You botched it." (crying) I didn't. I didn't. But — (pause) I just want a door. I just want privacy. I just want space.</p>

<p>[12:05.7]</p>

<p>And not having these things anymore, like I don't know what I can do. It's not like other places are $600 a month, and I'm not going to find something that cheap anywhere here. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're going to have privacy, right? The door is going to —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. If it gets fixed. Maybe it won't get fixed. Maybe I won't have privacy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why wouldn't it get fixed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because Aaron is bitter and he has a baby and therefore he can't do it or something. Though he didn't say he can't do it, but — I might eventually have privacy. I guess I have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it will probably take a little longer than —</p>

<p>CILENT: Well, Ryan (ph) moves in on Wednesday, so it needs to happen by the time Ryan (ph) moves in. Otherwise, I guess I have to stay at Sydney' place until I get the doorknob. (pause)</p>

<p>[13:07.1]</p>

<p>I don't have space. I had to move the desk back into my room when originally it was in the baby (inaudible at 13:14.3) and it was in the baby (inaudible at 13:15.7) for the two years I was living in the small room and it was just fine. But Aaron is like "Oh, you need to move it and I need to get chairs and stuff." I'm like, well, I do need a desk and theoretically the room does have space for a desk, but not as big a desk as I have. It fits barely. The desk is just like flat and it has like a little filing cabinet underneath, but mostly just flat horizontal space.</p>

<p>So it's like I've ended up dumping a bunch of stuff on it, and I'm living like I don't have enough space. And I don't know what I'm going to do about my yarn in the basement. It's not even yarn, it's really wool, and I don't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>[14:03.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he just asked you to straighten it out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He asked me to straighten it up, but I don't know how. Like I currently do not have the resources. I have to go out and spend my own money in order to do that because — (pause) He is the one who chose to have a baby. He's the one who chose to make — now that Joshua (ph) has his own room, we won't have a guest bedroom anymore. That was his choice. When I bought that keyboard, I had no clue that he was going to adopt a baby. No one did. The keyboard was well before the baby. (pause) Like he leaves his stuff all over the place all the time, and I don't send angry e-mails to him.</p>

<p>[14:56.7]</p>

<p>It took him weeks — actually no, more than that, like when they did their room switch they left a lot of stuff in the meat kitchen, or the meat dining room, rather. It's still there. It's still there. I haven't sent a single angry e-mail about that. (pause) So I feel like I can't go home now, or I can only stop and get things and I can't actually live there anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't want to get yelled at more. I'm afraid that if I talk to him, I'll get yelled at even more (crying), and that he'll try to tell me that I'm wrong, but I'm not wrong. I just wanted privacy, that's all I wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's starting with the door, but it sounds like there are a lot of things wrapped up in it. It sounds like you're upset with the responsibility he placed on you about the door. You want more space for your yarn. You want a space for your keyboard.</p>

<p>[16:04.1]</p>

<p>It sounds like there are a lot of things you want, more freedom in that house. It sounds like it has gone beyond the door.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. (sniffling) I mean, I'm not the only person who still has things in there. Like the mattress is still in there, and the bookshelves are still in there. We don't know whether or not Ryan (ph) wants the mattress or the bookshelves, so it's not just my stuff. But I'll move the keyboard out, and I guess I'll put it in the TV room and see what happens. I mean, there's already a keyboard in there but it's a fake — it's a Guitar Hero keyboard, so it's not actually a real one but it takes just about as much space as a real keyboard. And also currently the TV room is also overrun with stuff from Aaron and Janet's move.</p>

<p>[17:04.5]</p>

<p>I try. I really try. I just don't have the space. And I haven't been able to put up the wall shelves because there were all these things in the way when we were dealing with Sydney's move. Sydney was going to be the one helping me put up the wall shelves because I don't necessarily have the physical strength to do it or the height.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does Sydney's presence in the house have anything to do with this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. We've been hanging out at his place ever since we got the bed built and stuff. It does in terms of I have no space in my room because his stuff is still there. Not all of his stuff, but still enough of his stuff that I'm like tripping over his printer and not having places to put things. We've assembled the bed, but we haven't assembled his desk yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it might feel a little bit different when he's fully moved in.</p>

<p>[17:57.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, but that still would not be enough space to put my bags of wool from my store. (pause) Like I really don't know how I could do that anywhere other than the basement. I just don't. So, yeah. (pause) I really don't have space for things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry that you're feeling so squeezed out and feeling uncomfortable in your house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like Aaron moves his baby things in really annoying — like he had the stroller at the top of the stairs to the basement, like taking up space so you had to jump over it. The basement is where we have our laundry. Presumably, if you want to get your laundry done, you have to carry baskets of laundry up and down those stairs and jump over that stroller. I don't think he needs to store it there. (pause) I just don't like being yelled at for things that aren't my fault.</p>

<p>[19:11.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody likes to get yelled at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the reason why my room didn't stay a bedroom was because like "Oh, we can't show that room because no one wants to live in it." Well, I lived in it for a good two-and-a-half years. So clearly, that's not true. I wasn't paying any less rent than anyone else and stuff. And like this other room — and Janet (sp?) gets the big room again and she and Aaron got to — you know, I wish I had had that option to be in Aaron's old room. But no, I didn't. So Janet (sp?) moved from a big room to a big room, and I still have a smaller room and no space. Like my closet is a lot smaller than I thought it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does who gets what room get decided?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know. Aaron was all like "Oh, you spend more time in public spaces, therefore you should get the smaller room" when we were first moving in (inaudible at 20:09.5) and then it was really really tiny and I'm like "I don't know if I can do this," but I did. (sniffling)</p>

<p>So I sort of felt pushed into that room to begin with. When the room opened up — like when Derek and Anne (ph) moved out, then there were two rooms, the room that was Derek's and the room that was Anne's (ph). When Janet (sp?) was the first one to move in, she got choice since she was moving in so she of course chose the big room. She had the choice to take my room, but no one would obviously take my room, even though she had a twin bed and I had a full bed. So it really wasn't an option for me to move. It was only an option when Joan moved out. I'm like "You know, I've been here in the small room forever and I deserve my [old room.]"</p>

<p>[21:02.1]</p>

<p>But then they decided they couldn't get anyone else to move into the small room, so therefore they were going to have the other room be a room and not — and so then Janet (sp?) and Aaron decided, and I wasn't even part of that. When I found out about it, I felt unfair about that too. So Aaron has a lot more space in his room than I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're feeling kind of resentful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling kind of resentful. I make do with that space the best that I can, but I can't put a keyboard in there and I can't fit my yarn in there. So I really don't have —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like he's asking you to get some sort of organizational system for your yarn, but not necessarily move it out of the basement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you know, that doesn't solve the keyboard problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like he's trying to cope with the influx of baby stuff.</p>

<p>[22:04.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sort of trying to figure out how to make more storage space in the basement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the way to do that is to yell at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly not. But the way to do that is to ask you to organize your stuff in a way that there's room for both. It's not fair to do it in an angry tone or to yell at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm trying to understand what the issues are. I'm certainly not saying it's okay to yell at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm not going to yell at Aaron, so have to just like hide. Because I can't yell at Aaron because that would not be fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So those are your two options, hiding or yelling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. Or being around the awkwardness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why can't you have an honest conversation with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't want to and because I'm going to get yelled at more that way. I don't want to get yelled at more. I'm getting yelled at enough. Just tell me it's my fault, you know. Like it's my fault. I guess a lot of it is my fault, but a lot of it is like Sydney' stuff isn't moved out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is Sydney paying for space?</p>

<p>[23:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was when he was living in my room. He's no longer paying for space, which is why the stuff was moved out of the guest room and into my room because he hasn't been able to get it all into the car and to his space. Like he moved most of his things during the move, but he hasn't moved the electronics because it was pouring rain when they rented the U-Haul, which makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it does. And if he was paying for space for most of that time, it makes that most of his stuff —</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now his stuff is back in my room, and I don't have the space for that either. But it's my fault because I haven't yelled at Sydney to get his stuff, but I can't do that either. Like I can't force Sydney to do it, and I don't want to yell at him. Yelling at him would just make him feel worse about it. It's enough when I'm already freaking out about not having enough space which is partially his fault, but I can't make him do anything. I'm not going to be like "Oh, it's Sydney' fault" either. I'm not going to say that to Aaron.</p>

<p>[24:00.7]</p>

<p>I haven't put up the wall shelves yet. (pause) Which does rely on other people because no one could reasonably expect me to put up wall shelves. (sniffling) I don't have the space for that. And I'm too short. I don't think I could like — I don't know where I'd put a stepstool to do it all, and I don't think I have the strength to do it either. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to be reliant upon others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's like I have to rely upon others in order to have enough space, but even then the wall shelves will only solve some of it. Getting Sydney' stuff out of my room will solve part of it, but it won't solve the yarn. Not having the desk space anymore outside of my room was a problem. Having a desk in my room, now I don't have a bookshelf because I didn't have a place for my bookshelf.</p>

<p>[25:00.6]</p>

<p>So I left the bookshelf for the new guest bedroom and that's where it is. But I still have some books and they're sort of just not there, or they're on the floor because I don't have a shelf to put them on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's certainly not ideal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Aaron has zillions and zillions of books, and they're all like in the rooms of the house on the bookshelves there. But like — I don't know. Sometimes — because I put my books and he's like randomly taking them off the shelves, and I'm like "Other people have the right to have books on the shelves too." It shouldn't just be his books. That's common areas of the house. That's tons of books. Tons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the typical — how is it typically handled because he owns the space and you guys pay rent —</p>

<p>CLIENT: The common space belongs to everyone. It's just that he's always had more books than the rest of us, but we were allowed to put our books there like our cookbooks on the cookbook shelf and stuff. People did, and Derek did and left his books and some of them are still there.</p>

<p>[26:10.0]</p>

<p>So I don't know why those books of mine — it was only like a few of them, but like we both have copies of <i>Harry Potter</i>, for some of them. His was on the shelf and mine wasn't, and I'm like "Mine needs to go up there too." In theory, you don't need two <i>Harry Potters</i> on the shelf, but I would like to keep my <i>Harry Potter</i>, and I deserve bookshelf space just as much as Aaron does.</p>

<p>So theoretically, they're all communal but Aaron has more books. Like when he joined the ALA Committee for selecting the best young adult fiction of the year, he has been given a lot of books because they sent him lots of books, boxes and boxes and boxes of books. We put up these new shelves like in the TV room. There are ones on the side and then others on the long wall.</p>

<p>[27:02.1]</p>

<p>At this point, I think all of the bookshelves are completely covered with books. And I think all of those books are ones that have been sent to him recently. But he doesn't want [a chance] to be on the committee. He knew he was going to get a lot of books.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I really don't have bookshelf space either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like when there has been some more time for feelings to settle down, I wonder if having a conversation, just to try and work it out. Say you're feeling uncomfortable, you're feeling squeezed for space, is there a way to make it work a little bit better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess it's reasonable, but I don't know whether or not Aaron will be reasonable. Maybe he'll be reasonable, but I don't know that so I just don't want to get yelled at more. Like even if it's been time, like that time might be time for people to cool off or it might be time for resentment to build.</p>

<p>[28:10.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're feeling like he's being unreasonable now. You've known him for a long time. Is he usually reasonable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually he is. Right now he's pissed off and it's not actually my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's an important thing to recognize, that's why I asked. I wondered if this is the norm or if this is out of the norm. It sounds like this is out of the norm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's out of the norm, but if it's something he's still — like the resentment is still building, I think. I don't think me sending that e-mail saying "Hey, I actually did everything I could to try and get that doorknob installed. It's not my fault the guy botched the job." But I didn't even use the words "It's not my fault." I just said "You know, I told him to install it and by the time I found out he hadn't installed it, he was packed up and leaving. He told me I could install the doorknob by myself."</p>

<p>[29:04.4]</p>

<p>I was skeptical, but I was like okay, I guess I really have no choice. And if Aaron had yelled at the guy and been like "I paid you. You're putting in this doorknob too," he could do that because he can pay people. But I shouldn't have to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt really trapped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt trapped, and I wasn't the one paying him anyway. So Aaron had to spend the time. He's like "I had to go all the way out to Home Depot to get this." But it's not my fault the guy gave me a doorknob that didn't fit the door.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not your fault.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the guy's fault. Like I don't know what I could have done differently to make the door — like it wouldn't have gotten installed. I really don't know what I could have done differently, reasonably. (crying) Because I don't think there is. (pause)</p>

<p>[30:09.1]</p>

<p>And I've done the best I can to live without a doorknob, but that's not going to be possible anymore. (sniffling) Aaron can just keep his stuff in Joshua's (ph) room, but he has all the space in the world. He really really does. (pause) I might still have the smallest room in the house even if it's no longer the smallest occupied room in the house. Maybe Ryan (ph) room is about my size, I don't know. Maybe Ryan (ph) somehow does have as much stuff as I have, but I somehow doubt it. (pause)</p>

<p>[31:03.8]</p>

<p>And like some of the stuff I have — like I don't really know what I can get rid of in my stuff anyway. I don't think I have an unreasonable amount of stuff. Like now I have even more stuff because I had to buy more clothes that fit, but I'm not going to get rid of the clothes that don't fit right now because, you know, if I'm losing weight, hopefully they will eventually fit me again. So like I can't just — I did get rid of a bunch of clothes and I'll put them away eventually.</p>

<p>I don't know what else I can get rid of. I'm not going to get rid of all my yarn. I'm not. And even if all my yarn were to sell now, I would eventually replace it with new yarn, because the point of the store is to have things in stock. I'm not going to move to a system where everything is made to order because that would be really stressful and crazy. I would only have two things made to order at most and everything premade, so that way I get to dye things when I want to and I don't have any deadlines. (pause)</p>

<p>[32:12.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like maybe investing in something to help you organize this stuff would help him to feel better about it, and maybe also to help you feel like you're feeling a little bit less crowded. It might be worth it to take something that you sell from the store and use that money to help get something to organize it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except that I need to get the stuff to organize it now, and the stuff that I sell isn't necessarily going to sell now. (pause) I guess in theory that money could go towards it, but not —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's just a computation in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At least until I get to the point where I'm actually making enough money that I can get taxed on it, or bother to report it on my taxes and therefore also put down expenses and put that as a business expense and stuff.</p>

<p>[33:11.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you guys still have house meetings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We do, but that's like a thing between me and Aaron so it shouldn't be in the house meeting. Like we have a house meeting on Thursday to, you know, figure out chores now that we have a sixth housemate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if anyone else is feeling crowded for space. You seemed upset about the stroller. I wonder if other people are having —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people might be upset about the stroller and the fact that Aaron does keep half his baby stuff randomly in the kitchen and stuff. I feel like it's unreasonable to have to request that he keep it clean all the time. But it's really setting off my OCD. If like the highchair is at the table and covered with food, I have to not look at it in order to —</p>

<p>[34:03.3]</p>

<p>Or if Joshua (sp?) is at the table and is covered with food — and everyone will say "Oh, Joshua (sp?) is so cute. He has food on him. Yay. He's eating food." — and not wiping off his face right away and then I have to actually look away. And I can't look at Joshua (sp?) or I'll gag because it sets me off to see — you know, it's fine if Joshua (sp?) is clean, but to see him with food all over his face is just like so disgusting for me that it makes me want to gag.</p>

<p>I can't deal with that, but I can't tell Aaron because I don't think it's necessarily a reasonable request on my part because it's my fault that I have OCD, and therefore I just look away if Joshua (sp?) is there when I'm eating. But I don't know. I guess no one else, I think, has OCD such that it would actually matter that things are in the way. The baby stuff is in the way. It's everywhere and all-consuming and stuff. (pause) The baby stuff is all-consuming.</p>

<p>[35:07.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like that's been bothering you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know if it has been bothering anyone else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even if there is nothing you can necessarily do about it, because it sounds like — I mean, some stuff might be like asking that the highchair be cleaned just like the table gets cleaned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I asked him to clean it before he left, but I don't think I can ask him to clean it right away when it gets messy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I think you have to set some limits there, and things can't necessarily be done exactly the way you would want them done. Joshua (sp?) is a household member now and he needs some stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So like it's okay to have some stuff there, but like — and Aaron has tons of boxes of books in the common areas because now he has those (inaudible at 36:01.1) Well, that and he wouldn't put it on the shelves right away anyway. It's like he takes a while.</p>

<p>[36:05.9]</p>

<p>But he has boxes of books and all of the shelf spaces taken up at this point, and he's still getting boxes of books and those are taking up some space too. That was his choice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like some of this stuff might be house stuff, just with the — what's the flexibility with how clean things need to be. If it's okay for his boxes of books to not really have a space to be in, is it also okay for your yarn not to really have an organized space to be. If you're going to be flexible about letting things slide for him, then everyone else needs that same kind of flexibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[36:59.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there's not going to be flexibility one way, then there isn't going to be flexibility the other way because it sounds like the common areas, regardless of the owner versus renter thing, doesn't —</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're supposed to be common.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're supposed to be common.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like our rent is paid for being able to use the common spaces as well. They're not just Aaron's overflow. But they have turned into Aaron's overflow for books and he's running out of space to put them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that sounds like something that's not just a me-Georgia (sp?) issue, but a house issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, but it might be a Aaron-Georgia (sp?) issue that I'm making into a house issue. Because I don't know if anyone else is upset by that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you find out? Is there a forum for finding that stuff out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Asking people or seeing if they get upset over it. People have been upset by some of the baby stuff being in the way. Other people have been upset about the stroller being at the top of the stairs to the basement.</p>

<p>[38:03.3]</p>

<p>That's universal. And Aaron has also left baskets of laundry there before for extended periods of time too. So it's not like that's the first thing he's left in a really really really inconvenient place. My stuff is in the basement. It's not on the stairs to the basement where everyone will trip over it. (pause)</p>

<p>Maybe (inaudible at 38:29.9) but it's not like I've had people complain about there are so many boxes of books. So I don't know about that. (pause) They really are. I guess at this point he's probably got at least 1,000 books from this ALA Committee, and it's not like he didn't have books before then.</p>

<p>[38:59.6]</p>

<p>Then he also keeps on getting repeat books because like sometimes he'll get different people who will send him the same title. Then he has repeat books that he has to figure out what to do with. The thing is, he can't even put them in his library for like the kids at the school that he's being a librarian at because most of them are like pre-released copies which are not proofread, and those you're not allowed to share with other people. They can't [leave the house]. Or they can leave the house to be borrowed by individuals but they can't be put in a library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They can't be donated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They can't be donated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's tough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really is. So those are going to have to sit there. (pause) I guess they can be donated to individuals but they cannot be donated to organizations. I'm feeling like I have no space at all. (pause) And like my room is unlivable.</p>

<p>[40:12.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long have you been feeling that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I've been feeling my room is unlivable since Sydney has been living in it. It's like even like — because he had a bunch of things in my room and not in the room he was renting. Like when he moved in, he was sharing a bedroom with me because where he was renting was filled with his boxes. So it meant that I [sort of had less space]. Also like normally, I have the desk in front of the door between mine and Ryan (ph) room. I had to push it back towards my dresser so the work could be done on the door. I haven't moved it back yet because the work is still being —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You still can't open the door].</p>

<p>[41:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I have to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that will be temporary. You can move that back eventually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can move that back eventually. I can move —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Sydney' stuff will be gone eventually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even before that, I still felt like I didn't have enough space when I had to get everything in there and I'm like "Wait, I don't have enough space for my stuff." Because boxes that had previously been in the closet no longer fit in the closet and are on the floor of the room itself. I didn't have two dressers before. I got one dresser from my parents that they weren't using. It's a really nice dresser. I put clothes in that one and I put clothes in the other one, and I have one of my two mini-dressers. I left the other one for the guest bedroom because I couldn't fit the other one. Those are all taken up with clothes and stuff now.</p>

<p>[41:59.9]</p>

<p>I wanted the wall shelves before Sydney had moved into my room, but we never got around to it. We only got the shelves slightly before he moved. So they've never been put up. So I've wanted the wall shelves for a while and Aaron was like fine with me getting wall shelves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been talking about making changes to your room for a really long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know how Joan lived in it. Well, she didn't and her room was always a mess and stuff. I guess she didn't have a desk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Having a space where you feel comfortable is really important, so it sounds like some of that stuff is doable. It's just a matter of having Sydney move his stuff out and moving things to where you want them and getting them put up. That stuff is doable. It's hard to live with while it's undone, and it's been undone for a long time.</p>

<p>[43:11.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's like this thing of cubbyholes that like Sydney was originally going to put in his room and then never put up in the old place, and it's still in the box. We realized it was actually like thin enough that I could fit in space between my dresser and the window, so that will also give me a little bit more space.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it has to get put up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It has to get put up. I have to bring it back from Sydney' new place to my place because we only talked about it later. I thought it was another full bookcase but no, it was this cubbyhole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe really slotting out some time to have some of this stuff get done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's bad enough that we haven't assembled his desks or his bookshelf yet, so it's really hard to get all that done.</p>

<p>[44:04.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's stopping you from doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I can't do it myself. I'm too small, and Sydney is always like not in the mood and stuff. If I ask him he'll be like "Oh, we can do it later." The fact that we were able to get the bed together was sort of like a miracle in and of itself. Yesterday we were like we really should break down these boxes from IKEA things that we've made, and they were sitting in the room for a while. Then we were like oh, recycling is today. We will just take these boxes out and not break them down. So I got that done yesterday night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it takes a while. So basically it's all dependent on Sydney and his mood and whether or not he's feeling well and how depressed he is. Today we're going to go to Target to get shelf things for my wool in the basement. (pause)</p>

<p>[45:04.5]</p>

<p>Because even last night, I was like he can't even take one thing out. Our car was sort of parked far away because we didn't think there was parking close to the house and then there was, but we had already parked. And he was like "Oh, can we get it tomorrow?" and I'm like "Okay, fine."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would have happened if you had said "No, I really want to do it tonight"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like it would've been putting pressure on him and then he probably would've gotten upset</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever put pressure on him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do, but it felt like I should just give up at that point. It wasn't like we were staying in my room anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just checking to see what happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does not end well, so I figured since it was something I could live with for now, I would just deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm sorry you're having such a tense exchange with Aaron. I hope it will simmer down for you. You can think about some ways that you can get a sense of what's not just stuff between you and Aaron, but if there is any household issues here that you might be able to address in an objective way so it doesn't feel like you're attacking him back, but finding a way to maybe create a little more comfort for everyone.</p>

<p>[46:23.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also I don't feel like I can do this at the house meeting because Ryan (ph) just moved in and it would be about the chores that we're doing. I don't want him to have all this tension and stuff when he just moved in. Like that's not fair to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might have to hold onto it for a little bit. I know it's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like if I could get the tension — like I guess I could let it go if I could get the shelves and like it does feel livable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe doing some things you can do in your space so you take action and control over the pieces that you can. Because it does sound like there is some stuff you can do or that you can do with Sydney that doesn't involve the rest of the house.</p>

<p>We should probably stop for today. We didn't schedule for next week. Do you want to schedule or do you want to skip a week?</p>

<p>[47:17.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I probably should schedule. I found out that StateHealth — they needed my W2 from Work and I sent it to them and didn't realize that when you send it to them it takes a while to get processed. I thought if I send it on Saturday, they'll get it on Monday or Tuesday. I called them on Tuesday but it had to be processed, so I called them again on Friday and they put a priority thing in for me. But that means Wednesday is when they will deliberate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I am still currently between insurances. I'll find out on Wednesday whether or not I even get StateHealth and then after that if I do get it, I can give you the number so you can do all the paperwork for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Monday we can do your normal 1:30 or we can do 11:30 on Monday. It's the 27th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 27th. Maybe 11:30 would work.</p>

<p>[48:11.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, we'll do it a little bit earlier. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It's in my pocket, not my pocketbook]. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll see you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: At 11:30.</p>

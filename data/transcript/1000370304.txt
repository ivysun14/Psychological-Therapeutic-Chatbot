<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I think since I've left yesterday I, uhm, have been thinking off and on about my reaction to the question you asked at the end.  And I was aware of sort of not being able to think about what image I thought you had of me or impression.  And I wasn't sure exactly why.  I think I said something about that if I thought of any, it was that it was bad and, and so that sort of implied I didn't want to think about it at other times because I was afraid it would be bad too.  But, uhm, I don't know, it's, it's almost the same thing I do with anyone when I, or if I talk about myself or even if I think about myself, that if I think something good, somehow I'm either afraid that I'm being too conceited or that I'm really wrong and, and, or just that I'll be punished for thinking that, sort of, like the evil eye concept.  And so I, so I purposely think bad things about myself.  And then if I say bad things about myself to other people, they can either agree, which is, well, I'd been saying it so then I can't be too disappointed or else they can disagree and say, "Oh, no.  You're not that bad."  Or, "You're not that way."  And then that can build me up.  So then that left me wondering, or it leaves me now wondering, what I actually think about myself.  Because I almost seem to be using all these horrible things that I think to some purpose.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think there's something about doing this mixed in with not being able to stand the competition with other people, that so often, in so many things, I'm not going to be the best or the prettiest or, well, I don't know, just the most talented in whatever it is.  And instead of just thinking of myself as good, but not the best at it, I'll just have to tear myself down completely.  I was just thinking that I do this in terms of teaching, that it's been very hard for me to admit that there're some things that my assistant is better at than me.  And my inclination is, when I see this, instead of saying, well, she's better here but I can do this better, to just think I can't teach at all.  (Pause) And even if, well, I don't know, on one hand I do do some things better but, on another hand, I really am not sure I really do or I sort of doubt that I do.  (Clears throat) It's almost as if I don't dare think it. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I was just thinking about the tendency I have, whenever I, I feel at all insecure, which is practically all the time, to be very defensive and defensive because I'm afraid they, that whoever I'm with won't think that I'm, again just taking teaching, a good teacher (clears throat) and how I often have done things with parents just completely out of defensiveness so that they'll think more highly of me.  And then that makes me just wonder how much, well, I'm sort of expecting that I can make people think I'm the best teacher, in a way.  And so I'm just wondering how much maybe I'm actually thinking, either I should be the best or certainly I am much better than I will admit that I think to myself.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>But when I think about the question, just what do I think of myself, the main impression that just been on my mind is that somehow I don't, when I'm just alone with myself, I don't really like myself.  Or I sort of always have this thought of, if I could only be somebody else or somewhat different than I am.  Or just what I will do with my time, I, it's a compulsion to do the things I do but I'm not really happy doing them.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think I was just thinking of another compulsion, sort of compulsion, uhm, that, well this morning, when I went to school, or when I got to school, I was just sort of in a bad mood.  And I'm not sure, it might have been something that happened there, right at the beginning.  But at any case, I started out feeling angry.  And I didn't hide it that much with my assistant.  It wasn't so much I was angry at her per se.  I think she knew this but she's inclined to always be good tempered so she doesn't have patience for people who aren't.  And, I don't know, I think it was probably a combination of, she showed her annoyance and I was sensitive to the fact that I had no reason to be feeling in the mood I was in, that made me become particularly aware of what I was doing.  But when I was aware of it, I, I don't know, it just sort of a compulsion to stay being angry and I couldn't figure out why I started out feeling that way.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's almost as if, uhm, by being in a bad mood, I wanted my assistant to give me more attention, somehow.  I'm not sure how exactly.  And when she showed that she wasn't going to do this, then I stopped being in a bad mood.  And it's, what I compare it to now, is just all the times when I act sort of sulky or used to, especially when I was younger, and I suppose, whiny and everything.  And then what I was trying to do is to get more attention, too.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about how I began to have this kind of pattern.  Because I must, by now, anyway, think that I got pretty good results at one point so it works pretty well.  And, well, I just I don't quite understand why it began.  (Pause) The only memory I have is of, well, I don't know how old I was but MLWZ and FNA were old enough to react to me and everything.  And, uhm, I just have this impression that often, if I got into a bad mood, I could sort of storm around and they would all sort of whisper, "FAI's in a bad mood.  Watch out."  And that type of thing.  And it, I think it must have given me some kind of feeling of power.  (Pause) In fact, I think just taking today for an example, the reason I didn't stay in a bad mood that long was because I wasn't making my assistant afraid of me and so it wasn't working.  (Pause) And for so long, it was only by being in a bad mood and being hateful to my mother that I was able to relate with her, even if I had made up my mind that it was just ridiculous to keep on the way I was and that, well, I felt very guilty, sometimes, about it.  And I wouldn't feel that way when I wasn't near her and so then I'd resolve not to do it again.  And as soon as I got near her, I'd do it again.  And I don't know whether it was because I did feel angry at her and, and I didn't sort of, I wasn't trying to get anything out of it, I just felt angry and was showing her, or whether it was for some other purpose, as these other moody periods seem to be for.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I began thinking about when I was really little and how I sort of think of myself as having been happy then.  Except then all these individual instances will come out.  Because I, well, I think even then FYC used to tease me and then I would, I wouldn't feel very powerful when I was with her, because she was bigger and she would be with her friends and they would tease me and, and just generally, she sort of belittled me then or made me feel kind of powerless.  And then I had a friend that I don't, I don't know if I remember this because I was told I would do the same things to the friend or if I actually remember that what I was doing to my friend was sort of in retaliation to what FYC had done to me.  But that's my impression of it.  And I used to just boss her around and push her around, just run right over her, literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Who was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Who was the girl?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.  Is it somebody you referred to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't think so: FEJ CLG.  I don't think I've mentioned her.  And she was just a very sweet little girl, much frailer than I was just physically and, uhm, and I think she was a little bit younger and I, I could boss her around.  She'd do anything I told her to.  So I kind of got my feelings of being powerful by being with her.  (Pause) And I've always had the impression, I don't think, I think this is sort of my own impression of what I was doing with her, that I, I bossed her because FYC bossed me and I had to have some outlet for it.  In fact, just now other things come to my mind, too, where I think this relationship I had with FYC really bothered me.  Because another time, ah, I think it was a creche that somehow I was involved in giving her for Christmas, uhm, she made me really angry and I threw the thing out the window.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What, what was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  A creche, you know, the, I think it was just a stable of, uhm, it had figures of jesus and mary and so forth.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And then another time when she was away, I might have mentioned this, I, uhm, my father's niece, my cousin, that, the one that is illegitimate, came to visit.  And, ah, she was older and I don't know whether she initiated this or not but FYC had a lot of candy that she'd saved up from either easter of halloween.  And somehow, anyway, we got going on this candy and I was very much, I was very happy at the thought of eating it all up and, and having my cousin help me while FYC was away.  It was, again, getting back at her.  (Pause) And then the, it just, I keep thinking of all these times.  And then when FYC had a turtle for a pet, this was after moved so it was after I was 6.  The other things was bef—, were all before I was 6.  And I don't remember having any particular feeling about the turtle but I wanted to hurt FYC so one day I let the turtle go.  And I pretended that I was taking the turtle for a walk and making it all sound very innocent but I was very much aware of what I'd done.  And then just the feeling I had when I finally made FYC cry and the fact we had so many phys—, real raging physical fights and then finally when I could make her cry and the great feeling of power that I got when I was able to do that.  It was almost as if now I could defend myself face to face with her, whereas before, I never felt I could.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And there's something about power—, being powerless that I can't stand now.  And, uhm, I think it went, that feeling went beyond FYC because I was just thinking of the time when I wouldn't eat something.  I, the only memory I have is when I wouldn't eat some turnips.  And I just didn't like the taste but then it became something much more than just not eating something I didn't like, it became a real battle between my mother and me on who was going to win, who was going to be the more powerful.  And I went for about 3 meals without eating anything because that was all I was going to be given and until I ate them I couldn't have anything else.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did it turn out?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't remember (laughs) but I must have eaten them.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You are amused at recalling it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) It was almost as if I was amused at thinking I could win against my mother.  Or the other thing was sort of this image of a young child having this thing as a principle and then not having any strength to maintain it, was sort of amusing.  (Pause) And I think this reaction my mother had had is one I've often had too, with children, that sometimes you ask them to do something and if they just completely bristle and say, no, which is what I did then, then it just is a matter of, I'm going to be obeyed and, and no matter how wrong what I'm asking is or how foolish or how just unimportant it becomes, I'm just going to be obeyed so I can be obeyed.  And that's what I think happened in that particular case.  (Pause) Because it's happened with other members of my family.  I, I think of the time my brother, I think it was MLWZ, threw an (laughs) — I can't believe this — threw an egg on the floor because it hadn't been cooked or else he just didn't want an egg that morning.  And my mother had this real thing about eating breakfast the right way, having the right things.  And she'd rotate it so we had cereal one day and egg the next.  And so she made him eat the egg off the floor.  And she couldn't, certainly, have been doing it because she thought the egg would be good for him.  It was just a matter of, who wasn't going to be defied.  And she was so angry at having been defied that instead of cooking him another egg, because she wanted him to have an egg, she made him eat this dirty egg.  (Pause) And she was al -, I think she did a lot of just little things like that which showed, even though she controlled herself and never just sort of stood there, yelling and screaming at us the way my father did, that underneath it all, she really had a strong temper.  Because I think she also, I don't remember this one too clearly, but FYC or somebody, I don't think it was me, wasn't eating with the proper manners and, or made some comment about the food at one time.  And so she made whoever it was go eat where the animals ate and right off the floor, I mean, having the plate on the floor.  It was soup or something.  And it was sort of all these little hateful things that — and she really seemed to hate whoever was involved at these times.  And just the whole thing with meals, anyway, it was almost as if she hated cooking them or having to but it was her duty.  And so she just kind of made them nutritional but that was all.  I mean, they didn't taste very good.  (Pause)</p>

<p>That's another feeling I think I often will have.  Well, I know I have it about doing laundry, that I always, or very often will feel put upon if I have to do the laundry.  And I look upon it as something I just have to do and sort of, MSCZ should be very appreciative and sympathetic because I've done it.  And sometimes I've gotten that way about cooking too, during the week, when, I don't know, it just seems like all I want to do is sort of throw something together at night.  I don't care what it tastes like and so it makes me angry that I have to worry about MSCZ's caring what it takes like, tastes like.  (Pause) And it was interesting too because my mother never really varied the different menus that she had or the way she prepared things until, well, it seemed as if it were when most of us were out of the home so she didn't really have — well, she had my father to feed but he might eat out sometimes and, or they might.  So somehow she didn't have 3 meals a day every single day to do and the pressure was off her.  So then she began to enjoy doing things.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>(SILENCE)</p>

<p>[00:01:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know, I'm not, I'm not sure where to begin. I feel... (PAUSE) I don't know where to start, start pulling the thread out.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's going (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm upset. (PAUSE) Jennie (ph) senses it. She's interrogating, interrogating me a little bit about it and I don't feel very comfortable with that. But it's true so why deny it? Not in the larger sense but in an immediate sense. "Are you alright?" she asks. I'll say, "I'm fine." [00:03:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I don't know. I'm not sure where to, I'm not sure where to start. (PAUSE) Which is I suppose a pretty good approximation of this making it difficult to work.[00:04:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things that are occurring to you that seem unimportant or irrelevant or (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a word that's stuck in my head after our last conversation. I can't remember exactly the context in which it came up. You know but it was after I had begun to entertain the (PAUSE) idea that (PAUSE) occasion or meltdown or what have you was volitional (ph) or something... The word that stuck in my head was manipulative. [00:06:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that's really my fear is I'm being instrumental at some level. (PAUSE) So I guess that's, that's in my head. That this state of (inaudible) is a way of, a means to get my way. (PAUSE) And to have my will be done. And it's kind of horrifying both because it's, I don't know... It's not an ethical way of acting but also because the outcome is so devastating. I mean, it's like what would want that to happen? [00:07:09]</p>

<p>I mean, how could that be that (inaudible)? That's the direction the will inclines then, I have to wonder what sort of will it is? It's a will to what? (PAUSE) I don't know.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:07:53]</p>

<p>Another word that's stuck in my head (inaudible) script which is a slightly less damning way of understanding this. (PAUSE) That there's a script that deploys when (inaudible at 00:08:19) Phil's says he's leaving. I sense that someone else is leaving. I sense there's no, you know, there's no benevolence in a particular interaction.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:08:57]</p>

<p>I don't know. That's all I got. (PAUSE) No that's not all I got. So (PAUSE) I had a very weird feeling last night. [00:10:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I came home feeling really desperate like I don't know. And Jennie (ph) came home and immediately said, "What's wrong?" Just looking at my face. I said, "Nothing's wrong." And I started interacting as normally. And she had a friend coming over. We made dinner and she had a friend coming over. And it was like normal. And yet (PAUSE) at some level, you know, nothing had changed. I could feel it. I could sense it. I could feel this sense of desperation somehow underlying everything. [00:10:59]</p>

<p>And yet, I had no contact with (PAUSE) It was a very strange feeling. It was as if, you know, I were crying but continuing to speak as normal.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (PAUSE) there are a couple of things that are unclear to me. One is (PAUSE) why you seem to be keeping from Jennie (ph) how you're feeling. [00:12:03]</p>

<p>I understand it's different because there's somebody else there. But I guess at first, when she asked how you were doing and you said, "Okay," even though you knew you weren't doing okay... (PAUSE) It, it's like you said it pretty reflectively (ph) and didn't really consider telling her otherwise and... (PAUSE) I mean, if you said almost as though as it would seem to be obvious that you wouldn't tell her. (PAUSE) And maybe too it is. [00:12:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm tired of... (PAUSE) I mean, she knows it. It's obvious to her. She keeps asking. I don't know. I mean, how long can I? (PAUSE) How can long can this last? It feels like a crisis extended over years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:13:31) You know, how long can I keep asking her to try and soothe me? It's too much to ask.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's too much. (PAUSE) I don't think it's good for her.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thing, which may be related, is (PAUSE) you're feeling (PAUSE) profoundly guilty about the possibility of sort of being kind of volitionally (ph) oppositional or manipulative.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:14:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (PAUSE) I guess I don't understand why you feel so bad about that possibility (PAUSE) as you seem to. (PAUSE) Some guilt, sure. But you sound, maybe I'm being dramatic, but really kind of stricken to your core with... [00:15:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, I don't know. I don't know whether it's... There's some guilt in there, I think. (PAUSE) There's also (PAUSE) there's also kind of horror. I mean, you know, if there really is some kind of cognitive deficit that's, you know, related to my ability to equilibrate, my ability to soothe myself, my ability to (PAUSE) you know, continue to operate when I'm upset. That's (PAUSE) something has to be managed if, you know, I (PAUSE) [00:17:05]</p>

<p>I mean, It's not as if the will is obstructed. It's that it's actively directed and in this completely (PAUSE) self defeating way, sure. But in a way that, you know, means that interacting with me is dangerous for other people (PAUSE) That I'll put their lives in chaos and that I'm doing this somehow deliberately. It's horrifying. You know, why would anybody want to interact with me on those terms? Why would anybody want to be in a relationship with me in one kind or another? (PAUSE) I'm going to subvert it. [00:18:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>It's lonely. It's isolating. It's horrifying that I'm doing this. It's what I do. (PAUSE) So there's guilt there clearly. (PAUSE) There's also something else.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe a sense like unworthiness to be in a relationship? [00:18:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just feels doomed. I mean, it feels, it just feels unworkable. (PAUSE) Feels kind of hopeless. It's like (PAUSE) how do you... (PAUSE) You know, if something is automatic, if something is, you know, constitutionally (ph) intervene (inaudible at 00:19:35) you know, how do you, how do you intervene in a will that's been so diverted with and the only thing you can do is use the will to intervene. How do you... See? It feels like a catch 22.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're kind of helpless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like a catch 22. That's a characterological problem rather than a psychological problem. [00:20:09]</p>

<p>If I'm such an unreliable narrator, you know? (PAUSE) Anyway. I feel, I feel like I'm, I'm down the rabbit hole. You know, once I begin to entertain that possibility, I feel like I'm down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:21:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think (PAUSE) you get worried talking about (PAUSE) how you see what you may do in relationships because (PAUSE) then it's not covert anymore and, you know (PAUSE) in here anyways, I'm going to know, and not want any part of this anymore. [00:22:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. (PAUSE) But I don't know what the last clause would... (PAUSE) I guess that's true. I guess that's a true... I would endorse that. (PAUSE) Not so much that I'm afraid that you'll know as that we'll have to address it. (PAUSE) And I think the premise is that you know, that everybody knows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of? [00:21:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of my untrustworthiness. (PAUSE) And they keep giving me opportunities to prove otherwise and I can't because it's true. You offered to see me four times a week on Wednesday. My initial response was horror. I mean I just told you that I, on the day and time that we had agreed, I can't follow through.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:23:57]</p>

<p>And you're extending interaction. I don't know how to trust myself. I feel like I've broken my own trust myself. And I couldn't tell... I don't, I don't even know how to... I don't know how to get my head around it. I can't tell whether I'm being honest or not. You know, like the whole evaluation of honesty, I, I, you know, my (PAUSE) There are too many recursions I can't keep track of them. I feel, I feel a sense of... I don't know. [00:24:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think your head gets fuzzy and confused like that in response to the (inaudible at 00:25:05) really. There was something about my offering that or suggesting that that (PAUSE) when I did that I guess (PAUSE) did horrify you (inaudible at 00:25:39) comes to my mind is you must have felt like, you know, if you're an alcoholic or something and I said, "Oh here. Why don't you take ten bucks and go down to the liquor store but get a newspaper."</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The model is that I'm testing these relationships. And I guess that's the model, that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I've got this, I have this deep fear of being left. So I push them to see how far it goes. (PAUSE) And I guess what I'm discovering is that I will, at some level, I want to be left. When I'm not left, it's horrifying to me. (PAUSE) You know, so I feel this anguish if I'm left and I feel, you know, anguish... I don't know. I think the best example was right after I got back in April right? And I feel this anguish if I'm not left, if the other person doesn't leave and the test goes on. It's, it's... [00:27:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll keep pushing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hell. I don't want to keep pushing it. I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't feel, I feel this just total lack of control and yet the model would suggest that, that I'm actually orchestrating this. I don't know. I feel... (PAUSE) I don't feel in control.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p>

<p>I don't feel in control.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:29:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then here, that's I guess played out in the feeling or worry that you're like screwing me over financially?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't, I can't pay it right now at this moment until the next paycheck comes in. So I'm not, it's not like I'm withholding something. (PAUSE) And yet I am. I've done this. I've done this. It did not need to be. I did it. [00:30:05]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>You know? The work that I haven't done at work? I've done it. I did it. It didn't need to be. (PAUSE) And yet, in both cases, you know, the state that intervenes, that prevents me from doing X was one in which, it was like when you started today. I didn't know where to start. I was just... You know, so there's some, you know, there's some other agent that I am not... I don't quite know how to, I don't quite know how to, how to reconcile these two models both of which are somehow operative. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I mean I can see how, you know, somebody suddenly and I guess this is part of the sense of horror, I can see how somebody might, you know, just as a, an analytical convenience come up with ideas of reference or some, you know, some external part of this that's, that's... (PAUSE) It just makes more sense. And the idea that you're completely divided against yourself it's...</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It reminds me, this reminds me a little bit of (PAUSE) you're, our talking about your forgetting about stuff from previous sessions in the following way. You know, that happens fairly often and most folks in my shoes would generally chalk it up to depression and... But the extent to which it happened to you and how profoundly disturbing it was suggested something different from how that usually works. And that reminds me a little of how you're talking now in that (PAUSE) again, most folks in my shoes would chalk what you're describing up to, you know, unconscious motivations and so forth. [00:33:11]</p>

<p>But (PAUSE) the, the sort of (inaudible at 00:33:25) between these different parts of yourself and the degree of disturbance, like how upsetting it is to be confronted with that (PAUSE) is a lot and is more than (PAUSE) what often happens. (inaudible at 00:34:03) but... [00:34:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're saying that most people confronted with this fact of some unconscious motivation asserting itself would not be so upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no it depends on the content of it but, but, but generally right. There's not a sense of such a gap between how you consciously known yourself to be and what you haven't been aware of about your motivation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not just me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a sense this total otherness (ph) about it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and the I think related degree of (PAUSE) like upset, disturbance when confronted with it. [00:35:05]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (inaudible at 00:35:27) have a baseline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean... To, to give a somewhat melodramatic analogy it's like somebody realizing they just cut off their own head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:36:05]</p>

<p>Well what you were saying a minute ago makes it clear to me... I mean, putting aside (inaudible at 00:36:27) or your work. I mean, just in here how you're kind of set up either way. Either, you know, there's something like the money that's, you know, you're worried is going to drive me away or there isn't and then you're going to worry about what you will do next to kind of pull or push or see if you can drive me away. [00:36:59]</p>

<p>You know, like I guess what you were saying about, you know, there are times when like at work now, Phil does say he's going to leave and that sets everything in motion but then there are times before that where you're kind of nudging or pushing or probing to see, you know, when that's going to happen until it does. But that this is always kind of active in one way or another (inaudible at 00:37:31) shut the (inaudible) problem?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to do. (PAUSE) Like six years has passed since, seven years has passed since I began trying to just divert this and I'm back where I started. [00:39:15]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I don't know what to do. It's good. I think, I think it's, you know, an interesting and sensitive and plausible model for what's going on. I think it's, I think it's true. It has all of the elements but I don't know what to do. I can't keep going like I'm going. I can't do it. [00:40:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean (PAUSE) especially knowing more about what you're doing or what's going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially. I mean, it feels like, you know, (inaudible at 00:41:01) feels like something that's interesting or expecting (ph) might be useful for somebody not for me. (inaudible) I don't trust it's utility. I don't... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (PAUSE) I think this is your throw away move. (PAUSE) Like, "I haven't gotten anywhere with this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Throw away move?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "This isn't going to help. I can't do anything. I'm helpless" Like right on the heels of actually (LAUGHTER) you know, having... [00:42:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Okay. You mean I should feel happy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just saying (LAUGHTER) you do this thing I think (PAUSE) sometimes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Here is it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Show me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here it is. I've come to moments like this 15 times in the last few years and each time there's been no change. Now maybe this is the killer (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but each...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) quite like this before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:42:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've seen you come to moments in this general direction but, I mean, you said yourself like you thought, you know, your whole life you've been sick and tired of everybody telling you you have some responsibility for this. [00:43:11]</p>

<p>And for the first time, it seems that actually you might. That's... I mean you're... That's quite different. I'm not saying Jennie's (ph) going to be gone tomorrow but nor am I saying this is the same thing as what's happened before. I'm saying this is a different thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more. [00:44:00]</p>

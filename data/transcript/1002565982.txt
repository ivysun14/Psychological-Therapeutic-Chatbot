<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  Do you like it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  How many hours do you work in a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not very many.  Maybe 10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—hum, would you like more or is that about enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Uh, that's enough, with school, so—"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And what do they have you doing there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, everything basically, just you know making pizza, doing dishes, cleaning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  I haven't been over there yet.  Is it all take—out?  Or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's okay.  Because it's you premake the pizzas and people take them home and bake them, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I see, we've had the pizza, I just haven't been over there.  Are you liking the job okay?  Good.  Okay, and how have your spirits been overall?  You've been feeling up or down or sort of in the middle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.  My brother's got back into town, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, cool.  So, uh, cause he's he's low risk, he's going to be staying with you guys?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And how are you sleeping these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Having trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How long is it taking you after you go to bed to fall asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes an hour or two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And once you get to sleep you stay asleep for the night or do you wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I stay asleep for the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how's your energy during the day.  Do you have enough or do you feel tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, not enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How's your appetite been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's been a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Back to normal, you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've gained about 10 pounds actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since the last checkup, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So that's last month you've gained about 10?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And does it feel like it's a good level now or does it feel like it's higher than usual?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's at a good level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  And how are you doing in terms of concentration?  Are you able to focus pretty well at school and work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.  And memory doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Um, are you finding yourself worrying about things a lot, or not too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay.  You're going to [DEIDENTIFIED] now, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like it pretty well up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Getting some good friends now, hang out with them and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And when you're with your friends, do you have a good time or do you feel like you're hanging out with them and kind of going through the motions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm having a great time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  What do you do for fun?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I like Frisbee golf—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's one thing.  Um, you know like throw a baseball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything a teenager does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds good.  That's good.  Any suicidal thoughts at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay.  And anxiety level overall has been pretty good or has been high or low or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's good.  So you're not worrying about things, you're not feeling nervous inside?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Okay.  That medication last time, how are you doing about remembering to take it?  Are you taking it pretty regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I I never forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  [INAUDIBLE]?  Both the Luvox and the Rozerem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or are you taking the Rozerem still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am sometimes, it just depends—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you need it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Luvox, you are taking it one every night still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any side effects or problems with it that you are aware of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum, besides sleeping, I don't know, it but it says, you told me that it helps you sleep, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually it does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what confuses me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel, I mean, people can have opposite reactions to medicines.  Do you feel like the Luvox is keeping you awake at night?  Or it's just not putting you to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just not putting me to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're on a pretty low dose, so it may not be enough to really sedate you or maybe this medicine just isn't the right one to make you sleepy.  So we might want to talk about some other options for sleep.  Are you using the Ambien at all anymore?</p>

PT:	Hum, well I ran out and my mom still hasn't got me a refill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  When you do take it, does it help you get to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So as long as you have the Ambien you are able to get to sleep without any trouble.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how long does it take you when you take an Ambien to fall asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, 20 minutes, a lot less than normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  How long ago did you run out of it about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum, a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just got to remind your mom to go pick it up for you, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So it sounds like that as long as you have the Ambien you sleep okay.  Sleep's cool.  Spirits are good, the anxiety level is low, you're doing pretty well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Good.  Any new stresses in life or anything that's bugging you or worrying you or—"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't know if you've heard my brother tore his ACL.  [NAME OTHER],  skiing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know if your mother told me that or not.  When did he do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know about 5 months ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he tore it while he was skiing up at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I remember she did tell me that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, he has surgery in the next couple weeks, so that's kind of bothered me a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  The good thing about that, I'll tell you, it's amazing how good the art to have surgery is now.  They do what we call arthroscopically, which means they just make these little holes.  They don't have to cut the knee open.  And they go in there, they can repair it so well.  I had a friend who had that done, and he was out skiing again, not not right away, but then once it healed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was able to go back and he says it's stronger than ever, so, they've really gotten good repaired ACLs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he said he's getting a dead man's ACL in his knee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.  Sometimes they do that.  But it sounds kind of weird, freaky, butta it seems to work pretty well, from what I hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he wants to ski next season, right when it, you know the slopes open, so they said it heals a lot faster when it's a dead man's knee in your leg, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is how weird?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're doing more and more of that.  Okay, so that's kind of stressful to just have him go through surgery.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything else that is stressful these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you're doing really well, [PATIENT NAME], so if you kept feeling just the way you do now, except for you're able to get to sleep a little faster, would you feel pretty comfortable with things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Then let's not mess with it, since you're doing so well.  Let's see here.  The refills, I'm checking, let's see, I wrote it in February, wrote the Luvox for up to 4 nights, that's to last you like 4 months and there was a refill, that's 8 months.  That will last you until October, so we're good there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Rozerem, you're not using that often, so I'm not sure if you need more refills on that, I might call them in for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Ambien, I did 6 refills last month, so we should be good for quite a while still on that one.  So I think we're good, but if you need anything else, just have the pharmacy call me, I'll call in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything else you want to talk about then, before we set up another appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I'm doing great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like you're doing great.  Should we check back maybe in a month or so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum, do you want to check in before finals, after finals, um, what do you think?  What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, that's what I was thinking.  Maybe after you're out of school, I'll just make sure things are going well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I get out the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  We can do it after that.  I'll get my book out here.  Let's see where that puts us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something a little later, if that all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you can sleep in a little bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds good.  Yeah, the [DATE] is [DEIDENTIFIED], so you'll be out by then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you want to do an afternoon appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could do like, uh, let me check this.  We could, I've done my schedule all the way out yet, so I want to make sure about this.  Um, how about, uh, how about like Tuesday, the [DATE] at one o'clock?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Tuesday, [DATE] at one P.M.  There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.  Anything else you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Naw, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, take it easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good luck at school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  See you next month.  Bye, bye.</p>

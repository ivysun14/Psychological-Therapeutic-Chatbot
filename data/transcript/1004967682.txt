<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing I was going to see if we keep Wednesday, maybe we could meet mid-day Wednesday instead of in the morning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also, I was hoping we could meet a half hour later than usual tomorrow, but if you can't, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that would be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I'll e-mail all that stuff to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [Pause.] Here I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Good to see you in person. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's good to be back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Pause.] Makes it seems to me like it's working, so that's nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [Pause.] What's the story with the partial? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the story is you're supposed to call or refer me to them, but they won't do it until the ECT is done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got a sort of cryptic message from what's her name. Okay, that's what it said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That seems like it would be a good thing too. Yeah. She said, apparently, ECT will just like keep treating me, so I'm going to have to tell them to stop eventually. I don't know. [Pause]</p>

<p>[02:15]</p>

<p>Still really sad. Oh well. Glad to be back. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible - 03:12].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. [Pause.] My psychiatrist in the hospital lives in [inaudible - 03:56] next to me. [Pause.] [inaudible - 04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a different one than the last time? Like it's going on Tuesday. Is he the same person that you had seen when you're just there? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Very curt, a little brisk, I guess. [Pause.] It was okay. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[05:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had the impression that you're pretty relieved to be feeling a little better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm relieved to be [inaudible - 05:48]. Yeah. [Pause.] I'm not sure how much better I do feel, but certainly better enough to be out of the hospital. That's a good thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's a really good thing. [Pause.] </p>

<p>[08:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is your mind just kind of blank?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has it been that way [inaudible - 08:29]? I mean is that an accumulating thing? Is it being here? Is it...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could be. I doubt it is, but I don't...yeah. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little anxiety. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] I don't seem to have that many kind of much annoying side effects. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So everything's been okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I personally think that's been okay. If I'm losing things; I'm losing them completely enough that I don't know that it's gone, which is good enough. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[09:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've had one person a number of years ago who had had a [DT previous the same knee - 09:52], and I saw somebody else who was referred for it but decided not to do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's working. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what's making your anxious about being here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes two of us. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[11:02]</p>

<p>I guess I have the impressions that I think I'm going to go back to being bad. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it making you uncomfortable to sit here unsure what to say or are you alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm okay I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like the most okay ever, but I think I'm okay. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[15:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're going to get yourself in to some kind of trouble if you start talking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just don't know what to say. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[20:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sad. That's about it. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's alright. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[22:48]</p>

<p>Yeah, probably something really important going on if not knowing what to say, but it will emerge at some point, eventually. It happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[25:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of what you feel is mostly kind of sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe a little worried about [inaudible - 32:35].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I get worried about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not necessarily the way I basically think. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[33:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I gather, a bit anxious as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[33:15]</p>

<p>[inaudible - 33:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The anxiety?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [Pause.] I guess I just feel like I should just be able to let go of the anxiety. [Pause.] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what, I wonder if it's safer being in the hospital and also safer doing the kind of treatment that you do there, than what goes on here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Seems like it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can mostly count on them to not know you particularly well. And I mean, at least they make an effort to get to know you like I would too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[36:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible - 37:44] person used it in the hospital, it's my impression that in a way you're in sort of pretty passive role; like you'll get sort of poked and prodded and checked in with and looked over and so forth. But kind of answer questions and go where you're supposed to go and do what you're supposed to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More than in a way kind of coming from you. [Pause.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause].</p>

<p>[38:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you hospital [inaudible - 38:47]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible - 38:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Do you wish I was asking you questions or things like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean that's not what you do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[40:00] </p>

<p>[40:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible - 40:13].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. There are times I work more that way. I'm not sure that would be more helpful. [Pause.] [inaudible - 42:21] Let's see, and tomorrow, yeah, that's okay, 5:45?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay good.</p>

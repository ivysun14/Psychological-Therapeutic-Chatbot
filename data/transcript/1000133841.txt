<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The twentieth interview. The twentieth interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi, how you doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's one of those days. The grades had to be in for graduating people and I [had three people of course handed in their papers today so...you know what I mean?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You had three courses - ?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, graduating people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Had to have all their grades turned in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And I'm at [ a system per course I had three papers came in for those kind of people today. ] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. And they just came in to you today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [They come in pretty quick and ] (ph) (inaudible@ 44:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, geez. That's a bummer for you, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [When they throw that at you.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 44:56) There's still one more on the list too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, really? Oh, gee. That's really rough. Wow. I uh, - there's really some things that happened. Well, just related to this thing with Don and - it's really strange. One thing I when we got to - well we had to go consult or council this family of [that girl that was around him] (ph) and then we got to staff meeting late. So after everyone left, Gary had made arrangements to stay an extra day at this cabin that we're going to this weekend and asked if would stay. And I felt like I really dealt with it very well and I said, "I don't feel as though I can. Don isn't going to be taking off at all. He's going to be here and I feel a responsibility to him as well as wanting to [be with him there.] (ph) And I just don't think it will work out." And he was really, really bummed out and I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He took it hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Much more than I expected I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess he kind of really expected you to say yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he really did. And I guess I didn't know whether we would have had a chance to talk about it or not. And anyway we went out to have a drink. We got done with the staff and all about 12:30 or something like that. It was closer to one because it was hard to find a place where we could have a drink because everything closes up [in Albany at one.] (ph) So we found a place to have a drink. And he was also bummed at himself. What was strange is I had accepted all of this as very close friends kind of thing and Gary came across with some things about very strong feelings for me. And I guess not just as friends or more than friends. And I'm really glad that beforehand I had decided what I was going to do because what I began to recognize is that I guess I felt like it would have been a really serious kind of thing in terms of Claire, Gary's wife, because he was talking - and I recognized this before - Gary leads like an almost entirely different life than his wife. His wife's perfectly satisfied being a wife and mother and revolving her world around that. [48:04]</p>

<p>And Gary's very much involved in lots of outside things and lots of people who are moving and changing and she's not. And he was really disappointed that I wouldn't stay...that I couldn't stay. And he became really angry with himself. I guess maybe it's just letting feelings get carried away and when a block comes in the way when he recognized how they were affecting himself and me affect his family. And I didn't feel very helpful or competent or supportive in -[48:52]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Kind of sounds like just seeing how all that affected him really kind of made you really - it threw you in a way too.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it did. I guess part of it is I don't think I've taken it all quite as seriously as Gary. Maybe that's - out of his joking manner about a lot of things and I've taken it a lot lighter recognizing the way I feel and accepting it and feeling good about it. But also I feel as though the decision that I shouldn't spend an evening or a day or sleep with him whatever - the decision not to do that was a pretty adult one and one that I was dealing with my responsibilities and the priorities and stuff. Yeah, and my feelings. And I didn't know what to say. I really felt kind of bad that he felt so uncomfortable with that or so disappointed in it. And I guess I tried to explain it out of saying that I began to look at what was going on and - it wasn't helpful but it helped me - I just began to recognize that Don is really a priority for me. And it's not to say that I don't care about you at all -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You were being honest.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I felt really good about that being honest. I often sort of twist things so that they're honest but not complete. So that worked through and Gary didn't feel real good about it. And I still left it sort of open. I said - He asked me again. He kind of pushed it. And I said, "Well, let me think more about it." I said, "I don't think it's possible. I don't think it's maybe a good idea right now." And I said, "I'll think more about it but don't-" and I was pretty straight about it. "Don't count on it." We were very tired. I did feel like thinking it over again. [51:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You did intend to think about it more.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I did. I didn't get home till I guess it was about three o'clock. Don had gone out. He was going to go [uptown] (ph) and meet some friends. I came in and he'd left the keys in an envelope on the door. "You lose." We'd debated who was going to get home first should take the keys. And I went in and he was sound asleep and I was really quiet and I went to get into bed. And all of sudden he got really angry and got up, put his clothes and said, "I'm sleeping on the couch." And I said, "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What's going on?" He didn't ask me why I was late or coming home late. I told him I'd be home somewhere around one o'clock. I figured I'd be done around one. And I was later than I thought. And all he could say was something about being worried or couldn't I call. And he didn't even allow me an opportunity to say anything to be defensive and explain or to say, "Wait a minute. I don't have to be defensive about it," kind of thing. He just stormed out, found the couch uncomfortable and he came back. And I was really tired besides the fact that the whole evening carried a lot of heavy things. [52:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One after another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was so tired and I knew I had to get up the next - I just wanted to sleep. So we must have stayed up all night and said very little. And just wouldn't hear it. And I thought he'd been drinking. I mean he reacted in a really strange way. It just wasn't the way he'd react, I don't think. But he said he hadn't. He said he'd been home at eight. He just - I guess it was jealousy coming out. He couldn't understand why I didn't call him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did he say anything? I mean like I know [another time when it was kind of like he had all these suspicions but you weren't sure you were being paranoid or -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he wasn't just jealous of Gary. He was jealous of the whole thing in Albany. And I didn't feel guilty about that anything that had happened Wednesday evening. I felt pretty good about it all. And it was like coming home and having made a decision that meant something for the two of us and he was sort of there rejecting any attempt to listen. He's jealous about being excluded from what I'm doing at work. And like Thursday morning was a real bummer for a long time until we finally sat down. And he moped around. He wouldn't say anything. He feels excluded from what I'm doing; that I'm not sharing anything. In fact, he was ready to leave Thursday and take off to go back home, not come back for graduation. Even made a suggestion that he didn't want to get married to me anymore. And it was so irrational and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Silly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Silly. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like a little kid in a way. Pouting.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was just like that. And I talked and I kept my cool for a long time. And I started at him that he was just being really foolish. That he wasn't listening. He was saying things like I don't share anything with him. I don't give anything of myself to him. That he wants to know what I'm doing in Albany - the kind of things I'm doing. And I never share it. I didn't call him and it was really, really inconsiderate and all. I'm leading this other life and excluding him completely from it. And what I said was, "Well, I've been living alone. And we see each other - and there are lots of things I'd like to share but we're not together. And I'm used to being independent and having to work problems if they're at work or whatever all by myself. So why should I bug you with them. They're haven't been overpowering. If they're overpowering I certainly have shared." And he just seemed to be turning everything I was doing into rejection of him, that I didn't think anything of him. I was being very, very selfish. [55:43]</p>

<p>And we worked it out at least for the moment and I said, "Well, okay, I'm not used to sharing a lot of things." And I pointed out, "You're making demands on me," well I really shouted, I said, "You're making demands on me that I'm not giving into." And I said, "You're trying to demand that I give up this trip for the summer. I know how you feel about it but it ain't going to make anything better if I stay around. You're demanding I don't go and I'm not going to give in to that demand."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Sounds like the whole thing was a free for all.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Almost, Scott, except that I - because I felt -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [He talked to you after a while you know what I mean?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well in a way he did except that I really felt in control of myself. It was just though I was shouting because I was angry and I was letting the anger out and I was picking - the thing that makes me feel like I was in some control is that I think I was being very careful about what I said and how I said it. But I was angry and I was letting him know it. It was sort of I guess a build up of tension and all kinds of things. And he began to see that a lot of his ridiculous things that he was saying was just out of frustration of being bored sitting around here, my going off and fulfilling the responsibilities that I have to finish up and being excluded and getting all that out. And I don't know. He's kind of pouting around today because I'm leaving this afternoon. [57:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the weekend you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's the strangest kind of thing is that it's a really childish kind of thing. And I don't know if it's new for me to see this or what it is or if it's like he's trying to make me feel really guilty and really bad and not do things. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. It's like when you try to make sense out of it. Why the hell is he being this way or what's happening? It's like you really can't. It's real confusing for you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, for one thing I got my period this week and so he's been horny all week. So okay big deal. But he can't even deal with that and he's pouting around. Well, I'm sorry! That's the way it goes! And being kind of really silly about that, too. I don't know. Maybe it's just all these kinds of things and my leaving. Maybe it's a build up toward getting married and thoughts about that. And maybe they're getting to him more quickly than they're getting to me. Like I see Kevin becoming very, very nervous about the fact that he's getting married next weekend. Maybe kinds of things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, kind of like you can't exactly know the basis for it. It could be getting married. It could be going off your going off. It could be his being bored. It could be some kind of interaction or combination of all those things.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the question that arises for me is that I think that I'm being reasonable as I can given what I want to do and I'm going to do it. And I think I'm being as understanding and trying to be sensitive to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're talking about being reasonable as opposed to being unreasonable, the only thing where there's a question is in reference to the summer for you. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean reasonable in the sense that some of the kinds of things that are happening are kinds of things that I could easily blow up about and shout and scream and be irrational about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, reasonable in your whole way of relating to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I think I'm keeping cool and not letting things blow my stack. I think I'm being patient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would certainly make it hotter if you didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. It would be probably ridiculous. And I'm not - I guess that maybe I'm not dealing with it fully enough. Like one of the things he says, "How many days have you spent with me?" And I've spent considerable numbers of days with him since he's been here. I would probably be getting a lot more work done that I wanted to do. You know, kinds of things that aren't necessarily a requirement in terms of finishing up in school but things that I wanted to read, I wanted to get done before I left. Well, I'm not doing those things. And he said, "This week, just this week, Wednesday and today are the only day," - well Friday, Saturday, I guess he didn't say Sunday - are the days when my time has been used elsewhere, that I haven't been able to be with him. And he said, "Well what about next week?" I said, "I'll be back Monday. I have to go to Uptown Monday night. I have two appointments Tuesday in Albany, but we've got it set up so he's going to go and we're going to go visit some friends and Wednesday evening. That's it. That's all that I'm really committed - and I have a couple of things to write up. But I don't know. I guess just right now I'm beginning to think those kinds of demands - and as I was driving back from Uptown this morning I was thinking, "I have a hell of a lot of adjustment to make around my independence." And the kinds of demands Don is beginning - [62:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [All of a sudden you're feeling really pulled at.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My time is being demanded and I like to be alone sometimes. I like to read and I'm not being able to do any of those kinds of things. And just feel like - maybe much of it is because I'm leaving in two weeks and I'll be gone. And that may be a lot more of it than anything else. But that kind of demand on myself, like all of my time is kind of disturbing. I don't intend to and I don't want to have to give up all of my independence getting married. I mean my - I know I have a lot of dependencies too but the independent things I feel pretty strong about it. And I guess just this week they sort of really - it's being thrown out that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's like pull back but you're feeling really closed in.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like some of Sarge is setting himself up for being bored, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By sleeping all day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sitting around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he wouldn't have to - at least not so completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like without you he doesn't do anything or very little.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [At least here.] (ph). Yeah, that's really strange. Yeah, I don't know how - last night he went out. They had stag party for Burt and he finally went later in the evening for a while. And that's fine. I didn't care when he came home. I was concerned that he came home. I'm concerned that he didn't get himself totally blitzed drunk because he wouldn't feel very good anyway. And we don't mix when either of us has been drinking a lot. You know, like really drunk-drunk. And he came home at one-thirty and I don't know how drunk he was. I don't think he was very drunk. And I didn't feel bad about not knowing when he was going to come home. And he just became - it was like being totally over concerned. And Daisy said something this morning too that she came in Wednesday night and said he was getting himself bombed. He was drinking rum and coke. So I don't know how much he had to drink but for me - it was a thought that went through my mind Wednesday or Thursday morning when I came home - it occurred to me that he was acting as though he had been drinking. And he said he hadn't. I don't know. I just left before I stopped at home before I came over here. And he came in and he said, "When do we - what do you have to do after this class?" I don't know. And I said, "I have to leave right away because I have to pick this guy up downtown." Just like that. And he started pouting around. I guess I feel a need to deal with that and I just - it's almost like that's intolerable to me. [65:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kind of like it's just too much for you to take all this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. I don't know if it's too much to take but it seems it's just really childish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's annoying you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It really does. Well, it makes me uncomfortable when he won't talk to me. He sits around and ignores me. You know that's really stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It doesn't sound anything like -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No (laughs) It isn't. I don't know if I do that if he does things to make me mad. I guess I'm wondering if I pout.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're as [poutty] (sp?) as -</p>

<p>CLIENT: As that. Maybe I am. I guess I become quiet and don't say anything. And maybe I'm just getting some of my own medicine. But if that's the case then maybe this is all right to happen to recognize that. And then recognize that this just ain't the way we're going to have to deal with things. I just find it unacceptable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well have you tried to sit down and talk with him not about the things he's saying but about how he's being?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not yet because up until today I've tried with deal it by being sensitive -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 67:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And being sensitive about what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you see maybe the more important thing is not the things themselves to deal with because in the long run the state is bigger than the things themselves. And you can see that because it's not like he's reacting proportionately or appropriately to the things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe the way to deal with it I think (inaudible@ 67:39) is not so much with the things they're talking about because their attitude isn't appropriate to the things. It's to talk about why are you being this way? Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that's the more important - in other words, if you ask if you had to measure what's most relevant to him at that time, it's not the content of the thing but how much he's caught up in his emotion about it. Not the specific of you just came home at two or whatever instead of one. There's more there. It's not -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hm. And the way he responds to those feelings. The way they come through. I guess that's sort of the way I began to feel this morning or this afternoon even. That it's the way he's dealing with the emotions and the things that are upsetting. And as I think about it right now, I think, is that the way I also deal with my emotions becoming quiet, pouty, and ignoring him? And if that's true and it may well be, at least somewhat true, that sort of to me suggests a game beginning to develop. And a really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll out-pout you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a really stupid, childish kind of game. Or not that I'll out-pout you but - well yeah I guess it does boil down to that. But also that's going to be the response to being dissatisfied or uncomfortable. [69:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pout not talk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I know it's hard for me to talk like when things get me down or he makes me angry, it's hard to talk. Part of expressing why I'm angry or how it is to deal with the anger and sometimes it's out of trying to deal out whether it's really something I ought to be angry about, if I ought to - if it's something worth bringing up and creating anything out of. Maybe I do that more than I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I kind of sense that it's like [it bothers you in a couple of ways what he's doing. It's bothering you that he's doing it but it kind of raises uncertainties and kind of, "Do I do it too?"] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that just sort of comes to me as we talk here that that may be true. I do that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You know like you can really see how it affects you when he does it, but by God maybe you do it and it affects him.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right. I don't know if it's pouty but like I know certain ways that I can behave to get a response from Don. And 99 percent of the time I'll get the response I want. And I don't know how much of that is when I'm pouty. I've become anxious now thinking about just in terms of, "Man, that's got to be dealt out really quickly." Because I certainly don't want that to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [To just become a way. That would be bad.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like - that's again talking not about the content of the things but sitting down and talking about how we do react to each other when we're pissed about something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And by doing it. By talking about it, it's almost like you're doing the very thing that's the thing to do which isn't it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hm. Right. That initiates responding in a much more -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a different style or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of working something out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wish I could remember more of the stuff that we were saying yesterday morning. Like so many things were said that seemed to bear a lot of weight on the summer and next fall. Things happened really quickly and my memory is so poor like I block things. I don't know whether it's blocking or just I don't remember them all. I guess when - I don't know. I can't remember. I can't put things back together the way they happened. Maybe that was the beginning of really consciously seeing what happened just (inaudible@ 72:41) his ridiculous behavior, just really ridiculous. I don't know if I see more of myself in the kinds of ways he's reacting to things recently. And it may be okay if I recognize that and we can do something. Just recognizing it. You know what sort of bothers me about this is that thing we talked of once before about sometimes I accept the role or take it on of being kind of motherly. And this whole thing of being very childish reacting bothers me very much in the sense of it carrying over into a marriage, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That you'll kind of foster an attitude which will permit him to be childish?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that and if it continues it's going to bug the hell out of me. Childish behavior from Don is very unacceptable to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like the events of the past day kind of makes a question mark when you think about being married and living together. Like is this now or temporary (inaudible) maybe this is the real thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. And the thing I also - I don't feel as though I reacted in a mother kind of way. I don't feel like I took - I feel like I was acting as an adult. When he stormed out of the room Thursday morning - early Thursday morning; like three in the morning - I thought, "This is really silly. This is just really silly." And the thought, "Well, I better go check this out and deal with it." I'm not going to run after that. He has no reason - I mean, he has a reason. The only reason he had to be angry is that I didn't call and let him know I'd be late. Well, I didn't know for one thing how late everything was going to go. I didn't tell him that Gary and I alone went out and had a drink either because I don't want to add that to the fire.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's enough fuel on it already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't really want to - and I feel as though like maybe in a couple of weeks I can share what happened and he'll be able to deal with it in an acceptable way. But I thought, I'm not going to respond that way because he hasn't - I don't understand exactly why he's so upset. I don't think it's totally justified in this kind of ridiculous behavior. And he's also extremely exhausted and decided I've got to - you know? If you came back all right, otherwise I'm going to sleep.] (ph) And off and on I don't think we slept at all. But off and on he would kind of take on a forgiving attitude and pull me close and put his arms around me and be okay. And then we'd talk for a while and I'd say something that - one thing was that he - the anger he verbalized was that I didn't call and let him know anything; that I didn't share anything that was happening. I should call and tell him what was going on. And I said, "I'm sorry that I didn't call." And I don't know how I said it. And I was sorry that I didn't call. On the other hand, I didn't feel it was that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Crucial to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it wasn't so crucial for the kind of anger that he expressed. So he said that of course he didn't believe me. That threw it off again and he got angry again. And again I just decided that it was really kind of silly. And maybe part of that was all that he had drank more than he thought too or maybe he was tired and it affected him more than he thought. [And some of the results came out of that] (ph) I've become very sensitive to - I guess more so he than I - which isn't necessarily going to reactions when we're drinking. And all reactions become more intensified. And we really try to be careful because all they do is they lead to arguments. I mean if we can decide we're going drinking or going to a party and get high and we decide that we're going to deal with each other and we're not going to get angry then it's alright.</p>

<p>Like that party Friday night when we both got rather tipped but we didn't get angry about anything the other was doing. Well we didn't do anything either. But both of us react to one another. I don't react to anybody else like that when I'm drinking. I don't think Don does either. But I'm also very sensitive to the kinds of things like the jumping out of bed and running - that was a drinking reaction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Right. That was an extreme type of ] (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was something that we don't do I don't think when we're sober and reasonable about things. It was so funny and it was so strange. It was a really disturbing kind of thing. And I guess it was more disturbing having some guilt feelings about Gary too for me. That Don really, really evoked guilt feelings for me where they weren't there a week ago or a week and a half ago. I didn't have any guilt feelings. I felt good and comfortable and I didn't feel like I had to be guilty. And he's really made me feel guilty about that. The thing about going camping, I feel like having gotten out some things yesterday like my having gotten out and saying, "I'm going and I'm not feeling guilty because I've planned this. And it's going to create a whole lot more resentment if I don't go." I think it's helped to alleviate the potential for building up guilt feelings for going. I don't feel bad about that either. We bought our tent yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Are you getting all excited?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, wow! Yeah, I'm just getting really excited about it all. Don and I went and bought the tent. It's a really light-weight - it's for backpacking so it'll be really great. Don and I decided that we'll eventually work toward getting one of those real light-weight sleeping bags so we can do that. He was really good. Well, that was after everything got out and he felt much better. And he felt much better that I - he was really vehement about leaving and I think I made him see that that was really stupid. I mean that was - what I was throwing out to him was that's running away from dealing with things. And if I'm not sharing things with you that I ought to be, okay, that's something for us to work on. It's not something to run away from. I know that sometimes it's hard for me to share but - and he felt good about some of the things I'd said. So when we went shopping none of the resentment about going camping came up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Yeah. And we got it set up. We're going to pick up a cooler with S&H stamps. And I just can't wait to get out of that place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you like camping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! Yeah. Just really love it. I've recognized that the camping I've done is relatively civilized. When I was very small camping with my parents was somewhat really camping. And then they got a trailer and it became more and more civilized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've gone back to tent camping. And now I'm really kind of excited about trying to get into doing backpacking. Mostly because there's no place you can go to campgrounds anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you can't go in the car camping anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Yeah, too many places you consider it isn't like in the suburb of ] (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's it there. Betty and I'd kind of like to try it. I don't know if we'll get a chance to but I'm really anxious to do that. Some things that I buy now are aimed in that direction. And we figured we could go up to where Sarge lives in [Manomony] (ph) County, go for days and get lost. And he knows his way enough that we wouldn't be really lost and practice and do it. And I want to go back into the mountains and do that. I think that would be great. It really, really would. So that looks like it's all set up. Yesterday might have helped Sarge deal with the going too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sure it's that. He recognized that it was a lot of things that were coming out. Like his blatant decision that he's leaving and he's not coming back was just needing to express some of that. I guess for a minute my response was to really blow up and, "Go ahead!" you know and respond in the same manner. And I caught myself. And I think if I didn't he may very well have let yesterday and started a whole -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Big explosion?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. A really, really foolish thing. I think I start to get feelings as plans are made for our wedding - I had been engaged to him a year ago and I'd broken that. And I didn't feel bad that I hadn't put an announcement or spread a word. And I wasn't very pleased about the whole thing. So that wasn't - and I thought, "Jesus Christ, if I go along and have this wedding planned and that falls apart," you know it has a lot more ramifications than -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I said, "I'm not letting that get away now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I didn't go through all those hassles for nothing."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) "If I made this decision to put up with you for the rest of my life you're going to put up with me too!" That kind of thing. Are things wrapping up fairly well for you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well I still have more analysis and my data due. And I guess the problem for me is that I haven't had a word on the dissertation. It's not like the mechanics of it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah. Well you'd said you're going to be - where...is it a?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In New Jersey.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it a cottage or a house?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a house. [And it's just that somehow once you leave here it's very hard to write a dissertation and it's starting to make me feel anxious. I realize it's hard to write a dissertation no matter where you are. I know that when people leave they have a harder time but it disturbed me that she said it because it just raised more doubts in my mind.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Last year I took an incomplete. I had a paper to do. And people kept warning me, "You're not going to get it done." And I said, "I have all summer." I never got it done in the summer at all. I didn't get it done until fall. And then you really got to get your mind focused on the intent to get it done. Well, it sounds like you're going to be in an awfully comfortable place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Except that it won't - it's a matter of it's easy to spend time setting up a place and buying furniture.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! That's what I mean. Writing the dissertation becomes even harder as you get comfortable sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I guess I've always been good at when I feel like] (ph) (inaudible8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's what I told myself too. That I'd never - although that this carries a hell of a lot more weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)I don't know. Every thought I had was of dissertation stuff. It's just too big a thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I think the key is that a lot of what happens is that people make it bigger than it should be.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. Probably very true. I'm sure I would do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And we should keep the perspective of it's just a book.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's a good attitude. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) To keep yourself in that attitude is great. If it all piles up - are you going to be all-alone all summer?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's good. She may not be helpful to getting your dissertation done though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's true but she'll be going to school and so....</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's cool. That sounds like a really neat thing. Wow! We were talking about getting our farmhouse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what we wanted but I couldn't find one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well New Jersey is different than most.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's not quite -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not much rural area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are some farmhouses but they are very hard to get.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're not too difficult to get in Wisconsin. We decided that we should live alone for a little while just for ourselves. I have more and more people vowing to come up to spend time with us. We may not be alone as much as we want to. It may just become a big hotel for people. But I really think that would be great. I look forward to doing that. And just being in wider spaces than Chicago. And the last couple of days with the pollution and all, it's really getting to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. [I was up in Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago] (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's so - to be in a place where it's quiet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I know. Like on this farm I woke up - and that was the thing - early morning or anytime that was the most amazing thing. How quiet it was. There were no cars. [Occasionally you hear a tractor.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's such a different sound that it's really nice to hear. I-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Just a lot of deer and birds] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One thing I want to do this summer - I don't know if I'll be very successful - hopefully I will be stopping and camping at places for a week at a time. And I want to get myself adjusted to relaxing. I get going and I have to move all the time. I can't sit still. And I can't even deal with boredom. ]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [It's like you're traveling under any kind of momentum. You're kind of leaving yourself behind somewhere along the way.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I want to just learn to sit and deal with being bored and enjoy it. And get myself to thinking again instead of always having things mapped out, "This is what you're going to think about and this is the time slot for it." And I figure there's going to be times when I'll be bored doing that. And I really want to work hard on it. Last summer when I took off for a couple of weeks and went out East, there was nothing to do. And I came back and I was relaxed. And it didn't take more than a couple of weeks before things were just going again. Part of it is the momentum of the whole city that does that. So I'm hoping Milwaukee if I can find a nice leisurely job - we may be living on public aid if I don't find a job. (laughs) Which wouldn't be bad. It'd be a new experience. I worked for the department of public aid last summer and it's a strange experience. I often thought what living on that kind of assistance would be like. Wow! ]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I hope everything goes good. I hope you get your dissertation written.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope so. I fully intend to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sure you will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I hope your summer goes well and you have a good time. You should.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope you don't grow tired of traveling. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope not either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [After a couple of rainy days, you might get fed up.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well but that's okay.</p>

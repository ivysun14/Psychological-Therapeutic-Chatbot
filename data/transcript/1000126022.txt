<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 16. Interview 16. ...so fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I (inaudible at 0:00:05.0). I had a day yesterday, the most unbelievable day. Probably the worst day I have had since I had, (inaudible at 0:00:17.3) I've had since I had the abortion. I just, I was part of (inaudible 0:00:24.5) training thing, you know,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want to stick it in?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. The training thing you (inaudible at 0:00:30.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no this was - oh maybe I haven't told you I thought I had, but Gary-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:00:34.1) social work [you know] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah of course, that is social work [always] (PH) people. Gary, a guy I'm (inaudible 0:00:44.9), who I work with - what about three weeks ago offered me an opportunity to work with some other workers doing in-service training for teachers in  (PH).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For where?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In (PH), sort of around a direct use program although, the little amount information it gives doesn't necessarily have to focus on that. Because one of my concerns with that I certainly [wasn't] (PH) an expert in drug use and I felt that my knowledge is just to limited, really to (inaudible at 0:01:21.4). So, and it was worth $65 and I actually jumped at the opportunity, and nothing, you know like, I knew that I was going to do this but we didn't receive any further information about it. Tuesday, Gary got letters for both of us just confirming the fact that this was taking place. And it ran - we were to meet with all the trainers at 10:30 in the morning. Meet with a group of ten teachers from one to four, individually one person to each group, one to four and seven to ten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This was yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we get there at 10:30 in the morning, and the kind of orientation they had set up for us wasn't very helpful in the sense of really - I came with a few ideas of kinds of things to do with groups. But I, you know, I felt somewhat inadequate to begin with I didn't know exactly was to come. When we get there, to find out these are a group of extremely hostile teachers, who were forced to come, it was compulsory to be at these meetings, this workshop, this afternoon, this evening. That very few of them had any real sensitivity to the kids, now what they wanted to do is focus on teacher attitudes, personal attitudes and values and of course as they relate to working with kids. 0:02:58.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is what the teachers wanted to do but not their leaders who...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this is what we were supposed to do with this group of teachers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, but they were all hostile people and like they didn't want to be here and, so you go into this thing, knowing all these people hate the hell, like, to be there. Don't know who the hell you are. The goals that set up were extremely vague. I went in, for a group of eleven, there were eleven in my group, and there were five people under 40. One, probably between 25-30 and the others were under 25 of that five. There was one in the entire group that appeared to have any potential for really understanding what this was all about. But the information that they had received really didn't explain what the workshop was going to be about at all. Some people thought it was to talk about drug education. So they thought I was going to be an expert and give, just poor knowledge into them. The rest of them had been given another story. The whole school system -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it was well organized. 0:04:16.9</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - it was like the whole school system from fifth grade through senior high school. Well part of it was organized and perhaps the most essential part was not organized and that was really, exactly, you know, what-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: What was supposed to happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What kinds of expectations to have, some intentions in this group. And I came in and I was really nervous and I shared this with them and said I, and had - finally over lunch been able to put together some things I thought would be useful towards looking at themselves, you know. And I came in and I told them who I was. Told them I was a teacher and I worked part-time at the YMCA. I didn't tell them I was a student at that time, and then I said that, you know, I felt some anxiety about what was going on. I wasn't exactly positive about what they had expected and I said, "I had some ideas in my own mind of what we want to accomplish today. And I am kind of nervous. I don't know any of you" you know. 0:05:27.5</p>

<p>So, I set up, I asked them to just go around the room and just say their name and why they were there. And every one of them said, "Because, I was forced to be here." Then I decided I would use this, kind of, exercise toward getting acquainted. I didn't-you know they said they were sort of acquainted but not very well acquainted - and kind of look at what kind of feelings they brought into the group and what expectations they had. And they do this by individually and then pairing up and then going into a group of four. Well I had to participate in this because there were eleven in the group. So I picked out this one woman, she was sitting there; she must have been about forty -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this the kind of exercise where you, you talk to someone and find out about them and then you talk about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, you can do that; I just gave them a task, of expressing, sharing with each other about what they were feeling about having to be here. Because I knew there was going to be a lot of resistance and I wanted them to start talking about that. Damn did those people resisted the whole day, without really being able to express very much beyond the fact that they didn't want to be here. 0:06:40.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think they were closed from the beginning and never even got past that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what I also, I picked this woman out, she was sitting there, she had made no attempt to talk to anyone so I went and sat down with her. "First of all I think you picked wrong terms. Anxiety, I have no anxiety about being here." Well, no she was calmer than that. "I haven't got any anxiety about being here, a meeting's a meeting. Maybe you have anxiety, but I don't have any anxiety." Okay, I just "You young people, youth today." Then she started doing the, shit I wish I had gray hair. You know I wore a dress and I guess I should have worn something down to my ankles, dang. And I really felt that resistance throughout the day with most of these older people. 0:07:31.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like pulling teeth the whole day and just feeling awful because you couldn't see any kind of effect you were having on them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh Scott, absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like no reinforcement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing, absolutely nothing happened. Oh I was just so drained, well we took a break and there was one administrator in my group. Quarter to three, "Time to take a break." I was in the middle of a sentence, and I - it became increasingly difficult, there was one asshole who thought he -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like, sounds like an ordeal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah there was one guy who thought he knew it all [drinking] (PH). So I took a break, came back, and got more and more uptight. I almost fainted I have never been through an experience like that in my life. And so the evening session five people didn't come back, six people didn't come back. They said they weren't coming back. And that was a positive exclusion. There was no movement, the only movement I thought that came all day was this one guy who had potential, finally in the evening he was able to become a little more verbal about identifying with what kind of situations students are in as well as teachers. That really can happen. It was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a little light in the (inaudible at 0:08:43.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Barrenness] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was an extremely difficult thing; it was the first time I had done, been involved in that kind of experience. One other guy who was leading another group, and I think I was probably the youngest member of the trainers and the only -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How many trainers were there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were ten. 0:09:04.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did everyone have the same kind of experience?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I became aggravated like the. As I recalled this morning, I was the last one to get the list of my group. And what I finally figured out is that the two people that developed the program put it together and tried to divide up so that there were some good positive people and some - recognizing that there could be some very negative people. And I got a group that they didn't know anything about. It was the last group that they put together. And I really feel as if they knew very few of the people in that group. And so I feel like I really got shoved with a group of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Losers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well they didn't know. They had no idea of what I was getting stuck with. There was one other guy that had a very difficult time. I was also the only female but that really wasn't any thing, I don't think. And one of the people who organized it reacted violently by almost all of the teachers. She is a teacher herself and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of felt stacked against.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Others were very resistant to her, anything that she would be involved in, you know. And I guess I came away from it, one thing I have a lot of trouble with during the year is that I haven't had a lot of success with groups this year. Least not as much as I had last year, you know. But I think I recognize that yesterdays experience, you know, wasn't - I can look and see some things I could have done better, you know. But I really, I think I can confidently say also, that it was really stacked against me. To have been successful would've -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had been thrown into just things, which you had no control over; they're all negative. 0:10:57.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I lost control in the afternoon anyway, at the end, I think the only thing that could have been positive if I had had more experience I might have had a better chance at getting to something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a higher tolerance level. When you say you lost control, what is that, you got mad at them or flustered?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh after the break I lost the, kind of, agenda, the kinds of things I had to fall back on to use. Well then, of course, they reacted violently to the exercise. That was a real wrong move. Well the first wrong move was to tell them I was anxious, and then to suggest that any of them had any anxiety. Although later you know, the anxieties came out. And I said something but they couldn't recognize, they didn't hear a damn word I said all day. 0:11:52.1</p>

<p>Well after the break the frustration just really fell on me, and the - one of the program developers came and sat in, [and that] (PH) made me very nervous because I didn't know her. So I couldn't feel, you know, I felt more being watched-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Watched.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - than I did feeling that she was just observing out of interest. That added to that they just took off and I couldn't pull together anything that, that I lost control. They just overwhelmed me in that. They started talking about drugs. I couldn't pull anything together. I just got more and more uncomfortable and I had a difficult time listening to anything they had to say, because I was trying to think of what the hell can I do, you know. 0:12:38.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of panicked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, panicked, you know. I really almost fainted and I sat there and I wasn't hearing what was going on, because I was trying to pull myself into some resemblance of control. And it was just awful, just absolutely awful, God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were sitting there kind of feeling it coming were you just feeling hums?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jesus, yeah. It was so terrible. In the evening one of the guys who was - there was a man and a woman that were put together - and he had expressed a desire to be in a group so I asked if he, and he said - he knew that I had a really bad group so he asked if he could come in. He's a social worker also. And I thought yeah, and I thought it would be positive and I said to him, before I said, "I may rely on you for awhile just to take it, because I need to gain some comfort back into this thing" and that was really disappointing. He was not helpful. The only thing he was helpful in was his presents helped me gain comfort and then I could move into something and - but he was not helpful at all in terms of direction and in terms of pursuing things. We didn't work - that was not helpful. It didn't add at all. So even the evening was not...0:13:58.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a miserable day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh wow.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: (Inaudible at 0:14:01.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was it? It was just really annoying though. That wasn't the end of the day. This is something I want to talk about and it's kind of difficult. I don't know where I'm at with it, I have to preface a little of this because I'm -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it feels uneasy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel very good on one hand and feel very, somewhat uncomfortable, somewhat guilty on the other hand. Gary and I drove out together and we stopped on the way back and, for a drink, you know, and I think our relationship has been growing closer, particularly since I have shared a real crisis. Much of our relationship hasn't revolved around, I think I'd said that that it was the first time I think that I had reall -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Been giving from yourself, things about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and really shared something serious about me. And he's expressed before, you know, physical sexual attraction to me. And we've dealt with it through joking and all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of been recognized but kind of just left there to keep him out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: [In the past] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I hadn't begun to really look at that, except perhaps in the last week and a half, and began to really recognize that I have a sexual attraction to him. But when I - I guess I don't think about it, you know. Like I block it, and I don't deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just like your eyes; you don't let your eyes open to letting yourself feel that sexual attraction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like it's very frightening to me. I'm not, you know, I'm not sure of my feelings, I'm not sure about the control, I'm not sure about my emotions, and I guess I felt some tension last night. In that, you know, we've been through a real - he had a group that was much more successful. But for all of the six hours, it was a hell of a long time anyway, you know. So the whole day was exhausting whether you had a successful group or not. And we'd been hashing through that and sitting in some silence. And he's able to deal with, and recognize, and accept, his feelings towards me, you know, and like I had a -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 0:17:05.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, right. And so we were sitting there and he finally said, you know, "You're a very hard person to get to know." And I know that, and it made me really uncomfortable. 0:17:23.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He knew HE was disarming you. That he had that effect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I didn't know what to say I said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it has the effect of let's open this door.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, like it was hard to sit there and look him in the eye, because I got a sense for where I was afraid that I was going with the way I felt, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were hearing him say lets come this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not necessarily he was just - I don't think he was saying that as much as he was saying he wanted to talk about the way we, our relationship was. And he recognizes where he is at and he deals with it, or at least he deals with in joking but he at least he recognizes that, and he accepts it. He doesn't fight it and I thought [what a] (PH) - and I guess I knew that he dealt with it. And so that I wasn't sure, like I wasn't sure where this was all going. In terms of could I be comfortable going to bed with him, even though I had thoughts about it. 0:18:40.5</p>

<p>So we sat and we were talking about, well I know what I said, it was "Yeah I know it is hard to get to know me" I said I really floundered around for a long time because I wasn't sure of what I was thinking, what I was feeling and it was kind of a struggle for what I was feeling or trying to express it. And perhaps he was giving me an opportunity to recognize how I felt. And I hadn't, you know, as I said before, I put a block toward it and I don't think about it. And he said - and I guess I feel like much of what happened last night was a result of our separating you know and having to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having to not leave quite the way it was. 0:19:33.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and having the relationship really building in the last month and a half, it's really growing. So we talked and I finally was able to say I guess, you know, I care a lot about you. And I guess I begin to recognize that I have feelings beyond the relationship that exists right now, you know, a working relationship, caring relationship. I guess I felt it was a really big move for me to give and share with you the experience I went through three or four weeks ago. That I want to do it, but to have done it was a really big move for me. I felt that it was a positive move. And I said to him I guess - and our joking about sex has become increased in the last couple weeks. We've always done that I mean it's always been there. But it's really become more intense, and I was finally able to say you know, "Yes, I'm afraid of the way I feel, I'm afraid of my emotions, because I'm not sure about them." And I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what to do with them. 0:21:01.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I said, I told him that, you know, about coming here and I said that I wasn't sure that, and I said that I went in with the intention that I, that I was troubled about my emotions and feeling them and understanding them, or just being able to deal with them. And I wasn't sure that I would really come anyplace without. Although as I sat there and saw myself being able to look at them and deal with them, and I recognize that. Yeah I guess I have moved, and I said "It's frightening for me to start looking at those emotions."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I said</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were doing it you said it was frightening. 0:21:44.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really was and I said, "I've begun to sense, you know feeling a physical, sexual, attraction to you. And I've blocked it and I don't think about it." He wasn't sure he understood what that meant. And I said "Well I don't know I guess it's that when an emotion becomes frightening to me". As I guess I, as I was saying it, and as I say it now it becomes apparent to me too, that's what I do with my emotions. You know feelings that become threatening I just block them out. And I said some of it was that, well I said that you know. I got that out and we kind of talked about different kinds of things in relation to emotions and stuff. I don't know. He said something about his parents and about, I'm not sure about what he said, I'm not sure I understood it completely. And then I began to think of the really neat things I felt right then were about, that having any kind of a relationship with a man has been difficult. And I think that what has been most frightening is that there is a fear of having any kind of a close relationship with a man involves having these sexual relationships. 0:23:21.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of, not so much the relationship with a man; I mean I know it's a problem but what it could lead to, and being able to handle that, and having some kind of troublesome feelings about you and sex with a man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I felt good, really good about having come as close to Gary as I have. And I know we talked for a while longer and about this, I'll probably come back to it I just want to move for a second. We left there and we were in  (PH) and still had to go to [Albany] (PH). And I'd been sitting on the other side of the car, - well I had some stuff in the middle, I moved it and I moved over closer to him. And he put his arm around me and we drove back that way. And I felt good and I felt comfortable and I also felt uncomfortable, somewhat guilty. 0:24:34.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It felt comfortable when you were right there but you felt uncomfortable when you looked at yourself there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I felt comfortable in the sense that I care about Gary, and I'm physically attracted to him. And I was feeling good at being able to feel that and allow myself to express it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you feeling guilty out of respect to Don or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was feeling guilty because, and I am comfortable, I still wasn't sure where this was going, and I wasn't sure where I could let it go. 0:25:06.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you wanted to let it go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I felt guilty about Don, I felt guilty about Gary's wife, and not being sure if this was - even though the feelings that I felt were really right. The old moralistic thing you know and we talked about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Monogamy and all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and we talked about that in the car and it was, and those things are really ingrained in me really deep. Even though I intellectually don't agree with those things they're really deep inside. And it's hard to overcome them. And we finally got back to Albany and we stopped the car, and Gary kissed me. And my discomfort increased, because also suggestive, you know, of having stopped at the bar and driving back was also suggesting not to go back to Albany at all. You know but to stop someplace for the night. And my discomfort was that I knew that I wasn't ready to deal with that. 0:26:35.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it was too much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so I said I was uncomfortable and he felt uncomfortable with that. And certainly didn't want to leave with my being uncomfortable. And wanting to, I guess I see us wanting to kind of work it out one way or another or at least begin to or at least get some-I began to feel-you don't know what you're getting your self into, because in some ways, I began to feel where I'm really f**ked up. And it's in dealing with sex, and dealing with emotions. And I began to feel like I'm not sure I want you to have to deal with that now. 0:27:28.8</p>

<p>And he didn't understand the uncomfortable ness exactly, and I wasn't sure how to express it, you know, I wasn't sure how to say it. And I said, I guess I said I felt somewhat guilty. And I think he was afraid that I was really rejecting him, that my feelings weren't, that he'd kind of opened himself up, and opened himself up to suggesting. And he had said in the bar more blatantly than ever before that he wanted to go to bed with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of thought that he might be taking it like, he was saying look lets go to bed and then you were giving positive signs and then saying no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and rejecting it and I started feeling that it was more than that just rejecting the relationship that we had. I guess what really hurts me right now is that I can do that, you know. And I'm afraid that, I guess I'm afraid that - well let me finish and I think that I can come back to it because it's in the...0:28:44.7</p>

<p>So he suggested that we go for a ride and talk about it. And he suggested we go in my car and I'm not sure why he'd do that except that that was a station wagon and that maybe suggested more comfort, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh your car is a station wagon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No my car is a VW; his is the station wagon (laughing).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to be hard to do anything if it is done in the car (laughter) I got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I don't know, I'm not sure why -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:29:14.1) and let's talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm not sure why he suggested my car except that that occurred to me and it didn't make much difference. So we took my car and we drove for a while. And we stopped in this park and talked for a while. And I had all sorts of really good feelings, you know, it was like being desired and all. It was really nice. And I felt very much like a woman and I was really excited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel good inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I began to feel really good about it. An opportunity like this existed once before for me, although I wasn't half as close to the man. He was married and at that time I was going with Don and of course I wasn't taking birth control pills and I had a really big block about being pregnant which completely stopped anything, you know. But the opportunity existed. But my [guilt] (PH) feelings were very strong about the fact that he was married. And the relationship didn't mean anything except physical ness. At that time it didn't. 0:30:32.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:30:31.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was very different. And what was exciting to me, or is exciting to me, is that I care about Gary, and I can recognize though - on the same hand - that my love for him is different than my love for Don. You know, and I can recognize, what I couldn't recognize at the time that this other guy had said that he loves his wife very much and he has a tremendous relationship with her, you know. But he was very comfortable in having a sexual relationship (inaudible at 0:30:59.9). But what was here is that, you know, I could recognize that I know Gary has a good thing with his wife and his family, a very caring loving relationship. I know his wife and she is very, very different than any of the women Gary deals with in his work. And that our love is really different than that, it's a working, it's a co-working relationship, peer relationship, love relationship that's close and is more than that. And I was excited about recognizing that and that. 0:31:37.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Recognizing that you have it and you let yourself feel it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I had -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were dealing with your emotions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I have, still have some guilt feelings about Don and about his wife but, they're not nearly as overwhelming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the good feeling of beginning to deal with that (inaudible at 0:31:55.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's kind of the guilt feelings kind of in a way, they're there and you feel bad but it's kind of even better because despite those rules I can still let myself have him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I talked about some of this, you know and some of what I was feeling was very confused, and because I was very comfortable with Gary, and caring for him. And I'm still unsure about where things were going last night, but at that point I was still comfortable. I was uncomfortable about the guilt that I had about what we were doing and I guess it does relate to Don and Claire, almost in that overpowering kind of thing. And it was also comfortable because I felt very close to him, that he really at least, someone else who was beginning to or did understand me and I could share with.0:33:13.1</p>

<p>And so we stopped there for awhile and started making out. and like me tell you is just really silly, we were laughing and I felt so funny, because I haven't done that kind of thing since I've been in college you know it was so silly. I mean, we were in the God damn Volkswagen. It was so silly. It was really funny, really is funny. And we were really kind of enjoying that and just kind of being at peace with being together and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just being there with each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I guess I kind of made a decision driving there and stopping there to be comfortable and not to stop the thinking, you know not to put the block in front. And I tried to explain that to Gary more, you know. You know what I mean. And he understood after I talked for a while. It was very hard - I guess, you know, I was so confused that I wasn't sure anymore about my physical attraction to him because it was there, you know, being able to fulfill itself. It was so safe at a distance and Gary always; I guess I always trusted his kind of, the line of safety that existed. In the joking about it, and always trusted that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right (inaudible at 0:34:47.4) broken parts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I couldn't say that to he that there was a part of me that was really empty because I was, you know, I was a little unsure of the physical attraction because of the -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because (inaudible at 0:35:07.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really right there and I was scared of it. And I was uncomfortable with being frightened about it. We stayed there for a while and then we decided, you know, we better get going home. And left it there, you know, just really left it there. And I guess where I am at now; you know two things that are most troubling to me. One is - and as I begin to think about it I'm not sure how troubling it is - but one is that I'm still very frightened about going to bed with Gary. Because I'm still scared of sex in a lot of ways, and scared of my own fulfillment in a sexual relationship, and scared of him knowing that, too. 0:36:14.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Know that about you, that sex is problematic for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's he going to think of you after all this, he knows you in a way now that he is going to see that sex is a problem for you, you want to be sexual satisfying and you don't want him to know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah because he has expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'll be seen not to live up to those expectations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he makes me feel as though I can be very sensuous. And I know I can be that way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) you can be sensuous, but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty you don't really fulfill the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the thing is it's for me it's not fulfilling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could be (inaudible at 0:36:57.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that scares me a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it won't be fulfilling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I, you know and it's so troubling because I enjoy sex but I don't come out of it having been fully satisfied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right you enjoy it but it's not, kind of like that ultimate (inaudible at 0:37:27.5) release, kind of, glow-y feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's very frightening because I can't say that to him, I'm sure I couldn't say that to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you have to say that to him? 0:37:46.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm not sure I'd have to, you know, on one hand I feel as though I want to pursue it and see what happens, you know. Although being uptight about it limits, you know, doesn't help me relax towards -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Towards pursuing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's one thing that is very troubling to me, because in a lot of ways I really do want to pursue that. And I don't think I feel bad about it at all. 0:38:31.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of sense, it's like it's not guilt or anything like that. You really would like to go pursue it, you know, go to bed with Gary, if it were only not for the hang up about -</p>

<p>CLIENT: The doubt I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - doubting the sexual fulfillment and being fulfilled, it's kind of like, it's not the situation, it's not Gary, and it's not Don.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really kind of you and sex.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That and that doubt is really built up inside of me, to the extent that no matter what the circumstances, no matter how relaxed I can possibly be, it's, kind of, deep inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you say what you mean by that doubt is built up in you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to the extent that Don and I've been sleeping together and been having sexual intercourse together for three years and I've never had an orgasm when we've had intercourse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you ever had an orgasm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah and that's not the problem, trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The problem is having an orgasm during intercourse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you can't have one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I guess it's built up to the extent that Don is a very good lover and I didn't see that there should be any reason that I should be fulfilled by having sexual intercourse with any other man. Because it isn't Don at all. 0:40:26.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. It's you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's me yeah. And the doubt, builds up is that the fact is there and toward overcoming it, is like really tight inside. You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that sounds like that's the problem in a way it's the problem is worrying about the problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you are having intercourse with him do you think about coming, am I going to cum?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes more so than others, because sometimes I really expect fulfillment, because I'm really enjoying myself very much. 0:41:30.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So but what it sounds like there is-kind of like-you kind of have reactive, having intercourse is kind of like it's always there like I'm not going to be fulfilled or worrying about being fulfilled but it's kind of always there. It's not like your just there physically and emotionally. There's always this other stuff in there, I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, say that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like when your f**king-excuse my -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No that's OK I use it all the time. (Laugh)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like your not just there purely, emotionally, and physically, because, kind of, with you is this self knowledge or, can't have an orgasm. Am I going to have one, you know, it can take different forms. Kind of like the very act of having that is your worst enemy. That's what makes you not happy probably. Do you understand that? 0:42:32.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because once people start worrying if they're going to have an orgasm, they can't have an orgasm it's just a rule in sex. I mean, it just is. It's a fact of life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's it. And you know it's like, I guess I can't get rid of that block.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does knowing that that's what it is make you feel any different to you in terms of like seeing what you are doing to yourself? Do you see what I mean? It's like, my God, if I could just, it's precisely because I put it up as a block, it is a block. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got to just stop the vicious circle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that though, I know that, or at least, I'm not sure how much I know. I intellectually believe that the block is the block. A mental block is what is causing my not having an orgasm. 0:43:36.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it's, kind of, a little more subtle than that. It's kind of like the block has evolved the base, but it's become self sustaining. Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I can't get rid of it. And I can't get rid of the block and I know, or at least on one hand I know that that may be the cause. On the other hand I'm not sure that's the cause either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there might be something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could it be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (Laugh) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing is, let me just say, the thing is sure there can be all kinds of other reasons for having the block. I mean it's your development, it's your previous experiences with sex or what ever, conditions to your attitude towards sex, but there can be all sorts of reasons for why it is but the fact that it is, is what is making it so. Do you understand what I mean? 0:44:33.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not because something happened to you when you were three, that's preventing you from having an orgasm, it might in part help contributing to what helped to build the block.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not that relevant, do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I mean I've gone through trying to attribute, trying to understand why I have the block I have just in terms of trying to get rid of the block and just relax and not let that enter, get it out of my mind, my body everything, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:45:09.2) exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just always there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have no idea where it ever comes from. I know I've had an, you know my bringing up was an extremely ridged one, you know, sex is bad all that crap. But I recognize that so I don't see why that should have any - you know I'm not sure that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:45:40.8) you can understand things but it doesn't make much difference, it happens all the time. Homosexuals who want to be heterosexuals know why they are homosexuals but often it doesn't, unless you really (inaudible at 0:45:52.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and my experiences with sex has been, you know, good I mean they haven't been the kind that help sustain that block that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know that it's kind of like they've been good but it'll only take one experience of F**king and coming that'll change that, they've been good but they haven't been the experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. 0:46:27.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See in a way it's the knowledge that can be different, you don't know, that you yourself can physically have an orgasm in intercourse, which has probably changed the whole thing. I mean you may not have one every time you have it but probably over time more and more. But it's like because you don't know, because you think, because you have in your mind that I don't know if I can, is what (inaudible at 0:46:58.6) one time from coming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think that's true. Yeah, that's it, so what I know that. And that's what almost increases it is because I know that. And I guess that Don is an extremely understanding person. And he does - you know our being together and all he's understanding and he's gentleness and all, you know, we really worked toward overcoming the block I've got.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Optimal in terms of the two of you it's ideal for getting rid of it. (Inaudible at 0:47:54.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, and that kind of almost sort of, probably I guess may increase the block.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you feel more (inaudible at 0:48:07.0) then, this is a block with a capital B. And it kind of makes you feel more so like this is always going to be a problem. I just can't have an orgasm when I am having intercourse. See that's, there really is a difference; there are people that can have an orgasm in any variety in physical activity. I mean that's a different problem than what your saying because it's not like you have never had an orgasm. You just haven't had one while f**king.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so it leads me to think that it's not a hang up about having orgasms. It's something, it's almost something that has been setup, I can f**k him but I can't have orgasms that makes it so. 0:49:00.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, what I've done also - and I know that this just makes it worse for me - and I don't do this all the time, but it occurs to me as we spend time talking about it is that I extend that inadequacy, kind of in connection with the other things about myself that I don't feel very good about. And almost as though I've put absolutely everything on having orgasm in sexual intercourse</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:49:37.4) it's like you think; my God I can't have an orgasm, when I am having intercourse. I'm just such a lousy person, really inadequate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now I'm not sure if that's true anymore. I haven't thought of that in an awfully long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it would certainly make you feel a hell of a lot better about your self if you had did have an orgasm, put it that way, it can help here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, that's exactly true, although other things have -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:50:11.5) generalized other things. Do you feel good about that? Just like in a way, you know, like I sensed when you were talking about being able to feel those feelings for Gary and expressing it, you really felt happy and it just kind of makes you feel good about your self, in a more general way. You know it's kind of when you feel something good about your self it just does generalize to the way feel about the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right, it does. And I guess what I wanted to say too, is that I think that through this year and I think through our talking that I probably feel better about myself and can accept and deal with some of the things I have in the past felt somewhat inadequate about. So then I'm not so sure how much I any longer relate generally. 0:51:08.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like making much more (inaudible at 0:51:11.9) it's self, it's still really, really disturbs you about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that I think, Scott, is the very thing, that's the real reason that I ended up coming here, because that became more and more difficult to accept.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, one more now it's just too hard to accept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well or I have moved to a point of I've got to do something about that. 0:51:49.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see it's kind of like, you know I'm feeling pretty good about a lot of things but this is still there. And I just don't want it there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel futile and I feel inadequate and all that kind of thing because nothing positive happens in relation to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of sense that when you came here it wasn't like that was the explicate reason. When you talked about sex really once specifically and kind of felt very uncomfortable about it. And didn't bring it up again, till now. I remember sensing when you talked about it, and talking about it now, much less (inaudible at 0:52:40.4) comfortableness then the other time. You know it's a different level than (inaudible) but-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't feel-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: It's kind of, it's hard for you to really deal with it, you really want to but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's a difficult thing to deal with and I do feel much more comfortable about it, part of it is I feel much more comfortable with you, you know, I don't know what else goes into it. 0:53:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that is something that we should be dealing with, I mean in (inaudible at 0:53:15.5), because I can just see it, that it really, just kind of, really just feel like I got to solve it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I feel that very much, really, really, really very much. As you suggest maybe we should pursue it, I'm at a loss to know where to pursue, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean there are a whole lot of feelings that are connected with sex generally. There certainly connected, you know, what goes on in your mind, when your f**king? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean just in terms of talking about the kinds of things that do go on in my mind?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:54:04.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess one thing that I recognize is that it takes a long time for me to get really turned on. And just get really excited. And of course I've grown in enjoying sex a lot more than I once did. I feel more comfortable with it, excited about it, anxious. Whereas, you know, maybe a year ago or so Don had to be the initiator of any time we were going to go to bed, or in bed having intercourse anything. And it isn't so anymore sometimes I just really want to go to bed. 0:55:24.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You looked - I'm going to stop you, but you looked embarrassed when you said excited. "I find it exciting." And kind of when you said, "Now I can take the initiative." It's kind of like sex (inaudible at 0:55:33.5) embarrassed about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe but, I'm not sure that, in itself, is as embarrassing as not, you know, it's just the whole issue is difficult for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see it's kind of the embarrassment, not about it, but about talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that - talking about any part of it is hard. The - what we've talked about so far you know I'm sort of amazed at the comfort I felt in being able to talk about it. But it's still hard though you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure yeah, I'm sorry I should see the embarrassment as embarrassment about -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and not so much, any one part of any -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So much as the embarrassment about talking about sex. But can you see that it is almost very embarrassing talking about it. The (inaudible at 0:56:38.4) in a way, in a way overcoming embarrassment about talking about it can also have an effect when dealing with it when your f**king? Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think that's probably true, because it's hard for me. I just don't talk about sex to people, Don, you know, that's it. Because we're very comfortable and he understands me very well, you know. And I begin to relate to my roommate and kind of a strange thing I, - I don't think it's completely off the subject - last year as I was getting acquainted with Jill, she come over one night and got off talking about several affairs she'd had. Talking about it rather comfortably and in an almost bragging kind of way and I just didn't make much input, you know, or very little. And feeling as though I couldn't talk any further about it and I couldn't tell her it was like a guilt in having to say that the only man I have really had sexual intercourse with is Don. I couldn't say that at all. 0:58:08.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I kind of sense, kind of like do you have kind of the feeling though I haven't quite - I don't know I was going to say I'm kind of sexually abnormal, or I just can't be as free about sex, I haven't slept with people like other people have, (inaudible at 0:58:25.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that doesn't bother me, but I feel abnormal. You know, I don't feel very normal, but it doesn't bother me that I haven't had a lot of sexual relationships. The potential of having a sexual relationship with Gary's, you know, kind of exciting, you know. Because I have often thought of wanting to do that but never being able. 0:58:52.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost but the reason of not being able to kind of I sense has been, I've wanted it but my sexual abnormality is cutting it off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well see I've always had the excuse that I was never taking it, I never had any, wasn't taking birth control pills or any real contraception. You know, so I always had an excuse, you know. And in the back of my mind the thought of feeling somewhat inadequate about sex was there. But I always had an excuse. I didn't have to deal with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's [kind of] (PH) the excuse (inaudible at 0:59:22.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I don't have that excuse anymore either. Well to go on with what I was going to say about Jill. As we've lived together this year and Kevin moved in-and I guess I, you know, from that one conversation I had, you know, suspected that Jill was comfortable with sex and really enjoying sex [and was very free about it] (PH). Or not very free, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:59:57.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, comfortable. No trouble with it. And sometime during the year, you know, she was talking about Kevin, you know, to the extent of, you know, (inaudible at 1:00:11.8) say something about "Sex, sex, sex that's all you ever think about, sex" you know. And I had never thought about her, you know, ever being disturbed about having too much sex or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it was because she just [must] (PH) you know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but (inaudible at 1:00:25.2) the first time she went out with him she went to bed with him, you know, which is OK, you know. If you wanted to do that you can do that. I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't see yourself [do that] (PH). 1:00:36.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could never do that. I mean I really couldn't. I wouldn't want to. I mean I don't have that physical need to have sex with anybody I run into. I don't know like we never-it never went any further about talking about it except that, you know, the recognition of her not always being comfortable having sex, was good to hear in a way. Like, now Daisy, you know, has never slept with anyone, or had sexual intercourse with anyone-well she's never said that explicitly, I know that's true. And she has a lot of hang ups about sex, too. And I know that. To the extent that I know that I can share with her that thought that I have hang ups about sex, but I can't go beyond that. 1:01:27.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, kind of like you just (inaudible at 1:01:29.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I can -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the feeling there kind of like I can't share this with people because they're going to think I'm just a real (inaudible at 1:01:43.7)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, part of it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of embarrassed, kind of like sleeping with Gary, [who maybe] (PH) he'd see you as inadequate; you don't want to be seen as inadequate. You just don't want people to think that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see [it] (PH) just can't help you think that where you're wrong [and what's] (PH) messing up is the thinking of yourself abnormal. You know, that's a big mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and in part I know that, or at least I know it, you know, intellectually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are millions of Daisy's in the world. There are millions of [yous] (PH) in the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but they're not me, I'm, you know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't say that to-but that doesn't really help at all because that doesn't help me -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want a different (inaudible at 1:02:38.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - eliminate the block I have. Yeah. And I don't want to be that way. And, you know, I can say with peace -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just finish (inaudible at 1:02:50.7) what I'm suggesting to you is that the thing about the block may be in part because you do think of yourself as abnormal [that helps] (PH) the block. You understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you didn't think of yourself as abnormal you might not [find] (PH) yourself blocked. 1:03:07.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess my response, or at least my immediate response, you know, Scott, is I've thought of that, you know. I really have. But I still feel inadequate and abnormal. And it may be, you know, I guess one thing feeds into it is that Don is very sexual and very viral, you know. And even the fact that for a long time he was sterile didn't really help me feel more adequate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of like his very (inaudible at 1:03:48.1) just wanting to have sex, sex, sex, sex -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, (laughter).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - just made you feel (inaudible at 1:03:57.3) he's so much more and I just can't seem to (inaudible) boy I'm pretty lousy, you know. Not being, you know, a -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the thing, yeah and the thing of it is that, or, you know, one thing of it is that yes, he's very physical and I keep telling him he's got a one track mind a lot of the time. That doesn't bother me at all anymore, you know. You know, I rather enjoy it, but-I forgot what I was going to say (laughter). 1:04:33.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it something about (inaudible at 1:04:36.8) came from kind of seeing it so (inaudible at 1:04:39.7) making yourself feel, made you feel more inadequate as a result of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it wasn't. It wasn't that. Damn I don't know what it was. Oh what it was is that, you know, he's very sensitive and he's very supportive and he thinks that I'm a good lover and that I can be very sensuous, you know, and sexual. And he's very supportive that way. And at first, you know, as our relationship developed I don't think I always believed that. I felt that he was saying those things to try and give me comfort and help me relax. But I believe that, you know, because I feel good about myself, and I have fun, and I feel comfortable, you know. And I believe that, you know. And so that adds to the optimal kind of situation that we're in in terms of feeling good about myself and having someone recognize that I'm good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He sees you as good and you feel yourself as good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I know that. 1:05:58.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: but it's kind of like boy, it's really good (inaudible at 1:06:01.9) it's just (inaudible). It's kind of like the way we are [physically] (PH) is that it's very [good for us] (PH). You know, how we can turn each other on and it's really nice, we're both sensuous, we're good lovers, but God damn I can't have an orgasm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like everything about our sexual relationship, I think, is good, except that. And I guess for awhile it hasn't troubled me and I've kind of accepted it. And every once in awhile it troubles me and I get very angry with myself. And naturally Don is always very sensitive to trying to do his best to help me have an orgasm.

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's kind of like, you know, it's kind of [what you are is] (PH) sulking and you're in disappointment in yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. And I begin to feel guilty about, you know, harping on it or saying anymore about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because like it should've been done with. I'm sorry we've got to stop, I have another client that was five minutes ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I would really like to talk about it, you know, I mean it's (inaudible at 1:08:17.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would too. You know, I really would.</p>

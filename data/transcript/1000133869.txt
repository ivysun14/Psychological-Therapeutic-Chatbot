<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the 16th interview. Sixteenth interview. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I see they're graduating today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep. Today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh two days of graduations. Why's that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think they do the graduate students one day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see. I see. And the undergrads the next?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Tomorrow is undergrads.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. That's nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I think they do two sessions today. They do like graduates from departments like in the afternoon. I think in the morning they do like law school and medical school. You know, professionals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Schools. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey you must've had a hard time parking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no I found one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. I'd seen the robes before but I never could identify where they were from. Now I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know the maroon with the-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah they have black stripes-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are PhD robes. They're different. Undergraduates wear just plain old black ones.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see. I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But those are the ones you wear for (inaudible at 0:01:02.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do they still wear the same-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different hats. More like, undergraduates just wear the regular old square. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not one of those fancy berets. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I always kind of thought the beret things were neat. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah me too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I don't know. I guess basically I'm a sentimental traditionalist. (Laughs) Or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:24.1) tradition is a real nice thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think it's really nice. I don't see why anybody would knock graduation or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I remember when I went to my graduation from college. I went to college. I kind of enjoyed the ceremony. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All these traditional things playing medieval music. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah yeah. I thought it was really kind of nice myself also. Somebody says, "Oh hell. Who wants to go?" And all this stuff. "Why should you go?" It's because I'm graduating. That's why. (Laughing) After all that work there ought to be some sort of pomp and circumstance. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it is, I kind of dig it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. But I don't know. What did you read in the papers there is a 16 year old valedictorian who got up and said, "That it was like 13 years of babysitting. That's all you ever did for me." [0:02:12.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She says, "When we ask about birth control you say that you can't mention it. And we asked about dope and you send us to a policeman. You don't send a doctor."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she says, "We're not insane. We're not crazy. And we're your children." It was really kind of nice. I thought, "Wow." She really hit the nail on the head. Thirteen years of babysitting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But at any rate. Graduation is nice. I remember when I graduated from high school it was like I was-you know graduated from high school. And usually the family would have a big party for you or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my father said, "No. You just got out of high school. It's no big deal." And I was really pissed. Really upset about the whole thing. So my mother said to me, "When you make it out of college. You know, ha ha. We'll just throw a big party. We'll rent a hall. And have a band. And the whole bit." I made it out of college and she never has yet thrown a party. (Laughs) I'm still waiting for the party. But I kind of remembered those things while working through college. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe when you get married.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. When I get married then the big party will come. I'll end up paying for it. (Chuckles) Because like I was the first one out of college.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It should've (inaudible at 0:04:06.7). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It should've really meant something. [0:04:08.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Like out of anybody. But at any rate. (Inaudible) I went home to change after work. And it was really funny that I got a call from this guy who I met in Chicago when I was there last summer. And we had sex together, you know. And he was kind of nice. And we went and saw Chicago together. </p>

<p>And he was from Portland, Oregon. And he called twice before or something like this. But it was nothing he just wanted to talk. And he just called. And he said that he was going to be in New York on Thursday. And he wanted to come by and see me. I just was on the phone and I said, "Well, no." I said, "Well it's like this. I'm following the straight path. And I've turned over this new leaf." And he said, "Oh okay." And that was just a goodbye. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it felt kind of good to say it. I just said, "Goodbye." But he would've been a nice person to know in a straight basis. He was a big man in H.E.W. Health, education and welfare. He would've gotten me a nice job I'm sure. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a good person to know but like you just didn't want to get into a situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. No way. But like he would've been a nice person to know. Like-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm saying. Nice person to know regularly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. As straight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 0:05:43.5) friend. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. You know one of those people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just but you really kind of wanted to avoid anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Really. Like I said he can call from Portland. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Then I thought, I was really glad that I did say no. Even because I would've had to say no even if he did come into New York. If he was making a special trip to New York. I thought, "Sh*t." It would be kind of waste of his time. And mine unless he gave me a job. (Laughs) Because he did mention the last time when I saw him Chicago that he could've gotten me some job or something like that. And those are nice jobs to have. (Laughs) [0:06:26.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do they do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's civil service. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what you do. But like all I know is you travel a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Put a stamp on forms. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. He flies to Alaska and flies all over. I could dig it. (Laughs) But that's life. And that other guy called me. This is something else. I don't why. Like just now. All these people-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're all showing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they're all showing up. Like wow. That other guy, Thomas Delcroy, he's the guy who had me in-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The gas?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. The gas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The gas guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And he called again. And he said-he wanted to know where I was during the storm last Sunday. And I said, "Well I was in bed. And matter of fact I was in bed with a fine young lady." (Chuckling) I said, "If you want to know the truth." He says, "Oh?" And I said, "Yeah." And he says, "Oh I see." And I said, "Yep." And he says something about you don't plan. Something about the two way or something like this. And I said, "Oh no. When I go, I go all the way." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was really kind of funny talking to him too. (Laughing) Just saying all this stuff. And I think like he asked-we sat and conversed about nothing. For the rest of the time. He was really-I think he was kind of floored. To tell you the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of that you had gone (inaudible at 0:08:00.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. And he says, "Oh I suppose you'll get married and have children. And all this stuff." And I said, "Yeah." I said, "Oh we'll have to have lunch sometime. Or go out for dinner. Something like that." Sit and talk for awhile. He says, "Yeah." So that was the end of it. It's really weird. It really was weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like having the voices. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. You like haven't heard from these guys in like years or something like this. But it's really kind of grand just to say, "Well, sorry. Goodbye." [0:08:32.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it kind of makes you feel good because you don't even feel tempted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it doesn't. It doesn't even bother me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's not even kind of like a decision like before. When you didn't want to it was because it made you feel guilty but you kind of did want the release.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:49.7) feel like a battle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-uh. There isn't anything (inaudible at 0:08:51.5) like this. Not even. No second thoughts about it or anything like that. So that's nice. You have to go out and buy all these storage boxes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No you know that new building next door? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The new one they just (inaudible at 0:09:07.9). So people moving in there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh so they were getting rid of the boxes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I think movers save these boxes. I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. You ripped off of them at any rate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tons of them. Stacks of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's great. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah they're good because they're basically all the same size this way. That makes packing a truck a lot easier. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Really. Hell of a lot easier. That's grand. It's like - Mr. Heiman, who is the art consultant, they had some voting booths out in the hall. They were going to use for senior. We were thinking of ripping off a couple. But-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Voting booths? I bet that's some of kind of an offense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. It's a federal offense or something. They were just cardboard though. But we ultimately ended up going through it legally and calling the man. And he going down to the warehouse and picking up the used voting booths. But uh - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. The cardboard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cardboard. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought you meant the kind that (inaudible at 0:09:59.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no no. Not the curtain ones. The cardboard ones. Yeah. But this man-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are the kind you do your paper ballots.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Mr. Heiman was saying that they put new sod in front of this new high school. I think it was [Desabo] or something like that. Or Dunbar. They put new sod. One morning new sod in front of the high school. The next morning he drives by and there's new sod on the other side of the street in front of all these people's homes. (Laughing) They all had beautiful sod. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:25.4) expensive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. I think it was terrific. They never had grass before. They have it now. Courtesy of. [0:10:29.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How'd your play go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice. It really turned out well. Comparatively. It was kind of hectic. This afternoon at lunchtime the two women, my two team mates, were on tranquilizers so I decided-I never had one before, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I joined them in a tranquilizer. It was very relaxing. It really was. Like wow. It was like, I just sat there and watched the play. And nothing bothered me. (Laughs) Didn't even get up out of the seat. It was really kind of nice. And they really-I didn't. They just kind of relax you that's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't know what else they're supposed to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make you tranquil. Relax you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. It was really, really kind of nice. I don't know if I'd make a habit out of it though. Just you know if you have to depend upon tranquilizers things are getting pretty bad. Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tired?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. A little bit. Not too. I went to bed early last night. I called Tanya. She was in kind of a bit**y mood. Kind of a blah mood. And I wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "Well what's wrong with you?" And she said, "I don't know." And I just felt like hanging up. (Chuckles) You know like what's the sense of going on talking if the conversation is going to be so strained. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of turned you off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. You just kind of (makes clicking noise). But I don't know. I ended up talking to her but it was kind of like really kind of blah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah just really didn't feel like a satisfying warm talk. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Not at least whatever I was looking for. (Laughing) You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But because I was feeling kind of good at that point. And then I thought to myself, "Well we all have our bad moments." Including I. So imagine she feels the same way if I'm in rather a lousy mood. [0:12:39.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:12:43.0) tired and just (inaudible) do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Do anything or you know. So I just thought it happens to everybody. It's getting around to the end of the year. And getting all this stuff together. Something I'm not looking forward to. (Chuckles) You know it's like doing report cards. And doing [cue] cards. And packing and all that stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And just really kind of a pain in the a**. And what do you do with 31 children while you're trying to get all the rest of this stuff done. I wish I could just go home and stay. We tried that once but they all showed up. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Telling them to stay home. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We did. Truthfully. I think it was the last day before Christmas or something. We weren't going to do anything. It's just like it's just going to be getting things together to go on the Christmas break. Just throwing subtle hints like, "Oh I imagine you have some last minute shopping to do. And your mother would like to take you shopping. Don't strain yourself to come." But they all came. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were practically giving you a written invitation to stay home. Mm. Some of the kids I had in 7th and 8th grade they came back from another school to see the play. God like it's this new person. They've all developed. They've all passed puberty now. [0:14:30.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like I didn't even recognize half of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You really see how they've grown up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh wow. Twice as tall as you are. And it's really a weird feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that's kind of like you're getting them right before that age.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right before that age. And then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where every year makes dramatic differences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. They just-oh it was unbelievable. I had this one kid. I didn't even know who he was. I couldn't-And I had him like only two years ago. He was so different. He was so scrawny and little and now he's just so big. It really makes a hell of a difference. It was kind of nice though to see them. They come up and say hello and all this stuff. This one girl though. Shawna she used to give me hell. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she was nice in her own way. And the teacher had to get her. And I said, "Christ, she hasn't changed." (Chuckles) The other one. Chyna. Oh God. She was really bright. Really bright. And she was bright enough to start trouble and stay out of it. And you know just really clever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really a clever girl. But she's, God in 8th grade now and sleeping with guys and carrying on. Unbelievable but she's got more brains. She's supposed to be going on to [Lindbloom]. Which really isn't a bad school. If she makes it. If she doesn't play, she'll be fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean she's the type that stuff that we were doing in grammar school, pfft. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's pretty-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she could play. She didn't have any hassle. She'd pass all the time. She could really have a good time. The whole thing wasn't challenging enough for her. [0:16:36.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe she was babysitted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was. We were babysitting for her. We were. I think they'd have to just burn the whole system right now and start from scratch in order to really get down to teaching these kids what they really should learn. Burn it all. Oh. Only two more weeks left anyway. When are you leaving?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm leaving on either a week from Tuesday or a week from Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that the twenty-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's around the 22nd. </p>

<p>CLIENT: 22nd. 23rd. Yeah. And have a place to stay and everything? Oh that's nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:17:45.6) when I was out there in April. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: House.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A house? Hey. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm renting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. It's better than an apartment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:59.8) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I mean did you have to get a lawnmower and all sorts of things?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a shovel. For the snow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I don't know if I'd like. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I remember it. And I just can't see myself getting a power one though because I don't care that much about the lawn. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it seems like such a lot of money to spend but it's really hard. I mean I remember when I was a kid (inaudible at 0:18:24.9). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hated it. [0:18:30.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially when you're real lazy like me and let the grass grow so much it's hard to mow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I remember when my brother and I, we used to let it grow so long. And it just-of course we never had a power mower. (Laughing) It was like the two of us. One would have to get on one side and one have to get on the other side and push because you could hardly get through it. It really was bad. (Laughs) I hope the neighborhood improvement association doesn't get after you for a shoddy lawn. (Laughing) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm the last house on a dead end street. So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh good then they won't even notice. (Laughing) We used to always be trying to talk my father into putting in a cement yard. So we wouldn't have to cut the lawn. He never did though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like have you ever been to the U of I circle campus?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. You know. Nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Because it looks like, I think there's (inaudible at 0:19:56.4) of cement into green (inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. It really looks bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's kind of (Inaudible at 0:20:04.0). They really (inaudible) than this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah they are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:20:08.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. If you'd like to take care of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure here the university spends a fortune for lawn care. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And usually the graduation. I don't know (inaudible at 0:20:19.9). </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) Something you can rip off of it. I really can't-I guess a lot of people must enjoy it. It's really - . There was this like the one witch who used to live in the block. And in the fall whenever her lawn she used to take it. Because there was always one. She was really weird. Come out and squirt you with a hose. Just antagonize you. So you'd just be more antagonistic towards her. (Chuckles) And then on the other hand there was this one man who used to live in the back. I mean we'd use his yard for a play area. We built a tree house up in his tree. [0:21:19.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He used to build little wooden carts for us with the wheels on it and stuff like that. Who was really a nice guy. I don't know if he was a bachelor or something. Lived with his sister. He was an old man. He used to have one of the cars with the running boards. And we used to hop on the running boards. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:21:33.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And during the winter we used to stand by stop signs and hitch the rides in back of the cars. And he'd always let us get on. Of course it was very dangerous. I realize that now. (Laughs) But he was really nice. And buy anything off of you. Whatever you were selling he'd buy it off of you. I always wondered-know what happened. I think he moved to Texas and retired. To Texas. I was wondering if Tanya was pissed about our last conversation. I'll have to ask her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you told her (inaudible at 0:22:27.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. If she was upset about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean kind of like she was feeling bad and she wouldn't say anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you didn't want sleep with her on those nights. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And she doesn't say. Like I said to her, "Well what's happening like tonight?" And she says, "Well nothing really." And I said well I had to come here and like I'd be through about 5:30 or so. And I said, "Well do you want me to come by your place?" "Well I don't care." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of seemed really turned off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To you. You don't know if it was to you or if she's just apathetic about everything. Or if it was something special to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And she says, "Well if you'd want to." Or stuff like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she showed no enthusiasm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like I'm saying, "Well whatever you want to do is fine with me. If you want to come this way or you want me to go that way. It really doesn't make that much difference." And she'll never say well I really feel like coming over. And I'd-so fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you ask her if anything was the matter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And she said, "No nothing." Just. (Chuckles) It's like no, nothing. And you could really kind of tell there was something bothering her somewhere. And she just kind of (inaudible at 0:23:38.6). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you really wanted her to show some enthusiasm. (Inaudible at 0:23:42.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah right. Something. Some yes or no. Or tell me to go to hell. I don't care. Say something. It's just better than nothing. Which really drives me insane. Because you know that when a person is thinking something, and you know a person is thinking something, it really just drives me up a wall. It really does. [0:24:09.1]</p>

<p>In fact the other day, through this play business, we had prompters on the stage. And there were about six of them. And I suggested to Kathleen, she was the one who was kind of like in charge of it. She was running the show more or less. And I said, "Well don't you think six is a little bit too much?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "We should only have two because it's getting a little crowded up there." And she was kind of like apprehensive just letting the two go up there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I talked to her later and I said, "If I said something that was kind of like offensive or you thought there should've been six or something, why don't you say something? If you would've said something." And she said, "You know me better than that. If had something to say; I'd say it." Which is true. She would. She says, "There were just so many other things on my mind that I just wasn't there. I was just kind of out of it." Which is really kind of nice. And I was really kind of glad that I asked her about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was feeling kind of rotten. I thought well did I say something wrong? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Sara the other woman who works with us she was feeling kind of the same way. Because I asked her. "Is there something wrong? Did we do something?" And she said, "No. She had troubles at home. And trying to run this thing and all that stuff." But at least she explained. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was kind of good to be able act on kind of (inaudible at 0:25:36.4). Instead of just wondering. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Wondering what's wrong. Or what did I do wrong? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of be open and say (inaudible at 0:25:42.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. What did I do wrong? Was there something that I said or did that's upsetting you so? If it is let me know. In fact I think I asked Tanya the same question last night if I'm not positive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She didn't give you the same kind of response?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It was just like, "No. Nothing. Nothing's wrong." So I don't know. (Chuckles) You even ripped off with the tape, didn't you? [0:26:16.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I took a whole roll of it home last night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey wow. (Laughing) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's good tape.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can imagine. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm really notorious when it comes to kind of stealing little things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I couldn't steal anything big.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither could I. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know just little things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I always feel nervous in doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh you think you're-But teachers are unbelievable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh school supplies I bet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God. They'll rip off of anything. If it's hanging on the wall they'll take it down. Really. And they may not even need it at that time. But oh I may need this later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (Inaudible at 0:26:59.3) I've done that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) And it's really unbelievable. Anything. Anything. Like one of the kids was talking about she was stealing something. She had stolen something. And she really didn't feel guilty about it. She had stolen something in old town she said. And she said, "Well they gypped me. So I decided since they gypped me I was going to rip off something." So she did. </p>

<p>I said, "Well." And then she said, "Oh you promise you won't tell anybody." And I said, "Oh I promise I won't tell anybody." And she said, "I stole my mother's Valentine's Day gift." And I said, "You didn't!" She says, "Yes. I stole a pillow out of Walgreen's. I walked out and looked as if I was pregnant." And I thought oh God. Eleven years old. And she says really didn't feel bad about it or anything. </p>

<p>And I said to her, "One time. Do you know the Kroger that used to be up on Hilltop Grove?" And she said, "Yes." And I said, "One time, it was around Halloween time, there was a bunch of us had been shopping up at the center up there. And we went in and we were hungry. And I stole a bag of Hershey candy bars. And the manager saw me take it. And he tore off after me. And I swear he chased me for blocks. I mean through prairies. Through gangways." [0:28:29.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You must've been really frightened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God. I was scared to death. Really. Just scared to death. He never did catch me. But I never would eat those candy bars. And I never stole anything again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I bet you never went back there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never did. Really. I never went back there either. And I like I remember the kids saying, "Christ you can't go back there for seven years. Because seven years is the time. They can catch you for seven years." And I never went back into the store either. I did learn my lesson though. I would never, never steal anything again. These kids think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Going in there. In fact my mom (inaudible at 0:29:10.1). Young kids. Just little, like grammar school kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Into a cash register. You know, pfft, open up the cash register. Stole the money. (Chuckles) And think nothing of it. I thought, "Christ." But then I think as far as the parents are concerned that was always a big threat. If I ever hear you kids about stealing anything. Oh it was just like the biggest threat. If I hear you stealing anything. That and what was it? Hitting a girl. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That and hitting a girl. If I ever see you hit a girl. Because we couldn't. Even our sisters, it was like you don't. (Chuckles) You just don't. Which now I really can't see why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. They're people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I really-that's it. Just always you respect them. And all this stuff. In fact I find it in the black community it's getting-they're really emphasizing the respect for their women. [0:30:31.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's a thing there wasn't much of before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's really becoming out now. And don't you hit that girl. You must respect. She's a young woman. Blah blah blah. But I mean I can understand that as far as the boys are concerned. If some girl is going to come and slug me. I'd just slug them back. I was thinking about this weekend. And going to bed with Tanya. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought I was really looking forward to it. First thoughts. Really looking forward to it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Second thoughts. What if? (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What if I don't perform. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just have to keep in mind my first thoughts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I guess it's kind of like it is a worry that kind of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you kind of flop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or whatever you call it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't know. (Chuckles) Whatever you want to call it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:32:07.2) And kind of like you just kind of don't want to worry about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Just really don't worry about it. But I thought to myself if my first thoughts are that I'm really going to enjoy it, well then I probably should.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's probably better if you don't let yourself worry about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:32:27.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm really looking forward to it. Then it should-at least my first thoughts are first. Are you going to spend your weekend packing? [0:33:02.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep. And doing research work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think probably more research work this weekend than packing. Pack next week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Still haven't finished your research, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah. I still have to (inaudible at 0:33:18.8) my results in. See what they look like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to answer (inaudible at 0:33:25.2). Dissertation I'm supposed to talk to him about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think your supervisor. So try to talk to him about anything that I can think of before I leave. Because it won't be so easy to talk to him once I'm gone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see. So then when you finish your paper you have to send it back to him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Him and once he approves it you have to send it to everyone on your committee. I have three other people on my committee. And they have to approve it. Then you, (inaudible at 0:33:54.7) have an oral defense of it kind of. It's like then I come back and make (inaudible at 0:34:00.8) for a couple of hours. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Christ.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then it's kind of -  And it's really pretty hard. But it's mostly ritual. And then maybe they'll make you revise a little portion of it or something. Or say it's okay. (Inaudible at 0:34:14.0)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well they wouldn't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They usually don't-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go so far as saying rewrite the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not usually. No but they can do that before-once they've told you it's okay to have an oral on it, you usually don't have to rewrite the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they can tell you-well I don't understand this. Why don't you rewrite it and make it understandable? I don't know if they do that with a dissertation. That's a pretty big thing to rewrite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They'll do it with a section of it. Like well I don't like your discussion section of your results. It's not clear. But I don't think they'll ever do that with a whole dissertation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh. Seems like a hell of a lot of to go through. I mean when you think about it. Christ. Especially getting the approval of four. You're bound to get one bas**rd. I would think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like who's going to say, "Well forget it." (Inaudible at 0:35:05.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I have one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then, actually then they send it kind of, you write up an abstract of it. About a ten page abstract of it. And that goes right to everyone on the faculty. In the department. Not the whole university.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they've got to approve it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They make it hard for you. It's amazing to see anyone wearing those robes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was going to say. Christ. That is unbelievable. And all right so you send your abstract, what if one doesn't approve your abstract?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually they don't even read them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's kind of like they only have to disapprove. I don't think they do anything to approve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because probably most of them don't really care enough to read it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they're so busy and responsible. If you had to wait around for everyone to say yes. Just never ever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what they used to do but they-it was taking so long. [0:36:05.4] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'd say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That the way they do it now is usually I think is like-</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they don't hear anything it's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By a certain date. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wow. When do you plan-you'll graduate from here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But yeah. I'll get my degree from here. I expect to get it maybe at the end of the fall quarter. Because usually there's some time once you're done with it that-like if you have to revise parts of it. And then there's always a time lag. Like to get the degree at the end of the quarter you have to have it done about six or seven weeks before that. To get it typed by an official NYU dissertation typist. And all (inaudible at 0:36:51.0). Yeah you have to use an official typist. They're really-there's a book which tells you exactly how the style, like you should indent this many spaces. It's really-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's someone over in the administration building. They have a dissertation office that someone reads every dissertation in this university to make sure they conform to the right style. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Then after they're finished they stack them up at the new library.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Exactly. (Inaudible at 0:37:22.8) and no one ever reads them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Unreal. Unreal. God. Well it really means something though. I mean as far as if you have a degree from the NYU. Like the name itself, just wow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've got it. (Chuckles) As long as you have that piece of paper it's really kind of nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really. Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking it would be kind of nice-I mean if someone wrote each subject for a dissertation. About ten or twenty years from now seeing that most of the children of today both parents work. How that affects the child. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah if they kind of go on-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. What happens to these children whose parents both worked at the same time? [0:38:13.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting. Because it is more likely that people whose both parents worked are more likely to do more. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So were you thinking of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just thought it would really be interesting because from nursery school on. From, Christ, we had a couple of them and then the kids weren't even a year. And they were back to work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the kid is shipped out to a nursery school. Or a babysitter or something. And the mother has always worked. I thought it would really be interesting to find out-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The effects?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the effects. The children. Because years ago, just in a curve. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was a-my mom always worked. Well she worked during the day since I was about nine or ten or something like that. And it was really kind of nice to come home and find her there. It was like a treat. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I remember like when I was little and my mom worked too. Real early. I was like in first grade and I remember coming home and she wasn't there. I had to make my own snack. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think it helped me maybe to become more independent. (Inaudible at 0:39:28.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. It does that. You just have to do things for yourself because no one is going to do it for you. It's like going home at lunch time. And if she was home you'd have a nice lunch waiting for you. But you were home you made your own peanut butter and jelly sandwich. (Chuckles) And ran off to school. Which was about it. Which is really-that'd be interesting to find out. How these kids really turn out? We call them the key club. Because they always have keys around their necks. To get inside the door because no one is ever home. Maybe ten years from now I'll write a dissertation on it. (Laughing) [0:40:08.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course you have to find a control group and all sorts of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be kind of hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Plus if you had a look at them kind of before and after.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:40:20.0)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would happen to them? I should start now. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are studies like that that measure things over a ten year period. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:40:31.4) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah really. (Laughs) And what the hell good is it going to do after you're finished? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It'll end up in a box probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Course. There's this-well one of the kids at the school he had a big part in the play. And his mother doesn't work. Oh Christ. Drive me up a wall. This is this Mrs. Mays. Again. Her child was in the play. Mrs. Mays was there during dress rehearsal taking pictures of her son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was there this morning. I mean, Christ. She was up on the stage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taking pictures?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the stage. No getting her son ready for this act. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Kathleen came up and she said to Jeanette, "Do you think you need me?" And Sara says, "Oh no. Mrs. Augusto is right here. She could run this show." Then she'd run down and get her movie camera and take the bright lights. And the kids just really resent him because of his mother. And it is so sad. Really sad. She was up here during dress rehearsal and she ripped off a couple of hangers that were in the room. And the kids, "Mrs. Mays stole my hanger!" (Laughs) I said, "Well I'm sorry. We'll see if we can find you another one." But it was really rotten for her to treat him like such a baby. Oh. It's like woman would you please leave and leave your son here alone? (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he'll turn out-I don't know how. She's strange. She's really weird. She married an Indian. Like-[0:42:21.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) Indian?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Indian. Indian. Indian. Indian. The kid looks Howdy Doody. (Laughs) He does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the kid as bad as the mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He's really-it's sad. Because they tease him. And they say, "Lloyd is your mother going to be here this afternoon?" He says, "No." So. I think he'd just like to tell her to leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I guess it's getting better. I guess when he was like in fourth and fifth grade, she used to come and walk him to school everyday. (Laughs) And carry his briefcase and his musical instrument and everything else for him. If parents only knew. How they can ruin a child. That's how I was like trying to think about how my parents had an effect on me. It's nothing that I could really say. If they really did have an effect on me. They weren't around that often. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just did they really have an effect on me? I imagine they'd have to. But there's nothing that I can really pinpoint and say, "I'm this way because my parents."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. This is it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There really isn't anything that I can really say. Of course there are a number of psychologists that take that route, don't they? [0:44:24.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean try and pinpoint?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Try and pinpoint your parents and stuff. I mean they do. I mean sometimes you can really tell why a child is the way he is because of his parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But usually you just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of in a much subtler way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. I mean there's a few children you know. In fact the parents-just by meeting the parents you know why the kid is this way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why he's arrogant. Because his parents are arrogant. Why he's stupid? Because his parents tell he's stupid. (Chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think frequently it's just not so blatant. Like that there's such specific things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's really strange. Oh well. Should we call it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What to come in Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:45:33.3] [end of audio]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One of my hearing aids is broke, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got to probably just, well anyway for this thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'll do all the talking then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did it break?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yknow, what happens is from time to time they get a little bit too wet, yknow, like if I sweat or they absorb moisture and humidity, you just kind of got to go in and turn them in and they like dry them out and make all the circuitry back and then, so I'm leaving from here and going there, picking up those things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you need it for the trip.  Are you leaving on a trip or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm leaving on, I'm leaving on Wednesday and I won't be back till the following Wednesday, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  Where are you going?  Where are you going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well actually I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're going to fly, you wont' drive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because last time you drove to [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, normally I would but since I'm not coming back, that'd be kind of a tough trek [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your mood seems good though, how are you feeling?  Your mood seems pretty good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yknow, I mean, I don't know where we left it with [NAME OTHER] last time I was here but, yknow, she's back and we're all worked out and so that's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who's back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My girlfriend.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]?  Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did that happen?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I mean, I think, yknow, in looking at it, I think what happens is that her kids like me, I think a lot of it has to do that they know my kids like me and so that must make me okay and then they like me and I think they talk to their father when they're with him about, yknow, [PATIENT NAME] did this and [PATIENT NAME] did that or, yknow, [PATIENT NAME] and I think he kind of, yknow, puts a guilt trip on her of, yknow, what's going on and what are you doing with this, yknow, even though their divorced, yknow what I mean, and he doesn't even really have any right to do that, I think he does it and it makes her panic a little bit about,  yknow, all the dynamics involved of,  yknow, him being the father, yknow, her having a boyfriend and, yknow what I mean, all that and so she pushes away a little bit and so I think this time we kind of talked it out about what's really going on and, yknow, it's not about her and I, it's about, yknow, some of these outside issues and we've just got to, yknow, she can't react that way every time something like that happens.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it was pressure from him and last time you said it was something about she thought she liked him again, no?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Last time what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That she liked him again or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well the way that she termed it was that she had issues with him.  I just assumed they were issues of, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay but she didn't actually say that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she said issues which turned out to be, as we talked through it, so I mean it was good, I mean we, yknow, I just think it's, when you're in the kind of relationships that I'm in where you've got their kids, yknow, she's got her kids, I've got my kids, we've got all this peripheral shit going on with, yknow, her husband, her ex husband, my ex wife, yknow, they're getting married, yknow, blah, blah, blah, yknow, there's bound to be some misfire ricochet stuff going on where, yknow, for the wrong reasons, people are doing the wrong things because they don't, yknow, it's hard to deal with all the different stuff happening and so I think we've come up with kind of like a game plan for, yknow, dealing with some of that and so that it doesn't happen again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  So you're secure, you're feeling secure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean, yknow, like, yknow, we've kind of decided that nobody is going to break up with anybody until we've really talked through what the problem is, yknow, instead of just saying I can't deal with this, yknow, see you later, yknow, now that it's been a year, we owe it to each other to at least make sure that, yknow, everyone understands what the real issues are and then if they're not workable, then that's one thing but, yknow, like in this case, it's a whole separate thing that, yknow, there's no reason to, yknow, go through what we went through then we can avoid that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you let your guard down again with her in the relationship.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she's seen me naked, I don't know how much more you can let your guard down than that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yknow, in terms of protecting you from being rejected.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm about, I think I'm about ninety percent there.  I mean there's certainly, yknow, I don't know that I'm every going to completely let my guard down even if we're together for thirty, forty years, because I did that once and got singed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, so but I don't know if that's necessary for a good relationship, I mean to have one hundred percent, yknow, I don't need to know every one of her deep dark secrets, yknow what I mean, I mean what's in the past is in the past, I mean unless it relates to me, I don't really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I mean just the trust level that she's not going to just drop you like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean from that perspective, yeah, I trust her, I mean, but I had some problems with [NAME OTHER] this past week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened with him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He got arrested for selling heroin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]?  After he's been through so much, he did it again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thirty years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's facing thirty?  Is he is in prison now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's got a mandatory thirty year minimum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh wow.  Is he in jail now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  They set his bail at a million bucks because, yknow, he's a drug dealer.  Yknow, those guys are pretty much, in today's society, the scum of the earth which that's the category he chose to put himself in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, I thought he wasn't using at all?  I thought he stopped using after he was in jail?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't know that he was using it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just selling it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In some respects, I blame myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why is that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, a couple of months ago I said hey, you've been out for a year now, yknow, you've got to get a job, you've got to start, yknow, moving forward, you've got to get, I'm tired of giving you money, I'm tired of putting gas in your car, yknow, so instead of going out and doing the right thing, he just went out and did the easy thing, yknow, so that kind of sucks.  So that happened on Wednesday night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you seen him since he's been in jail?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's called you?  Has he called you on the phone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did you find out about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mother.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did she find out about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He called her.  I think he knew better than to call me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's really sad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and, yknow, I don't feel sorry for him because he knew what he was doing.  It's not like, yknow, some guy in [DEIDENTIFIED] and sells something and gets imprisoned for life, first time and doesn't know what's going on.  [NAME OTHER] knew exactly what he was doing and he knew what the cost and penalties were based on him being on parole and he knew, yknow, what the downside was and still he went ahead and did it, so yknow what, it turns out it was the fourth time he sold to this undercover police officer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In the last month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh geez.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's really sad.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the bad news, the good news is it scared the shit out of [NAME OTHER].  Like I pointed out to him, I said you realize that by the time [NAME OTHER] gets out of jail, I may not even be alive.  He may never see me again because I'll be [AGE].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He didn't involve [NAME OTHER] in the selling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, [NAME OTHER] knew nothing about it, he was as surprised as I was.  Bad deal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing you can do now, right?  There's nothing you can do now to help him really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  It is what it is and I'm not going to throw a nickle at it either.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no, it won't help if it's a mandatory thirty years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It won't help.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not with this kind of deal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that was kind of my Thursday and Friday, was getting that all straightened out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does his sister know about it?  What was her reaction?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's everyone's reaction, it's a shame, it's stupid, yknow, he was an idiot but what are you going to do.  Feel bad, I mean, we all feel bad, I mean even I feel bad that, yknow, here's somebody that's taken a life and just totally wasted it but what are you going to do, I mean, yknow, other than beat yourself up over it.  I mean there's not a lot I can do, so it's been a little bit of a topsy turvy week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  So the house feels real different now with him not being there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, well that's a plus, I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, less traffic, less, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about the car you gave him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They impounded it because, yknow, it's evidence and then once the trial is done I can get the car back but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you and [NAME OTHER] sat down and had a talk about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell him you don't want to see him follow the same path.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.  We talked about, yknow, it all seems like you'll never, you always think you're invincible and you'll never get caught and, yknow, nothing will ever happen to you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But he got caught, that's the funny thing about it, this isn't the first time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he didn't learn from the other time.  He was in jail for what, three years before?  How many years was he in jail the first time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about the other kids, yknow, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well they're all sad.  I mean, yknow, they're a little bit too young to really understand the adult ramifications of, yknow, being gone for thirty year but, yknow, they were sad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But for good behavior, he can get out in half, right, or no?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, not if you're a drug dealer.  If you're a murderer you can but not a drug dealer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's ridiculous.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But yknow, I also talked to [NAME OTHER] about, yknow, I mean, even my scenario of, yknow, some of the injuries and things that happened to me in sports when I was young and I never thought about what it was going to be like when I was [AGE] and, yknow, if I had known then what I know now and that's what, yknow, trying to be a parent is all about, is I'm trying to give you the benefit of my wisdom because I've made that mistake, don't make it yourself, yknow.  Of course, who knows what will sink in and what won't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to tell your family, your sisters?  Will you tell your family, your sisters?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The truth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'll tell them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, there's no point in sweeping it under the rug, I mean, my sister is in [DEIDENTIFIED] probation so, she's a probation officer, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she'll see him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she would know anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All you can do is just feel sad.  All you can really do is just feel sad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  So that's the situation.  One thing I need, I need my usual Adderall this week but my Provigil three month thing you wrote has expired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow how when you, for that [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You write the three month prescription, well that's expired. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need a refill on that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I need another three month so I can mail it in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about the other medicines?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just that and then the normal Adderall is all I'm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How come you have so much left of the Zyprexa and the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well once you write that three month one, they kind of keep it on file and I guess if it's not like a controlled.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, they renew it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They just renew it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the Provigil is, yknow, has got some restrictions on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so write the three month and then I'll write the month.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The three month and the one month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then you're going to be taking some vacation in the summer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well I'm going to, I've got a business trip, then I got a vacation, so I'll be able to come back in four weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In four weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where are you going on the vacation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With the kids?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, just the two of you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it should be fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have a good time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then in September, I'm going to take the kids on an Alaskan cruise.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh wow. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that'll be kind of cool.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, wow.  You already signed up for it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now she gets married too pretty soon, right, in August?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When does she get married, in August or in July?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm off the hook, she gets married in the first week of August but the guy already moved in so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you don't have to pay her anymore as of this month?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I have a little extra spending money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, that's true, financially you're in better shape but she's not complaining about it at all?  Did the kids say anything about it or they haven't?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The kids don't complain about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No and for that I'm thankful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  All right, enjoy the extra money.  You got a car, you'll get a cruise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

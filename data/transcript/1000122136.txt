<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 4.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've had your exercise for the morning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I took notes for this session. I'm all set.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to close the door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Got notes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I went to see June. She started talking and saying so many things so fast that I decided that I have to take notes, which probably doesn't bother her to much because I've done that before. But anyhow, it was really amazing. She made all the same observations about me that I had made. Right on down the line. I thought I was fooling people but I sure wasn't. At least not June. She's really observant. Well anyhow, I decided to go over and see her and set everything straight. I just never got around to really saying the out and out truth about our relationship but we talked a heck of a lot about me. It was just amazing. The same things that I had been telling you, that I had just begun to realize. [0:01:15.0]</p>

<p>But she pointed out one thing that was a little different. And she said that number one I'm good at it. I seem to fool the groups of people that I'm with. But she thinks that maybe the reason that it's bothering me now is not so much that I'm doing it but for once in my life I'm not doing it well. I'm wondering if that's not the case. If it's just that I've been getting along just fine until now I'm no longer comfortable in the fact that I can do it well because I can't. That I'm really looking for how to do it better rather than learning how to not do it at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. Now I'm not clear. She said that's what she thought you felt that. I'm not quite sure if that's how you do feel or if you're not sure. [0:02:07.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure that's it. That's basically it. Remember how I told you I was with that group of older people. And I told you how I clammed up and I was worrying about saying something clever. She pointed that out as the prime example because I wasn't quite ready for them and was waiting. She had made the same observations about that particular encounter and brought it up as an example just as I did. I mean she could have come here and probably told you better than I. I was honest about the fact that generally I don't behave with girls the way I behave with June. I went through with all that and after we got through with everything we decided that I was really a bastard with her. I asked her why she put up with it. And she said she didn't really know. The most important thing now is not my relationship with her but her observations. [0:03:06.6]</p>

<p>She also said one other thing that I mentioned, you surround yourself with people that are non-threatening in the values that you consider are important. The things that I consider important which is another thing that I mentioned. Maybe I didn't word it that way but like the school that I chose. Why I chose a different circle where I could rise to the top but that's pretty much the same thing. She said some unbelievable things. Oh she said it's some of the most benign manipulation of groups she's ever seen. Because generally the circles of people that I'm with that I can often times control the tone of the group; which is really different than the idea that when I go into a group that I become part of that group rather than that group becoming part of me. This is somewhat different. It doesn't deal with that but it does fit in with the idea that I don't associate with people that are superior to me. That I would only go into a group that I could manipulate. [0:04:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you would only go into a group that you could set the tone with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But the reason that I started taking notes was because I was just amazed the words were almost the same as she started going through things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like it was just amazing that here you could suddenly come up with these things. Then you went to see her and she sort of feed you back the same things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: However I did mention that she probably knows me as well as anyone. She's seen me in different circles of people where other people haven't. So she's probably been able to observe it. I also think she's quite observant. Maybe I'm also just saying this to you because I want to think that I've fooled people all along. Think that I was better at this game that I've been playing. [0:05:10.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. You mean it was all a game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean to have her know it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was shocking. It was shocking to think here's something that I hadn't thought about myself, and just lately over the last few months I've been figuring this thing out, came up with it, and was pleased with myself. And decided I'd go to her, someone I knew well, to glean a little information that maybe I could supplement and add to it. She had it doped up better than I almost. It was amazing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it says something to you about how you come across to other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's right. She used the word that I was protecting myself. In that I would put up a barrier when I would go in the group. She's correcting my stuff over and over again. I didn't quite understand the sense of it. But it's as though I wouldn't really have wanted to assimilate into the group. Rather I'd put out this barrier and the people would sort of interact with this barrier rather than with me. I didn't grasp that too well. That was the first thing that I wanted to mention. [0:06:17.9]</p>

<p>The second thing I went to a party last night, no Saturday night. Huge party. I haven't been to a huge party in a long time. Wow I was really different and I think I'm really starting to think about things. I went in there and usually I would try and mix somewhat and this time I was just groping and looking for someone I knew to go off into a corner and talk to about old things. And finally I found a physicist there and he was just as out of place as I was. Although I'm not usually out of place like that so I think that my introspection is making me think about how I interact which I hope is like stage one. Well anyhow, after the party I went home and passed one of the apartments of some kids I know and they were up watching a late show Saturday night and I stopped in. Wow what a relief. I was really very loquacious and at ease and was behaving completely differently with people that I know. It wasn't a control thing at the party. I wasn't saying well I'm not going to interact. I just couldn't. Didn't. I don't know whether that's good or bad. I haven't figured that part out. [0:07:45.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was different than the way that you'd acted before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One other recent observation that I just made this morning, all the way through college and high school and everything, I've always had a lot of people around me. I was never very much of a loner. In high school like I wasn't at home. I had a small family; four people. My parents and one sister. I wasn't home a lot. I was always out with people. At college of course, I lived at dormitories and although you have your own little cubicle you still interact with people in the hall and everything. So you never really get alone with yourself for long periods of time. And I came here and lived in a dormitory for a year and then I lived in an apartment. In September, I've had two roommates all along, but one of them moved away to New Mexico and the other one's started working in North Dakota during the weeks. The guy I got to replace the one that moved away spends every waking moment in the lab. I was only taking one course. So in September then I was like home 90 percent of the time alone. I'm thinking that maybe this is what started me thinking about this. [0:09:17.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What started you thinking about what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well about the way I behave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. Be into that situation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Also I've decided to move for many reasons but I'm definitely set on living alone and I never would've thought of that before. Never would've. I've even like got an apartment lined up that I really like. Well it's a coach house. There's nobody around me. I just thought of that this morning. Why did I like the coach house above the other apartments I've looked at? It cost a little more and it's kind of run downish and it's hard to get to. People will never find it if I told anyone how to get to my place. But now when I think about it, it's really alone. It's probably the most isolated thing. That seems to be... [0:10:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very appealing somehow when you think of living alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It never had been before. Just lately. Just lately. Well those are three observations that I came up with. I'm kind of proud because I hadn't...You know every time I think I'm going to come in here I think about it. And for awhile nothing had happened and then the party and I noticed that. This morning what I consider an astute observation but perhaps... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you happy every time you notice something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Things are settling down. I still have this feeling that maybe we'll get everything figured out and I'll just see how I behave and just see that I behave that way and not do anything about it. I don't know if one can change if it's so ingrained in one. [0:11:05.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that's what you're worried about that you'll see a whole pattern. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it's a worry. I just kind of think it's going to turn out that way. By the way have you noticed any major contradictions of things like I might have made an observation two times ago that now is completely different from an observation that I made now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I haven't noticed any but I haven't looked for any. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Please.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The observations and the conclusions they're not really.... I don't think they're probably on all the evidence there. They're sort of well I don't know. See its so mish mashed that I come up with conclusions, then I've got so many things in the back of my mind that I'll just pick out the ones that sort of verify that conclusion; pick out the data I want to fit the results. [0:12:05.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not look at everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I fear that. I don't know if I am or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that's what you're afraid that you'll do is only look at what you want to see right then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think let's do a carbon experimental here. Get an idea that the experiment's supposed to work out this way and low and behold it will if you do the right work in the lab. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're afraid you'll do that in yourself and make that experiment in the lab.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One thing that I should mention, it doesn't really pertain to me but it's definitely been on my mind with regards to this. If I were you, and I know you don't, well I feel you don't, I really wouldn't give a damn. I figure well I'll come in here and I'll say, "Do you really give a damn?" and of course you do. Well I think you do. And you'll say, even if you didn't you'd say, "Yes." And be sincere about it. And yet I can't see how like I could. [0:13:16.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you were me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean a stranger walks in here and he's confused and so he comes and talks awhile and maybe he gets something straightened out and then you're done. But it's certainly not a monumental type of work that you're doing on me. Well I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you mean it's not a monumental thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it's not like there's someone here in a straight jacket and is going to walk out a beautifully sane person and go out and win the Nobel Prize in literature.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like I'm going to make some things change in you. [0:13:54.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess so. I hope you do. Well I don't know. It's really hard to be honest about things when you haven't. Let's see how to say this. Let's look at it this way. Put the analogy into the thing I know about; physics alright. I work all along and I'm getting ready to do my dissertation for my doctorate and I end up getting a job adding the sixth decimal point after everyone else has got the first five on the half life of the ado particle. Big deal. It's work. Its physics and you get it done and you sort of put it away. But then there's some other graduate student that gets a dissertation like he develops the Mossflower effect which is the one graduate like in the early 60's that he got a Nobel Prize for. A graduate student. Really great heavy stuff. It just took a little bit of incite and a little bit of work. I just get the feeling that like I'm the fifth decimal point for you of the sixth. [0:15:19.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I take it that you also feel you're coming in that way. That you're coming in like not with the whatever its called the moss problem or whatever it is, but like only to change the fifth decimal point, like all the rest of it's already been decided. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Oh hey that's a good point. Well maybe it's this way. If ideally everything that I want to have happen to me does happen, I don't know that a lot of people would notice. I would certainly feel infinitely better and I'd notice but I don't know that anyone else would. I know that other people would but to people that I might work with or the secretary I see a lot or my parents, I'm not going to change my relationship with my parents. That's too ingrained. It won't affect them. But new relationships that I develop will be much more honest I hope. I'll probably interact differently. But it's not like a major metamorphosis. It is though actually. [0:16:39.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying it might be major but it might not look major. Like say I might not realize that it would be a major change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's pretty much it. But again it boils down to that thing I said before and I've probably used the wrong analogy. Remember when I was talking how one person's life is everything to him. I didn't mean to be that severe. I meant that I wasn't talking about death or life or anything. I'm just talking about a problem to a person. If that's a major all consuming problem at that time that's his problem. Just like a problem made very severe or not so severe. If it bothers him then it's his problem. [0:17:23.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To him the most severe thing that's happening right then. Right. It sounds a lot like you're trying to say in some way, "Look this might not sound like much to you but it does mean something to me." I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's pretty close. I don't know much about how or why behave sexually the way did and why I'm not doing it anymore. I was wondering do you see any way how it fits in or do you think it was just something that was not a part of this? Can maybe you in some way straighten me out as to whether it's something that's more physiological oriented or more psychologically oriented? [0:18:26.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the trouble is with what it is in the first place. I really don't know what it is specifically you're talking about. See I know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I would have to be more explicit. Wouldn't I? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you would. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well as long as we're being honest, I might as well be explicit as possible. Alright. The first couple of times it happened, it was maybe a couple of years ago, and it was the first few times that I got stoned. It would happen during masturbation and it would involve fantasies and what one would think about during masturbation. It generally involved by body becoming feminine. I would have breasts and a vagina and would then as it were another body; I would be making love to it. It happened a couple of times and it didn't bother me too much because I was doing some strange things when I was stoned. The first couple of times I thought, well it's just something strange. But then it happened again and again. That's basically it. My breasts would definitely be erogenous; I guess that's the right word. My I identified it with erroneous or something. I don't know. It was only during masturbation and a couple of times I was really worried about it. I got stoned once as sort of a test, a little experiment, and went up to see June. I tried just to see if I was indeed, if my breasts were erogenous, and they weren't. So it was really comforting. [0:20:28.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By erogenous you mean that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it was a pleasing sensation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To touch them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Since then when I was with her it wasn't the case. It was fine. What pleases me is what normally pleases me. Then there was a little bit of a burden off of my shoulders and then came the observation that it only happened when I was stoned. I thought it was probably just heightened when I was stoned. But I think it might have happened once or twice but I doubt it. But that's basically it. Now the feelings that I had about it were, that's neither here nor there about whether you smoked or not, a lot of things are heightened. You're senses, smell, taste. I really eat. I get the munchies and I just love to eat. I eat until it hurts. Sexual things are also. Tactile senses for me are very much aroused. When it happened a couple of times it bothered me, and it still does, but maybe it's just a part of me that's there. That it's me but it only comes when I'm really tactilely aroused and behaving that way. Like a taste for avocados is me you know. But I don't like avocados normally like in a salad but maybe when I get stoned, their really great. And maybe that it's just something that has been chemically heightened in me. [0:22:23.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something that is there all the time that kind of lingers. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This is just one thought I had about it. I don't know if fear would be the right word or not. So the idea is, especially with thoughts going around now about sexual honesty, I mean a personal sexual honesty. That if a person is bisexual to be honest about it or transsexual. I don't know how the terms are exactly defined nor do I know how I was behaving. I should mention that I'm certain that I've never been attracted to a man. So that part doesn't bother me. [0:22:59.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ok. Let me say a little about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish you would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you tell me how it hits you know what I say. In the first place like lots and lots of people have fantasies about sex that they consider very strange. In other words, it isn't really abnormal to have like a normal fantasies like that. It's very common. Just having fantasies like that doesn't mean anything about being bisexual at all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh really. Oh wow. I definitely think my breasts were. I mean it was pleasing to the touch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't think that's terribly unusual either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that when people are in their 20's and so forth like there are a lot of problems with who am I? Am I masculine? Am I feminine and all this and my guess is this is a kind of thing like nobodies totally masculine, nobodies totally feminine. And for you to feel sexually like a woman or for say me or somebody to feel sexually like a man in certain ways is very much within the normal range of being heterosexual rather than bisexual. [0:24:42.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess looking back at it, it is almost exclusively fantasy. That was very comforting. Thank you. I don't know if it's completely alien to everything else that I'm talking about. I don't know. [0:25:13.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well see I don't think its alien. It probably expresses some part of you that everyone has a part that's sexually not in line with what's suppose to be culturally right. Everybody has those kinds of things and yours just happens to come out in that little way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I don't know. I can see what you mean. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me what I said so that I see if you get what I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well at least the most important thing, at least what went in there, is the fact that sexual fantasies are things that all people have that are not be treated too heavily if they are just fantasies. It can be strange and much more exotic and weird perhaps than mine. A person that behaves that way is not necessarily sexually deviant. That he's sexually normal because there is no real well defined normal. [0:26:29.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. That's what I meant. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's very good. I don't know whether I want to take this now and drag it in and now in this light see where it could possibly fit in or just say well lets just keep going and blunder busting our way through the rest of my life and if it crops up somewhere we'll see. I should point out, however, that I think I have. It's been a while since I've really had a good relationship with a chick, and I think it probably was at my most distraught time of not having been around a girl that I enjoyed, or that I just wanted to get attached to, that it began. [0:27:23.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That also makes a lot of sense. That sometimes happens. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course, since then, I guess I haven't been. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Since then you still don't have a relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had a real good talk, June and I. She said my timing is unbelievable because she would just be at the point. I hadn't talked to her for about a week, and she would just say, "If he doesn't call up by tomorrow night, I'll call him the next day in the afternoon." I slipped in just ahead. And she said a couple of times she has just been ready to throw me out but never has; which I really expected it but I hadn't ever noticed it in her. The way I was behaving, there was not way. I wonder what's going to come of it now. Now that I've been reasonably honest with her. I never did come out and say, "Look I'm just not attracted to you at all." I didn't say that. [0:28:22.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't go quite that far. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I really wanted to a couple of times I got the words in the back of my throat and I just couldn't spit them out. The closest that I could come was saying there's simply no way in the world that I was going to get serious that it was a very superficial type thing. Although we probably knew each other very well, that there would never be any real affection exchanged. I did explain too that in the past I have been more affectionate. Here's where the big lie came in. I didn't say then therefore the reason that I'm not that way is because I don't feel that way about her. But maybe I've changed and I don't feel that way about anybody anymore. But it's not too much of a lie because I don't really know which is sort of the nicest way to say it. That was probably about the most honesty I could come up with for one night. [0:29:24.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was something you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We can't do it all at once. Maybe I'll go back and see her again. Polish it all off. She's really an observant person. I'm amazed. There's a couple of other people I wanted to talk to about it. I just told her that I was going into therapy. I don't think I mentioned it to anyone else. It may have come out once when I was talking about the testing which I found quite fascinating. It was really fun. Were you associated with that at all or what that other people I was testing for? I mean the stories that I wrote and things like that. [0:30:04.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't seen them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were really cool. I mean I really enjoyed that. I didn't do well but I could see where I would really like to look at a cross section of population to see if you could tell what kind of a person is just by the stories that he wrote and things like that. I was expecting to see a picture. You know they give you 20 seconds to look at a picture and you write for four minutes or something. I was expecting to see an airplane crash on one side and a boat going on the other with two people making love in the front and in the background blueberries and chasing squirrels. All sorts of things. A guy walking down a street. You can't even tell it's a street. You can't see his face. Oh wow, just nothing on it. You couldn't squeeze anything out. You know I had a girl once, I think I was attracted to her because she was sort of my antithesis. She was really really scatterbrained. She would write a great story about something like that, however, I don't think I could. I couldn't see anything in it so I couldn't write anything. When I looked at the picture, I decided what I was going to do was get as much information as I could. Be a good investigator. Look at that picture and glean what information I could from it. [0:31:30.0]</p>

<p>In the first picture I saw there was only one possible bit of evidence that made it anything at all different and that was his hat brim was turned down a little bit more than normal. That's all I had. I didn't approach it with the idea with here's a man now construct a story. But here's a man, see what evidence you can get out of him to construct a story. Well it was interesting. There was one story that I'm still amazed about. I don't know if you know about it. It's there Olav Gunderson or something. The 6 foot 7, 270 pound guy from Finland who was racing in the midget car races and he's winning all the way. And he gets right towards the end and his car breaks down and he picks it up and carries it across the line. Now you've got to write a title for that story. There were just so many puns you know. The Fin Finished and the Giant Midget. I just didn't know what to do. There were just so many. Of course, I just knew that there were scores of people taking that test, so much better than I, that were coming up with great titles. [0:32:38.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking about the test you took here? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well excuse me for going off on a tangent. I thought it was quite interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if you're associated with that part of it at all. I think statistically looking into people's minds would be really fun. I don't know if I could handle individually looking into people's minds. [0:33:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But doing it with numbers and groups would be fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. To see like they have a bunch of cards and you put them in a certain order. The ones that are most like you in the center but it was already tuned to be a goshen. It all had nice tails on it and everything. My gosh talk about making the data conform to me. That's another thing that I would like to do. I think it would be really interesting to see how people listen. The thing that got me mad about that thing with the cards was that I put them down and after a few minutes, 10 or 15 minutes, there were just some I didn't know where to put. They just didn't apply at all but they were sort of like me but some of them sort of weren't. They were still really hard to define so I just put them somewhere. I thought oh thank goodness I finished with that. Then he comes out with the same deck of cards again and says to do it after therapy. I said, "What about these ones that were just borderline things that I might have put two from the end of the left and now they're two from the end on the right." Someone is going to think boy he's hoping for a big change there when it doesn't matter to me you know. Oh well. Does that come into our relationship at all or not? [0:34:28.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean will you ever look at any of that testing or was that done for other people?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the agreement is that I won't look at any of the testing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. Because I was very happy to do that. It was interesting. Testing like that can be fun. I don't know how...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the idea is that I'm not supposed to see your tests so that I'm not biased or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What you know about me then is just what transpires in here? [0:35:03.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I know about you is what I see of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right on the tape recorder. How about that. Well well. Well let's see what should we go in to. I'll go through my notes once more. Oh yeah. She said one other thing. That there is a complete difference, not a difference they're the same thing but opposite ends of the spectrum, closing off and being a snob. She said that when she noticed me do at the party I was just closing off and not interacting. But when she has ever tried to do the same thing or other people she's seen do it, they act snobbish about it. So that kind of pleased me in the fact that if I do behave this way, I won't behave snobbish. The thing she mentioned was that other times that I've interacted, I haven't interacted honestly. For a very weak analogy, I put up a mirror and people interact and see what they want to see in me. That I'm behind that mirror and they never really see me. [0:36:20.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They see certain aspects of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I use the word mirror, I mean I reflect what they want to see so therefore...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You show them the parts of you that fit them but they're looking for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now this other idea of closing off that I've done now, is to just stay closed off and pull down the mirror. I just deny they're act. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like just not let them see any of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So really you see there's no great change in the amount of incite they might glean about my character. There is a great change in the amount of information that they're getting from me. [0:37:08.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Because they never were getting any incite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. That's why I'm amazed that June this incite. I really am. Of course when I think about it, she is as far as circles of friends is concerned, she's with this older circle of people but she lives right near me in South shore. So she knows those people down there. Plus she's seen me interacting with some old high school friends on several occasions which I suppose are the people that I grew up with. I don't know how you behave with the people you grew up with whether you're honest or dishonest. It's certainly a different part of me. I don't know if everyone does but I have one person sort of in each little bulk of my life that is still a remnant there. I can just go back to that part of my life and behave that way. [0:38:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Become that person in that world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fortunately though kindergarten on up to high school the guy I grew up with, my closest buddy, is still in Illinois med school. I see him quite frequently. That's a great relationship because it gives you a constancy. A contact with the past. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A sense of continuation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Wait a minute now. That doesn't fit at all into this idea about living alone. Oh maybe it does. Because, the thing that I'm thinking about now is the fact that the idea of being alone is so that I look at something myself and don't rely on anyone else and maybe that's why I'm being more introspective and trying to figure things out. Trying to figure out why I behave the way I do. Whereas before I was always interacting so there was never any time or reasoning to slow up. But if I've got this guy, this friend Tim, I might as well name him too, it might be considered sort of a crutch that he's still there. [0:39:18.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Depending on him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can still resort back to that lie if that is indeed a lie. Although I think probably that's probably least a lie because it's hard to lie to someone you've grown up with; who knows about you. One of the most different things that ever happened to me, I had this friend of mine, Tim, and a guy from by college in Ryder, were in town at the same time. At that time my closest friend here was the roommate that moved away. One of my favorite people. A really good guy. For some reason, they all three were at supper, and I was there too of course... [0:40:07.7] 
THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. That must have been a little confusing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [laughter] That's true, but I don't think. I think the greatest change is then, of course, the guy I knew greatest amount of time. However, because I kept this contact up, we've grown together, me and Tim. So he knows where I am now. You know, I see him every now and then. I see him a couple of times a month. So he knows how I behave now because he knows how I was back then too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. So, in a sense your relationship with Tim is honest, it's pretty honest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. Yeah. Although, he but now, you know, honest and really one last thing and really affectionate. We just really enjoy each other's company. We get along great. We like the same sort of things. But not very deep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, although I don't think that's an indictment against how I behaved with it. I think Tim is not a deeply emotional person. He doesn't get involved in things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's a good relationship. It's fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's, you know, honest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it lacks something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [42:13]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish I could get those people. That would be great to have them, the three of them make observations and take notes and. To see what they have to say. Oh, by the way, I mentioned my roommate too, the one who spends time with Michelle. He's back in town and he noticed, he's noticed a change over the last few months. He said to me once, a couple of weeks ago, he thought I was mad at him because I hadn't said anything lately. And I guess that's the way that I get mad. I just get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quiet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Quiet, yeah. And, I said no, no, nothing at all. And then just the other day he mentioned that I got really quiet. And I, it probably is not too profound an observation because I have been studying a lot though. When you get on a roll, when you are hitting the books.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, so, yeah, one thing. It sounds too like you feel like you are getting more introspective and spending more time thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I definitely spend more time thinking but, I. You know, honestly, I went off, I feel that, I feel a great. It's a burden. It's a burden to really have to think to come here and talk for an hour, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I enjoy it, when I get here except when I get to the spot where I say that's it and I don't have anywhere else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anywhere else to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Or that I had seven profound thoughts for today and that's seven, kid, you're not getting anymore. So when I get to that point it's kind of awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not getting what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're not getting anymore. That's all I've got. But you know, I really do. I really want to approach it conscientiously so that when I, I am thinking about myself. I am really thinking a lot about coming here to talk about something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like what you are saying is that it is hard work or it sounds like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like in that you like that because you want to work hard but sometimes it's a heavy thing too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's also. It's all that I can come up with in a couple of days. And that they are not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe they're not deep enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not significant enough. Is that what you mean or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, observations, maybe I've got [inaudible at 44:43]. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't count on your observations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. You see not having been honest with myself for so long, it's hard to say why I've done certain things or what is a good observation and what isn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. As you say, it's really a new thing that you are trying, to be honest, and it's not so easy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not so simple.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I. Thinking about that party the other night. I was really at ease when I first got there. I think I really probably enjoyed that, being quiet. Not interacting with a lot of people and I wonder now if that's what is going to happen. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you get more quiet, in tune with yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, just, I mean when I think about it, that's about all [unintelligible at 45:43] really. Other than the things that [unintelligible at 45:50]. It's a definite possibility. It's, I probably, shortly either, hopefully not within the next couple of months but certainly within the next couple years I'd like to go into a new environment again. Either because I didn't pass the test or because I got my degree after I passed the test. And, it would really be interesting to see what I do, you know, the first couple of contacts. Whether I'm, well, I doubt that I'll do that. I really do. I'll probably develop [unintelligible at 46:26] and be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty much active?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much active, yeah. Interacting a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not sure, it's like you are changing at this point but you are not sure what will happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like. I'm looking forward to living alone. That's something that really is different now and if this trend continues, I could conceive of being very different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very different. I think a lot of people would be surprised if they saw me now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. If they saw you being more by yourself and introspective?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that wasn't the kind of person that they knew, right? They didn't know you had that side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, like I said. No one knows anything about me. Much less myself. Much less I. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. Every time I make an observation, I think that's a [unintelligible at 47:32] thing to say and I wonder why. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it doesn't quite fit the pattern?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know I don't know whether I'm at this stage of the game groping for evidence or going for different conclusions. Unless I get a conclusion and I can go back over the evidence which is just horribly confused now in the back of my mind. Well, I'll just, I'll just play it by ear and keep growing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't quite get what you meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the. I, well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I do get is like it says, it is very confusing, all the evidence, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But I don't, you see, I don't, when I go, as I skip through this stream of consciousness thing, I am skipping. Initially I was skipping from observation, observation, observation. And then gradually I stopped to. Well, no, I should have said, not observation. Yes, just turned off that fast. And then I'd come to some deep conclusion about it. About the observations and facts. And then hope that maybe these facts will fit this conclusion. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and now I am wondering if maybe I'm going from conclusion to conclusion to conclusion. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Changing it as you see the facts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you see what you do is you develop a Goshen curve and you plot the number of conclusions against the number of observations and see how. You see what my training has done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. I see what you are saying</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are looking at the way that you are looking at yourself and seeing yourself changing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I step back for a second and see what the trend develops.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it seems to be a, well, that I'm getting more and more conclusions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really didn't, I'm balancing something out here. Do people mostly come as often as I do or not as often or what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They mostly come once or twice a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I really like to think longer than between Monday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, we have this burden, don't we?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there is a time limit. How would Monday and Thursday be? Is that any better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would probably be quite a bit better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, why don't we do it that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't think between now and then, two days from now, that I will be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay and then we could easily do it once a week if the [inaudible at 50:28], that would be ideal. Let's try it Monday and Thursday. Let me see. Let me call upstairs and see what time I have appointments on Thursdays. Hi, Beth, do I have any appointments on Thursday morning? Okay. Yeah, I do have one right now. We are setting up schedule. Not down there, huh. Hm. Um. Well, I hope I'm not getting myself confused here. Okay, good-by. Why don't we set up an appointment for, I think, 10:00 o'clock Thursday would be okay. I hope that's.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it isn't, just let.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll let you know. Okay, fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My schedule is quite flexible. Will that be regular then?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll wait and see. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So 10:00 then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Right. I'll try to have more insights at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughter]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'll talk to June and get some more from her. Okay, bye. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye-bye. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and tired. [Pause]. I've been waking up between like 4:00 and 5:00 like every single night for like four weeks now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And sometimes it lasts for like five or ten minutes and then sometimes it lasts for like two hours...what happened last night. And I think it is the SSRI...at least that's what my psychiatrist thinks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which one are you taking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm taking Zoloft. [Pause]. So that's what the fatigue is. I'm overwhelmed because I don't like the distracting and sort of tiring process of taking medication and adjusting to it and thinking about whether it's useful or...[pause]...even like noticing little things that make you feel like you're taking medication. Like the little brain twitches. [Pause].</p>

<p>[01:52]</p>

<p>I heard once that in...[pause] the 60's and 70's it was people who were trying to pursue a meditation practice were sort of discouraged from being in psychotherapy because they were thought to be achieving overlapping goals and that you really needed to be sort of...it needed to be the meditation practice that was the primary like fear and listener. But that is outdated and no one really believes that, at least from like 50 the teachers that I've heard from. </p>

<p>But now like the latest wave of that is like that meditation interferes with like really trying to see things for what they are. [Pause] And they don't believe that either at this particular place. But it occurred to me recently that maybe that's part of why it's overwhelming for me because I'm not only trying to sort out my own reactions and sort of deeper internal [pause] states, but also like what's this stomach ache from? Why do I feel like wide awake in the middle of the night but extremely tired? [Pause].</p>

<p>[04:00]</p>

<p>Anyway, so that's overwhelming and I was pleased yesterday because I sort of said to the psychiatrist I can't really do anymore changes right now so even if the Zoloft might be not a good match in terms of sleep, the next change I want to make is to not take any medication and see what that's like. I'm not ready to do that this moment either. So and she was totally agreeable to all of that and thought that I should just do what I want to do and know that there is a very very...she is very accessible to me should I want to see her and switch to medication number four or get more of a prescription for one of the three that I've tried or talk about what it's like to not be on medication and that she thought that all of those things were wise should I, depending on what I feel. So that was good. [Pause].</p>

<p>[05:20]</p>

<p>I'm overwhelmed for two other reasons. The first is my lab work, which is sort of settled; it's the nature of science. I figured; I got an interesting result a little while ago and had been trying to repeat it and the repeating it hasn't been very satisfying. I haven't been happy with the quality of any of those experiments and I don't know; I feel unresolved about that. So I'm not going to talk about it. Maybe I'll talk about it later.</p>

<p>The third issue or the third thing that's making me overwhelmed is therapy. And the only reason I can be like somewhat articulate here now is because I've like talked about for like hours this week to various different people and thought about it a lot. [Pause]. </p>

<p>[06:34]</p>

<p>So I think the two days in a row is really really intense. I think one day is really really intense, and I think two days in a row is too much. But I didn't want to just like go with that and change it for this week, because I'm not sure what those feelings are coming from; where those feelings are coming from. </p>

<p>So I think therapy is seeming overwhelming because it's like...it feels like the biggest thing in my life at times. [Pause]. It feels like a very totalizing experience. And I think...I realize that partly when [pause]...like the therapy itself became a possible unit of discussion and thought. [Pause] </p>

<p>[08:04]</p>

<p>The fatigue; it's like interfering with... [Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: You talked about dreams being interesting to you. I've sort of had like a dream this whole time too. I've sort of been trying to keep track of them, but so I need to know what about the dreams would be helpful to talk about because any kind of writing, documentation activity right before or after sleeping is not really compatible with like how late I am always and how tired I am. So if you could maybe give me some guidelines as to what aspect of the dreams are...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever you can remember or whatever comes to mind is fine. You don't have to do anything extra. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So like...okay. So I've dreamt about therapy three times in the last week and dreamt about tons of other stuff too, but this is the first time that therapy has come up in my dreams and I couldn't remember the second dream was, but the latest dream, which was last night was that my parents and my brother came with me, which was very cute and not surprising. </p>

<p>[10:04]</p>

<p>The first dream was that you and I were in some therapy like meeting room and you were like, "I want you to talk to this other therapist that's...who's like...who I respect and who I think would be useful to talk to." Like I sat down with her and she's like, "Ethan told me that July was a month of hyperbole and anxiety for you." And those were all the specific words that I remember. And I remember it being this very like scary experience. Almost like I was being evaluated or something. I don't remember; it was like a dream. [Pause.]</p>

<p>And I wish I could give you like the list of other dreams because these dreams didn't like really stick out in any way other than they're...the fact that they were sort of about a new topic. So I might try to do that for next week...to contextualize like what else do I dream about. My family comes up a lot. [Pause]</p>

<p>[12:13]</p>

<p>I feel like I want to be led in talking right now because I'm forgetting, not feeling like I have all of the...[Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're feeling, for starters, terribly overwhelmed including by, I mean especially these days by things that are happening here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I kind of like it. Like I still look forward to coming here and I still...I think I'm crying because I'm tired. I'm not like feeling...[pause]...well, whatever. So I like the; I like the intensive aspect of my own like insights and your insights and the exploration that happens. And I don't know. It's like fascinating and I'm like asking all these people inappropriate questions about their therapy because I'm just like really curious about it. </p>

<p>[14:11]</p>

<p>Jeremy told me yesterday, "I'm not going to be as open as you are about my therapy." Because I was trying to ask him one question further than was appropriate. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you want to know? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said how is your session with Rachel today, and he said it was good. And he usually doesn't say it was good. He usually says, "It was okay." Or he'll tell me a specific insight that he thought was interesting or weird or something. So I just; I should have stopped there in his eyes. Then I was like, "What was good about it?" He said, "If I have something to tell you then I will, but I'm not going to be as open as you are." And I said, "Well, to be honest, I'm just super curious about therapy right now. I don't actually feel like prying actually. Like I don't need to know because I love you and I need to know what's happening in your therapy. It's just like you're a person in therapy that I talk to, so I want to know what's happening in your therapy." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also had the impression...[pause]... you want to know things about what's going on in, let's say, his therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For my understanding. She did tell me. That was useful. Or comforting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that was, I guess, what I had in mind because...partly because of some things with her. You care about her and what is going on for her, but there's something else about wanting to be comforted or reassured by knowing what's going on in her therapy or Jeremy's.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More so that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there isn't too much. I show that I love these people in other ways. I don't have to know what they talk about in therapy.</p>

<p>[16:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I brought it up to Linda exactly as that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and...[Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because it's sort of this like strange experience and no one really talks about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And Linda is a great person to talk to because she...she treats most things as an objective study and it's so nice to just hear her analysis of anything she's been through in her life. Sort of maybe the way that people might experience talking to me. I think I do the same thing, but she's a religion student and obviously writes and reads an awful lot, so she's got this cool literary way of talking about all of this. So I knew that asking her about something like this would...that I would just get a whole lot...like a structured argument; an analysis and that sort of...I was just looking for some...another person's impression of the phenomenon. [Pause].</p>

<p>[18:46]</p>

<p>And her...I think hers in particular, and I think she...I was able to find a lot of things in common with her analysis. But I couldn't quite like put together the words myself. I started all of them and then she would sort of finish the thought because it's still very fresh for me. [Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that therapy for you is feeling like an equally or maybe even more intense dress rehearsal where you come in and you really put yourself out there in an open and honest and spontaneous and kind of intimate way. And then in here, even, I guess more so than in general, so. What you hear back doesn't necessarily reassure you or allay your anxiety about what you put out there or how it reflects on you. [Pause].</p>

<p>[21:12] </p>

<p>CLIENT: The confidence is a really different...in a really different place, so I'm really comfortable and confident about my own ability to be introspective even if you say things that I've never thought about before. So I feel like I can communicate extremely free in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That makes sense to me and I can see how that's different from jazz rehearsal. [Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aside from that, yeah, I guess it's...jazz rehearsal, I can sort of like forget after it's over. [Pause] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine there's a lot that you'd want to know about what I think about you and what you've said. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I can't really forget therapy. That's what I meant about it being totalizing. [Pause.] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kind of...the things that happen or that we talk about that you say that I say like they really stick with you like that and they...are you very focused on that now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and just the potential. Not necessarily exactly what is said, but they do stick with me. Just like when I was watching The Wire, I talked all day about the characters in The Wire, and I just finished a book yesterday and miss it very dearly and think about what happens next. I've gotten pretty attached to people and their stories. So it's not unusual for me to be thinking about my interpersonal relationships a lot. But more than that, it's the...it sort of feels like a grand stage and I don't really mean that in the performative way, but more like this like theater where it's like a super set of all the other things they do in my life. So it encompasses everything, or it could. [Pause].</p>

<p>[24:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we could talk about anything here. [Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. And I imagine also bringing things together or find, to even find aspects of things that have previously seemed separate. [Pause.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like Sarah and my mom did it all. Linda got it, but she's got more similarities...way more than I did. Between her and my mother, I've been just sticking to the edge. [Pause]. </p>

<p>She remembers that my relationship with my mom was a little more adversarial in high school than it has been since. And I don't remember those days. I don't remember that aspect of our relationship . I know that it was there, but I don't remember it about like...anyway. Yeah, this sort of unifying potential. [Pause].</p>

<p>And it's not so much like focused on you, it's more...it's like you're a part of it, but a lot of it is also like what my own role in it seems pretty grand. [Pause]. I have to decide what to say. I have to decide how to say it. [Pause]. I realize things, but I don't realize like elsewhere. And then like I think about like all the things for like the rest of the week. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[26:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of what you're saying that this has become super important, super meaningful to you super quickly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Um [pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's something kind of frightening about that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess it's sort of like how I...how things become important to me like when I started meditation, that was like all I could talk about, and I read a bunch about it and I told everybody about it and I asked them stuff ...[pause]...besides present as new, as my latest thing. And maybe this is sort of become that in a way. And that happens with everything, with swimming and like painting pots. I started painting my terracotta pots a couple of weeks ago and I was looking for my own creative activity and...so it's sort of an unfamiliar feeling to be really like honing in on this and getting it a lot of weight and importance. </p>

<p>[28:49]</p>

<p>I don't think that it's necessarily super important in the way that like I need it or want it really badly. Like I don't...I think I have a lot of mixed feelings, but it has become super influential or just sort of is dominating. More dominating and influential. Really quickly, yes. [Pause].</p>

<p>And just to give you a sense like [pause]. Jeremy has started to say stop talking about therapy. I don't want to hear more. Not necessarily about my own therapy, but reading about it and just talking about it. [Pause]. So imagine that will die down like it did with meditation and then I'll reach some equilibrium that feels more comfortable. </p>

<p>But yeah, with mediation it didn't feel overwhelming or scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression is that with most things like the plots too, it doesn't. </p>

<p>[30:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, it doesn't. But clearly this is very different. [Pause]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I've been thinking about...I'm trying to figure out what's still not so clear as to me why that is. [Pause]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it doesn't feel like an activity. [Pause]. Like a recreational activity or...it does feel like an enrichment. [Pause]. Enrichment but I think it takes a lot of emotional energy. [Pause]. </p>

<p>[32:33]</p>

<p>And I guess I...maybe there's some aspect of like wanting to be good at it or wanting to feel like I'm giving it a fair shot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe also wanting to figure it out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How it works, what to do? [Pause]. Yeah, as well as it could have been more kind of explicit past in the way of like figuring out what's going on with you or what you're thinking about and then also just wanting to figure out how therapy works or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. It's also kind of [pause]...it's kind of exhilarating because it's always sort of a surprise what I'm going to talk about and what you might have to say about it and how I might feel after. And I don't think most things are that surprising. And I could see if I had like a very deep seated, you know, issue that I had been battling with for many many years, but maybe there would be some element of like knowing what was the thing to talk about, but that's not really the case. So I just talk about whatever I talk about and don't necessarily expect there to be parallels and sometimes there are and that's sort of...sometimes that's kind of like a treat. But at the same time, if it really sticks with me and changes the way that I'm viewing things; yeah, it has the potential to like influence everything. So that's...and it has. In some...sometimes it has, so that's kind of different from the other activities. Plus if there's like this whole structure, like meditation is something that I have to be pretty self driven about. And in some sense, I've made a commitment to another person in therapy. [Pause]. So it has a bigger presence. [Pause]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's a big sense of obligations or...in a relationship in way that there isn't, but...than in meditation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's pretty reflective of my value of people. I mean for some other people like meditation could be much...a much more dominant activity because it's driven entirely by the self and it's a solitary thing. Solitary activities that never had that much weight for me as not solitary activities I guess. Probably the yoga. [Pause]. </p>

<p>[37:31]</p>

<p>But in a sense this feels solitary, like I don't...I don't know. [Pause].</p>

<p>I feel less overwhelmed having talked about it already. [Pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also...I have the impression that one aspect of what you're saying—and I'm not sure whether this is something that on a kind of rational actual level you would sort of be this way or if this is coming from some other way that you're experiencing things here. But one aspect of what you're saying is something like that I'm doing things here or conducting things in a way that can be hurtful or overwhelming to you. [Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...[Pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that...[pause]..that would be hurtful somehow.. [Pause].</p>

<p>[40:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to imagine like a different person and personality type and if it would be any different. [Pause]. I think if I had a really talkative woman who was more ...[pause]. I don't know if this exists though. Maybe...I think in some sense if I felt like I was...I don't think the woman part is that important, but it's like the type of person I'm imagining, I don't know that many men...[pause]. Yeah, maybe like more...of a...I'm your pal dynamic would be less...I don't feel hurt. I don't think hurtful is the right word, but maybe less...[pause]...maybe like more; there would be more lubrication for the...like if you imagine that you're sort of like going on this road and like here are a bunch of bumps and turns and you don't really know where it's going to be maybe more like cushioning, if there is a...[pause]. </p>

<p>[43:17]</p>

<p>I...[pause].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't really explain it. I guess I'm imagining like a...sort of more talkative...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Casual?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Casual; lots of [inaudible 43:35]. But I don't think I want that. I think I want to come to a pretty objective place. So I'm not wishing that I had a more, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it sounds like what you're saying is there would be things that would be easier about that. It might not at all be, although it would be a lot, but just to sort of drive this point, it sounds like you're saying that kind of a chatty, casual...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe people...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe women. [Pause]. Would I sort of facilitate this or I guess make you feel more at ease. [Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, sure. That's true. I don't I want that though. I think I would grow more tired of the person if they were that way. If there is more of their personality and their thoughts. Because like, you know, unless they were like completely compatible, it seems like the nature of this stuff isn't so much about like what you say or how you say it, at least, but maybe it is. [Pause].</p>

<p>My friend Kate told me many weeks ago that her therapist is like so chatty and talks a whole lot. And I remember thinking, "Oh, that would be nice." But...[pause], yeah. [Pause]. There's plenty of that in my life. [Pause].</p>

<p>[46:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would that facilitate or lubricate you think? [Pause].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe there would just be more hand holding. [Pause]. And reassurance that...[pause]...things were going to be okay. [Pause]. I'm not sure that anybody has that power to really reassure me that things are going to be okay other than myself. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess you're worried. [Pause]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause].</p>

<p>[48:02]</p>

<p>Jeremy shared a thought with me a while ago, but he was not really worried, but sometimes he has some fears and he expressed it and I got married to you and it broke you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yikes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And we both laughed a lot about that because it was sort of this really sudden shift...[pause]...that neither of us could have anticipated. But that's sort of like the sentiment that I sometimes go back to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well let me stop for now. And so I guess as I understand so we're on for tomorrow as usual, but do you want...my schedule is actually changing some in the next couple of weeks or two. Do you want me to try to find a time so that we're not going back to back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that would be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'll try to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mondays at 9:15; is that still open? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will look. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't really feel that strongly about getting in to lab early on Mondays because I'm not doing it anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'll look for something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel pretty secure in my [inaudible 49:55] lab, so you can...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: At least right now, that's not important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No problem. See you. </p>

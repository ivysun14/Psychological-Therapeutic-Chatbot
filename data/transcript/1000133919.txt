<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client Grogan, interview 4. This is Client Grogan, interview 4. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is this the place that you're supposed to sit? Or do you just, I mean I can't remember if I was told to sit here or not. I was wondering about that. For no reason at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean there is no, I don't remember telling you to sit there but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wondered. I don't know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. All right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the microphone's there. I suppose that would be..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you prefer to sit over there, is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this chair is very comfortable. No, I just, I don't know why I wondered that. That just popped into my head on the way here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe all the time you've been sitting in the wrong place? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God, yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd tell you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, ok. I have to go through this thing. I haven't had a cigarette since I after school. (inaudible at 0:02:00.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You trying to cut down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't know why I didn't have one. Anyway, I'm craving one right now. So excuse me for a minute. I don't know what to talk about today, at all. I'm stalling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feels like you don't really have anything to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that. And then I think that I'm just repressing. Because it's just, completely dependent on whatever mood I'm in. I guess if I'm depressed I feel like talking about it. And if I'm not, I don't want to get depressed because I do want to talk about things that I think are problems. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And right now you're feeling pretty good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling very medium.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Medium but not, but certainly not in a place where you want to start dragging yourself down. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I tell myself that I, that's a, I don't know. I don't know what word to use. Bad or wrong or, anyway the reaction to that isn't good. You shouldn't get, I shouldn't get depressed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When talking about stuff that bothers you. Like you should be able to do that and not be pulled under. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not, yeah, yeah I should. I'm not exactly objective right now. I should be happy that I'm talking about it. Or trying to do something about it instead of feeling depressed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of, instead of getting depressed about the content of what you're talking about, you should sorta feel positively about the process which you're doing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yes. And I also was feeling on the way here, now I can't give you a specific one at all, but I was feeling that, oh I'm sure that I'm not, I feel like I'm being honest here but I'm not being frank or complete or something. And I think that's because you're over there and you're a human being and I don't want you to pass judgment on what I say. Something that I think is, I don't know what. Wrong. Or what I think I shouldn't want or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying something like, so far as you're going you're being honest. It isn't that you're lying. But it's like you're holding back parts of you..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would take that (inaudible at 0:04:54.0) you would want me to. That would have a bad impact on you. 0:04:57.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really think so. I know that it's happened several times but I don't know what the times were. But I remember thinking as I was sitting here that I didn't want to say whatever I was thinking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's not helpful to me I don't think, to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like you'd be better off if you could kinda come clean with what you're thinking when you're thinking it. But it sounds like that's sort of my, I don't know what exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm, it's like, yeah, I'm ashamed. That's what it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are the things you're ashamed of like, feel sacred to you. [Comfortable to keep to yourself.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Sure. Like I, I'll feel the feeling like I'm wasting you're time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like right now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I'm really trying to think of something to say. I really am. 0:07:05.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're mind's a blank and it's important, will be important for me to know that it isn't that you're not trying it's just that nothing's coming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. You know I don't want you to think I'm unproductive. Or not trying to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you're not being bad or something by association. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's a good association. When I feel depressed I feel like I'm down too, I think. (inaudible at 0:08:07.3) I knew that this was going to happen. And I didn't want to come because I knew this was going to happen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like I invited a case of stage fright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not wanting to go out there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: God, I'm going sit there for how long with absolutely nothing to say. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly, I was feeling that the hour was going to be torturous. Long and torturous</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sorta pain, minute by minute or..0:09:01.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Usually it goes very quickly but I felt that it was going to be horrible. The last time I was here it, at the very end it went very foolishly and I don't remember why. I wanted to get out of here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Couldn't say it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Should I have said that? That I wanted to get out of here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That as well as what was important to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know which was most important to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I meant if that feeling was like uppermost for you..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was uppermost. See nothing, nothing traumatic especially happened to me. So I'm going to have to think of something that I probably don't want to talk about. But I don't know what that is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't help, for me anyway. Ok so nothing, no catastrophe has happened since Thursday, or Tuesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why does that mean then you have to..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I, there's nothing fresh on my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I understand that. So you're going to sorta, I hear you say something like I'm going to have to back to something that isn't recent or fresh for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what doesn't follow for me is like how come that has to be something you don't want to talk about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it must be because I can't think of it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Oh. It must be because you can't think of it and that means you must be repressing it.0:11:01.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I think. That's not actually, that's not correct. Maybe I really am wasting my time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a sense that you're not tying yourself in knots, sort of thrashing or chasing your tail or ..</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now, yeah. You know like spinning your wheels or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel, yeah, I just feel, I feel like I should perform. I guess that's it. I'm getting upset. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really is stage fright. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought that it wouldn't be like, it shouldn't be like this. I mean I (inaudible at 0:12:13.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Do you think that feeling will go away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But here you are, like starting all over again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.. These thoughts are going through my head. Let's see. My mother. I don't have anything to say at the moment about my mother, ok. My boyfriend. I talk about my boyfriend all the time. I don't have anything new to say about him. I'm editing. 0:13:03.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't hear what you're saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I'm editing all these things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's no good, that's no good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everything winds up on the cutting room floor. Still, right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I guess if I don't have a script to follow I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Without some sort of prior notion about which thoughts are worthwhile, it sorta seems like none of them seem particularly worthwhile.0:14:13.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get that feeling if I said something like talk about your childhood, or talk about your feelings about sex, or talk about your feelings about power. I'm going through different kinds of personality theories. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like then it would feel all right for you. But there's something about inside being a kinda uncharted area and all of the teams equally unimportant. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, if you told me to talk about something I'm sure I would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like without that direction, it's just (inaudible at 0:15:01.2)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. You, I think, even when I'm alone I think sometimes when I have nothing else to do I'm like, it's like I'm thinking, I'm acting out a part of what a single girl should do when she's alone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, things I've read in stupid magazines or a book or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like even when you're alone and there's none watching you, there's someone watching you. 0:15:36.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know about the watching but I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. But it's like even when you're alone like not, like not being really you, even when you're alone. But like being, I don't know, a woman with no companion. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I feel like I live by my feelings and sometimes I feel like I live by what I think I should do. I don't know which time, no, usually I know when I'm doing what I think I should do. Usually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not that you, usually it's not that you confuse what you should do with what you feel. 0:16:59.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like, like you were saying something like, ok or that's right. But also like there are many times when you wound up doing, doing what you ought to do in somebody else's script. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, sure. A lot of times. I don't feel that, you do that for other people though. You don't do that for yourself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The only thing that I was picking up on was you said, "Even when I'm alone."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or is that different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boy, I can't even remember. No it's like what do I feel like doing. And then sometimes I feel like doing this. And I know that I'm doing this because I don't know what I would do if I didn't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people watch TV when they want to, or something. 0:18:18.1</p>


<p>COUNSELOR: I'm having trouble following this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So am I. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me, let me, let me try, try this though and see. Is there something in there like feeling (inaudible at 0:18:47).1 people like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I know for sure that I used to. For sure I used to think that this stuff, I don't know, sometimes it's between 18 and 20 this stuff (inaudible at 0:19:09.2) that not that long ago. That everything that I did or that happened was for, and this wasn't religious at all. This was for a reason because somewhere along the line I was going to do something special. I don't know. 0:19:35.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's true that everything's a preparation. I mean all living is a learning experience therefore it's preparation but that's not what I thought. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I got what you mean. You mean like being chosen specially and not religious. Not like God necessarily but like fate or something another or whatever the mind is unclear but, specially picked out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Like, you know like a scientist or something, everything that happens all of a sudden they decided to go scientist. Like that though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah and it never happened. I suppose I grew disenchanted with that. Maybe that's the way I used to rationalize things, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I look, I look back on myself like five years ago and I don't really know what I was like really. I mean I cannot remember a lot of my feelings and things but I think that they were a lot different. I really think that being around this one man for so long really changed things or you know. Sorry I, I don't know how I was. 0:21:13.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Sounds like being born five years ago or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know that's not really true but... That has nothing to do with this at all. I mean, I don't even care about that. I feel like I'm, let's see, I'm cooking a dinner and it's turning out real bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I want to finish that for you. The next part is that I keep on cooking. I curse. I burn the soup and then I burn the, and I'm still doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah, I still, I haven't ruined dessert yet. For sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come you're burning everything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Hmm. Because I want to, let's see, I don't know if I want this to be worthwhile or if I want to not waste your time. It might be that I don't want to waste your time even more than I want this to be worthwhile. Yeah, maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it may, it sounds like you're saying it may have more to do with me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. It has to do with you but it has to do with me too. Maybe I'm disgusted with myself. Yeah I am. 0:23:38.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disgusted with yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm feeling like I'm failing again. Why? I was thinking yesterday that, I told myself that I had about two months. And within two months I should straighten myself out. Because that's all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aw, I felt like I wasn't going to do it. Like I shouldn't even try. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Like it was really hopeless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hopeless so why try at all? 0:24:58.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And now I'm not trying at all. Right now. No I'm not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like bad. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like listless, sounds like. I'm listless so what the hell? 0:26:10.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I am. I'd come back from my grandmother's Saturday on the train and I got, actually nauseous from worrying about my boyfriend. But I mean I think I know why. It's from, it was a learned response. The other one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But whatever the reason for it, it sounds like worrying about it will make you sick. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was. Oh yeah. I didn't think that was worth talking about. That's why I didn't say it before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Not very important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I just thought it was stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like that's something that shouldn't be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if it should be, there's no reason to talk about it. It's not justified to talk about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It was a stupid thing so why talk about that with you? 0:27:48.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to seem stupid in here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. (chuckles) I'm disintegrating. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I want to sink into the chair. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like not disintegrating so much. It's like embarrassed or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you embarrassed about? Or uncomfortable about..0:29:17.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm uncomfortable. Because I don't know what to do. I don't have anything to say. Maybe I'll go out and create a trauma before Thursday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really experience yourself under some hell of a pressure to say something, sounds like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it. I feel if I just sit here, that's silly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. The taxi meter is ticking away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, well it is silly. I could have stayed at home and slept. (chuckles) Instead of coming here to say nothing. I'm alternating between feeling very depressed and very flippant. 0:30:29.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And both things are (inaudible at 0:30:35.9) because I'm uncomfortable. I'm embarrassed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't like yourself either way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's like the depression is because I don't like myself. And the flippant seems because I'm being, oh what the hell. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's like, that's like giving up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think of similar situations but I must be like this all the time, I don't know. I know that if I can't do something right away I don't usually want to do it. That's for sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do? I mean that's, do you mean something like that's like in here, like not being able to come up with something right away? 0:31:41.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wow. I just had a feeling for you feeling like pins or something. Like here it is one minute after five and you don't have anything to say and just anticipating the other 45 or 50 minutes worth and you feel absolutely trapped. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's kinda similar to that. I guess I feel there's nothing to say about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sit here and watch you and one thing that occurs to me is I'm wondering is it like nothing very important about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I can't of anything important to say. That's correct. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I never feel important. But I don't know I feel worthless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling worthless now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not yet. But I'm getting there. 0:33:10.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like this is really a negative, negative compulsory experience for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're sorta getting, feeling more and more something, lousy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I am. I am. Sometimes though I feel like that in here, then I go outside and I think about things that were said and then it's ok. Sometimes, I mean like when I think about things, you know, like all the way home. That's all right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Sounds like sometimes what happens in here is mostly outside. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Sure. Because I don't want to say some things to you. Must be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in parallel, it sounds like, like you kinda take what goes on in here and then when you get outside, like plug it in or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mind is really closed. When I take a test, usually I do well on tests and my mind opens up. (inaudible at 0:34:41.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that? Concentration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't mean concentration. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought that struck something off in you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it did. I thought that was the wrong choice of words when I said it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But something, anyway, something about the humanist of the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the opposite of taking a test. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm really bored with talking about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like going home and calling the people that I know that have had therapy and asking what to do. That's the truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're like having to get through the script.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what you're supposed to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I can't do it by myself because I don't know what... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something that you'd like from me? (inaudible at 0:36:14.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but yeah, I mean I really don't want you to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. But go with the other side for a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I'm not clear. It's like, you'd like me to tell you what to talk about. You can't do that by yourself? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not that you, you're right because it doesn't seem important to me. For sure. If you thought that it was important then maybe it would take on a kind of importance. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Is it when you say something that it seems like I don't treat what you say as important? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean your, like your physical, facial, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean like when you say something, does it seem to you that when I respond to you that I seem to like dismiss it as being..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't think you do that. I think that's in my head. 0:37:08.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just wanted to check out whether you..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No I really don't think you do. No, you don't bring this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or fall asleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I keep looking for you to fall asleep too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Kinda like you're wasting my time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I don't know why I feel that what I have to say is not worthwhile. But I really guess that I do that. A lot of times when I talk, after I've said something, not necessarily here but sometimes, "Oh, I think that was really stupid to say that." And maybe nobody else thinks that. I mean nobody's told me. 0:38:18.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one's said, "Oh, that was a dumb thing to say."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just really think that it was stupid and I shouldn't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the way you're saying it makes it sound like you're the only one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Maybe that, maybe they're thinking that underneath. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know a lot about a lot of things. That's why I don't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you're saying. Like (overlapping)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm talking about general conversation. General conversation. I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're not a sparkling conversationalist. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true probably. It's about things I think are inane.0:39:11.1 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Things that I feel aren't worth talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Where you have, where you're proficient is stuff that isn't worth talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's true. I guess I really didn't realize to what extent I felt that, really. Because I really think that's true most of the time. And I can't face that anyone makes me feel like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the part that's true in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do feel that the things that I know about seem..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Second rate or third rate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something, yeah. I never think how I, before college we took a test. And we were put in all these classes. Not according to grades but according to these tests. So it's probably like an IQ thing. And for sure I know that I, maybe I felt stupid and all before this but that's when I really began to feel stupid because I, I don't think that my high school education was as good a most of the other people's really. But also, I didn't study at all my first two years. And I never knew anything in class. And I was with all these people that really knew a lot of things. And I never, and that's when I started to never really ever talk. 0:41:46.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't say (inaudible at 0:41:52.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really stands out as important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it does. Yeah. And it was like I couldn't, maybe I didn't, it was like I couldn't compete even if I studied. I felt that the people put me in there by mistake. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it was an accident that you were..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I was just hanging around. So as a consequence, I didn't go to class as much. Really, I messed up. I didn't even try. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sorta sounds like kinda just giving in and waiting to be flunked out or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't flunk out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds sorta like a barn horse that wakes up and winds up in the starting gate..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the Kentucky Derby and then decides well, what the hell? I might as well lie down on the track. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No, walk around the track. 0:43:08.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Walk around the track. Except unlike the barn horse, like you were stuck in there for how long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was either two or two and a half years because I quit after two and a half years and I don't know if it was the last semester. Maybe one course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kinda a long time to feel over-matched. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I didn't want to try. I know that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My God, what if I failed? What if I decided I was really going to study and then even by doing that I didn't make it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Sorta like this way you could say, "Well I never, I wasn't really tested."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's removed from me. I felt a lot more comfortable talking about things. I wasn't, see I was very upset this morning. And that must be removed. I'm not upset anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying something like, it's like, "I feel more comfortable talking about it. It must not be all that important or all that." Something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. As I was talking about it I thought this probably isn't important. I'm laughing at myself in here but I, but I, but it's true, I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, what's true? 0:45:04.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I feel like that all the time. And I don't laugh at myself outside of here. I'm laughing at the fact that I feel things I don't understand, that I say aren't important. But in a social situation I'm not laughing at the fact, I'm just feeling them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, oh wait a minute. I'm sorry. Is it like, you said to me before you said, "The things that I talk about aren't worthwhile."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you start talking about this and then you say, "Well, this isn't worthwhile."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like you sorta looked at yourself in the mirror and said, "Hey, I'm doing it right now, what I told you about." And you were laughing at yourself only it's not funny because you do it. I'm sorta slow, but I'm with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really isn't funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pardon me?</p>

<p>C I said that really isn't funny. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that's a kinda way, I guess you're feeling like you tripped yourself up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to do. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? 0:46:35.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I can do to not feel like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I can tell myself that that's not true but I don't believe that either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The truth of it is, sounds like you're pretty unknowledgeable and inane person. Like unknowledgeable where it counts and inane where you're knowledgeable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah I'm intellectually disagreeing with you but I know that, if there were people sitting around here talking about something, I would probably feel like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For as long as I can remember, my father always talked to me like I was an adult. And I used to laugh. Not at him, because I thought he was crazy. I mean I thought that he was silly to do that. I don't know if it was because I didn't know anything or if I just was laughing at him. 0:49:06.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the one thing I see is it must have felt like being a child being spoken to as an adult. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I knew the difference. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew what you were, I mean..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it was almost comical. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I don't know what that has to do with anything else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. That wasn't a very good thought. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it wasn't. Sometimes I like talking about my family. And I talked to my boyfriend about my family for like ten minutes. Maybe I'll be interested in what I'm talking about or, it's not even necessarily my family, but I'm thinking that because what we said about my father. 0:50:11.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then when I get done, all of a sudden I'll think how stupid that was. He's not interested at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Like while you're talking you're into it and..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling like it's interesting but when you're finished, you get this creepy feeling like, I totally made a fool of myself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I think this has something to do with feelings but I can't think, I can't, I don't know what. It does. I know it does. Something about, things that I don't care about maybe I don't feel stupid talking about. Maybe that's it. 0:51:18.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I care about something, like or dislike, but care about it then I feel stupid talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like if you're involved in something, if you have feeling about it, then afterwards you feel awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because I'm exposed my feelings. Maybe. I've shown some enthusiasm talking about it and, maybe that's it. I don't know. It has something to do with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the enthusiasm is, that's not being cool?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know about that. No, that's not it. (inaudible at 0:52:22.8) I was in a, oh, I was in a group therapy session last year for around two days. And I hardly said anything there at all. And everybody there told me that when I said something I made, I don't know. What's the term? They liked it and I was a good discussion leader. Something like that, whatever that has to do with it. And I really felt that I fooled them. Which I really did because I didn't talk about myself at all. Or very little. I just felt that was stupid. 0:53:37.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:53:40.9) But I guess that I, I'm not sure of the substance but it sounds like you came away feeling that you'd pretty well fooled them. And you saying, that's right you really did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but that was an afterthought. At the time I just thought that, I was angry with myself for doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it wasn't really consciously done but I didn't want to give anything of myself really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet all this reinforcement that I got was very, you know, positive and I felt good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wow. I would come out of that experience feeling like a damn fool. Like doing something, like I had done something that was gratifying to me but I had really messed myself up in the process. Like I had done something to get people's approval but it wasn't the thing to help me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. Yeah. I don't know about help, it just, it didn't even help the group at all. Yeah. I didn't feel like a fool. I felt angry with myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. What is that? Is it like angry for acting somebody else's script? 0:55:04.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was angry, I don't know why then. Because I couldn't or wouldn't do the things that the other people were doing because I was, I didn't want to talk about myself. It wouldn't have relieved me. Partly I felt it wasn't interesting. It wasn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They wouldn't find it interesting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. To be honest I didn't find all of them interesting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:55:51.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm relieved because I think the time's almost up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got through another hour. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. It's really tortuous for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling where you're like watching every second. Like a display board, and it's time and one more second past the light lights up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not that bad. It really isn't. But I feel under tremendous pressure. I really am. And you're not exerting I don't believe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I don't believe that you're exerting this pressure. But I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really am.0:56:50.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like what I was trying to get at before to understand is what, what the heck are the components of that pressure. Or what, what's that monkey on your back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Off hand, I don't know. And the hallway smells. I wanted to say that when I came in but I thought it was irrelevant. But it does. It smells different today than it did last week. Today it smells like grain. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It always smells different. That's animal in the basement and stuff. They're also building a building next door. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it smells like plaster. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different scents waft through the corridor. It sounds like you can't say anything that isn't irrelevant that you feel. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who says? Why is it irrelevant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could come in here and make social conversation. But that's to me, I mean that is irrelevant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait a minute then. Ok. So it sounds like that you have some sense of what you want to talk about or something and that's like a deviation from what you want to talk about. Is that what you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I want to talk about myself. I can't yet. 0:58:12.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm having trouble. I'm doing it but I'm having trouble. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like a lot of things you were saying that were irrelevant you were talking about yourself, so I guess I'm confused. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't know what that, yeah, I was talking about myself. And I don't know why I felt they were irrelevant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we'll stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I can say that with a straight face. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I expect you, I say that because I sorta expect you to heave a huge sigh of relief. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. (inaudible at 0:59:42.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Good bye. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye. See you on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm also glad that you don't have a great big box of Kleenex because that would (inaudible at 0:59:59.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why on earth? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems presumptuous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have a big box of Kleenex. What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I thought of that all the time. Like how I've seen have big boxes of Kleenex usually expect the girls to cry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people have too, I can't remember who they are. (inaudible at 1:00:30.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be (inaudible at 1:00:37.9) to show feelings now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. See you Thursday. 1:00:57.1</p>

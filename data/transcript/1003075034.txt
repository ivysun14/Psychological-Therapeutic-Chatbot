<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's been a while since I've seen you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About six months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like, uh, just over six months, but then again, we've been, we've been at this for a long time.  So, any, uh, big changes or things to report that come to mind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've had a little bit of a dip in the last month, but that was more of a situational thing, something I had to work through and I knew it.  Um, my brother went back out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.  That, that's got to be tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a lot of contact with him normally, or is it more peripheral in your life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he's using, I don't hear from him, and when I do hear from him, the communication is limited, and it's funny because he didn't tell me until about a month and a half ago and I asked him how long he had been using, and he said about six months.  I said, you know, that's funny, [NAME OTHER], that's how long we've been having problems with communication, and he says, oh, no, but we know denial.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just like when someone stops going to their meetings and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's about —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The time that off the wagon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  And he knows I can tell, and I told him.  He said well, I'm back in, and I'm working on it and things and I said well, I'll leave the communication up to you, and he says, well you'll hear from me more than you'd like.  I said that's fine with me.  I have no problem with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he an alcohol or a drug guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Drug and alcohol.  I mean it's, but I haven't heard a word from him since —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he ever come to you as, as some kind of the quote expert on the topic to get any help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, we keep our relationship totally separate from that, and that was real hard for me to work on in the beginning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's always hard to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To be able to do different with your family than what you do professionally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean I'd work with 30, 40 guys a day and couldn't do a damned thing for him, but I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Rise to a level of frustration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It did, and I just finally learned to turn it over, and decided to leave that alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, in what way do you find his, his situation affecting you?  When you say it kind of took you lower for a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Took me lower for a while.  Um, well, first I was real upset and angry and then I realized that the anger wasn't all with him.  Part of it is with me because how can I yell at him or be upset with him for not having his shit together, so to speak, when I don't have all of mine together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We all have our own cross to bear, there's no doubt about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what I need to be working on.  So that's what I'm trying to do is get all my ducks in a row and work on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any particular areas that you're focused on in getting yourself together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to work on my weight, and I've got to work on my self esteem and get myself back into the job market.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, at present, you're not working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's since when?  Was that going on last we talked?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, uh, that's been going on since about October, and I just haven't pressed it and, but it's time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sticking to your preferred field when you talk about looking for something, or are you open to all possibilities?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's time to get back into the field.  I was kind of sitting on the edge of it, and thought maybe I'll just do something else until I move and things, but at this point in time, I'm not sure what I'm going to do as far as moving.  Um, I think I'm going to stay in the [DEIDENTIFIED] area for a while, um, because I was going to head to [DEIDENTIFIED], and I think right now I just need to stay here unless something else develops, but for now, I need to be here.  So I think it's time to just get back into the field and start doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you aware of any possibilities out there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There are some, um, Catholic Charities puts out a good, um, job bulletin, and there are some occasional jobs popping up and things and I need to get off my butt and start sending out resumes and things to places, start going to some of the, um, um, the alcohol and drug addiction board seminars, and letting people know that I'm back and ready to start work.  I'm going to hit some of my contacts and things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you can do good work when you dive into it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I do very good work, and I know that people know that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the word gets around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> More than I ever realized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a big city, but that kind of thing is a pretty tight, small circle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I didn't realize how much it got around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, we're on that curve of coming down and hopefully starting to come out of it, where, where do you think we're at right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A curve like this, probably about here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just starting to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of pull through this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's been the last couple of days that I've started really moving out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is there anything in particular that you've, you've done or that you're [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've upped the meds a bit, um, started reading more to get out of my head, um, reaching out and helping others rather than staying within me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you said the anger is not all at your brother, that's, that's a good insight right there because there's a bigger picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've always been good at seeing that.  I mean I've never really totally ever blamed anything, I've always known that I have my part in it even from day one, but I'm better able to look at it's me and even if others, even if I am a victim at times, because sometimes you are, but even if you're a victim, you're still the only one that's going to get you through it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you can sit and wallow or you can move through, and sometimes you need to take some time to just deal with the pain and issues, but sometimes you just need to pick up the pieces, throw them in a basket and move on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Easier said than done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Oh, I know a lot of people that put them in a basket and sit on the basket hoping they'll hatch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  It gets to be a way of life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they don't much like me because I yell at them for it.  I don't yell at them.  I just try and point it out to them, and then don't really like seeing that, but I can't help pointing it out.  I'm sorry, I'm an honest person, and what I see, they hear.  Then they got the choice to do something or just sit there, and that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the way I always say it is that there's two ways you can deal with depression.  If you think of depression as a person laying in bed, doesn't want to get up and do anything, as an example, the two choices are you can keep laying there and say I don't want to do anything.  I'm just going to wait until this lifts and, and then I'll go do something, or you can fight through it.  You can get up and force yourself and go do something, which I think will help to hasten the, the depression lifting because you're taking an active —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Role.  If you're laying there waiting, you could be waiting, waiting for God knows how long.  It could be whenever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can lay there until you die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, that's, that's not a real good excuse, or another good approach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have the power, one way you don't have any power.  You're just laying there.  You're just waiting.  The other way you have some power and some, some self esteem and some input.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I always likened it to diabetes.  Yes, you have a disease and you can control the disease or you can let it control you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there's no cure for it now, but you can control it, and that's what it's about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's exactly.  It's an honest way to look at it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That worked well with treatment too because a lot of the guys had diabetes or knew somebody that did and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it kind of hits home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It helped them see it a little better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now when you say you've raised the medication, where are you at on, on the medication right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now, I'm taking three a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's on the Serzone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that goes back, when, when did you raise it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'll fluctuate at times.  I mean there are times where I'll take three just because I can feel a little fluctuation, but I've been doing three for about the last month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And to me, that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just a little bit of a concern because you were on four for so many years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but I can get it down to two when I'm okay, but I also know there are times where I got to take three, and that's what I got to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, if we look back over this whole six months, was there a period of time that you were taking the two pills and, and doing quite all right with, with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Actually a lot of that would have had to be through the winter months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Of course, I wasn't going out much.  I was just relaxing at home and things, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was isolation a part of what, what we've going through here in the recent weeks?  Like I say, you're having to push yourself to get out and be around people, get out and look for that job, get out and quit waiting for —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Life to control you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you talk about working on the weight, are you doing any kind of walking or any kind of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm doing steps.  I'm doing some walking, but not as much as I should, and I know that, and I've got to start moving on that.  I'm cutting back on carbs, more vegetables, more fruits, all the things you should do.  I got to do more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's at least a start.  You can always do more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, reaching for the stars and striving for your best is what it's all about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How you doing on the energy level these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Actually when I get up and move around and go places and things, I've got the energy.  It's just that if I don't push it, it's real easy to sit around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And do you have any trouble getting, getting a good night's sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You mean do I have problems with, um, sleeping, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Falling asleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It isn't always good sleep, but no, I don't have any problem with sleeping right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In general, is, is that any different being off the Remeron for a while as it was with the Remeron?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I just always equate that with knocking people out and, and we haven't had it for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't had any problem with sleeping.  I didn't notice any difference with sleep and not sleep with going off the Remeron.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And are you taking any other medications, or have you had any health issues outside of stuff you do here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, the only problem I had is, um, I had some infected teeth, so I was doing some antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Done with that now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Got those pulled out and everything was fine.  I got all that taken care of.  Teeth are fine, and I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, do you have anything this summer that you're looking forward to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From the rat race?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to a family wedding in July, and I'm going to go visit a friend up in Michigan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Always good to get a change of scenery if you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.  It's even better if you go visit friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't beat it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, you can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where, where do you go up in Michigan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, actually she's right outside of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But we've been friends since fifth grade, so I haven't seen her in a couple of years, so that'll be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still covered under the insurance the way that it's always been?  So that's all independent of whether you're working or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We've always tended to go mail order with your prescriptions.  So, and that's all still the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what, what about the, um, Klonopin?  Are you taking any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've used a few of those this six months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I gave you 30 of them when you were here last.  Do you think you have much of that left, or is it time to get you a few more again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just to be safe, and then probably the next time I won't need any at all.  I just don't like to not have them.  Either that or we can go without and then if I need them, I can call you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I, I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would you like to do it that way?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I might as well give it to you now while I'm thinking about it and then you won't have to track me down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I mean I would call you before I got that low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right now, I can give it to you and you can —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I'm not going to mess with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'll just give it to you now while we're thinking about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  This is the woman that fights the emergency room over pain meds.  I don't need anything that strong.  Go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I, I respect that though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was watching a friend's daughter, well, watching her.  I mean she's [AGE], but she's got psyche problems too and she had gotten, uh, strep throat really bad and they gave her Vicodin for her strep throat, and her mother keeps all her meds locked up because she's, for good reason, and her throat was starting to bother her, and she tells her mother well I need a Vicodin.  And I'm like my God.  I said [NAME OTHER] don't you have some Aleve around here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little hot tea with some honey in it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I went to the store and got some aspirin and gave it to her, and she says, oh, that's really helping.  Duh.  The poor girl's a drama queen anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think there's so many doctors out there that, that just want to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take this.  Shut up and go away and I don't have time to listen to it or explain it all to you and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just so much easier to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'll give you this and then you won't come back and complain anymore.  I'm like Vicodin for a sore throat, give me a break.  What do you do, give them morphine IV when they come in with a hangnail.  Who knows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all the time looking, looking at these people coming into the hospital [INAUDIBLE] and seeing what their docs have put them on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I understand.  I just the VA is notorious for that.  I used to have a lot of VA clients and they'd bring in their meds and I'd be looking at that going who gave you this?  The VA.  No wonder you're an addict.  [LAUGHING].  And then they send you for treatment because they keep giving you this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was always a fine line that we walk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trying to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.  It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keep people satisfied and comfortable without overdoing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You've got to have a good sense of humor to be in this line of work because if you don't laugh, you cry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I have to say just in the many years that I've known you that you've done a heck of a good job of kind of cutting back from where we started.  You used to be on a lot more medication yourself than you are now.  You've, you've headed in the right direction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I want to thank you for working with me.  Um, you found what works and you've helped me with finding what works and, and your delivery is very calm and relaxed and it's just been a joy working with you.  And I'm sure glad you didn't intend to move to California.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that'll never happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I was just so glad to find you.  I really was because there were a couple of years there that were a little iffy for me with everybody leaving and dying, but I'm glad I ended up with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know as well as anybody though, the medication is part of the solution.  It's never the whole solution and, and it's all the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The hard work and the insight and the talking yourself through it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had a lot of people that have helped me work through this, and there were a lot of people that were very good to help me along the way, but it was a long, hard journey, but you have to go into it with the intent that you're going to go to the other side and you're going to get through it.  Of course, if I had known what the road was going to [INAUDIBLE] started, I'm not sure I would have started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not exactly what you signed up for, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  But I'm not sorry I did it either.  I'm a far better person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The alternative is not the road you want to go down.  So I'm glad you've chosen this path.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, we'll say a prayer for your brother and I hope things work out for you and your family and those that you care about, and get you some refills to at least help you through for the next few months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just, uh, give me a call if there's anything you need, and otherwise we'll touch base later on in the year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I'll see you then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okey, doke.  There are three prescriptions for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A good year to you and yours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You got good plans with the kids this summer?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, we're going to head out for a, a couple of weeks here and there.  So I'll be out a couple of times, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll have [NAME OTHER] here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know you do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you need to get in touch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never worried about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, stay well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's always been good to me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take care.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You too.</p>

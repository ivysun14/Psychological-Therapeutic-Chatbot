<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How you like this rain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's all right. It keeps it cool.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Next weekend my son is going to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a biological camp for a week.  So I called and said can we come and stay? We are underwater, all the parks are closed.  Looks like they're going to have again rain today.  I thought we were done that's what they said.  Somebody told me that next week we'll have rain again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's back.  Hopefully not as much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, a little bit rain is fine, but this is definitely better than last year when we had a hundred, over a hundred degrees for so many days in a row.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seasons change.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Well, you are being treated for major depression and according to your last visit you were on Wellbutrin SR 100 mg twice a day, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took two pills in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, we increased you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm having some trouble remembering the afternoon ones.  But, I was working, talked with [NAME OTHER] last week -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She reminded me because I sit at a computer to set up my Outlook calendar program to have it flash a reminder.  So that's helped me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so that is helping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because it does come in Wellbutrin XL form.  It's kind of like that, it's once a day.  But the problem could be that SR comes in generic form so it's relatively cheaper.  But XL is still not available in generic form so it can be, the copay part can be quite expensive. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We were on XL before we switched to SR for that reason. And then your Provigil is 100 mg once a day in the morning. Is it keeping you alive?  I mean, awake?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you, is it more active in the morning and you get tired in the afternoon or one dose carries you the whole day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Keeps me pretty much the whole day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So there is no need for a second dose in the afternoon because some people after two or three o'clock start to feel sleepy again.  That's not happening for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Restoril 15 mg at bedtime, do you take it pretty much every day or as needed basis?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, every day.  I'm taking it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Overall with this combination tell me what's happening with your depression. How is your mood now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I've had a few problems at work so it's not been the best.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's happening?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, today I had this guy planning a family reunion in two weeks and yesterday I found out it was actually next week so I had to go ahead and reschedule, plus I'm training somebody because, uh, the guy above me moved to another position and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are they going to give you that position?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I interviewed for it last week.  That didn't go over well.  So the new guy is coming on now, the one they did choose, so I'm having to train him to do my job. He needs to know it anyway, but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he will be your supervisor. But you have to train him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I have to train him on my stuff, so he understands my part of it for him to understand his part.  I do, I transfer funds to cover all the checking accounts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do transfers, so he does more of the accounting, general ledger purposes, but [INAUDIBLE] reconciliation so he needs to understand where all my stuff is at.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it can really flow through correctly, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So is he a guy that is generating anxiety in you or is he a pretty friendly, easygoing guy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's pretty easygoing.  He's been in the other office, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know him.  Oh, okay, so he's not a stranger outsider.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Someone inside.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So are you going to get the vacation next week or are you not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They finally this afternoon said okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So the whole day was stressful, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  So then I had that interview last week and it didn't go well.  I know that that position was a lot more accounting work, actual accounting, and I've always worked in different positions around the office, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I just basically needed to learn programs and how to work certain programs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So since this is more accounting they actually gave an accounting quiz in the interview from an accounting class 101 and I wasn't ready for that.  I don't do that many debits and credits and I don't remember all the terms.  So I didn't do well on the test.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So have they told you that you are not going to get the position or is it still up in the air?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they told us last week.  They interviewed Tuesday and they told us, I think this was Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it disappointing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too much.  I don't know how much ready I was to do it.  And I've been, I talked with my boss last performance review and he indicated how the office would move around if somebody left.  And so I was looking at maybe taking some classes at [DEIDENTIFIED] refreshing accounting, maybe get a little second degree or whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So [INAUDIBLE] about that.  You get the push from inside?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A bit.  If I wanted to go more at work I'm going to need more accounting background.  So I guess I'm ready for it.  In the past I hadn't really wanted to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  I mean, in the past you kind of looked like doing things for others just to survive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My question was that are you doing that again because your office people are [INAUDIBLE] boss wants you too, or are you going to do it because you think you are ready?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I think I'm ready.  I've been, I need to get over and talk to them about it yet, but I've been thinking about it for a couple of months.  And, unfortunately, the other guy in the office decided to leave a month or two ago and it was like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He didn't give you enough time, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  They're open another year or so then I'd have a little more of the accounting and feel better about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The timing didn't work out.  Well, yknow, this other guy is coming up.  Let's wish him well, but things can always change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  So next time I'll be more ready for it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  I'm so excited to hear that statement from you sir, because when I first started seeing you that was about what, we are working together now almost, um, just a little over three years now.  This is a remarkable change in attitude.  And I have to congratulate you on that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thanks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I am starting to believe you that, uh, you may not be or I may not be ready for every single job.  But if you are deficit in one area or other areas to [INAUDIBLE] and then get ready.  It's possible for anybody in every work.  Just take a little extra load above and beyond your working hours you might have to go back to the studying and taking classes and stuff.  Do they offer that online or do you have to go physically?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I gotta go find out. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can check with [DEIDENTIFIED] because they give a lot of those courses online.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My wife used to teach there so I know that they do offer a lot of them online.  You have to have a full time job so, uh, if you can do it physically, that's good, if not, you can do it online.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll see yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, any romantic matters looming?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you tried?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Never really met anybody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are getting involved into some kind of group activity in your church?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I work with [DEIDENTIFIED], kind of a fraternal group.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fraternity type.  How often do you meet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twice a month. I'm the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Make it once a week, a little frequent, that can be part of the routine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's every two weeks.  That's all they do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sex life?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not seeing anybody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about masturbation and stuff?  Do you do that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe once in a while.  Not very much anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you slowed down on that or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably from when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just been busy, I'm living at home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The reason I'm asking is an individual who is at the initial visits of treatment for depression or is undertreated misses a lot of things what is fun or pleasurable.  That's because they are not treated, that's because their depression is not treated yet.  And that involves going out, having fun, having girlfriends, sex life and all those things including masturbation.  But though when we use antidepressant to control or get rid of the depression, this fun part of the life comes back.  But there is one caveat there.  Some of the antidepressant might want you to have sex, but you might have problems with erections or erectile dysfunction.  That is a direct impact of the medication on the system.  And the Prozac group is what we call SSRIs are notorious for that.  The reason I went into discussing that is that you are on Wellbutrin, it is usually not known to cause that kind of problem.  So if you are lacking the desire part then we might have to get a little bit more accuracy with treatment.  But if you're lacking in the performance part then we have to review the medication.  This is how it differs.  And my role is [INAUDIBLE] to make that decision.  Sounds like you try to think about it because you are not old enough to give up the sex life just because you do not have a girlfriend.  There is alternatives which are healthy and harmless.  And now I'm not talking about promiscuous sex or unusual sex.  Whatever if you think that you need or want, you should try it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Weight.  What's happening with your weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The heat and doing the yard work I think I've dropped some pounds down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Go for it because you can easily lose another 30 to 50 pounds and if you can do that you will physically and mentally feel much better.  Try that.  Okay?  Any side effects from these medications, particularly excessive sweating or hot flashes or tremor of the hand or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, whether the sweating has to do with the temperatures or -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Last few days it can be. I'm talking about let's go back three months ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  No, not really.  My only concern, [NAME OTHER] mentioned something about I have trouble remembering things at times.  Um, I caught a cold two weeks ago and I finally got around to calling to go to regular doctor to see him and then more or less by the time I got a week later for the appointment I was feeling better and then I forgot, I got busy at work and just forgot.   She says sometimes it's forgetting 'cause I'll put things down.  I forget where I put them.  Other little things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it can be part of depression.  It can be part of depression, lacking in focus, lacking in concentration, short term memory, can be part of depression.  To add that, if you feel depressed then I can increase a little bit more of the Wellbutrin SR.  Currently we are total of 300 mg.  We can go up 100 more mg.  The other option is that if we believe that your schedule is just too overwhelming to remember, for example, I have this piece of paper, I have eleven, uh twenty one chores to do today that I have to do it, and I wrote down and then I was driving and why can you not remember?  I said forget it, you cannot make these twenty one chores and each of them have a subdivision, two or three.  I wrote down on a piece of paper in the morning and I'm carrying it and I'm putting marks.  Do I feel bad about it?  No.  Sometimes our schedules can be so overwhelming that taking some extra help either in the form of a paperwork, whatever's convenient, or they have this PDR, you can use those, talk on to the handheld computer.  Whichever is comfortable.  Put it on, they will give you the alarm like you said about the medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I figure I can use that for other things.  [INAUDIBLE] schedule [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely, why not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And once you start it might take a week or two to kind of get easy with that, and then it can become part of your life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have that much.  Work's a routine every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And more likely have the brain in the skull and a little bit on the brain on the outside in your pocket or in your - big deal.  We have a satellite unit with our brains in pocket.  [INAUDIBLE].  So you don't miss it.  Don't feel bad about that.  But do we increase the antidepressant or not, that will be your call.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Talking with [NAME OTHER], she said I probably should wait a couple more weeks since I've not been real good on the second pill each day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That is the right thing to do, to give it [INAUDIBLE].  If one sustains it, see what it does, what it does if it is good enough, then we don't have to increase it.  If it is not, then we do.  I agree.  Okay?  How often are you seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Once a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need any prescriptions today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think so. I think I'm, I'll need them in a couple of weeks, but I think they're all refill or, if not, they call in. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, the pharmacy sometimes.  I'll see you back in about four to six weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you, and again thank you for allowing me to record the conversation.  Take care.  Bye bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye. </p>

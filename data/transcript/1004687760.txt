<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Hey there] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [How are you] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I decided to go home yesterday and tell him what my decision was. I thought that was important to do. And, like, he was still, like, in bed being sad and depressed and whatever. And, like, we were both sad for a little while, then we started talking about, like, stuff and, like, his issues and why and all this stuff. And then he started talking about his family, and then he, like, started sobbing about, you know, like, "Why do they hate me? Why did they do that to me? Why did they, you know, why can't I forgive? Why don't I -"</p>

<p>You know, like, I was like, "This is all stuff that you are going to explore in therapy and, you know, talk about why it's led you to, you know, being (ph) how you did with somebody that you loved and," you know. And I told him that, you know, I want to see him work on things and, you know, if things can get better then, and you know, and there's a chance, then that would be fabulous and wonderful and great. [00:01:06]</p>

<p>But that because, like, I just don't trust him at all, like, I can't, like, I can't even make myself think about how to trust him again, like, if it's ever even possible. I said, "You know, we have to separate for a while." And he, like, started crying a little and I was crying, and, like, he's like, "I understand," you know, but he didn't that understand that that meant he would also be moving out. So I said something about the cat and he was like, "What do you mean? Why would you have to, you know, why would you even have to separate them and give them up?"</p>

<p>I was like, "Well, whether they're going to stay here or go with you, and I mean." And he was kind of, like, you know, looked at me, like, "Well, no." I was like, "You know, honey, we can't be separated and be living together, like, this needs to be like—and I mean, (inaudible at 01:59), like, I'm going to be starting from, like, literally the beginning with you, like, in terms of, like, building trust and kind of getting to know you, even in the sense of how your brain works, because I just don't—it literally has to start from the bottom up." [00:02:19]</p>

<p>And I mean I also told him another big piece of, you know, us being separated in that way has to do with him being able to work on his stuff without me being there to take care of anything and, you know, for me, like, just how I am with him and how I have been, it just would be too hard on my end not to, you know, "So, like, you know, did you go down your bike route?" Like, you know, kind of stuff like that. So, he understands that, you know, and it's sad and, like, painful. This is going to be, but the things that he's saying are, you know, "I'll do anything, like, to win you back, and, you know, like, there's nothing that I want more in the world than you. I don't know why I ever (inaudible at 03:06), you know, all this stuff, you know. [00:03:07]</p>

<p>And I'm not even, like, I don't know if I can even like 100 percent—like, there's so much trust lost and, like, zero basis for trusting you at all, that I can't even, like, 100 percent believe that. And it's like, you know, OK, I want to believe that but I have to see it. And, like, I don't even know how this is going to work but, you know, yeah.</p>

<p>And then last night I went to meet up with Mandy (sp?) a little while. Her friend was singing at a bar in the Square. So I went to do that, and it's just, like, kind of hard to, like, socialize. Like, when you're going through something like this because, you know, you're so much in your own brain and, like, I am also really irritable about people. Like, this woman was, like, not paying attention and her bag kept hitting me in the back. And Mandy (sp?) saw that I was on the brink of, like, going berserk and screaming in her face, and she was like, "Let's just switch places." (inaudible at 04:03), she's like, "Oh god, I understand." [00:04:08]</p>

<p>But, you know, like, little things like that. And, like, some guy was like, "So what you drinking? White wine?" And I literally was like, "What does it look like?" And to the point I was like—he ran away (laughs). I don't know, I just don't want to talk to anybody. And Franklin (sp?), I really encouraged him—I had to, like, force—like, not force him, but be like, "You need to get up and you need to take a shower. Like, you need to brush your teeth, you need to drink some water." Like, I made us a can of soup we shared because, like, we still hadn't really felt like eating. And then he had to (inaudible at 04:41) up to his friend Tim's house.</p>

<p>Tim is the one who had the baby with Franklin's sister, who passed away—the baby that passed away. And so, I mean, it's good to go to—Tim is a good friend, old friend. They've known each other since they were, like, 9. I asked Franklin (sp?) later if he spoke to Tim about what was going on and he said no, that they just, like, shot the shit or whatever. Which is fine, I mean, I do think that Franklin (sp?) should, you know, see if there is any friends that he'd feel comfortable talking about it. I mean, I think that partly he may be embarrassed because I think that everybody knows how good I am to him and sees what I've done for his life and, you know, sees how lucky he is. So he may be embarrassed to say, "You know, I fucked up."</p>

<p>And, you know, I hope he doesn't, like, lie and I don't even—I mean, that's the thing. Like, there's no trust to the point that I'm like, I could even see him being like, "She cheated on me." Or, I don't know, like, because right now I just don't—I mean, not even trust that he's not talking to the other girl. I mean, there's nothing—even though he showed me, I'm like in my head, I'm like, "Well you could've delete some." You know, it's just to that point that—and he understands. He's like, "No, you have no reason to trust anything I'm saying. Like, I know what I'm saying and what's true about it but, like, you know, you don't." [00:05:47]</p>

<p>But I think that Tim maybe isn't the right person to talk to anyway about it, like, regardless, just because he's so depressed and cynical and damaged himself that I'm not sure that it would really do Franklin (sp?) any good in that regard. And, I mean, you know, even if he doesn't tell people the whole story I hope that, you know, he starts to tell people that, you know, Trina (sp?) and I are separating for a while, you know. I think he's not feeling ready to do that yet, whereas, I've already told all my friends and, you know, I really reach out for support. Like, that's what I do, that's what I've always done. That's what I've been taught to do. He's kind of the opposite and I think he gets ashamed.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I ended up picking him up at Tim's on my way home because he was still there, and we stopped and got burgers—which is probably not the healthiest thing to eat after you've, like, have not been eating. But we were both like, "We're kind of really hungry." So that was good. And he's at work today, and we're both in better spirits. And he says he's just been, I don't know, researching stuff and thinking about me and thinking about, you know, things just to change and—I mean, you know, I just hope that he does. [00:06:55]</p>

<p>And right before I came in here, I spoke to my friend, who I used to live with. I had an apartment, like, a year after I'd been out of college. And she had moved down to Florida to go to school, met a guy that lives there, got into a serious relationship with him. She'd known him through friends or something. They got engaged, he cheated, they broke up, they got back together, they went to couple's therapy. They moved to Chicago because they thought everything was better. He cheated again. He moved out. They still started, you know—so, she was a good person to call.</p>

<p>And she was like, "You know, I had come originally (ph), like, I'd love to talk to you. Like, the first thing she said was, you know, I love you and I want you to know that, like no—I will never judge or, like, anything about any decisions you make (ph) or Franklin (sp?), or anything. Like, I'm here forever you, whatever, and just let me know what I can do." So that was really helpful and I spoke to her, you know, told her my whole story, and she, you know, when I was done, she was like, "OK. Like, the first -" You know, she first asked me what—she's also, like, in therapy. So, like, she knows (inaudible at 08:01).</p>

<p>She's like, "Well, OK. Before I say anything, like, step on any toes or, you know, hurt feelings that don't need to be hurt, you know, what can I do for you? Like, what do you want, you know, need from me?" And I was, like, "You know, honestly, I just want kind of your opinion in this situation. You know, you've gone through it and whatever." And she said, "The first thing that I'm going to tell you is no matter what he says, like, do not make him believe that this is your fault and make you internalize it. Because it's not. It's his problem and whatever he's saying, you know, caused him to do it that has to do with you, like, don't worry about it. Like, it's not your problem. Like, it's not your fault." And which is good, because I already have been telling myself that. Like, I already knew that I would get blamed for it, just because that's his pattern. And I already, you know, told him, like, I don't—that doesn't matter. Like, it doesn't matter. Even if I wasn't (ph) cheating on you, like, still, that's no reason to not talk to me about it. [00:08:56]</p>

<p>So that was the first thing. And then she kind of was just talking to me about, you know, what she did. And, you know, she said, "You're probably right for not, you know." I think her issue was that she did internalize it and make it her issue. So that's why she, like, kept taking him back and giving him second chances and going to couple's therapy or whatever. And she's like, "So I think that, you know, if you feel like the right decision for you is for him to move out now and you guys to have your space, then that's the right decision and you need to do that. Like, rather than like—don't waver, and, like, you know, don't convince yourself otherwise to be sad or because he tried to tell you you did something wrong or whatever."</p>

<p>And (inaudible at 09:37) I know that it's like—I know that Franklin (sp?) a little bit hopes that in the time that it will take for this to, like, actually happen, like, maybe I'll change my mind. But I'm kind of, like—I've told him, like, (inaudible at 09:46), this is happening. This is what needs to happen. And, again, like, yeah, I'd love to, like, still—I'm not going to, you know. [00:09:52]</p>

<p>And another thing Jennifer (sp?) said was, you know, "Don't cut him out, you know, completely. Put up your boundaries in terms of what you need for you and put yourself number one, but don't cut him out. Because, you know, first of all, it's going to be hard on you and second of all, like, it's not going to—if you do think that maybe some things can change in the future, you know, you need to be around to be able to see it. Like, you need to see it sometimes."</p>

<p>And she said one of the biggest (ph) things with Steve, if he was in therapy, that, you know, in hindsight she realizes she—if she had paid more attention to was, you know, every time she'd ask him, you know, "How's therapy going? Like, what have you guys been discussing?" He'd kind of, like, dance around it and be like, "Oh, my family and, you know, how I'm doing at work," and whatever, but he wouldn't really mention, you know, anything about, like, his issues and, like, why he's cheating. And, like, she feels like he's a psychotic (ph), which, you know, fine, but he wasn't given her any indication that he was actually talking about those things. And she's like, you know, so that might be helpful to, you know, make sure he's serious about it if he, you know, if he is able to show some progress. [00:10:50]</p>

<p>And I mean, I don't want to pry, and I think for her it's (ph) a little different because he actually was physically cheating. He actually ended up getting somebody pregnant who had a baby, that she didn't find out till the baby was two months old and she was already engaged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, way worst, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that may have something to do with how—I mean, I don't think that I'll necessarily have to ask him about what he's been talking about. I think that it will show by the way that he's talking to me and, you know, the things that he says to me. I mean, again, you know, he seems very serious about wanting to change. I don't feel as though I know how long that will last right now. Like, I'm not sure. Like, OK, are you just saying this now? I'm like, are you going to lose steam once you are on your own and whatever? Or, you know—because he's saying a lot of, like, heavy stuff about, you know, how he wants to—really wants to, like, figure out why he, you know, needs this and why he needs this attention, and why he feels like, you know, the person that loves him isn't giving attention, you know. And I never did anything wrong, and I've always supported him, and why he feels like I didn't, you know. [00:11:54]</p>

<p>So he's saying a lot of big stuff, which I'm proud of, you know, and I think is good. And I'm happy about—I mean, I believe he doesn't want to lose me. I believe he wants to regain my trust. I just don't yet believe that he knows how or is able to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a referral for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said he made an appointment. He goes to, like, the Well House, like, health services. That's where he's always seen his doctors. So I guess he called them and they made an appointment with the primary care so that he can get a referral through them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is great. And I honestly, like, thank you for the offer, but I think that also it's, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Better if it goes that way] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He needs to just do it. You know, I feel so much for him and, like, I'm happy to help him. I told him, you know, I'm happy to help you if you do need help finding a place or whatever, but I think it's good that he takes the initiative and does it. I mean, of course, I hope he finds somebody good but, hell (ph) anybody with a PHD will just be fine right now, because he has never gone to anybody. [00:12:54]</p>

<p>So yeah and, you know, I don't know, it's just like—I told my mother about it. And of course she said the fucking—the worst possible thing ever as the first thing, which is, "I just hope you don't have an STD." I was like, "Mom, like, thanks." (Laughs). And I was like, "Really?" And she's like, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just, you know." I was like, "OK, you better watch yourself. Like, that was, like, so fucked up. Like, I wasn't thinking about that and, great, thanks, now I am. Like, fabulous." (Laughs). I mean, I'm not really, because, again, like, I just—I mean, I don't know, but I just don't—in my gut, I just don't feel like he has done anything. And, you know, I've asked him several times, like, you know. But I mean, I don't believe him. I don't believe anything. I don't believe anything he says right now. Like, to that point. But yeah, she was like... [00:13:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She could've said something far more supportive. (Laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, yeah. She did say other things supportive afterwards, you know, things like, "I'm proud of you, you're such a good person," you know, all of that stuff. But, I mean, really Mom? STD is, like, hello. So, yeah. But, you know, I've already told her and that was good. I mean, it might not be—I think the reason that he didn't, like, process that he would have to move out is because of kind of being in denial about it. And she [kind of] (ph) pointed out and she's like, "Well, you know, would you want to think that you had to leave that apartment?" Like, mother (ph), no. Like, you know, it's a great apartment or whatever. So yeah, I think it's a little bit of denial that that was like, "OK, I think (inaudible at14:40) guest room. (inaudible at 14:42)."</p>

<p>I mean, you know, my parents did that when they first separated, and they were probably sleeping in separate bedrooms for, like, a year or two. I mean, I was young and I thought it was because he snored. And so, it was just, like, normal. Like, oh, Mommy's room, Daddy's room, like, it wasn't really a thing. But also, they had a house, they had kids. They were 50-something. Like, it's a different story. It's not three years into a relationship that we both, you know, can survive on our own for now.</p>

<p>So it's (inaudible at 15:19) process, and when it comes down it in terms of, like, when I'm going to be away and these people are coming to stay at our house for this event in August and, you know, needing to find a roommates for myself before he can move out. Like, it might not be until September 1st. And just because I don't know if he can find anything, that's like, August 15th, or whenever. [00:15:48]</p>

<p>And so that's a little bit of a—I don't really know what to think (ph). Like, I don't know, like, I mean I'm OK with that kind of, but I guess there's a part of me that's, like, worried that maybe he'll like think that he can, you know, talk me out of it. And maybe I'm a little worried that I will get talked out of it? I mean, I don't think that I will because I am feeling really strongly about, like, us needing to be on our own for now, and him needing fix whatever he wants to fix in order to regain my trust and win me back and, I mean, you know.</p>

<p>He's very serious about, you know, "I don't want anything because I'll do anything for you. Nothing is worth jeopardizing this relationship, like, I will never waver again," like, all this stuff." Like, he needs to work that out on his own, (inaudible at 16:46) about that. I just don't, I mean, it's just the living situation is, like, just, you know, complicates things, obviously, in this situation. [00:16:57]</p>

<p>And I mean the other thing is, you know, he's going to find a room and an apartment with some roommate. Fine. But, you know, he can't bring—he's not going to—I'm doubtful that he'll be able to find a place where, you know, he can bring his weight bench and, like, all of his bullshit. So, like, some of it will have to stay at my house. I mean, I don't really care. Like, that's fine. Like, the weight bench, like, he's not going to be, like, coming over to use it because he doesn't even use it that much. (pause). [00:17:29]</p>

<p>I mean, again, it's also about money and, you know, if I can, you know, if we can figure this out without out me having to, like, turn to my father like, "Help me." (inaudible at 17:37), which I really don't want to do. Then I prefer to do something else. I mean, (pause) and I did, like, some calculations and, well, assuming my landlord isn't, like, a jerk (ph) and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I feel like you're trying to show me how responsible you're being about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, because I'm always so responsible. No, (inaudible at 18:14), that's what I do, yes, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And well—but I think maybe (pause) there's something else (pause). [00:18:37] I'm not sure how these things to fit together, but I guess imagine they do. You don't seem very upset. Like, you just decided yesterday to end your three year relationship that you had been thinking would, like, you guys would get married. And you don't—I know you sort of talk about, like, crying (inaudible at 19:16) yesterday when you and Franklin (sp?) were talking about it. You don't seem especially upset at this moment or as you're talking about what happened. And (pause) that strikes me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, how come? Like, what do you think that means?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. (Pause). [00:19:46] You were—yeah, when I'm talking to somebody who's just told her boyfriend of three years that she wants him to move out and, you know, sort of that she's just broken up with the man she had thought she would marry, one might expect she'd...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Be more upset about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...be more upset about it. I guess my—I have a hunch about it, which is that at some moments it doesn't feel very real yet. You know, he's going to be in the apartment through the middle of August or September. Maybe if he changes, you guys can get back together. He's talking a lot about wanting to change. You reminded both of us five or six times that that's really not what you want and you're committed to his moving out, but the reality is maybe hasn't quite caught up yet? I don't know if that's it, that it hasn't doesn't actually feel at the moment like this is happening? [00:21:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there's that. I mean, I think there's also a sense of, like, feeling hopeful that he will change and that I can trust him again. I don't—I do really want him to move out though. And then maybe also part of it is that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say that, I think, like, I have a (inaudible at 21:41) or I think that's the right thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that's the right thing. Like, for me. That's the right thing for me, is to not live with him. I mean, I think partially I'm a little cried out, which happens, I think, and, you know, (inaudible at 22:04). I did a lot of crying—there's been a lot of crying, there's a been a lot of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh OK, I didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. Like, well, the first night it happened. Then, like, the next day at work. The next day when I got home, that night, you know, the next day at work. Like, there's been a lot of... [00:22:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh ok, [crying about it] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Both of us have. [And there'll] (ph) probably be more. So, there might a little bit of, like, cried out. And, like, maybe I'll be sadder again and, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, no, you can be done with it for now, be done crying for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I think that's that, you know, and I think that, you know, you're saying that maybe I don't seem as upset also, like, (pause) I don't know. Maybe that also comes with the kind of relief of having told him my decision and kind of making that part of it real. Yes, there is a portion of it that's, like, well, is it going to be a for a little while and in the meantime, yes, we're, like, broken up. But, you know, maybe we'll still, like, go to dinner, you know, every week or whatever, or, you know, do some things together. [00:23:23]</p>

<p>Like, [I see] (ph) how that would still be happening. And I mean even after he does move out, like, I don't—I'm not going to want to not see him, and I know he's going to want to come see the kitties, like, you know, and hang out with them sometimes. And also, like, I do this with a lot of things, you know, if I (inaudible at 23:47) and (inaudible at 23:49 (ph) if it's like easier for me to handle it, like, sometimes I guess. I mean, now, you know, when it comes to, you know, start, you know, looking for a roommate and putting up an ad and telling my landlord...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some of this is sort of, you know, happening in stages, kind of? And you're sort of, you know, if the most recent stage was, like, the deciding and telling him about it stage. You're kind of past a lot of the crying for that stage, and if the next stage is the, you know... [00:24:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Separating bills and] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, whatever phase. You'll sort of crying again during that phase.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I think that's what it is. I think that, you know—and, you know, there's been a lot of, like—it will, like, flash through my mind what happened or, like, the messages will, like, flash through my mind and, like, the idea of him, you know, talking this woman like this, and the idea of her (inaudible at 24:56) false sense of whatever they might have had or whatever. You know, and then I'll feel like I'll be getting teary-eyed or whatever. And, you know, if I've been home with Franklin (sp?), there will just be moments where, you know, where maybe we're, like, laying there and, like, I just start crying, just because there's just so many emotions and it's just—yeah.</p>

<p>So, I mean, exactly. There was, like, that phase and, like, telling him. I couldn't, you know—I'm not even ready to, like, talk about logistics about it yet. Like, OK, that was big. You know, like, we're separating and we're not going to be living together. You know, I'm going to get a roommate, you're going to live with roommates (ph) and, you know, we have the other stuff coming. [00:25:37]</p>

<p>Next, I mean, in terms of money stuff, I think that probably, you know, we'll just change all of the bills to my name. You know, he has a good enough salary that, you know, he can pay for his phone bill. He has a loan that he pays, like, a 111 a month, which is pretty small. So, then he could—he'll be fine, and I do—I mean, this is something that we'll have to discuss. I mean, obviously, I've thought about all of this stuff already because—whatever.</p>

<p>I do want to ask him for, like, maybe a couple hundred a month just to go towards the credit cards, just because a lot of that debt was trips that we've taken and other things. And so I think just—I think that's fair. I mean, at first I was like, no, I'm just going to take it on or whatever. But, I mean, as long as, you know, I still am going to be talking with him and communicating with him—like, he's still coming over to see the cats. As long as there's, like, a sense of, like, he's trying to work on things and, you know, win me back, I think that he can help with some of that debt. [00:26:47]</p>

<p>But other than that, I mean, I think, yeah, I'm just not ready to tell, like, my landlord and stuff yet. And I just—it's going to be difficult, like, to, show the apartment just because, like, everything in there is what me and Franklin (sp?) chose to decorate and how we were going to set it up and everything and, you know. I mean, I feel that is was important, you know, even though there is going to be this long stretch of in-between time, I do think it was important—for both of us—for me to make it clear what my decision was, because I think I already knew, like, the second time it all happened. I just kind of needed to sort it out a little bit. And I actually think it's (pause)—I mean, I know that it's helped me, like, not feel tied up in knots and not feel, like, just this constant tightness and, you know, not wanting to eat and all that. [00:27:59]</p>

<p>And it seems like it's helped him too because it seems like now he knows what's going to happen. He's not waiting for my decision and, like, trying to figure out, you know, how or whatever. He knows what's going to happen. This is happening and, you know, I think it's given him more space to say, "OK, now I really have to put in the work and figure out exactly what I'm going to do and all that," which is good.</p>

<p>He's going to sell a bunch of stuff, I guess. Like, he has a camera he's going to sell and, like, computer hard drive, because he wants to get himself a bike because he used a bike all the time everywhere, and he hasn't done that and he wants to do that. And I was like, good, like, you should. I mean, another thing is, you know, Mandy (sp?) said something about, you know, how he's very always telling me, you know, and how he would tell me, like, "You always say you're going to do these things and then you never follow through, and then whatever." [And we went through that] (ph). [00:28:53]</p>

<p>She's like, you know, "He's one to talk. I mean, like, he wanted to do photography. And he wanted to do the thing, he wanted to do this, or he wanted to -" Like, do it. I think that, you know, he talks a big game but, you know, living with me and just, like, getting into the habit of just hanging out and even if, like, recently, since I have been going out with my friends and have been doing more things on my own, like, it still hasn't motivated him to do it, he still hasn't done it. And I do think it's now, like, he'll be able to do that stuff and that will give him a better sense of if, you know, if he really does want to be with me and really does want to, like, fight to regain—you know, be with me again and try to be with me again in, you know, a year or whatever it is. However—you know, whatever.</p>

<p>Because it's really going to take a lot. Like, he understands. And I told him, I was like, "Honestly Franklin (sp?), like, I don't trust you at all right now. Like, it's really terrible. It's just going to take a lot for me to—if I'm going to figure out that I can trust you again. Like, it's a big if right now." And, you know, it's painful for him to hear, and I was crying and he's crying, but, like, he understands. He's like, "Well, yeah. I mean, I fucked up. Like, I totally betrayed your trust, betrayed you, betrayed our relationship, betrayed our future." [00:30:15]</p>

<p>It's just going to take a lot, if it's possible at all, because right now I just can't see him changing. I just can't. I hope that he can and I, you know, whatever his actions are a result of, in terms of his problems, I hope that he can change. Just right now I don't see it. So, like, we'll see but in the meantime, I don't know. I think there's going to be a lot more—I mean, like, we have been sleeping in our room still, like, I think that probably we should [pull out] (ph) the guest bed and, you know, and sleep in a separate room. But I think even that's going to be hard and, I mean, it's just going to be difficult in the meantime living together, I mean, which is why it was, like, that he thought we could be separated and live together it was like, not really. It's just not possible. [00:31:17]</p>

<p>So I'm really not sure about how this time's going to go. I mean, I think it's definitely good that I'm going to be away for, like, two or three weeks, because it will give me the space I need. It will give him some, you know, sense of being alone and needing to take care of himself, and not having me to talk to every second and whatever. And then when I get back, well, I think that's going to be, you know—or maybe after I get back in the first weekend in August that'll be when, you know, he starts searching, I talk to the landlord, I put up an ad. [00:32:08]</p>

<p>I'm a little nervous that my landlords are kind of dicks and they're just kind of—I mean, like, whatever. They, like, own the housing and they could—it's a big huge apartment. They could probably charge, like, three or four-hundred more than they're charging me. They just raised it, like, 50 bucks after two years, starting on September 1st, whatever, 15th, when I pay the rent. And (inaudible at 32:28), like, (inaudible at 32:29) notice that Franklin's (sp?) moving out and I need to find a roommate, they're going to go, "Well, then the rent needs to go up." I mean, I can't say that they (inaudible at 32:38) two roommates. You know, I'm having one, so it's literally exchanging one person for the other. I just hope that they don't come up with some bullshit excuse, "Well, we rented to a couple and, you know, if it's not going to be a couple then it needs to be 1500." Some bullshit.</p>

<p>I hope there also won't be an issue with the security deposit because if possible, I'd like to leave my security deposit as is, not have to ask the security deposit from the person that moves in and just charge, like, a flat fee. But I don't know if my landlord will allow that, like, will allow me to be, like, the primary person if another person moves in because, well, [also on my end] (ph), what if they do something (pause) and screws it up, and then I don't want to pay for it or whatever? [00:33:23]</p>

<p>So, we'll see, but, I mean, it would be probably easier to find somebody, you know, if I was able to just say, like, "900 bucks a month, everything included, here's your room." My mom had said, you know, "Maybe you'll end up with, like, temporary people because, you know, since there's no lease, maybe people are nervous about not signing a lease. Like, who knows?" I mean, I don't—like, I never thought I'd have roommates again, so, like, swallowing that is just (inaudible at 33:53). Like, I really don't enjoy it. </p>

<p>And Franklin (sp?) said the same thing, and to which I answered—you know, he's like, "I just hate roommates." And I was like, "But on the upside, you know, maybe if you don't want to hang out with them because they're lame or just don't want to be in the house, it'll prompt you to go out and do things that you want to be doing, as opposed to living with me where, you know, you're fine hanging out in the house with me, even though you should be going out." So, you know, bright side there but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:15)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so I pay 1350. Then, you know, the cable's, like, 130. The gas—I have [balanced billing] (ph), so it's, like, 123, and then average, let's say... [00:34:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, like, there's no way you can do something to, like, just make the money so you don't have to live with a roommate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 34:35)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I asked, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it'd be tough. I think it'd be tough. Because, you know, then groceries, I mean, everything. I mean, to be perfectly honest...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I'm not saying] (ph)</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, I know. I mean, but one of the things that I had thought of was, looking over my budget and taking out Franklin's (sp?) income and seeing what it looks like. I haven't done that yet because I'm just not—again, (inaudible at 35:07) to do it. But if I can do that, I will. But if I can't, I'll have to get a roommate. And I don't want somebody that will be my best friend, but I also don't want somebody who's a weirdo, like, or, like, foreign exchange student, like, I don't know—or college student.</p>

<p>Like, I want young people, like, I don't know, I guess it comes down to beggars can't be choosers, then I need to find somebody. But (pause) then I guess I'll have to see—I mean, I don't want to move out of there, like, at all. I have so much furniture, it's just not any—it wouldn't make sense, like, because I have to pay for storage. Like, it's just—so... [00:36:05]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 36:05). (inaudible at 36:12) thought of that, but then (inaudible at 36:14). I mean, great that I haven't gotten my annual raise yet. They think it's, like, sometime this month or next month. But it should kick in, and I don't know how much it is yet. It's like a really small—like, it's a percentage. So maybe, you know, with that bump—Franklin's (sp?), like, dental loans are—in August, if we pay 399 we're done. So that's really good. And then if he's helping with the credit card bills then, I mean, yeah, I mean, I would look into it. I mean, if my brother weren't, like, a retard, I would just tell him, like, to come live there, you know, and pay me, like, 400 bucks a month or something. But he's retarded. And I don't think he'd want to live with me, I think that's a little weird. [00:37:04]</p>

<p>A girlfriend of mine had just broken up with her boyfriend and had to move out and back with her parents. And so, I (inaudible at 37:11), like, but—so I kind of thought about that, but I think she had told me that she's going to stay with her parents and save money, so, OK. I mean, there's also, like, I need somebody who's cat friendly, like, I need somebody who is, like, 4/20 friendly to an extent. Like, I don't, you know, if I want to smoke a joint before I go to bed, like, I want somebody's who's going to be like, you know, "(inaudible at 37:36).</p>

<p>And I want somebody that, you know, is OK with me having (inaudible at 37:39)—so, like, there's a lot of stuff that I just don't want to think about yet, I think. It's just very—I mean, the more emotional part of the decision making happened yesterday, like, when we had to go over it. I think it'll come back when, you know, he's actually looking for an apartment and meeting people and saying, "Oh god, you suck, like, I like Trina (sp?) so much better." [00:38:05]</p>

<p>You know, like, packing up stuff, separating books and DVDs and (inaudible at 38:12). Like, there's stuff everywhere in that house, you know. And selling his crap that he needs to sell and figuring out where his photography stuff is going to go. I mean, I hate (inaudible at 38:22). Really difficult. I mean, the—I guess, you know, the good thing is, you know, I think that, you know, if I don't feel, like, so much hatred. I feel, like, anger towards him and, you know, disappointment and all that, betrayal. I don't have hatred towards him to the point that I'm like, "Get all your shit out of here. I don't want to see anything that belongs to you in this house. Like, take your fucking -" Wait, no, none of that. And we do have storage. Like, if he finds a place that's small and he can't fit a lot of stuff, like, I'm obviously not going to be like, "No, like, you take it or I'm going to throw it out." [00:39:02]</p>

<p>And, you know, we do have furniture that's, granted, mine, like, because it came from my dad's house or my old bedroom or something. You know, like, there is a bed, there is a mattress, there is a dresser and a nightstand, and there are lamps and fans and—I mean, there's plenty of stuff that, you know, he can have. I mean, it's not, you know, (inaudible at 39:24) everything. I mean, like, [the air conditioner] (ph), all that. So, there's, like, at least we don't have to, you know, he doesn't have to, like, figure out how to get money to do all that and worry about that stuff because that would really suck for him. I mean, granted, it would not really be my problem and it would be like, (inaudible at 39:41).</p>

<p>(Sighs). I just wish it hadn't happened. Like, I just wish that—like, a lot of things. I mean, I just wish he hadn't been so fucking stupid and, like, taken me for granted. Like, OK, you want to be with me so badly now, like—I mean, and I think that the thing that I'll start to feel like, oh. And then I'll, like, be like, no. I'll start to get really upset again is when I'm like, no, he was so consciously doing this. Like, it wasn't an accident. He wasn't drunk, he wasn't on pain medication. Like, no, none of that. Like, this was all him, like, consciously making the decision to talk to this person the way that he was. And I mean, again, he could tell me all he wants that he was never going to meet up with her. I don't believe that. [00:40:43]</p>

<p>And I said to him, you know, "What if I hadn't done that and I had confronted you at dinner about, you know, feeling uncomfortable about knowing that you were still talking to her? Would you have come clean and told me, you know, "Well, actually it turned into this and this is what happened today." And he kind of was like—what did he say? He was like, "No, because it was all lies." I was like, "Well, then, I'm telling you, you know, that I'm so uncomfortable with this and, you know, why am I'm so uncomfortable with this, like, don't you think that, like, the a way of making me feel more trustable (ph) would have been to say, 'Actually Trina (sp?), I'm really sorry. Like, it got too far. Like, I want to talk about with you, you know.'"</p>

<p>But he wasn't going to even, like, and even that is kind of like, hmm, like, you have a lot to learn about being honest and trust and dealing with your own problems because, you know. I mean, it's almost—it would've been—like, if I hadn't checked that and, like, I had gone ahead with the plan of just trying to talk to him about it and not (inaudible at 41:49), like, literally, it would've just given him permission to keep doing it. Like, it almost feels like it would've been like, "OK, she didn't see anything. She doesn't know. I can either do it secretly, or do it less, or stop doing it, but it's still on my terms." [00:42:06]</p>

<p>And, you know, just thinking about those things just makes me feel, like, just really hurt, like, and sad, because, you know, I don't want somebody who would think that and, you know, again, he has done it before. Like, and I don't—there's nothing (inaudible at 42:25) he won't do it again. That's another reason he needs to move out and I can't do any kind of second chance because, again, that would just be giving him permission to walk all over me. I mean, you know, giving me passwords. I mean, please, you know, I don't want your fucking passwords, like, dude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. I guess we'll talk more (inaudible at 42:46) Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wednesday (inaudible at 42:49).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good (ph). OK, thank you. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, sure. Take care.</p>

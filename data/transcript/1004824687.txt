<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what's on my mind is kind of going back to what I want and what my interests are. And I don't know. I feel like I don't have very many, other than science or something. And I don't know. I think it worries me that I'm not more interested in things or I don't care about the things that I used to be more interested in. And I feel like in high school, I was much more interested in—I don't know. Just, I liked movies and I don't know. [00:01:10] I just felt like maybe I liked things more? I don't know.</p>

<p>But I don't know. Then again, I guess it comes down to not having much to do. But I don't know. (pause) I don't know if I'm doing it to, I guess, protect myself or not getting involved in things or if I'm just generally not interested. I don't know. But—(pause) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like—I don't know—I feel like it ties into me thinking I'm not a very good communicator at being able to share what I feel and my interests. And also I just like—I don't know—like I'm just thinking of an instance when in which friends and I were discussing something. And how I just kind of get, I guess, brain dead or I can't think of what I want to say. Or later, I'll think about it and I'll have an opinion. But at that moment, I'll just kind of—I don't know, brain dead. [00:03:07] (pause)</p>

<p>But I haven't really thought about it very much other than I think that I just worry. But I don't have more interests in like—I don't know. I was just thinking about it. My friends all have things that they—like sports or, I don't know, things that they're constantly looking into or know information about and I don't really know that much in. But like I don't really that, I don't really like seek after something or keep—I don't know—tabs on something. But I don't know. [00:04:02] (pause)</p>

<p>I guess it doesn't make for a good (chuckling) conversation. I don't really have much better to talk about—I don't know—other than my big (ph) problems. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) How do you mean? Do you mean in that it doesn't make for conversation here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yea, and in general of what to, I guess, discuss with people what's going on in my life or—(inaudible at 00:04:49).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling like there's something wrong with the way you're talking now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not when I'm talking it. It's just nothing comes to mind. [00:05:05] I don't really don't have much to say. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it that your mind goes blank or that things occur to you that don't seem relevant or important or appropriate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess my mind goes blank or—I don't know. I get feelings when I don't really understand them or—I don't know—can't unpack (ph) what they mean, I guess. I don't know. [They pack lots of meaning.] (ph) I don't know. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I encourage you to just sort of talk. And if a sort of a half-thought or a feeling that seems out of context comes up, feel free to sort of describe it, even if it isn't fully formed or it doesn't seem to fit. (pause) Yea—(pause) were you the whole time motivated (ph) that in a little bit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK well—(pause) [00:07:05] I mean, I'll try to do that not in sort of a general way, motivating approximate (ph) presentation. But like a little more closely to what we're talking about at least. So for example, I generally have the assumption that there's something going on in concert of getting in the way of your—and I want to say here or in conversing with friends or with sort of either knowing or developing your interests. [00:08:05]</p>

<p>I guess one example from what you've said that illustrates that or relates is when you say in the moment with your friends, you feel unsure what to say or where you're coming from but later it's clearer. So taking as it's plausible that that's an as an example of how in that moment, it's not like you don't have an opinion or you couldn't come up with a view in some sense, but you're into accessing it. And that later it's clearer or you can say alternatively that later when you feel freer to think about it, you kind of arrive at it in a way that you can't in the moment. It doesn't seem like you completely lack for the capacity to have opinions about things that people are talking about as so much as there something that's happening in the social setting that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—makes it difficult. [00:09:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's—to me it's I feel like, "Yea, brain that I can't access it." And then my automatic—like [prefers to] (ph) turn spot light on them. I don't know. Or just have them talk, I guess. Try to get any—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [There might have been] (ph) that there's so sort of (inaudible at 00:09:29) or story around why this happens the way it does for you. And that there are elements of that story that are pretty obscure to both of us. And that the best way to learn more about that is through free associating and our looking at it. [00:10:05] And as opposed to taking a more kind of linear, kind of organized, consciously problem solving approach which can sometimes make it harder to get at. Like what we all really know in first place. I mean, that approach is applicable to most problems in life but not so much to these other problems, I think.</p>

<p>And so I mean, I know this is kind of mean. It's a little less like knowing how to play your cards and knowing what kind of cards you have in your hand in the first place. And you can't really know even when a half feeling or some stray little thing that seems totally irrelevant comes up before you say it and see where it comes next, next, next. [00:11:03] Like how it actually may fit in. Like we'd always have experiences when we're just talking about—sorry, was it something that when it comes up and seems totally unimportant or irrelevant or out of context. Like then you merge it. That's the important part of the context for what's being talked about. And it just sort of takes a few steps to see it.</p>

<p>So, sometimes irrelevance kind of comes up [that's never clear.] (ph) Maybe it's not relevant but there are certainly many instances where it doesn't seem relevant or important in one's own head. And then after saying it and saying it and saying it more, like the sort of relevance and some of the sort of missing cards in a way start to merge and shed light on the problem. [00:12:03] So that's my little spiel for (chuckling) (inaudible at 00:12:12) explaining why I'm correcting that but do you have other questions about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, I understand. I guess it's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—not natural, I guess, for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, a lot of what happens with association involves the problems with capitulating (ph). In other words, those often relate in important ways again to the problem themselves. I mean, for you it's already sort of clear that it can feel like you can dwell over again and not being sure of what to say which is of course blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [00:13:00] And inevitably there are ways that that kind of thing happens for people. Like if somebody is nervous talking about a topic, it will occur to them they will get nervous and it will be hard to talk about it. I mean, it's kind of an errant part of the process which also makes it hard work and anxious and frustrating. (pause)</p>

<p>So and like an explanation like that isn't going to help you very much with the anxiety and frustration but it least sort of explains sort of an idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it—this just brings up like when—I was thinking of like but when I do it, that's the thing to talk about at work. Where, I guess, yesterday just reminding me like when I have something like silly or a decision, I often bug people and I guess it's—I don't know, I guess, I'm not—I kind of—I mean, I listen to people's advice or what they would do. But I guess it's, for me, it's kind of like having something to talk about with people. [00:14:19] And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like I often (ph) like—and my friend, I always go to her with like—just like simple, like, "Should I do this or should I do that? Or where should I go to do this?" I don't know. And I don't know, maybe that's my way of having a conversation. But also I think it's just useful. Like I always—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—like at work, I was sitting next to another teacher's (ph) assistant but she's a little bit older and—I don't know. I'm always like, "Oh, I'm so tired. Should I go? Or go out? Should I do this or whatever?" [00:15:07] She said, "Just go do it. I don't know." And then so, for some reason, then I always need, I guess, a little motivation with my decision. I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>This is not always true. I think I go through phases of when I feel more uncertain and others where I'm more, I guess, direct, I guess, when I know what I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it looks like it can be nice to have though. Like somebody else being encouraging or giving their opinion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But sometimes I feel like that it'd be annoying. I'll ask a specific question all hour, "Should I do this?" I don't know. [00:15:58] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you concerned that I'm annoyed with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe just on the fact that—I don't know. I can't really like get the ball rolling on the talking off the top of my head, I guess. Or just—I don't know—doing it better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any sort of thoughts about or like thinking about what my annoyed thoughts are or how I'm seeing you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that I wonder if you're frustrated or what, I guess in general, you think about me. [00:17:04] But I don't know. I guess I don't obsess about it. I just had it as a thought, I guess. I don't know. Like in a—well, I don't know. Yea, I don't worry about it too much. [It's just this feeling that I've thought about before.] (ph) (pause)</p>

<p>Well yea, I don't know. I just feel—(pause) yea, but I've all of a sudden—I don't know if it makes me feel like dependent on my friends to always ask these questions. And like, "Should we do this? Should we do that?" I guess I think it's because I don't trust my reasoning or I don't totally trust my perspective. I don't know. [00:18:07] And I think that also ties into why I can't like talk to a friend about a topic because I'm always like, "All right." And in the moment, I can't think about it or analyze it enough to just say what I want to say. Like, something where I would voice my opinion but in a conversation, I don't really have enough time to totally analyze how I feel. So I kind of just shut down maybe, like I can't make it into a logical thing. I can't just free associate clearly. So I kind of just shut down because I don't trust my—with perspective or my, I guess, feelings about it. I don't know. [00:18:56]</p>

<p>Maybe it goes into like I'm not who I want to be so—(crying)—and think about it later. And think of what would the best choice be or seem to be or what actually what my opinion is and is that something I want or like—I don't know. (inaudible at 00:19:22) But maybe I'm so unsure of myself. I don't know. It's kind of (inaudible at 00:19:34) later over what I'm thinking and analyzing. Change it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As though, yea, that's not going to do it, but I know politics or science or whatever that you kind of need to think it through in a way that's hard to do in the moment. And you sort of won't necessarily feel like you've done before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I know it's like you feel unprepared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yea. Yea, yea, more on certain topics more than others, right. Or I don't know how I feel about them or—(pause) well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also that you worry, including in here, about not being able to carry your part of the conversation comparative of all of where you feel you should be. [00:20:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in the way that's kind of result in another person getting (inaudible at 00:21:07).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yea, because I often feel like I leave the conversation saying, "Never mind, never mind, I don't know." (chuckling) Yea but—(pause) I don't know. Yea, I think I kind of one of my bosses went out of town for two weeks and he was e-mailing me and one of the computer science guys about coming to change for annotation marked data. But he was being very vague and he was in Asia. So he didn't have a very good Internet connection so we couldn't send him anything. Like, if we sent him an e-mail, we couldn't send him attachments, he couldn't open it. So I don't know. And that's the way our boss is. Like he comes back and there he's expecting us to do something. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>And so I don't know. I was brainstorming with, his name is Tom, and like what we should you do or maybe we should do a few things so we can show him the differences because he probably doesn't even know exactly what he wants. Just I don't know how we should do it. But I don't really like talking to him about ideas that I think we should do and so he's pretty narrow and he doesn't—he's a pure science guy—but he doesn't know a lot about biology (ph) genetics. So I was trying to explain things to him but I just—the concepts that I feel like I know very well but I can't vocalize them or explain them exactly. And I tried drawing it on the board and after still I was like—I mean I was, "I'll show you." I'm like, "Never mind, like let me think about it a little longer." [00:23:06] And I don't know. And I felt a little embarrassed but I don't know.</p>

<p>Yea, and that used to also happen a lot with my friend Mike who was also a computer science guy that I worked a lot with at work. And I would go to him with like a half idea of, "Oh I really want to look at this." And then I would be like, "OK, tell me what you want to look at," even though I was just kind of like—I don't know—rambling. I guess it wasn't clear. I guess because—in my mind, I understood what I wanted to do but I guess it's hard for me to vocalize or have the right unit vocabulary to describe what I wanted. I mean, like Mike was there, we can usually piece it together. But with Tom, it's still like, "No." So he doesn't quite understand everything. So a little harder for me with the—I don't know. [00:24:08] So I think that it goes into not being able to describe my knowledge or what I want. Or maybe the way I understand things aren't very logical or especially with these computer science guys where they're so like—(chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) (inaudible at 00:24:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, especially Mike. So I don't know. Yea so—(pause) And also on the work on the—a contact person for the large project and a lot of people ask me for data and sort of things. And then I have to go get it done to get exactly what I want or to format it the way they want it. And even I understand exactly what the person wants. [00:25:01] But for me to like—and I understand why they want it and then it's hard for me to often like say to them what they want. You know I understand—I don't know. It's weird. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Say that again? I—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I understand what—like people requested it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I understand what they way but it's often hard for me to tell them what they want. Or say it in the way that they understand what they want because I guess if I just sent them—like forward them an e-mail and they wouldn't exactly understand it because they don't know I guess everything that's going on behind it. So I could describe it exactly what they want. And that's when I get like hung up. It's like I don't know. Think maybe I'm really too concise. Just not very good at explaining things, so—(pause) [00:26:01]</p>

<p>It reminds me of like in school, studying implicit and explicit and I always thought I had that I had a much more implicit on things, understanding things logical. I don't know if it's I'm tricking myself and like, "Oh, I got this." (chuckling) That's how I feel about science in general. And it's like I can do well on a test and I understand how things works but it's hard for me to explain to people. I don't know and yea. [00:27:01] And I think it's—like I often talk to Vicki (sp) about this. We took similar classes. And yea, that's the way—the different ways we understand things. I don't know or yea, how it's different. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has that always been true? Like is this something else that seemed to have been more difficult over the last couple of years? Or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—is it something that you—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's gotten more work into describing things. But also I think because things are more complicated and especially when I went to school and started studying. [00:28:09] It's a lot more science. I don't know. (pause) Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it also harder with Tom than with Mike because at least after a while you had some confidence that it would—that you and Mike could work it out and then he would sort of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I always felt self-conscious around Mike but we worked together for two years and I think I just got over it. Or like I would feel self-conscious but then I was like, "He's never like gone to the boss and be like, ‘I think Molly is insane.'" [00:28:56] (chuckling) But he was always patient. And I don't know. He never got angry that I was a little—like come at him with a lot of idea and then we would have to work together to kind of [leave out but one.] (ph) With Tom I think it's harder he just is not—he quite doesn't understand the level of Mike that understands. So I have to explain more, I think. And I think that's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it's more that than your having become more confident with Mike. Although it sounds like you sort of did in the sense that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I didn't think he would judge me. Well, I don't think Tom would judge me because he's also very nice and I don't know. I joke with him that I—I mean, I don't know, what was the band? [00:30:05] Like, "Oh, I don't really know what it's going on?" Just do it, mostly what happens. (pause) So, all right.</p>

<p>I think that my hang up is more that I'm upset that I can't explain myself, that I think that I'm being judged by Tom or Mike. I think I'm more upset about that. (pause) Yea, it's like they're both misunderstanding me, pretty sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even with my—like if my boss comes by and asks about something and I kind of feel like I'm getting into the—or I'm half explaining things or having trouble. [00:31:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not worried that he's thinks that I'm doing it wrong or I don't know what I'm doing. I'm more worried that I can't explain it well. That also comes from another experience of him not ever getting mad but I didn't understand. I don't know. I just—I feel like he never got mad but I didn't understand something. I never, even if I thought he—I messed up or was an idiot about something. I don't know. It doesn't really affect me, it more affects that I can't explain what's going on, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you under the impression that it's mostly your frustration at not being able to more easily explain what you mean or what's kind of on your mind? [00:32:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think I said this before but like when at writing that research paper or something, I have all these ideas. And putting them together, I guess because I have such like strong little tidbits of ideas, but stringing them all together and kind of making a coherent paper. So even if it takes me a lot of time, none of them—like I'll work on it for a while. Write a little bit here, right? Like write all my ideas down and then kind of have—I have to go through it with someone. Like Vicki and my other friend Anna (ph) is good at science papers and kind of, I guess, organized. Like yea make it, and then hearing kind of—I guess come up with the hypothesis or opinions. So—[00:33:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it was somewhat bottom up in that you'd have tidbits or pieces of ideas and they would help you arrange them in a way that made what you're writing I guess more coherent? And would also make clear what your overall opinion was? Or view?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess yea, I think it's a little bit of both. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm just trying to remember like—I remember I was writing a paper on—I guess writing it on (inaudible at 00:33:49) and I was focusing on—I don't know. They were stressing pregnant rats, or whatever, at different stages of in trimesters. [00:33:58] And I remember I had all these like—I had like yea, an a hypothesis. And why, I guess why, it was happening and I had different papers. But I don't know. And maybe then I wasn't good at maybe making all the parts fit together because I like knew why my mind was like, "Oh, from this paper, it was because during second trimester, it was with HPA." Like all of this different stuff. But I couldn't, I guess, piece it together. I was clear and I understood it in my mind. I guess I don't know. It was kind of like, "What are all these different fragments?" And I know it was because I'm like not a very good writer or just not very good at explaining myself. (pause) [00:35:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are various things that we need to think that it's not mostly like a kind of an expressive language kind of issue. [00:35:57] But do you have reason to think that it is, in part, that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:36:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, the only thing that would make me say something but I think I've gotten over is like I'm late on separating or whatever and I didn't read until I was 12. But—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And I took—I got tutoring in—tutored in this program which I think is for dyslexics. And it was—it turned everything around. Like I started—was able to read and very well afterwards and I guess caught up with everything. But that's the only thing I could think of. But I don't think it directly had a way of expressing myself. [00:36:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. I mean, it sounds like a different—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—I mean, that's interesting but did you have—you must have had a bunch of testing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think they thought I was a sick child. (chuckling) I had a lot of earaches and ear problems. So that was because of my hearing but I never had none of that—that big of a loss but they thought I must have. I don't know. I don't know. But yea, I had some testing and yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it didn't look like that difficulty with reading was due to dyslexia?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think it was dyslexia. I think it was, I don't know, they call it late onset. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) I mean, it's like, yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did have problems with—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That explains it. [00:38:02] (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I did have problems, I remember, when I was really young with b's and d's but I always just like remember the dog was, like the curve of him, on this side. So I could always, I guess, associate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had a good memory when I was younger so (inaudible at 00:38:21) so I could—I think they call it letter-by-letter reading so I could remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Well I could—I did well in school and I could fake that I could read but when it came to—I remember my first grade teacher wrote like, "The bunnies in the fields," and we're supposed to write a paragraph about it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—and I was just blank. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I couldn't spell very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop for now. We'll talk more next. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. OK.</p>

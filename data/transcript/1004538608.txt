<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (sigh), so (pause) something happened on Friday which was (sigh) you know kind of (inaudible at 00:00:24) but it's still bothering me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so, um, it also involves Lucy so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which is a little weird about that, but kind of going forward. Um, and so I had (yawns) tried to make plans with her earlier in the week last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it didn't work, um. So then I suggested that we meet after work, which to me is after five, which to her is after seven because she has people who work flex time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, oh...no, I need to be home like...so I was like okay let's meet at 5:30 and she's like I'm not ready, I can't leave until about sevenish cuz I said after work, and I was like okay, whatever. Then I was like well, you know this Friday at seven my friend is doing a book reading at the Book Store and I'm like okay, is what we're gonna do is you and Ashby make reservations and I was like sprint over after therapy, and I was like order me a drink or whatever, we'll get small things, then we'll just go right there, so it's like...[ 00:01:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya got, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is plan A.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like tight, tight timing, whatever. Um, like we have 15 minutes in which to consume food (laughs) and get over there. Um (pause) and so while I was walking over Ashby said Lucy's not here. And I'm like what? Cuz you know it's after six and I'm saying mmm, and then I get a text from her saying she was (inaudible at 00:02:11) depressed, was having trouble leaving the house and there was more traffic than she expected, so she's gonna be running late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, sorry, I'm confused. So, I thought Lucy said that she couldn't meet till after seven.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was for earlier in the week. So we rescheduled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:02:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we...earlier hadn't worked and we rescheduled to Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got ya.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had to agree on the time...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I was like it's super...like I said like it's really time crunched.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. No, I...right...I got all that. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then Lucy texted, having not shown up, and says she's feeling depressed. She's having a hard time leaving the house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then she's like oh, and then there's more traffic than I expected. And I'm kind of like it's a Friday night in Cambridge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:02:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But whatever. So I get there and she's still not there and Ashby's pissed because like our whole plan is contingent on like eating really quickly and getting over there and I'm like mmm...so then whatever. I said we'll just order for her. I'll text her. It's like (inaudible at 00:03:22) like what do you want? We're going to be staying. There's no reply. I'm like...and then she comes in like 20 minutes late and says oh, I'm sorry I went to the wrong restaurant and then I left my phone in the car. And I was really annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like (sighs) like you can't be claiming it's late when we only have like, ya know we have less than hour to eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also that you like left your phone in the car and I'm like uhh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like okay, whatever, like it happened, you're here, let's eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:03:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she didn't like what we'd ordered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, well, mmm, and I was...I'd also texted her...I'd also texted her but she didn't get it obviously, saying if you're running really late just meet us at the Book Store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:04:15) and like, so it was just kind of frustrating. Ashby was really pissed about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was more like...I was pissed at first but then I was like whatever, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's done. So we're walking to the, walking over to the Book Store. A friend had already reserved seats for us, and um, my friend was talking...her book is about fat acceptance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a good reading. It was a great audience. And like a lot of people I knew were there and like etcetera, etcetera, and so during the Q&A I think I had asked Elaina some goofy question and I was going to ask her a serious question but I didn't get a chance to, and Lucy said well, ya know, um, a lot of the fat fashion blogs I see are for the fem style for men who wear feminine clothing, and I don't like wearing that kind of clothing so where are the blogs for rich, fat people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:05:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Elaina's response is like there really aren't any. And my followup...and I was like yeah, and I was like oh, well, like this would be...there's two things you can do. You can look at blogs for (inaudible at 00:05:41) like chubby gay men and there is a blog called chubster which is all guys masculine fashion...and then Elaina's saying she's like but I don't like their fashion and I don't want to date gay men and I'm kinda like mmm, like sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, and she's like your saying...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just kind of the best you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm like there's nothing out there...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that I have really seen, like this is where it' at and she says like, and she was really dismissive about that and I was well, whatever. Like I've been asked that question a bazillion times. There's not really a good answer. Um, like you can pick out individuals but really there's not a good answer. So, um, and then Elaina mentioned like there are some butch fashion blogs that are also tangentially run by kind of some chubby people sort of but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not part of their...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like not a lot of butch or masculine guys' fashion blogs. It's like they just don't sew (laughs)...okay, yeah, alright. Um, so when it was over one of my friends I could tell she really was bursting to say something but wasn't for some reason. I said did you have something to say? She was like okay...well, I'm gonna be really polite and she talks a little bit about like plus-size fashion, masculine fashion and like what's happening there, and I'm not really paying attention because I've already had this conversation. I'm talking to someone else I know. And then I get up to stand in line to have my book signed and Lucy comes over and looks really pissed and she's like I don't appreciate being lectured to by someone, ya know. I'm an intelligent person. I went to Brown. And I was like what? Ya know. I didn't hear your conversation and I don't really...and (pause) and so she had interpreted my friend saying I want to be...I'm going to try to be polite as being really catty. And I'm like no, she literally is trying to be polite because she doesn't want to be rude to you, and she's my friend so she doesn't want to be rude to my friend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, that's what happened. And so she starts ranting about how she's mad about that, and then Ashby turns to her and snaps something like you're being really rude and reductive and then stomps off, cuz Ashby's in a bad mood and I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And annoyed from before. [00:08:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And annoyed from before. And I was kind of like well...that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? And I mean Ashby's really good at hitting like the jab that really hurts. Like, and plus she like knew the jab that really hurts and stomped off. And I was like huh. And then Lucy just burst into tears and...I said, I'm just like what just happened? Um, and (pause) she just sort of said...she, like and so she's talking to me and she said yeah, I feel like people are saying that I'm bad and stupid for asking about masculine fashion and that I shouldn't ask about it because like that's a horrible thing to do. Then that's okay you should just tell me so. And I'm like, no. I'm just what? And then she did ask me like well why did, ya know, Ashby say that I was rude and reductive. I don't know. I'm not Ashby.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:09:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can tell you that Ashby's in a bad mood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I...I don't know! Um, and she's going on about my friend Pat and I was like well, Pat was a nanny for 20 years. Sometimes people perceive her tone as being a certain way because she worked with kids for so long. I didn't feel that, but whatever, ya know. So like it's a possibility, and (pause) she just was like, I don't know, like she was, ya know, really upset and crying and sort of like asking me why did my friends do these things and I'm like I wasn't there for the conversation. I'm thinking I'm pretty sure that didn't really happen...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but like, whatever. And I also said like you'd have to ask that person. I don't know. And she said well I know that you don't know, but why? Like I...don't...have an answer. I'm like the other answer in my head is kinda like well, ya know (pause) there aren't a lot of options for masculine fashion and to say well, I don't like them when given like the two options, like that is a little flip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't like huge but I was kind of like mmm. I was going to wait about for like two seconds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then (inaudible at 00:11:13) and, um, I think I tried to give her a hug and she was like I don't want you to touch me and I'm like okay, and while she's sobbing and talking to me at one point (chuckles) um, the office husband is like I'm really sorry. This person just wanted to see you really briefly, and I'm like Jesus Christ. I would love to talk to this person but Lucy's having a meltdown in the middle of the store...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:11:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I can't really deal with that right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right now is not the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know, and I was like hi. You know me, right? I have to try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can pull Lucy aside into like an aisle so we can't be seen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And continue talking to her, and it was this whole like meltdown about how (pause) like stuff from her childhood and how people had told her that she's been rude, she doesn't understand, and no one will explain to her and (pause) just like all this stuff and she was terrified that this was another example of her like not...of her being rude...or of not acting correctly and no one telling her and people saying if you don't understand then you just...I can't help with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, uh, as though she sort of...everybody knows but nobody's really willing to help her out and tell her like (inaudible at 00:12:44).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was just kind of like...it was a book talk. (sighs) And so after a half hour she kinda was calmed down enough that I felt like I could, ya know, maybe get my book signed, say hi or something, and (pause) she...and a couple times was like do you want to go out for drinks after this? And I'm like no. And I said, um, at first I was like, ya know, maybe you just...maybe you're tired and you've haven't eaten dinner. You want a full dinner. And she (inaudible at 00:13:25) again and then I'm like why don't you go home, eat something, drink some water and basically lie down. Like I figured as how you should do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I feel like if you have an enormous meltdown in public usually means...like for someone to just stay home on the couch it like it usually means she was having a crappy day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she didn't say like do you want to hang out? Do you want to go for drinks? I've got my car... and I was like, I said no, I really don't...I don't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:13:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, also cuz I'm thinking, look if you want to go for drinks you can't give me a ride home after.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you're actually so upset I don't want to be in the car with you driving and also I'm exhausted from this meltdown so I'd really like to go home and lie down, like myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it was just I found it hugely frustrating and I was really...I just passed over a lot of things like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like that she was late and like, and the like the fact that you left your phone in your car. Like, that's like...I too have left my phone in places or accidentally left the ringer off. But it was really frustrating, and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a combination of like her, um, sort of (pause) being upset, requiring a lot at various points in the night and, uh huh, also kind of making it all about her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like there was no like oh, I left my phone in the car and oh, I'm sorry because I know that made things more difficult for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was just like I left my phone in the car, like...but it wasn't really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or, I've had this meltdown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've am having a hard time, but I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fuck this up for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just all about what she was upset about and how upset she was and what she wanted and things like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the point of I guess not even listening to your telling her a few times that you didn't want to go out afterwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And (sigh), I mean it sounds kind of harsh but we're not good enough friends for me to put up with that level of like crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, ya know, like and (inaudible 00:16:13)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was a lot to ask, and as we were like leaving the restaurant I was kind of like oh...I was thinking to myself I should tell her she should go get something like to eat up on (inaudible at 00:16:14) like grab a sandwich. I'm like she's an adult. If she's hungry, she should go feed herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm not...(inaudible 00:16:32) myself for thinking like oh, I bet she won't cuz whatever. (Sighs) She's an adult. Um, I also was pissed at Ashby for making a remark that she knew was going to upset Lucy. Ashby actually...Ashby apologized for that before we left though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To Lucy or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me. (Laughs). Yeah. She didn't regret the remark at all...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:16:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but Ashby kind of was I don't regret what I said. I do regret the (inaudible at 00:17:06) of causing your friend to have a meltdown. But also Ashby was like I didn't think that that was gonna like...she didn't want to say something mean. She didn't think it was gonna turn her like a complete freakout.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and then she's like I'm sorry for like kind of like (inaudible at 00:17:24) part of the evening and I was like well, mmm. Like, it happened and honestly while that was mean I would not...saying you're being rude and reductive and then stomping off I'm kind of like well, that was an asshole move, but like whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also (inaudible at 00:17:48) I was feeling like I just want to go to this book reading and then hang out and you were having this meltdown and it's all about you and you've really been talking about a lot of things. You really focused it on why aren't you giving me resources to the things that I want. Like she specifically wants aspirational photos like masculine fashion but not men's fashion and not there's and not anything that's already out that, and I'm just like I...I don't know what to tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort it out. Um, I also, Elaina had written this whole essay about how plus-size shopping is like always this like digging and digging through horrible ugly plus-size catalogues, trying to find something to fit your size and it's really difficult, and that's just not something that the people who can walk into a mall and find...and like just try on clothes appreciate. Which I tried to sort of relate back to Lucy. It's like, ya know, like mmm. Um, and then she went home that night and like angrily posted on her blog about how...it was just really weird and it was, it was annoying, so I'm like I feel like your passive-aggressively telling me about this, but then again you just told me about it for a long time, so whatever. But (pause) the way she talked about it, it was like everyone and like...she said I'm very comfortable wearing dumb clothing (inaudible at 00:19:34). I'm like, that's not true or else you're really uncomfortable with it. And so she was (inaudible at 00:19:39) about how she's totally comfortable wearing fem clothing but she didn't want to, and she wanted to dress in a certain way that she couldn't describe but she really wanted aspirational photos that looked like that and she was just really angry at everyone was imposing a gender binary upon her and all this other stuff. And I'm like, ya know what Lucy, I've been shopping with you. You don't...you're not comfortable with fem clothing. Like, she did report that she tried to be more comfortable with fem clothing for a while, like ya know thanks to Karen for helping with that. I'm like, yeah but you're not...like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:20:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you're really...like you are more (inaudible at 00:20:26) of yourself than...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well your actions are more (inaudible at 00:20:28) than you're willing to admit. And I found that really frustrating. It kind of re-upped all my irritation when I read it the next day. So I'm just like (sighs), like that's not what happened, it's not all about you and also you're really in denial about this thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, I feel really...done talking to her about that stuff. Like, I feel done with it. Like...because I don't, I don't feel like...I don't feel like anything penetrates and I feel like she's dumping all this emotional crap on me without (pause) like (pause), without fair warning. Like (pause)...so I've been clothes shopping with transgender guys who are like I can't...clothes shopping is so hard like (inaudible at 00:21:50) blah blah. Can you come with me and be my girlfriend and that'll make this whole thing easier. And I'm like yes! I can do that. And then I know I'm like we're gonna (inaudible at 00:21:57) and that's, that's part of our little package of the shopping trip. Um, with Lucy it's partially I think my own like voluntary denial. What she says is I'm having a hard time with like fashion. I don't know what looks good. I'm like, alright, I'll help you. I'm anesthetic. I can impose it or whatever, but then it becomes I'm fat, I'm hideous, I'm unworthy. Like this whole spiral and I'm like mmm! And then there's also a lot of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lucy describes the shopping trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's a fuckin' nightmare, and I'm just like what? And there's a lot of like passive-aggressive weirdness that happens too. I'm also kind of like, if you want me to make decisions for you, then let's do that. And if you don't, let's do that. You don't...like I'm not your mom. You don't need to act out to prove whatever. Like, ya know, like that's, that does not affect me. Um (pause) and yeah, so she didn't say anything about it all weekend to me. Um, at the end of the evening on Friday I was like let's try to hang out next week, and she said well, my in-laws are coming to town, and then she invites me to a house concert. And I'm kinda like (sigh), the house concert is a car drive away, which means I can't leave early if I want to. It's not actually music that I've ever listened to and (pause)...no? But (sighs) mostly I just like (sighs), I mean I know it's a pattern of behavior I have of emotional vampire friends. Um, like friends who are really needy and I keep on being like well, let me help you, let me help you. Um, and like I don't know why, so they always like fuck, like. I just felt really done with Lucy's, with like Lucy's fat hate and not wanting to talk about it. Not wanting to talk to her about it probably like none at all again because (sighs) (pause) it's the kind of intensity where I'm just like you really should talk to your therapist. Like, if someone's off-hand remark makes you feel like it has undone 20 years of therapy...I really can't help you with that (laughs) like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially not in the middle of a book store, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and like also (pause) it just...it's too much. Like I can't do that. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you, uh (pause) I understand your explaining...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds a little also maybe like you're justifying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs). Yes. I have (sighs) (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like there could possibly be some guilt involved here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I...(inaudible at 00:25:49) be saying no...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like the two things that hit me the worst are people struggling with fat hatred and fat acceptance and, um, (sighs) great...now it's gonna be gone out of my head. At any rate, like that's one of the big ones, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other one is something else involved in this situation too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs) Like I don't know...or no! Like my thoughts are just being really scattered but I'm like fat acceptance is one of those things where I'm like if you're feeling (inaudible 00:26:29) I'm always like, well I'm feeling fat, and I'm always like uhh! Let me help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like the kind of other big one is, um, LGBT people who feel shitty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's what I was gonna say. Like the other thing I'm always sympathetic towards is like (sighs) light-skinned people of color who have like some crazy...like have like weird internalized racism or feeling like, I mean it's really common amongst biracial people this feeling like, ya know, I'm not really black. Like I had a time in my life when I was like I still don't know how to be black. And everyone knows I'm not technically black and like all this stuff and then I was like no, wait, crap...that's ridiculous. And I really did the same thing. And like, ya know, I just like...I kinda feel bad for anyone in that situation because it's horrible (laughs) and it's really hard to talk about it because most people who've gone through that rude self-hating stage don't really want to talk about it because it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Horrible? [00:27:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's horrible and (sighs)...I don't know. It's like one of those things that just, just like...cuz you have to talk about like I was a complete jerk like for a long period. Like I was a jerk to myself and to others for this period of time. Because part of that is also usually...like especially in high school and college like, well like I'm not like those other black people or gay people. I'm different. I'm better and I'm special.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I get it. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it also involved this like, they are bad and I am awesome because I'm like not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you later feel like shit about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, uh (laughs). Yeah. And it's just (sighs). Yeah, I mean so it's like, yeah if you function like...it's just...it's really kind of a horrible place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I see it like more often it's like teens or like early 20s. I'll see people like kind of having these feelings and I'm like, yeah, um, like I don't know. I just kind of want to give them a big hug and be like...you're not white and it's okay. Um, because a lot of that, like especially if you're light-skinned enough to to pass. It's like a lot of wanting to pass and then it's like no, that's so horrible for you emotionally, but I know why...I know why you're doing it, but you're gonna really regret that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so like Lucy kind of hits the light-skinned person of color who has a bunch of self-hate plus the fat acceptance stuff and uh, (pause)I think she sometimes unconsciously like dumps on me about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like that's some of the passive-aggressiveness is that she, uh, um, I guess treats you with some of the hatred?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and like I guess...I don't know if she wants me to fix it or what, but like I'll get this like...like I wanted to be talking about whatever and it's like there was this huge like emotional bomb dropped, and I'm just like uhh! I thought we were going to be talking about books or drinking some tea. I do not want...like this is not what I want (pause) and it also feels super one-sided because (pause) I mean like we aren't actually super close and so it's not like we're sharing like emotional...dropping emotional bombs on each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:30:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's not reciprocal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um (pause)...and also like (sighs) I do find it (sighs)...part of the thing about like getting the sort of body hatred, like someone dumping their body hatred like on to me like and verbally or whatever is that (pause) it really brings up....it...because it...often, like often people smaller than me and that's really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mention that? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then people bigger than me and I'm like well, like I can't really argue with you. Like, like I don't know it's like it feels differently both ways, um...but it leaves me feeling like not really questioning myself but like it sort of like leaves me feeling low about my body for a little while. Um, like, like I'm having like I'll have like...I'll have a this is not a great body image day. Which I think everyone has but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um (pause) and my friend Jenna who has crazy body hatred that she also expresses a lot (sighs) (pause) and so like feels the same way. I think...I guess the other thing is I also feel like (pause) mmm, for both of them I'm like there are resources out there. There are things you can read. I've told you about them. Like if you want to read like blogs about it or books or like all these other things. Like these are things that you can do that I've also done. Like you can blog about it. You can talk to your therapist about it. You can whatever, whatever. I'm not your only option and I don't like feeling like I'm here for you just to emotionally dump on me (pause) um (pause) and what frustrates me, which is always frustrating me, is I never really know...I never feel like I have a great way to sort of stop that pattern, or to say like I really need you to stop doing that, um (pause) because I always feel guilty about saying that, and I feel bad saying that to someone who is like really upset but on the other hand like I just really don't feel like...and (inaudible at 00:34:03) to being like sucky and upsetting and like emotional like also things. I feel like I'm spending a lot of my energy keeping myself afloat? Like I'm reaching for my own air mask.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:34:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't help...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I need to put mine on before I can assist someone else, and I don't feel like I'm at all like, ya know, in an emotionally stable, awesome place to like help someone else out very much. Like (pause) I don't know. I mean like not entirely but like (sighs). I don't know, like, I guess I don't feel like, I'm like if we're all really, really good friends these are already like back and forthed. I just don't have time for it. Like, I just don't have time for it. I'm like I just can't cope with it. Like I just uhh. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause) So (pause) yeah then the guilt and frustration sounds like pretty closely intertwined there. Um (pause) and (pause) I just think part of the guilt seems to come from being like empathic (inaudible at 00:36:22).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um (pause) and also feeling like (pause) I manage to...like I'm no longer like a self-hating (inaudible at 00:36:40) person. I don't hate my body, and I feel like I got to the other side and I would like, I'm like, like actually hard and it sucks and it takes a while and like I kinda wanta like reach out and be like, want to give you like a hand with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) but with Lucy just...I...and not just Lucy, like I mean I just that was just like...that night I just felt like I was being dragged down more than anything else. Um, (pause) and I also was thinking of like well, I mean I tried to talk to her about like what were the specific things that like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, ya really keep going on this sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ya know...I mean you kind of keep coming around to how you can maybe help or um, why it actually really doesn't make sense to try to help her as though you haven't laid it out on a number of friends already. I'm not saying I mind hearing it, it's just that it...it seems like you're, you have to keep justifying it to yourself which I guess means you keep feeling pretty guilty about it. [00:38:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean...and clearly you really want to be able to help. I mean that comes across.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, ya know and (pause) like no one wants to be crying in the middle of a book store. Like that really sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know...or like to be really hungry and cranky or like all these other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...And I know her husband was away for the weekend so she was like also depressed about that. And part of me...like the other thing I was also feeling like, is I'm like is (sighs)...which actually I do feel—it sounds a little callous - but I feel like okay, if you feel really depressed and you can't leave the house, you should just say I'm really depressed and can't leave the house. Like, that's...like that's the completely, like that's a reason to cancel on an event or to be like I can't do dinner early and that sort of thing, or like, or to be like wow, this is really upsetting, I have to go. Ya know like, ya know like definitely gone...like invited friends to events and have them be like this is really good but it stirred up everything so I have to leave now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like good with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) I actually feel like (sighs)...I don't know (pause) (sighs). The best way I can describe it is I just felt like, like get your shit together. Like if you can't go out...like if you said you can't leave the house, don't. Ya know, if you're...thought someone was being really rude either say that was really rude or like don't. Like I don't know, like it's kinda like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like you're annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're having a hard time telling people you're annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it would be the guilt again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also like I...when I'm feeling really depressed I worry about like...I think it's okay to say I'm feeling depressed, like I just need to cancel tonight, but I also feel like ohh...like I don't wanta be...I don't want my friends to think of me as that like that really depressed person who's always really sad or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the sort of thing you might think when you're depressed and don't want to go out so what are they are going to think I f you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes! [00:41:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I also feel like, I don't know, like uuk! (pause) I don't know, I was kind of thinking about like friends and people I know who are my age who've like done like impressive things, like with their work or whatever. And I'm saying like well, you know to be honest like I haven't done any massive like career success but I actually feel like well, ya know, I've managed to consistently like get out of bed, feed myself, clothe myself, go to work, ya know, go to school, like...and some days that feels like that was the hardest thing I did, like, um, (pause) (sighs) which is frustrating because I'm kinda like, uh, like I do think like...like sometimes I do think like that was a lot, like I do feel like yeah, it's impressive that I haven't...that I've managed to like, ya know, at least look at myself staying together, employed, etcetera, but it's not something that you really get accolades about (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, even though it would be nice. And...I don't know. (pause) I guess I wanted like (pause) like I was just really (pause) like I was kinda thinking like, like Friday's been a rough day. I'm feeling these things and then she'll like go from therapy to dinner to (inaudible to 00:43:12).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm cool and not like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...depressed. It's a big crowd. Let's not stress about it. I'm making it through. I'm kinda like Lucy, I really just want you to do that. Like on this day of days I would like you to just either pull it together, like pull it together, don't just say like I'm going, I'm not going, or I need to leave, or just kind of anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess these would have been ways she could have like however sort of implicitly been there for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like especially at the end of our conversation and she was really clearly wanting me to (A) go out with her even though like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...what the fuck now. And also kind of...it seemed like she wanted me to tell her what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (pause) should she call a friend, should she have done like all these things, and I'm just like uhhh! Like I don't know. If you're hungry, eat some dinner. Like I don't (pause), I don't want to tell you what to do. Like I just felt like she was asking so much and not really acknowledge...like she kinda says like was like oh, I'm sorry. I think she said it like once but like it wasn't. Like I don't think...I think like it didn't...like she thought so much about herself and not really acknowledging like that I was feeling crappy, and like didn't like drop me a line (inaudible to 00:45:10) like sorry about the meltdown...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:45:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...yeah...and it also says like ya know if you just want to get (inaudible at 00:45:18) or ya know like this other thing, like let me know. Nothing. And (pause) it just feels like weird, like (pause) selfish and like self-involved in this way that I don't like and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have trouble, um, keeping a hold of like sort of (pause) the feeling of having been a good friend to her, having been there for her, having really actually worked pretty hard to, um (pause) I don't know what to say. Like, uh, kind of give her a lot of leeway and support that evening, um...like, I guess what I'm saying is you're being a good friend and kind of working hard to be that? Um, in spite of feeling so, uh, like put upon and I guess taken for granted throughout? I'm not sure you, like, whether or not you retain a clear sense of those things in the course of the evening or after.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs) During the course of the evening not really. Like (pause) I was really mostly...I was like flip-flopping between really pissed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:47:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean, oh my God, let me get her off this ledge so I can leave (chuckles)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, I don't know. Over the weekend I was mostly feeling like this person being mad and frustrated and kind of taken advantage of in a way. (sighs) I guess what (sighs)...it does feel hard to sort of think about like ways in which I've been a good friend. I think in part because (pause) I don't really feel like coming back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, or like a real acknowledgment of it, or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're gonna stop for now. Um, I guess that seems like it might be an important point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Also I figured out I need to reschedule on Monday because I have another dental appointment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last of this series I hope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uhh, let's see. Scheduling next Monday. Ya know I think I could do this time again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so it's Tuesday the first, 5:15. There we go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Got it.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Interview of, 1970. Interview number nine. Client number 0729-107. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

</p><p>PATIENT: Good morning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hey. [On this lovely, early morning.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I overslept.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh?

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:39.2) overslept. The kids didn't have to get off to school. And how are you?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I'm pretty good. How about you?

</p><p>PATIENT: It has been good. You get all your Easter candy shopping done?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, finally.

</p><p>PATIENT: I realized that I had not done my candy shopping yet. I'm at the last minute trying to - I sort of feel like Ed McMahon. Shop right before the holidays.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, sometimes that is the best day. I often have done some the day before and sometimes [I've got them all done] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: [No, anything can last if you've got the] (ph) great American dream of buying up everything you can get your hands on. Well, it really hasn't gone away. I'm really (inaudible at 0:01:48.0) about something I chose. I've told you before that there is a young lady that I work with who I've really gotten to know. And I guess I've gotten to know her too well. I really feel very close to her. And I feel quite sexually excited by her. And here two days before Easter (inaudible at 0:02:27.4). But it really scares me.

</p><p>She is going home for the holiday. She is going home today. And I mean I'm really going to miss her. And I never have really felt this way about anybody but my wife. And it has just got me scared to death.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: At the very idea of feeling that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I halfway felt like wanting to go with her. Well, I do want to go with her. And I began doing some thinking that I don't like to do. It scares me a lot. It makes me very uncomfortable about why should I be with Susan and the kids during this holiday. What are the alternatives? I mean, God that is really frightening. [0:03:23.6]

</p><p>And I just don't know quite what to do. She, of course, is married. But one of the reasons she is going home is she is thinking seriously about separating from her husband. And I don't know how much of that I have superimposed on myself. And it has really been hard this past week or so. So it is hard making sense out of it.

</p><p>I know that I do really love Susan and my children. There is a lot of responsibility there. And sometimes I think that all and a part of the idea of going with her would be less responsibility. It'd be just one person.

</p><p>And I just don't know how to handle this. I keep coming back to that old thing that I really trust and that is what I would call discipline, for lack of a better word. Well, what you do is you just make yourself very cold to it. Just all, "Well, I really don't want to do that." It is really hard for me right now to know exactly what to do, what I can do, what feels comfortable.

</p><p>Because then I'm with her, it is very comfortable. We have a good relationship. When I'm with Susan, I have a good relationship sometimes, but not all the time. I'm thinking about this woman when I'm with Susan.  And I'm thinking about Susan when I'm with this woman. [0:05:19.9]

</p><p>And I think I'm the cause of the conflict. So actually I'm really quite frightened by this. This is the first time I've really felt this strongly about another female. And I don't really know how to deal with it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Some might have] (ph) felt frightened by allowing yourself to even feel the feelings and then it is, "Okay, if I feel them, what do I do about it"?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, how the hell did I ever get this involved and so on? Now that I am this involved, should I get uninvolved? How do I really handle this? I've looked at the feelings with this other woman. And I seriously think some of them are sexual, but many of them are not. She is a very modest, a very tender, person - very warm. And it really hasn't [felt right.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there is a very strong pull toward her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes, it is. But it is something I have never really seriously - unless I fantasized, I never really have seriously considered ever leaving Susan.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And is that probably why it is so frightening? Suddenly you realize, "I'm really thinking about concretely leaving her." [0:07:10.6]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like I thought last night, it'd be just delightful to go out to the airport tonight and hop on a plane with her. (inaudible at 0:07:26.1) But then it would come tomorrow. And I'd wake up, and I'm divorced with (inaudible).

</p><p>I have no real grounds that I see as valid as it regards to Susan.  It seems like a very important point. I mean, I feel like I can really handle this right or I can really blow it. I could go with her, which I think would be blowing it. I could make myself very cold to her, which I think would be blowing it.

</p><p>But I really don't know what else (inaudible at 0:08:19.2) to break this thing clearly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because those are the only two alternatives you've ever experienced?

</p><p>PATIENT: Those are the only two I've ever experienced. I've only experienced really one. I mean I have left Susan once. But those seem like the only two alternatives, because there is the chance that she might not be coming back after the holiday.

</p><p>It depends on what she does when she decides when she gets home, away from her husband. I mean I feel like this whole situation you could flip on and find on your television any channel between 12:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [But that is distant, a distance thing kind of when you turn it on.] (ph) Well, this is just a soap opera kind of. But that isn't the way it is supposed to - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is not really the way it feels. There are a whole bunch of connotations that are wrapped up in it: being an adventurous old man, being the salesman type who sales his wares along with selling himself, just sort of things like that (ph). [0:09:42.2]

</p><p>It really makes me feel kind of devious and uncomfortable, because I go home and be with the kids. And they don't know anything different. And here is Susan, and I really don't know if she notices anything different. And it is boiling inside of me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does this feel that this has been gradually kind of developing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it this week that it is only become just a real possibility kind of thing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:25.7)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't expect it. I guess that that was what I was talking about. I wasn't very straightforward about it, which was the same girl that I was talking about before (inaudible at 0:10:37.0). And I really was attracted to her, but I didn't know how to handle it. It is gradually advanced into the fact that I've really gotten to know her. I'm really feeling warm toward her.

</p><p>And I don't know. The third alternative is to do nothing finally (ph). That would be fine. I'd like to get rid of some the turmoil, though, and end the conflict eventually. I mean I'm comfortable thinking about whether I should talk to you about it. It certainly is not very comfortable if I can't even talk about it to anyone. It is something I really felt like I needed to talk about. And I'm glad I know though what to do. [0:11:47.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that is a part of you at this point.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is following you around all the time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess the main feeling I keep hearing is, "Well, I feel so stuck. I feel like there is no way to turn and nothing to do. It feels impossible."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. What do you do? It'd be very nice if I could be comfortable in both relationships, and I don't really feel very comfortable in those relationships. I feel like sometimes if I understood why. And I feel like that maybe there is something deep in my psyche, if this is just a way of my vindicating myself as a man or something of that nature.

</p><p>That makes me feel just really gross. I mean that can really turn me off, because I don't like the idea of using people. But I just don't know what to do. I don't know. What do I do? What do I do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is not that somebody could say, "Well, do this. Don't do that."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And, "This is the best thing."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't even know that it necessitates any answer, except to say that - if it doesn't necessitate any action, then I've got to feel better about it. I've got to feel like, "Well, this is all right." [0:13:56.0]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [It could put it in context]. (ph) in the position of saying, "Well, what is going to happen?" and "What kind of conflict"? You'll then know which way to go, and if there is just a (inaudible at 0:14:14.1), or if there is something else that I could do. So there is also like, "How do we know how I feel for sure"?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Like I said, it has never been a real, real solid issue with me. So I've really never tried to [get at] (ph) people before. And I think I've [got to trust it] (ph) this way, so that it was relatively easy to just to cut the other situation off. And this frightens me from a long-term point of view, because I don't want to have to stop knowing and planning involved with women.

</p><p>And I feel myself pulling back to that point, where you're very superficial and a whole lot chauvinistic. It is all a defense for my - this stays something at home. And it seems to me that when I did that on the outside, I was equally chauvinistic at home. There was no way I could turn it on and off like a faucet. 

</p><p>And really that had an effect; just trying to coop myself up had a real, real big effect at home. It made things very unsatisfactory. And conversely, it is very difficult for me to work in this kind of situation.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because if I'm open then I'm open to everybody, and then I'd be open to love.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if I have feelings - 

</p><p>PATIENT: And the you have feelings for them, right. It is not an easy (inaudible at 0:16:08.8) wish to have actions.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that is sort of what the heavy part of it is right now? Now, this has reached the stage where it is - there is a real wish to act, to be with her somewhat. If only I had more time [and had a deeper affection for her] (ph). [0:16:33.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: You're right. You're right. And I know just as well as I'm sitting here that first of all, that would be hard to do; because we've gotten into a pattern that I used to spend a lot of time at home, a lot of time with the children, a lot of time with Susan. It would have to come from somewhere, either that or it would have to come from my work; which I tend to chop away at pretty easily as it is.

</p><p>It could be very nice by never working at all - so not really. But it has to come from somewhere. I mean I really don't know. It'd be very nice if the other woman was the devious type, if she was, "If you love me," sort of thing, "then you're going to spend time with me. So how about tomorrow night? Spend time with me," you know. That would really be uncomfortable.

</p><p>But she is not that way. She makes really no sort of demands for my time. And intellectually, I know I don't want to start all over. Intellectually, I know that if I start all over, that relationship would be fraught with just as many problems as the one I have with Susan, plus an added one. And that is the way the way the relationship all sort of came about. [0:18:23.2]

</p><p>It would be very difficult for me to say, see my children on the weekends. That would just tear me apart, I know. Equally hard would be the idea of having to meet in the back alley, the back road, and this sort of thing. That would be very hard to do, too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of pretending it doesn't exist when it does?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I'm just kind of at a loss as to which way to go. So what do I do? I don't know which way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess that is one thing I hear that I wonder about. You mentioned (inaudible at 0:19:27.5) earlier. There is also the middle ground of not doing anything, which is hard. But it is the kind of thing where, "Well, which way do I go"? And then, "Well, do I want to go either way"?

</p><p>PATIENT: Do I have to?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do I have to go either way? Is there a middle of not doing anything? It is kind of finding where you are. If I give any advice, I give people that advice. Move to the middle until you know where you are.

</p><p>PATIENT: When do you know where you are? I mean, I thought yesterday afternoon I knew really pretty much where was. I really wanted to be with her. And I think if I allowed myself 10, 15 more minutes; I'd probably have been buying an airplane ticket. (inaudible) I don't want to do that. [0:20:23.1]

</p><p>I mean, all my life, I've always come home to Susan.  [And I got home to her. We created a lot of finality.] (ph) The one thing I know is that - I think I know - is that we could almost pick up from maybe anything. There is a point I think that would be very difficult to pick up from, impossible almost.

</p><p>And that might be that point. So I really have nothing else to add on that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is kind of, "I don't want to go to the point where I destroy a relationship." I mean you don't want destroy it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really don't. It all drives home yesterday. Susan's parents are here. And that is an added bit of strain, because something about her parents - which is not intentionally. They've been married for I think it is 35 years, something like that; and that kind of reeks of the stability factor. She is their little girl, so we should equally be able to maybe get up to 35 years.

</p><p>And she met me at the door, and we had a very hard night the night before. We were sleeping on the hide-a-bed downstairs in the living room. That is the first time - because we have a big king-size bed. And in a king size bed, you can sleep all night and never touch the next person. You could have practically three people on there and never touch the next person. But I did touch her, and I was very frustrated about touching her.

</p><p>When I came home yesterday and she really felt like she wanted to talk about the lack of sex. She really felt like we had so become involved in other things that we just hadn't had that. Our relationship had been great, but it had just about devoid of sex and, therefore, hadn't been that great. So we talked about that last night. It was good. It was really good. [0:23:08.0]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You felt you got to talking about -  (crosstalk)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Of course, I had not talked to her about this. That is comfortable not to talk to her about it. I don't know that I ever will probably talk to her about it, because I don't know. I feel a little funny about that. But I could see that it would be only - there would be nothing to gain by it except that maybe it would probably be destructive.

</p><p>It would put her very much on edge that she had to perform. And actually one of the problems with our sexual relationship as it is, is this feeling of a pressure, that this is her responsibility. As a good wife, she has put out 'X' amount.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sort of feel like this would then just add to that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So in order to keep you in the marriage, she'll have to - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And that is the way sometimes it has been, especially times when she has not felt compelled to do it for other motives, for her own fulfillment. She has always felt this idea, "Well, ultimately, I don't feel like I want to be fulfilled. I have this responsibility," you see, "And if I want to keep him coming by the fireplace, then I have to do well in this responsibility." And that is a bunch of bulls**t, I think.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That is not the way you want it.

</p><p>PATIENT: No that is 100 percent not the way I want it. I've told her many times. And I know this is going to sound very crude, but this is the way I tell her. I talk to her and (inaudible at 0:25:01.7). I told her that holes were very geometric forms. They are one of three geometric forms. And that I could find many holes anywhere. That wasn't what I wanted. But still she - it is this sense of duty sort of thing. [0:25:22.9]

</p><p>And that is not the expression that I really want. And, interestingly enough, that is not the expression that I feel that I would have with this other woman, at least not now, at least that wasn't where it always was with Susan either. And it is that whole mixed-up thing. This woman is - and I know she is married, but she has no children. I don't think you can underestimate the influence that children have as far as providing certain apprehensions, anxiety.

</p><p>You can't have anxieties and say, "Okay. Well, we're going to solve it by having just a funs and games time with sex." It is not that easy to turn off the anxiety and then turn on the sex and then turns on the anxiety again. It is almost like drinking, except that with sex you don't have that long of a high feeling.

</p><p>So I think I'm (inaudible at 0:26:53.1) having a hangover in the way that I look at people who really drink to solve their problems and if they get high and forget them. They have a hangover. And they're so inundated by the hangover that that is also as effective as the high.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So they're knocked out for three days?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, in order to make them forget their problems. So we have the children, which does provide an anxiety. [We're approved for therapy] (ph), which does provide a hell of a lot of anxiety. And this other woman does have that going for her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So since something is ease there then I can see how it would be very attractive and very nice.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm just fine about this sort of thing. I really am. It is one of the first times that I've allowed myself to feel something like this. [0:28:08.5]

</p><p>And I don't really want to get (inaudible) when I go back to the very nice, very pleasant (audio gap). But having a very deep, strong line drawn. Here I go. I cannot stop, because that has a clearer goal. I'll be honest with you. That has almost got me into more trouble. (audio gap) I think I feel a certain degree of affirmation about this.

</p><p>This seems like something that is real. It feels very good. It doesn't feel quite as nasty, quite as devious, as drawing that straight line. I mean the straight line just didn't really work most of time. Sometimes, yes. But most of the time, it didn't. There would be times when I was really low, and then it didn't work at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it has all become a kind of part of you? (crosstalk)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Everywhere.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - someone you [talked around] (ph) not to get involved. So it'd pass. (inaudible at 0:29:22.6)

</p><p>PATIENT: Because Susan is just a really beautiful, open person. She is just really, tremendously honest. I wish that I could be quite as honest. I wish the things that I had to say honestly wouldn't be so destructive. But I can see that if I really sat down and talked to her about this situation that, it could really just annihilate the new kind of good feelings that we (inaudible at 0:30:04.4).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel like she really couldn't take this?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Not now, I don't think she could. I don't know if she ever could. I don't know if I could. I've often thought, "What if Susan found someone (audio gap) - working through that problem by herself but staying (audio gap)."

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - something about knowing [what she is up to that'd be very difficult.] (ph) (audio gap)

</p><p>PATIENT:  - perfect that I just couldn't deal with. And that would provide such a basis for conflict that it would probably destroy itself. I think this is why I really felt good about both of us being in therapy is because there are areas like this (audio gap). [0:31:10.7]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There is also the feeling you have to be very, very careful. (audio gap)

</p><p>PATIENT: [Is that her weakness?] (ph) I think so. And yet I also feel that (inaudible at 0:31:52.7) (audio gap)  - idea about therapy was the fact that she could go back -  (audio gap) You think that a really great relationship has to mean that you have to -  (audio gap)  - think I envision myself just about absolutely clutching -  (audio gap) In a way sometimes, I -  (audio gap)  - that is a lot of modernism kind of crap. [0:33:14.8]

</p><p>- Pettiness and game playing -  (audio gap)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there are some things that not only don't have to be told -  (audio gap)

</p><p>PATIENT: It has to be all or none. And it is so hard to take a middle road anywhere.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it is possible to be very, very close to someone, very intimate, very involved and [to think how it'd be without that person.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (audio gap)

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - (inaudible) six (ph) years. (audio gap)

</p><p>PATIENT:  - trying to do this and strangle this a long time. (audio gap)  - what would happen if I had to talk -  (audio gap) If I'm separated, am I just nothing? We always - and I felt like I -  (audio gap)  - if I could be something again. But I'd like to have that not be a -  (audio gap) the second question is, can you have a -  (audio gap) [0:36:23.3]

</p><p>Is it okay that when you're with the other person that you're feeling something for the first person? (audio gap) I'm beginning to look at -  (audio gap) I think there have been times [with the stories] (ph) when I -  (audio gap) and all of them have a very tragic ending. (audio gap)

</p><p>You can't have two masters, because you will love one and hate the other. I don't know how the rest of it goes. But that is the kind of sign (ph) that you're kind of stumbling (ph) back and that you can't love two people. And I resist that, that all the books are like [the arrangement and ladies each having this lover] (ph); any of that type have such a tragic ending.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [So the implication there exists?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: One has to go, or something has to give.

</p><p>PATIENT: Something has to give. And then the implied here is always that there is going to be a tragedy. So that in effect, you're better off to stick with one relationship and put blinders on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then you won't have to experience tragedy?

</p><p>PATIENT: Then you won't have to experience the tragedy. See that is the other part of that kind of path that is that I've got to cope with what comes after telling. I feel like I have pick up the pieces somehow. I just think that it is a real problem. I realize that. It is interesting, because I look at this relationship. And it is very good. [0:39:12.0]

</p><p>I feel very comfortable about it. But I also feel like there is less than one half of one half of one percent of a chance that you and I would end up in bed together. And I know that sounds funny, but that is what I'm - it is funny from that point of view. And I really feel something for you, but it just is not in that vein.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that feels all right and it feels safe me sometimes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now, why can't I do that with other women? Why can't other women be my therapist and react the way you react? We can have a good relationship, but just exclude the other part. I don't know. Do these things hurt you when I bring it down to you and I level?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. No, that makes sense.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see, this is the - I really felt very comfortable when you were saying [about that] (ph) (inaudible at 0:40:23.6). And I really wish sometimes that I could have this relationship with others.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it is pretty much that somehow the possibility in effect is in there and feels (inaudible at 0:40:44.6). But I have a feeling that I'm going to have to ask about that or the likelihood (inaudible) makes it more pressing.

</p><p>PATIENT: And the other question is why and how has not the feeling of sex entered into this relationship?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why (inaudible at 0:41:14.8) that person?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Is it because this is more of a business-like relationship, that this has its limitations implied?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, where other relationships don't. And if that is so, that is not fair. It doesn't count. It doesn't count for reality. It counts very much otherwise, but it - what if you and I started seeing each other once a week? We're working side-by-side, you see, and I was more to you than I am, [because I appreciate that. And I feel very little of where you're at] (ph) (inaudible) [0:42:12.5]

</p><p>What would happen then? Because I realize that you do get tired. I realize that you do have your problems. I realize that you do have sexual urges. But I've never known any of them, any of it really.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you feel that if I got to know those then I feel (inaudible at 0:42:41.3)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then ultimately, I come back to the same question of, "Is there something really basically wrong with having those feelings? Are those feelings something that my environment or I have created in me? Are those something that are feelings that I have that are instilled"? And guess this is where I am.

</p><p>It'd be nice if I was selling encyclopedias, but I am a biologist by nature. And I work with animals and animals' kind of whole culture of breeding. Funny as it may seem, watching the animals, one gets the impression at least that there is an urge, that there is a sexual urge. And this implies that - because we have not told the animals by some means of our communication that they're supposed to have sexual urges, that there is a biological principle.

</p><p>And, of course, there is a biological principle. But that is the oldest line in the world. "Hey, baby. I'm a biologist. I know we have these sexual," you know, "blah"! 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: but again, I sort of have a feeling that you're saying, "Okay. Either somehow I've got to say, 'Well, okay, it is an urge. And I've got it. And I've got to act on It.' or I have to say, 'it is something I shouldn't have. It is bad. I've got to turn it off.' And if I could convince myself it wasn't even an urge that would work even better."

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. [0:44:58.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it is like saying, "I have it, and I have to act on it, or I can't have it at all." Like, you can't say, "Okay. I do have an urge. And I feel it very strongly. And it often occurs when I'm in an intimate relationship. Maybe [I start feeling warm towards her or something. But they like me back.] (ph) Then I have to say, 'That is bad,' and turn it off. I have to do something and get out of there."

</p><p>PATIENT: Or I get into a mess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it isn't possible to feel very strongly and, "This is something I'd really like to act on, but I don't have to turn it off in order to not act on it." (inaudible at 0:45:46.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: I never really have been able to pull that off (inaudible). I'd like to try that, but I never have quite been able to pull that off. Not everybody is as neat as you are, Ana. 

</p><p>About three months ago - the way I express it, I know you just must think I'm some sort of a rogue. But just one afternoon I really was really being pushed from all sides. And a young girl who that I have known for quite a while - we were sitting around and talking. And I said, "You really have turned me on sexually," and that is all I needed to say. (inaudible at 0:47:01.7)

</p><p>I was scared to death. She scared the hell out of me. And she didn't come back for a month and a half. And that was all the action that I needed. Maybe that is too much action. Maybe even that is, [to talk is] (ph) an action, being able to verbalize. I scared the s**t out of this girl.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What about for you? Was that little bit enough?

</p><p>PATIENT: It was enough.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That somehow then the feeling was expressed?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The thing that happened with this girl was the fact that I told her how I felt, and by then, she was feeling the same way. That is very hard to handle.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is much easier when you run away.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is much easier when you run away, because I feel better. And I can handle the running away. I can come back and be a nice, clean cut, straight arrow. But you see just having these feelings and trying to work them through has made me feel very much like a rogue, somebody that is not very nice, somebody that is just after it all the time. [0:48:42.0]

</p><p>And I don't like that [very much.] (ph) And I don't think that feeling is real. But, once again by comparison, what makes me different from the guy that is equally having problems but may not be trying to articulate his problems and will go to bed with anything he can get. (inaudible at 0:49:03.2) And it is important that I be different in my own mind.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that is not the way you want to solve it.

</p><p>PATIENT: That is not the way I want to solve it. I mean I want to be cognizant of what I do. I want to understand why. And I want to be able to have these feelings and to be able to work them through. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You're frightened of a] (ph) real example of a real - "I have both sexual feelings and (inaudible at 0:49:51.2)."

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And I think the thing that disturbs me most is the fact that if this had been the first experience like this, it'd be one thing. But I've had these feelings with other women. And I once again begin to get this terrible sense of infidelity and mental illness and, "Well, golly, you're really a sick person. You're really hung up. If you weren't so highly structured and in control, you'd be probably be called a pervert."

</p><p>And all these diagnoses or feelings really scare me, because I don't like the idea of being a pervert. And I don't like to consider myself as that. I mean I guess I rationalize it very quickly. You see how quickly I'm rushing in with my rationale by saying, "Well, the difference between me and a pervert is the fact that I at least am cognizant of the problem, where a pervert often is not."

</p><p>I don't know how much of that is rationale and how much of it is not. I don't really know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:51:15.6) become part of it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Damn right it does. (inaudible) try and fill in the holes. It goes through a lot of conflict.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because I guess I was (inaudible) feeling right here and now - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I want so badly for somebody to say, "What you're feeling is normal. I've felt the same way. But it is better to love than to shut yourself off." I want somebody to say, "You're not a pervert. You're a warm, sensitive person," from (ph) somebody who really knows. [0:52:05.2]

</p><p>Being warm and sensitive doesn't always mean tragedy. [I think that the response is isn't.] (ph) Then I guess I really want, I really need, (inaudible) No, but you know what I mean. That is the thing that I really need to not - I really need to feel within myself that these are okay and that these are feelings that other people have had. And it is part of living. It is part of being in life.

</p><p>It is the way not to be cooped up in [some little safe harbor] (ph) or something like that, where you've so cancelled yourself off, [like living cancelled, a key in a chest,] (ph) that you are completely impregnable.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right, [because it stays locked.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I just believe from some minor experience that for me to capsule (ph) myself is just deadly. I mean because I really feel like I can. I have the power to capsule (ph) myself, and it works about 90 percent of the time. The other time, I'm (inaudible at 0:53:37.0). I'm in bad shape.

</p><p>When the walls come down, there is nothing. There is no - nothing there. There are no defenses. And they're not used to taking any of the insults. They're not used to taking any of the hard times. And they just go berserk.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:53:59.7)

</p><p>PATIENT: This is what I see happened to my father is that he built up all these devices, defenses. And it isolated him. And it worked for him about 90 percent of the time. Then they stopped working the other 10 percent of the time. And he just went nowhere. He was an alcoholic. He had sexual endeavors.

</p><p>You see, a lot of it goes back to this, this business of the dining room table the morning after. Did I ever tell you about what happened? I remember probably the biggest thing was my mother had very small breasts, and she lost one. She finally lost both of them, because she had carcinoma of the breast. [0:55:00.4]

</p><p>And I was a sophomore or junior in high school, and she had her first operation when I was a sophomore in high school I believe. So I was dating this girl who had really, for a girl sixteen years old, had really big breasts. And she was very, very free with them. She liked to be caressed and all that sort of thing.

</p><p>And as any adolescent, when you're trying to find out where you really are, you go through a lot of things. And I can remember my father sitting at the breakfast table the morning after each one of those dates wanting to know all the gory details. Did I get my hand down her brassiere? How far did I go? God, it made that whole situation so distorted.

</p><p>And I mean, since then, I've seen a lot of women's breasts. I've done a lot of autopsies, where of course you do remove the breasts. And I realized that removing a breast is like removing a pancreas, intellectually you see.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you still have that reaction?

</p><p>PATIENT: But I still have that reaction of, "Well, can I get into them"? "Can I get down in those areas"? But when I really needed somebody to hear those problems about, "Dad, I really feel like I want to do that, but then I feel very guilty when I do," then I needed somebody to say, "Well, son, I think one of the big problems is that we've all put too much emphasis on the breast."

</p><p>As you can well understand from nature and kind of brassieres to the not wearing brassieres to the whole gamut that there has been such an emphasis placed on the breast. I mean really the breast is no more a less a projection of what it is. And then this kind of eating and talk - that would have been so good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: To get as an adolescent. Instead of that, I get this, "Well, did you get it"?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [He had kind of a] (ph) added interest?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You were feeling] (ph) that there is something wrong this person (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Then there has to be something wrong with person (ph). The relationship I had with my mother was strange - really, really strange. I mean she knew my father was drinking about anything he could. [0:58:01.3]

</p><p>And somehow, she was almost too physical in certain ways. She was very screwed up during the period when I needed somebody. She was also very screwed up. She had lost one breast. She was on male hormones. The whole thing really was a bad situation. She just got mortified at these breakfast table conversations.

</p><p>It is funny, because he never did that with my older brother. My older brother always wanted one girl. I never wanted one girl. He was very proud of that, that I'd have three dates in a single night sort of thing. I must be just really wiping the board clean. And there were just a lot of tremendous experiences like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So there was a lot (inaudible at 0:59:04.9) "I've learned and overcome"?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. There is a tremendous background for it. I know when I came back from Savannah, Georgia - I went to the St. Patrick's Day parade one year - and I had ridden the train all that long. And I got down and it was about 10:00 in the morning. I went into the bathroom and urinated. And I passed out urinating.

</p><p>Well, obviously, I went the doctor. And my father knew I had syphilis or gonorrhea one. He thought it was syphilis, because that is all he knew. I mean he had no idea of the whole [symptoms-wide] (ph) thing. And the doctor believed him. He thought it was syphilis, too.

</p><p>So he popped me with penicillin, and I had this beautiful glowing reaction to the penicillin. But that wasn't the important thing. The important thing was I had neither syphilis nor gonorrhea. If anybody had ever listened to me, they would have known that I had not had any sexual contact. As a matter of fact, I had never had any sexual contact, actually, until I was married.

</p><p>If anybody had ever listened to the me or heard that I hadn't had no sexual, probably they would have heard that I had ridden a train all night and I had been instilled ever since I had been toilet trained not to - to go to the bathroom before I left home. And therefore, I only went when I was at home. And my bladder was about three times its size, and I had a cystopic (sp?) they were trying treat with penicillin. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But now (inaudible at 1:00:45.1)

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm so nervous right now that I'm just shaking (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That is the whole (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I really get this kind of shaky feeling. It is a trembling. And when I was back at college, I'd be very lonely. And I'd get in the car, and I'd ride up and down the sleazy sides of town, which was where all the girls who wanted to be picked up walked up and down the street. [1:01:22.4]

</p><p>I could just see be trembling. [It is a kind of a rigor] (ph), but it is truly a trembling. And bringing back all those things starts me trembling again, and here I am 26 years old trembling at the things that went on. And I can see all these things intellectually. But once you get at the gut level, it is just - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:01:43.5)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It still makes me tremble. It sometimes makes me tremble when I think of what I might do. I might be able to have it so much better than I ever thought I would have. I've always kind of a pessimistic outlook about the fact that God or faith or something could easily come and cold cock me just when things were going well.

</p><p>I've always felt like I'm going to loose one of my children just to be punished, me especially. It will eventually come out that I was being punished for having these feelings about sex.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a real load [to bear] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: It sounds like a terrible load (inaudible at 1:02:32.8). I guess I can't thank you enough for listening. I don't know how comfortable it has been for you. Right now, I don't need to know how comfortable it has been. It has just nice to be able to say all these things.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And kind of put it out there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because there is a long history behind it and a lot of prior (ph) thoughts. I don't think we'll deal with it, (inaudible at 1:03:10.9). Okay. I don't think we're through with it either. And if it is all right with you, we'll keep trudging through this. [1:03:23.8]

</p><p>This is why I need therapy. It has very little to do with death, and very little to do with teaching, and very little to do with anything. But this is why I need therapy, [the business of love.] (ph) (inaudible at 1:03:34.3)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It has a lot to do with fear and family. (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: And I feel myself trembling all over. I haven't trembled in a long time. I remember reading in Black Rage, and he is in prison. Who wrote that? Eldridge Cleaver or (inaudible at 1:04:02.0), whoever wrote that? Black Rage?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, Grier or somebody?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But maybe this was the Eldridge Cleaver book. Well, anyway, he was in prison. It was the Eldridge Cleaver book. He was in prison, and he was sitting at the table. And the old man was telling about black people [on the right] (ph), that all of a sudden black people would cry and maybe his eyes would water. And he wouldn't cry.

</p><p>But they needed to cry when they were little, but they never got a chance to cry when they were little. And I think that is how I tremble. It is something that - sometimes a feeling that I anticipate. Like, I was talking to a student three weeks ago. And I was really talking very easily to her. And there were none of these feelings that I expect that I - it wasn't hard. (inaudible at 1:04:57.2)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Unlike related to deep feeling.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Thank you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Happy Easter.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. You, too.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'll see you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'll see you.

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is interview number 4, client number 0518-014. January 15th, 1970.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that all my tape? Or is it for different clients?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's all your tape.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a lot - an inch and a half!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm 20 today - yesterday actually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's right. I'm 30 today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh Amy! And you're all dressed in white!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it a virginal rebirth?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not it isn't - it's a slightly tarnished white you see! Your birthday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Birthdays are really heavy - how was yours?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eh, yeah. I haven't had a heavy birthday for a few years but this one was a little heavy. Yours was too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess because you expect it to be this special day. I don't know, I guess because I wanted to be like a queen and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And nobody was paying attention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not true - people were real nice. I guess it felt like all of a sudden it should be a new year. Also because it was the beginning of the year and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a sort of rebirth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I was in the middle of the same shit that I was in before. And I was like, "Why don't I wipe the slate clean as it's the new year?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Start fresh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, it was a drag. I mean, I wanted to be (inaudible 2:00)...it was people that...my friends and I was at my parent's house. I don't know. Friends of mine took me out to dinner the night before. It was kind of like, "What am I doing? I'm 20 and I'm living at home."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't seem right. Except for I got my parents stoned! (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must have been sort of nice!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I didn't enjoy my mother - she just gets really loose. Did (inaudible 2:41) leave?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, he left this morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think he left better than he came?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fantastic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 2:49) better. Last week, (inaudible 2:53) lots of people can't go back. It seems. That's also another reason why I'm scared to be in this place. I'm thinking of living in Crystal Springs. I don't have a place to live and I'm not really into school. And I'm having so much trouble with my friends at school, so leaving is probably the best thing I can do. 0:03:17.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really scared to leave this - I don't think I would come back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why could you not come back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess, like, I would come to the C-shop and there will be these people and it will be an event of somebody's (inaudible 3:45). Somehow I will leave and I won't be part of the DC world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you will never be able to get back - you'll have to come back and start all over in some sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I couldn't even do that but I'd be a (inaudible 4:00) to it on the interval (inaudible 4:01). But anyway, what's been hitting me a lot is this incredible sense of unreality about everything I am doing right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. It's all about being spaced out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and also when I'm not spaced - when I'm not feeling that particular thing that I am a little bit spaced out - sometimes I...like, here I am, it's the second week and I haven't been looking for a place to live. I haven't had a place to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not with my friends: I come home every night and I make dinner with my parents and we all sit around. They are all, like, really fine people but it's not part of my college universe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like this...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was taking one course. What were going to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like this sort of hiatus in your life where there is this blank space and everything ground down to almost zero.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're almost in between something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other thing is I don't know what I am coming from or even what I am going to. I know it is some sort of transition or something that's going on but I fell like...Since I left the dormitory in my first year, and after that year, I have never lived in any place for more than two months, three months - or a quarter. And I went to California and I moved around at least every three months and then I came back here in the winter time - last winter. I lived some time for the past month and back to my parents place - I lived there for a month. And then during the summer - I don't mean a month; I mean three months - and in the summer I moved to Washington again and this fall I moved back here into that apartment and here, the next quarter, I'm somewhere else. It just seems like everything has been transitional for two years. 0:06:08.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's all flawing and there isn't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not exactly like its all flawing: there is a chunk and a little space of chunk; and a change and a chunk; and a change. But it is not anything that's like...I would almost like to settle some place for a while but there doesn't seem to be a place to settle. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about that: there isn't any place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I guess I really want to find a place. A friend of mine, Ryan, was kind of nice. Two friends of mine came in from...two of my freshman friends. A lot of my friends are boys - they always have been. Before this year when I made gross - I mean when I got really involved with (inaudible 7:10). The first year a lot of my friends were boys. And Ryan came back and (inaudible 7:18) came back and they both came back - that was really nice. Ryan came the day before...he didn't know why. He was in Manchester and he went to the airport and he had no idea where he was flying. All of a sudden he found his way coming back to DC. He didn't know why and he showed up the night before my birthday. He said, "I just felt like I had to come." I said, "Ryan, it is my birthday tomorrow." And he flashed, "Oh, that's what it is - that's what it is." So that was really nice. And (inaudible 7:41) came in from Newark. And it was nice to see (inaudible 7:48). I'm only taking one class and working - that's something new too. I've never done that. That part feels really good though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be working.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. at least I know it is 10 hours a week I am not wasting. It's really to strange to see where the people have gone since the first year, and wondering where I've gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being imploding or not quite sure...it doesn't add up to anything you ever...you don't have roots.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it has something to do with searching for something that you haven't found. You don't know where to find it. Did Jamie tell you anything about me? He wouldn't tell me anything about you!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He said he'd talked to you and (inaudible 9:20) and stuff. Does that sound evasive? Actually I was evading...it felt funny to hear about you from Jamie but he said something about you being into women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I scared him because I guess I was real open with him about relationships I had with the women that I loved. We've all be talking or kind of avoiding about talking - kind of suggesting being able to be with each other because we all love each other and even if any of us is involved with a boy they're not as close as they are when one of us (inaudible 10:24). I guess it is because for a really long time, I haven't been with any one guy. I have been celibate because I was doing a lot of sleeping around at one point and it wasn't good. It didn't feel good and it didn't...Not so much then, it was much more in retrospect. It never felt...it was always, like, there was always this nice person that I liked and, you know, why not sleep with him. That's what the situation was but then in the mornings it would always be that I didn't want to wake up in the bed that I was in. I would have this lousy feeling in my body and lousy taste in my mouth. I would want to do things like read before I saw him, and really bad trips (inaudible 11:05) person. I felt like I was exploiting people too; I was exploiting men. So when I started realizing that I wasn't getting something that I wanted and being able to give how I wanted to give it, it didn't seem right to be doing that. So I've been, you know, kind of principled in being celibate. And meanwhile, Kathy and Harper weren't really close to me. Kathy just has this boyfriend in Bangor; as a matter of fact he still lives with Jamie- it's a small world! He used to go to school here. And she's close to him but she's, like, much closer about (inaudible 11:57) seeing me. And I've been feeling really good without being with anybody. I'd like to be able to prove to myself that I could be alone and not need a man to give me reassurance or something. I don't know. And I guess we've all been wondering why it is that we can't sleep with each other. We can be really close - I've felt completely comfortable touching them and being with them. It's not this conflicting thing - I don't feel conflicted about it because it is not an incredible push but that might be because I am not letting it be. 0:12:55.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's definitely a confusing thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're all in it together. We all feel like we are struggling with this thing and it makes us closer. It's not like anybody wants it more than somebody else. It's just like this thing that many people evolve to. I haven't told anybody about it. We have kind of talked about it but we've also not talked about it. We just know that we are all thinking about it. I haven't told anybody and I told Jamie and I think I freaked him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like maybe it has nothing to do with him being a man. He heard this woman being more interested in being with women, instead of being with men and he felt out of it or excluded or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it disturb you that it freaked him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not that much. Let me see - did it? I don't really know why I told him. I mean, it's not (inaudible 14:20) because it's not a problem. It is just like, perhaps, but it is not that important. I mean, it won't make me feel any farther from them. Like we failed in evolving or that we are cheating each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a pressure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not a pressure. It's just a possibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Slightly confusing and possibilities. 0:14:50.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the thing is I feel really healthy about it. I don't feel like...I don't see it as replacing them. I just feel like feeling out what I have with them already. And also, it is like...the relationship I have with them is really, like, Kathy and Haley live together with a bunch of other people and they have been really close since first year. They are a year younger. Actually, they are not a year younger but they are a grade less and they are the same age. They've know each other longer and they like each other as close as friends. There's been no jealousy at all between...I'm much closer to Kathy than I am to Haley, not really because I like her more but because I spend more time with her because I really dig Haley too. But there's just been no jealousy between us on being close to each other and spending time, which is different than, you know, I was pretty covetous of Sienna and I would be jealous if she was close to somebody else. And I guess I was like, much strongly sexually identifying with her too. I felt like I looked like her and acted like her and I really kind of emulated her. I just thought that she was incredibly beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She was the most beautiful woman that I knew. And that was a little bit more f***** up. She spent a month with me in the summer time - I told you about that, this summer. And we just spent all our time together and that was pretty wonderful. But it also feels strange because there are a bunch of guys who really like me and they are a couple - two boys - one boy in Glenwood - a Kyle in Madison - and a Kyle here. They both would like to be with me and I find myself totally evading them, just really not wanting to deal with a masculine relationship - and that a little bit freaks me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm using my involvement with women - not just sexually but also emotionally - to avoid dealing with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. What's freaky though about avoiding dealing with men?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a good question. What do you think? I don't know. For a long time I didn't want to be with any guy - I just knew that I didn't want it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I, like, went to the movies with somebody and came home and they were like having tea and they start (inaudible 18:01) to like me, whatever it is, my body would just feel numb, you know. 0:18:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess some of it because I haven't...I really know I want to be in love with somebody and I don't want to just sleep with people. Somehow it is like if they want to sleep with me too soon or too quickly, I then can't love them or something. Also, it is that old masculine trip of, you know, remember that trip that men used to always lay women...they always slept with ...you never sleep with the good girl, you just sleep with the bad girls. It's kind of like, I'd sleep with somebody and I would lose a little bit of respect for him. It's very strange. I guess because I thought I was really good at deceiving people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha, and you'd fool them into thinking...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, I would be sleeping with somebody and be really tender with them and you make love to them and I wouldn't feel mentally the love that I was showing physically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really felt like, there was just this incredible...sometimes my head would be miles away. This person would be gazing in my eyes and telling me that he really loved me and I just wouldn't be there at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't even see how they would enjoy it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would too. I mean, in some way I would physically get off and enjoy it physically, but somehow there was this incredible split between when I had those and the morning - my body would catch up to my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then all of me would feel icky and ugly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just want to get away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right - right. I had this incredible thing of taking showers!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just thinking you'd go home and take a bath.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's it exactly. I had to go home and take a shower. I had to take a shower and wash and wash and wash and scrub myself - that's what it was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. 0:20:26.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was hoping to find that cleanliness that I couldn't have. And then this really funny thing - I just realized this - and I broke...and I've been celibate for almost, well, almost a year - no, not that long. I don't know, not really, because I saw Jake in the spring time, but for a long time - longer than I'd ever. Because I was, like, single pretty much. I went and visited a friend of mine on a commune - this guy Luke that I really love; I'm really friends with - he's got a whole circle of people that I met my first year while (inaudible 21:30) for each other. I went to visit him and I met some guy on the commune who is living in Washington and I just found out that the boy I...I guess the real reason I haven't slept with any men is because I'm still in love with Jake - this guy that is getting married. I went a couple of months ago - at the beginning of the quarter - the fall quarter. No, it was even before - it was before that. Was it in the summer time? No, I guess it was the beginning of fall and I went to visit and that's when I found out that Jake was getting married and I left Harold where he was and went to visit Mia who was, I don't know, about 20 miles away, and I knew I didn't love this guy and I slept with him - just some guy in the commune. A lot of it was there was just a lot of pressure in the commune to sleep with somebody. I didn't want to have to deal with sleeping with Abbie because we were kind of...he was in love with me my first year. I was really close to him but I didn't want to sleep with him. I didn't want to f*** up being friends with him. I slept with this guy and I ended up getting crabs which I never had before and really did this incredible trip in my head. I didn't realize until a month and a half later. I had this itch there but I just couldn't what it could be from. It freaked me out totally. It just felt, like, so dirty. I just felt like this rotten log that these things were growing out of. It was like, I knew I shouldn't do that and I had to pay...it was so obviously bad that I had to get crabs. I had horrible beasts in the most intimate part of me. It was just really a trip.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's disgusting...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also, it freaked me that I had it for so long and not known it. It was almost like I wasn't dealing with that part of me. I also didn't remember sleeping with him. I kind of convinced myself I couldn't have slept with him because I didn't want to have broken this vow on myself. So I kind of just put it out of my mind because I felt that I hadn't slept with him in some way. I guess my head had never slept with him. 0:24:07.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's disturbing to you because it's like this, sort of, cutting something off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's upsetting for lots of reasons - that being one of them. It's like I am deceiving myself that well - forgetting what I actually did. Some of it is that I did break my vow and I knew that I shouldn't have. When am I going to stop hurting myself that way. I eat too much and I'm fatter than I want to be but I always know that - I always know. I'm fine the way it is now but I don't ever stop eating. There are just little subtle ways that I am better than myself. I really thought I was starting to be good to myself - trying to clear up my sexual conflict. Have you ever read tarot at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the card for Capricorn - do you know that one? It's the devil. (Inaudible 25:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that was a trip!</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the card is on...it's the same card as the lover's card which is a really beautiful card. Well, I will tell you about the devil's head: it's this horrible throned creature who is hairy and dark and has fire in its eye and looks grotesque and sexual...It looks really disgusting: it's like throned. And below him are these two naked people who have fire curling up around them and snakes and serpents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they are chained together. There is a chain around her neck and a chain around his neck and they are holding hands. It is like they are chained to their sexuality. The thing is the chain isn't tight around their neck - you can see that they could take it off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, in the picture it's not like tight around, it's just lying around them together. They could just throw it off and it could be the lover's card, which is the same card but a really happy, blissful place and two beautiful people and green plants. That's really how I felt about myself - that I was being that Capricorn card.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was being, like...because I really like touching people; I really feel like...I come from a kissy, touchy family. Everybody always kisses everybody else and I feel really sensual in that way, somehow I've gotten it really mixed up with sexual so I ended up having to seek a loving person who wanted to (inaudible 26:53)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got caught in the mire of it or something. What was happening to you right there? 0:27:11.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was happening to you right there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was glad that I was telling you but I was a little bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of embarrassed was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What kind of embarrassed?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just all of a sudden I pulled back. Thank you! Do you think my shoelaces are coming undone? It's also like I haven't talked about it. I don't talk to people about this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I talk to Kathy. Most days I've just been writing it. And I'm glad I'm telling you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think I understand that. It feels good in a sense: it feels good that you are glad that you are telling me but it's also (inaudible 29:07)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think you understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, for just a really long time, I was feeling I really didn't want to be with anybody and I felt really good about it. And then recently, I have just been really dying to...it's almost physical. It doesn't feel the same thing as (inaudible 29:41) because it has too much to do with how I feel - it has too much to do with my head. I really want to be really intimate with somebody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. 0:30:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I am kind of glad that I am doing that because I was pretty scared of myself when I wasn't willing to be with a guy. I always have friends that are guys and I always have them and I feel really comfortable kissing and hugging women, walking with them and holding hands but if it ever got the slightest bit heavy - which it wouldn't with my friends - but if I met somebody new or something, Like this guy Caleb, my whole being would just turn off literally. And now I'm a little bit scared because now I want to be with somebody and I'm afraid that I am still turning off or something. I mean, I am glad that I am feeling that I want to be with somebody - a little bit - but it is also sad in a way because I am looking for something that I don't have. I don't want to be doing that either and I guess that's when the thing with women gets more of a question. I don't really know if it is that contingent on a man or not - I think it has. Mostly just to do with how we feel about each other. It's not the kind of thing you end up talking to many people about because nobody is really concerned if they really understand at all. It's not the kind of thing one tells one's mother!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah! </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it is so funny because I haven't told you about Maya yet. She is, in a funny way, the person who is most related to me. I guess I'm hesitant about telling you about her because I guess, to her, it is the most immediate and most important....because we are more like lovers than men. Even (inaudible 33:12) 0:33:13.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes it more serious and more hard to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's also all so beautiful. I mean we really loved each other for about six or seven weeks and lived together and went through incredible changes with each other and held onto each other all the way through. With Kathy and Haley, how I got to was kind of women's liberation things and with Maya it has nothing to do with...I can't use any outside thing about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not ideology, it's you - or you and Maya.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it's me and Maya and I guess also Maya really loves me like nobody ever has. She just really loves me. She is just also one of the most beautiful women alive! I'd really like to show you: she made me a birthday present. She made me just this most beautiful present. I thought about bringing it - it's really fragile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did she make you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She made...it was a box and there is this scroll inside the box, like a poem. I'll bring it in and show you. A poem about who I was to her. And for each thing that she said, there was a thing in the box, just really delicately wrapped, with all these beautiful things. There was this incredible stone; something about infinite (inaudible 35:32) of the circular stone - this white (inaudible 35:34) stone. And secretive (inaudible 35:38) I think very delicate; it was like an incredible fish - a fish spine with these beautiful...I can't tell you about it because they are all these weird little things, like old pieces of wood you can just see the lines; all these bits of (inaudible 35:57) just like all these different parts of her that I (inaudible 35:59). It's just a really beautiful gift - it's just so much like Maya. 0:36:03.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you talk about her - like you say delicacy, fineness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This thing happens that's happened only a couple of times in my life to me - with only two people it's happened. It's happened with Jake and it's happened with Maya. And with Jake it was one time we were walking around Haight Ashbury and we were buying fish for dinner. We had gotten (inaudible 37:07) and we went to (inaudible 37:09) to buy rock fish. He is really an incredible cook; he can make all sorts of marvelous things. And we were just going shopping and walking around Haight Ashbury and he was holding my hand and he just looked at me and I looked at him and we just both burst into tears. It was just incredibly beautiful - neither of us could say anything. He doesn't cry - he just doesn't cry. And it happened with Jill the other night. Wendy and Lissie took me out to (inaudible 37:46) for dinner - it was the day before my birthday - and we had a great big meal. Then Wendy and I were going to go to the movies to see the Marx Brothers film, (inaudible 38:00) Wendy made me a cake and on my way I really wanted to see Jill so I have a car - my mam's car - and I picked up Jill and the three of us went to the movies and then I came back and had cake with (inaudible 38:19). then Jill and I left and just rode in the car to her house and just sat outside. We only talked for maybe 15 minutes but we can soar some talks. You know, soar. We talked until we couldn't talk anymore. We started talking about...she is living with some guy now and I was talking about how she is with him, some of which frightens me and some of which makes me really happy. And I was just telling her all the various ways I felt. Then, after a while, I just had to stop and we both just had to sit there and the whole car just got incredibly full. Neither of us could do anything but cry and then we just held each other and she kissed me goodbye. That's when she stayed up all night and made me the gift. I came last night for dinner. We went (inaudible 39:30) parents. Her parents are (inaudible 39:32). I had a flash of wondering and she would too. She said something and she doesn't normally say anything. She had a flash while she was leaving - while she was leaving me - to go upstairs to be with this man, instead of staying with me. We could both stay up but it could go no further. (Inaudible 40:17) because we are closer to each other than she's ever been to a man - except maybe for her father! We won't go into that. I don't expect it so it doesn't hurt. It's something I don't really want to deal with. 0:40:37.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's definitely this thing present in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something intense and beautiful but you've got to hold it all for someone else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't feel like not physically being with women stops me from...I don't have a feeling like (inaudible 41:09) I can't be close to them unless (inaudible 41:10) because I am already just so incredibly close to her. It's also not something that I can dismiss. I mean, I do dismiss it but it keeps on recurring to me. It just feels like this incredible gift. It feels already so consummated in how long and through everything that we've loved each other but I don't feel we are really missing it that much. I just wonder why it doesn't flow that easily. 0:42:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why it doesn't flow that easily?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, why...I don't know. I just kind of wonder why we haven't slept with each other recently. It's really funny to tell you these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because they are so private and personal? Because I am a woman too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you are a woman, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's...I mean, because I am woman too...there ought to be another sentence there I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. I don't know what the sentence is but there is a sentence there somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Perhaps, I am a woman too: is it possible that you would feel that way about me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is the sentence that's missing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you surprised by any of this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, not really. Except, that I guess it's about Maya. 0:45:04.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it's Maya you've been so close to surprises me more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you don't know Maya. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maya is not (inaudible 45:36) to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She is not who she (inaudible 45:46) when I met her. I know her because the first boy that I was ever fascinated myself...in love with. On looking back, it looks like being caught up and infatuated in a freshman in high school. I was dating her. I didn't like Maya imminently. I was a little bit intimidated by her but I was real pure and she was the (inaudible 46:27) of lots of people. She was going around with strange black guys and really (inaudible 46:40). It was very different then: her parents were (inaudible 46:45). She was fighting her father and hated him. It was just like...and then Ken (inaudible 47:00) and she came to school. She came back to DC - she hadn't been in college (inaudible 47:07). And I guess I must have liked something because before she went away to Holland - which was about a year before - I had given her this picture. I think it was called the Three Percent or the Six Percent - it was just a really simple brush painting and I gave it to her. She took it with her to Holland and it was the only thing she had in her room. Her room was completely bare - she just went completely aesthetic. She has this incredible...I mean, as much of a sinner streak she has in her, she has as much as saint's streak, but it would never come out and I'd never see. She lived literally as an aesthetic in Holland at this place and slept on the floor and only ate rice for three months and that pretty much stayed with her. She's loosened up some from that but she's only eating rice and grains and vegetables. No sugar on - no anything - for a year and a half. She meditates twice a day. And it is just really into her outlook. Her looks have changed so much - everything about her has softened and become a woman. And she's much quieter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She does sound different from the way I remembered her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's so different - she's almost...she's really different. I mean, she is just incredible. She is also one of the things that gives me faith in people in this funny way because I have this thing that people didn't really change and that they could change surfacely. I guess a lot of this had to do with my dad. People would change surfacely but they didn't really, in essence, change any of that stuff - that core stuff. And I really feel about Jill as if she is somebody new and that it's incredibly real and it's incredibly who she is, but it's just incredibly different than who she was. But I can see the roots. I mean, she carries her history with her - she really does. Last night, she came over for dinner and she brought her rice with her because we were having, you know, steak and she just never eats that stuff so she brought her rice with her. She came at the last minute- I didn't know she was coming. She called up my mom and asked if she could come because we had had such a beautiful night and she wanted to be there. And after dinner, we all sat around and had dinner and I was about to open my present my parents gave me and she turned around to me and she, like, just slouched back in her seat. She is just beautiful - she is blond and looks real (inaudible 50:32). She kind of slouched back in her seat and went, "Hey Barbara babes, how are you doing?" Like that, you know! It was like out of this movie from years ago and my parents totally cracked up. And I said, "Hey Mayase." I mean, I can see that...she is still...she hasn't deserted it but it's not offensive and it's not threatening to her, but she just really isn't that anymore. 0:51:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I want you to know her - now I want you to meet her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've always liked her. She never seemed to me tough in the type of way that you described it - just very strong. And even when she was so much younger than me, she seemed very strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes she's very strong. And that's the other thing that is happening: after a long time I felt younger than she. We lived together last winter quarter and I was definitely younger. I had never worked and she has worked all the time she has lived out here. She was already a woman and I was still only just beginning, you know. And her strength almost overpowered me. She was really into meditation then and it was all this (inaudible 52:12). And now she's very easy just as though she doesn't have to prove it to anybody or force it on anyone. She was still new into it and I wasn't into that. I was always much louder and had to have friends and she always hated Melinda, even then. I was really scared that I would become her because she was so very strong and I didn't at all. I really thought her about (inaudible 52:46) but now I feel, I mean it's funny, I just realized that a couple of weeks ago she spent a lot of the Christmas with me after I came back from New York and came back from the country - it was a couple of days before school began - she just stayed at our house. And I really felt like I was as much at home and as strong as she was, and I could tell that we both knew it now. And I know that she has just always loved me more than anyone else. To her I know I have always been that. somehow I felt real deserving of it now. 0:53:47.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, with her. I guess some of that had to do with where she was being out with men, I didn't really respect it. In this funny way, I felt like I was doing something that she wasn't quite able to do, which was live without somebody. I think she knew that too. All of that was...somehow, I guess it made more of a difference to me than it did to her. I was (inaudible 55:03).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it said something reaching out to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a little bit harder to look in your eyes now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How long did you know her?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know - not too long.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 56:02)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I knew her father best.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you seen him in a long time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About six months ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? Did he come back here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She told me that...when I told her that I was coming to see you and I found out your name and I asked her if she knew you, she kind of clicked and she said that her father had been in love with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if he was in love with me - I'd rather think he had something from it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really respect her father - he is a very strange man - an incredibly strange man. 0:57:10.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I know him as well as I know about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Are we running out of time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's gone real fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it a relief to be able to leave? (Chuckles.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I asked that because there was something about the way you said it. It sounded like you were glad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just seems that (inaudible 58:18)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. To me, we clicked in. The other hours I had some...the other two or three, I guess, had some sort of sense of effort. This time I felt a little...this is all fine but...so where are we going and what is she working on? I'm not even sure if that's appropriate - just something that is going through my mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel I wasn't...like I was working on was being able to tell you things instead of working around those things.</p>

<p></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. Yeah, I understand what you mean and that makes lots of sense. I'm just embarrassed because I...I don't know...because I said, "What are we working on?" It's alright. (Chuckles.) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I see what you're saying. (Inaudible 59:56) It's okay just being able to talk. 1:00:00.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm wrong to feel impatient about that - or even slightly impatient. As long as I don't really mean it, even though I have a nervousness or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also it depends...I mean, I can see you being the listener and I'm involved with the telling, so you're ready to work on stuff whereas I am still involved in the telling. And maybe you're just getting involved in the listening too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think so. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The apartment seems a sore spot!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How does it feel (inaudible 61:26)? Is something special going to happen to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I guess something nice is going to happen eventually I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you mean that like in (inaudible 61:43) me or do you mean like this year or do you mean today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today - today. I'm going to see about it tonight. It seems (inaudible 61:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. No. Being with somebody that you want to be with is what birthdays should be about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'd like to be treated like a queen too: I'd like to be taken out to dinner, made a big fuss over. We're going to have (Inaudible 62:18) and I am going to go to a lecture that Jamie wants to go to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you've done a lot for Jamie to be (inaudible 62:28). That would be quite a birthday. I guess that is probably also what I want - maybe next birthday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably in the afternoon - how is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I work on Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday's okay - Tuesday after 11.00. Oh, at 12.30 I am going to have racquetball. I think...no, that's not when I have archery - Monday is when I have racquetball. Yeah, Tuesday is fine after 11.30. Anytime Tuesday. 1:03:11.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about one o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know about the box downstairs? There's a box where you put these (inaudible 63:24) slips in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. (Inaudible 63:29) in the yellow paper?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday at one o'clock. How do you spell your name?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: C-I-N-D-Y I saw Maya's mother this summer too. I was out in Nevada and I visited her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 64:06)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible 64:11) for about three weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really? I'd like to do that I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like (inaudible 64:17) and all the time...it was just really fun though. </p>

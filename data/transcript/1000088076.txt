<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: 0735-103, session number 8, 1970. Client 0735-103

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible). One of these days it's going to be inevitable that it happens. I'm going to be here the wrong day, two hours over, two hours late.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Before (inaudible) you had the wrong time.

</p><p>PATIENT: I knew I might be here...so I know I was thinking about calling this morning just to make sure that (inaudible). Pretty sure it was 3:30. So, took my chances.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, I have two clients together, (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm not complaining. Just saying that one of these days I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I got here entirely at the wrong time. Let's see now, where'd we leave off last time? I think things kind of picked up the last five or ten minutes there last time. I wonder just what it was all about? We might try to pick up where we stopped there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't remember what you were doing the last time you were here.

</p><p>PATIENT: Today's (inaudible). Anyhow just the seeming depression that I had didn't last long. In fact I didn't even hardly realize that I was giving the impression that I was depressed, or whatever. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're (inaudible) depression didn't take you over.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in a sense that, yeah, it doesn't control me so much as it used to. Seemed like I'd get depressed and I couldn't seem to pull myself out of it, or maybe I didn't want to, I don't know. Nonetheless it seemed to last much longer. Now I can pass it off. In an hour's time I can forget all about what I was depressed about an hour ago. Seems to me it's an improvement. Maybe I need t buy me a tape recorder so I can just and talk to it. Now that didn't sound (inaudible), did it? Sorry about that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can (inaudible) my tape recorder.

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't mean it that way at all. Oh, shoot. [3:29] No, I mean that, like you said, talk and realize that you had things on your mind that you didn't really think much about until you start talking it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't even realize how bad things were until I started talking. I think this, is what the husband and wife relationship needs to have and it doesn't have. A session where we can sit down and tell each other complaints. What we expect of one another and (inaudible). Well, if I was listening to her complaints I wouldn't get all up under the collar about it. She...you know, if said something about me, you know, I didn't particularly like or something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean like if it was defined that your time to listen to her complaints, that that would make it a lot easier for you to listen?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd have to learn to not get so upset about some of the complaints that she might say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I guess you're saying (inaudible) some things up for the two here.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think somewhat that's what she calls...that's what she was calling these little "dates" that she had. I don't know if they were sort of going out and talking to somebody. I didn't interpret it that way at the time. Maybe it was a lot less harmless than I wanted to picture, so...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: Sorry.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure where...you think already that she needed someone to talk to, or whatever (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, she had at first tried to I think impress me with the fact that it was just somebody to talk to. Getting the whole story, there was a lot more to it than talking, it seemed like. And I took it from that side, that from the side that she just needed somebody to talk to. So...kind of amusing that she wanted me to find somebody I could go out and talk to also. And of course, like I say, I looked at it from a different standpoint, and I didn't know anybody, couldn't find anybody. Nobody from the same standpoint that I wanted to (inaudible). Consequently it worked out that way. Maybe if I had a different outlook maybe I would have, I don't know, pursued it more. [6:46]

</p><p>One thing that bothers me, I got my bill for sessions that I had in June. And I put it in my briefcase, said, "Well I'll pay this out of my expense account the next time I go on a trip." And I thought of course of a trip in the next week or two. And the trip gets put off, you know. Well, not this week, maybe next week, you know. Consequently I haven't paid and I keep saying, "One of these times it's going to be the like the times when we go to the doctor when you haven't paid the bill in three months and the doctor says, "Hey, when you going to pay the bill?"" So I keep expecting to walk in here and you say, "Pay this bill or else there won't be no sessions."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pay up or get out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Pay up or get out. But I don't have those trips a lot, and I realize how much those things help my financial statements. My boss kind of got worried when my expense account got up to half or more of what I was making each year. I got running up expense accounts that much. Maybe he thought I wasn't worth it. That's why he cut down on my trips out of town. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that means that he doesn't value enough to pay to be willing to have you spend some more expense account money. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He isn't like the previous boss that we have. I didn't work there very long before this guy retired, but I still enough so I could see what he did whenever his expense budget was getting low. He'd initiate a new project, you know, to get some more money for the office. Well this guy he takes his set projects for the year and tries to live with them, and he just can't seem to do it. [9:22]

</p><p>Secondly, like I said, he doesn't know how to manage the finances that well, so, it seems like he's punishing me. Not only himself but all of us. He doesn't know how to manage it better than I thought. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) for managing it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I (inaudible) time. Until I find another job I'm looking for. I need to find something (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not like (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Like today, he's out of town. We (inaudible) a little project, for that little project or something (inaudible) make the day go faster more than anything else. It...all along, like you say, it's just kind of biding your time until...maintain your equilibrium a little. Well, I said something to my wife about, oh about a week or two ago about you coming out for dinner or something like that. She said, (inaudible)? And this dates back to the time that there was a girl, this couple, happened to be coming over for just a drink or something. And it's a girl that's, you know, a nice-looking blond that used to ride in a carpool with us. 

</p><p>And she'd ride in the carpool, and I'd tell my wife about how she wakes up in such a mean spirit that day. You know, this was before my wife started wearing miniskirts to (inaudible). One day, or after the third baby was born, not too long after that, told my wife I was going to bring her over for dinner, you know. She didn't think I was serious about it, I think. So I popped home one day and I had her with me, you know. My wife put some food on the table, and we had dinner. And she got to view the new baby and everything, and of course that was the excuse that I brought her home, was to see the new baby. [11:36]

</p><p>I was proud of him. I think I really surprised the heck out of my wife. She didn't think I'd do it. Since then, she's really underestimated what I might do. She thinks she's going to change what all I do, I don't think she can. She really might do it, you never can tell.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to have her not underestimating you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I don't like to have anybody underestimate me. I think that's part of the problem with this job. The boss is not giving me credit for what I can do. But nonetheless, he just isn't using my ability as well as I think it could be used. There was one company I'm talking to, I was talking to him about a week ago. I said, "Well around here we're going to start at a particular time and we're going to quit. Our regular hours are from 8:30 to 5, something like that, you know." Most of them sort of usually head out before then. 

</p><p>A lot of us even stay until six, seven, you know, eight o'clock at night. I said, "Well, this wouldn't bother me if I'm making what I call an adequate salary." You know, where it wouldn't...you know, I'd say, "Well now I'm putting in 60 hours a week, I'm only making two dollars an hour, you know." Something like that would just make it completely unlegal in my books. [13:20]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) two dollars an hour.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, if it works out to that, no. Unless I'm overly interested in the job, and don't have to go home and face bills that I can't pay. Right now, to a great extent, I come in between eight and 8:30, somewhere in there. And leave at anywhere between 4:15 to 5:00. The hours are 8:15 to 4:45, of course, but it's just, you know, I've lost interest in the job. And I don't care whether I stay there eight hours a day or not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you'd think you'd be interested in the job.

</p><p>PATIENT: Which, (inaudible) interesting. Get right down to brass tacks (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No pay, no interest.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible). Well, (inaudible) go play some tennis. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean you didn't know what the pay meant, or you'd enjoyed doing something, not therapy with me?

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah. I'm so well interested in this job that Monday my wife said something about, "Why don't you just take off Tuesday. She was supposed to take yesterday off. Then we could go to the beach in the afternoon. I didn't really worry about it, you know, telling my boss anything. I said, "I'm going to take Tuesday off." And he didn't like that. So it come to Tuesday morning. Had a little trouble with the baby Monday night so, I didn't lose too much sleep over it but she did. So I thought, "Well, just take Tuesday off." [16:29]

</p><p>So I called in Tuesday morning told him I was going to take a day's vacation. I'd hardly got up and gotten around and the phone rings, and it's her boss, wanting her to come to work. Well, okay, so I sat home with the kids. She's only supposed to work from 11 to 2, a little after that maybe. Of course in the back of my mind the question is, "Was that really her boss that called?" There for the longest time, every time the phone rings, I'd make sure I get to it, not so much to answer it, just to kind of see who it was, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Once or twice it was this one guy who would call and he doesn't think that I know anything. The minute he'd realize that I was on the line, he'd stop talking, you know, hang up or something like that. So I've gotten to the point now where I kind of halfway trust her now, make a mad dash for the phone. Of course, then yesterday after she went to work, I thought, "I wonder if she's really going to work?"

</p><p>And there's still in the back of my mind, I've come around to the point where I trust her more. Not completely. Before she left, I found out that this guy was off work that day. So about an hour after she left I made it a point...well she wanted me to call and find out where this beach was that they had talked about. So I called and talked to him, found out where this beach was and everything. More or less from the standpoint of seeing if he was home that day. 

</p><p>Anyways we talked and find out that they have some people from out of town coming in to visit them was (inaudible). So I said, "Well, I'll just wait about two hours, then I'll think up something to call the place where she works, make sure she's there." I still don't completely believe that she might...that she's at work. She might be someplace else. So I called to make sure she was there of course.

</p><p>If you measure it in numbers I used to have ten percent trust in her. Now I've gotten up to 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 percent. (inaudible). Because it seems like I used to trust her implicitly. And then all of a sudden I found out that this trust was being betrayed. So it turned down to zero or to five or ten percent in a year.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now you're count is slowly building up.

</p><p>PATIENT: He didn't need to come along to destroy it, it would go right back to zero, five or ten percent. Nothing has come along yet, so it's building up slowly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's kind of like as far as you're concerned, she's still on probation.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The box says Share (ph) on it, but there's nothing in it. [20:28]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I have a theory, say you could do anything you want to, what you'd do is you'd pick yourself up and you're like poking through the doors, sort of exploring things. Kind of finding out about everything in the room.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, or else you're...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, or else you're...well, you've got to have a certain amount of curiosity to work in science. I mean, or you really don't fit, I guess you'd say. You know, it's not...I was going to have, oh I don't know. I'd have to think about why you say, "Well, you know the ideal lab section would be to go in and have a little drink, you know, and smoke, get tired of talking after 20 minutes. Well, turn the thing off and go do whatever you want to." 

</p><p>I would like to be more active than I am. I don't know. I'd like to go out and go swimming, play tennis, you know, things like this. But you just don't have that much initiative sometimes. And I don't have it. Like, for instance, the other day they was riding home and I said something about to this guy (inaudible), "I have half a notion to call your wife and ask her if she wants to go play some tennis. But I wouldn't want to disrupt your evening meal." He said, "That's not going to disrupt my evening meal."

</p><p>He said, "It's already ready when I get home." And he goes, you know, all he does is sit down. But I still didn't have the initiative to, :"Hey, you want to go play tennis, you know?" I don't know whether it's from the standpoint of where my ambition lies or whether I've still got this...maybe he thinks I'm trying to make passes at his wife or something. [22:25]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like a core factor, a lack of initiative. (inaudible). Or, maybe it's kind of a lack of initiative.

</p><p>PATIENT: You mean, do I think it's a drawback?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What I meant was, first you're saying you don't take the initiative to be as active as you want to, and then you say you don't feel like asking him out to play tennis. But (inaudible) the husband involved.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, the wife has instilled in me that I do things sometimes that, you know, scare friends away. The way she calls it. And maybe this might scare friendship away.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Then I'd rather not do it, if that's what it's going to come to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But, nonetheless, I feel like I'm lazy, to a degree or extent.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because if there's an easy way to do it, I'll do it that way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: This I know, from past experience. And a lot of times I don't do things I really should, like the other day my little boy wanted me to come out and play street hockey with him. Of course I found three or four excuses why I didn't...why I shouldn't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I wanted to, but I didn't really want to exert myself that much. And one of these days he's going to say, "Well, you never want to play sports with me, so, what kind of a father are you?" You know, so. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It bugs me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You just don't feel that energetic?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. My wife thinks it's vitamins. So she buys vitamins and feeds me vitamins. Maybe they help a little, maybe they don't. I was thinking that, it was last week, or yesterday or sometime in there, "You know, one of these times I think I'm going to bring these pictures of the wife and the kids over here and show them to you." And so forth. I thought, "Well, nah. She's never understood me, so." It's not what would be necessary, you know, things like these, so...I'll just leave them right there hanging on the wall in front of my desk. [25:27]

</p><p>Same way at Missouri, when the third baby was born, you know. Had a picture, and passing out cigars, and...well, once since then I've had my wife down there at the lab. But the people down there sometimes me, "Well, how's the baby," and all this. And I figure well one of these days I'll take them all down there and parade them through the lab.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I'm proud of my family, you know, so...I keep thinking the boss is going to say, "What kind of a (inaudible) is this that brings his family to work with him?" So maybe I'd better not from that standpoint, so...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: My decision-maker. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible) if your decision is like...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, you get thinking about the life that you'd like to be leading. You'd like to have this job that pays real well, you'd never have to worry about where the money for next week's groceries is coming from, anything like that. Sufficient so that your wife could stay home and take care of the house, maybe even have a maid for her to help clean the house up, and things like this.

</p><p>When they, well, when I think about things like this and they never come to fruition, I kind of get discouraged. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible) have the kind of life that you want.

</p><p>PATIENT: To a great extend, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really, you're worried about wanting to have a comfortable, clean house. Kind of think (inaudible) want things to be taken care of.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess you go to too many movies and you see these movies where the people don't have any financial worries and all, and you know, it's not for real. And I guess there's drawbacks to even that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess when you see a movie like that, it makes you think, "That's the way my life ought to be."

</p><p>PATIENT: You see half a dozen movies, you get kind of frustrated, saying, "Why isn't it that way?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: The thing is you go to more movies like this, what's it, 'The Grapes of Wrath', or whatever it was. That abject poverty level of society.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then you think good...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, then you go home and say, "Well fine, have a look at what I've got. I don't have to worry about things like that, at least."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) [30:22]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I think it does. You know, I don't know what you'd come up with that would be better because you know as you go through your literature, advertisements and so forth, you know they're always...everybody's always trying to come up with some kind of a catch phrase that would grab the reader's attention. I was trying to think of some others right off hand, I can't, but you know, you're always seeing something that's...well, I think this one here works well because it tries to personalize it by using the words "your", so I think that's good. Like trying to aim at the individual not the general audience. I think that's good. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe that's something with the phone. Telephone company or something. (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) the sign of the monitor coming in?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sitting here thinking about how now I can certainly learn 17 ideas running a minute through my mind, and I'm not really dwelling on any of them. Whereas some time ago I would sit and think about something for an hour at a time, just one thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe this, is a change that's taking place too. Seems like I keep grasping for changes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You keep wanting to put a change in play...

</p><p>PATIENT: ...changing, if it's changing it must be getting better. At least there's a 50/50 chance that things are getting better. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're doubting at the same time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said, there's a 50/50 chance, not really sure if it's better or worse. Just thinking that when this, is all over you're going to take all the tapes and convert them down into about 30 minutes of sensible talking. That will tell the whole story.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean, the rest of it has been a waste of time, or...

</p><p>PATIENT: No, just wasting a lot of tape. Maybe I should be saying everything that's passing through my mind but I don't think I can talk that fast. I'm saying that right now the things that go through my mind kind of are fast whereas they used to grow on me for an hour or so at a time, maybe even days. Sometimes I used to get depressed and stay depressed for two or three days at a time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and now your head changes so fast you can hardly keep up with it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe it's the fact that you've got enough sense to stop and think, "Now things can't be that bad." Or maybe they are and that they're (inaudible) known. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's more hope that they might get better.

</p><p>PATIENT: The last time I was here you impressed on me that you thought my problems stemmed back to a religious background that I had, and I was sitting here thinking about it. Not so much from a standpoint that I feel that I'm not doing what I was trained to believe. You know what was wrong. It's more from a standpoint that I've been so ingrained in certain philosophies, but now that I'm trying to establish my own beliefs, you know. It's hard for me to really take what I want from these ingrained philosophies and make into what I want it to be. More than what someone has implanted in my mind, from year one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I can...how to keep the things you want to keep but keep them at your (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And have a spirgo (ph) to take a bit of this and a bit of that and establish your own philosophies rather than just accept this philosophy here. It's holding your own when you're really...when something had come along and taught you, or gave it to you or whatever. And you don't really want to accept it as a whole, you want to accept parts of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not part of a whole, just look at that with a (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe it's the religion aspect, it plays a part in one's life, but if you go at it the way they want you to, it's supposed to play, you know, the whole part of your life. And this, is the way it was taught to me, was that religion should play the whole part of your life. And my parents kept telling me to believe this, you know, and then they didn't believe it. They let it play this part, you know, and not...they were trying to teach me.

</p><p>So now, I'm trying to let it be just part and not turn around and teach my kids that this, is the way they should believe. It's just like today's youth, they say you can't fool kids nowadays, because the know when you're telling them the truth and when you're not. And I think this, is older than they want to give it credit for. You know, I can see what my folks believed and what they wanted me to believe. And I can see that they wanted the same thing, (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you want to be a good (inaudible) for your kids. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And sometimes I don't think I am. I said the other day to my daughter when they wanted to play ball with me. Still saying no I didn't feel like it or no, I didn't want to, or something like that. I just kind of, "Well, later." And hoped that it rained.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: So then I'd have a reason not to go out and play ball.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It bothers you to see yourself putting off something.

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep thinking, "Well, maybe this, is the way my dad did to me when I was that age." And it's maybe part of the problem. It also goes to this thing because I don't like to go out and play ball with somebody who can't play ball, because I don't have the patience to say, "Okay, now go get the ball and throw it back to me." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's the kind of thing that my wife and I went out and played the other day. She says, "Well, you say you want to play tennis. Fine." We go out there and it was all me hitting the ball over the net to her and her not hitting it. And to this...to me this, is not tennis. This, is just, you know, it's frustrating. I like to have somebody to play it enough where they can get the ball back to me at least once in a while. [39:06]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, other companies that I'm familiar with like, Rosch or Olympus, you know, they also put out a good product line. I don't think either one of them has come out with anything that would meet that statement, and I'm quite friendly with both of those companies. [12:56]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) because when the come for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it's just frustration to get out there and throw the ball to him and have him miss it, and then have to go get it. And when he throws it he doesn't get it to you. So you either have to go over and get it and back up to where you were and throw it to him again. Or else you stay where you are, and you're going to throw it way over his head. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's not your idea of playing ball.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's just not what I'd call ball. So I'm just a lousy parent. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really feel bad about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: To a certain extent, yeah. I just keep thinking one of these days the kid's going to grow up and say, "My dad never did play ball with me." And this other kid says, "My dad always played ball with me." And that makes you look like a bum, it makes like a bum. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What would you do to feel like a good father. You don't think you are one.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not in my books, no. No, from that standpoint I'm trying to be equal or fair to each of the kids growing (ph). When you really go down to analyze it, you know that the baby gets the most attention, and maybe the other two just kind of take potluck at the same time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) where you're at? You (inaudible) you're not being trapped (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: I get the feeling, I don't know, like I was trying to convince myself sometime ago that I was being more equitable, more fair, whatever you want to call it, to the oldest girl. And I keep saying, "Well, from where I sit, it seems like things are improving." There's considerable, well, she didn't have much to do with me. And of course, when she didn't have much to do with me I didn't have much to do with her.

</p><p>And I'd like to believe that maybe I've tried a little harder, and maybe she kind of came around a little bit more. A father and daughter relationship, before she left to go to New Arizona. And I (inaudible) the other day, she says, "You know, it's funny how things kind of seemed quiet since she left." That's (inaudible), so...she's...it's funny. She's got kind of a standoffish personality. She's kind of an introvert. She's kind of an introvert, and doesn't have much to do with other people. She has friends, of course, but still, it's not very surprising when you hear, "Well, I don't like so-and-so anymore. Because they such-and-such." It can be very trivial usually. She just doesn't like anything to do with them for long.

</p><p>And if comes to a reconciliation between her and this friend, it would be the friend who would have to initiate, because she's not the kind of girl who would think of even apologizing or patch up their friendship, it's just not her nature. But between her and the other two, there's a noticeable difference in personality. The other two are kind of friendly. This other...the oldest one's kind of withdrawn and touchy, you know, doesn't like to communicate, seems like. There's an understandable different air in the house now that she's away. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is there...there's less tension in the house without your daughter now that she's gone?

</p><p>PATIENT: Seems that way. In August when she comes back I think we're going to (inaudible). Well, it's going to be, same rules isn't (ph) over again, it might take a while to get back to this...she's going to come back changed, let's put it that way. I don't think there's going to be a lot of difference after a couple of months, it'll move back at the same way of life...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But she'll come back more outgoing, more changed...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I think it's gonna be close to what I think it's going to be. I mean, she'll go back into this sort of introverted, standoffish personality, maybe after a couple of months. And she might come back that way just right off the bat. I think it somewhat has to do with not only me, but the other two children. They just don't have the same personality, so they don't get along. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I know me and my sister talked, just kind of carried on this friction all the time between us. And maybe there wasn't anything to it, it was just kind of a brother sister typical relationship. But there was always that friction. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I was three years older than her, you know. We just didn't have the same interests at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like if it was with your son and just your older daughter it would be nicer (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: To a certain extent, yeah. [46:28] The wife said something the other day about, "In a year or so we'll just have another one, and then that'll be it." Which was a little bit encouraging to me, but then again I see this three against one stage, the (inaudible) one relationship.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Might make matters worse. I know one thing it would do. It would get the baby of the house to not be the baby anymore. And maybe she would get treated differently, and help her. Then again it just hands her problem on to the next one.

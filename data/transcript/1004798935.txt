<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been one of those crazy weeks, slash two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been really, really stressed out. Um (pause for .03 seconds), yeah, I guess not having any time off is really hard. And um, it's been really stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The schedule that you were describing to me last time we met seemed really overwhelming and very jam-packed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. Um, so last night I went to section—well okay, so I worked Sunday night -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: which means I got home at like, I actually got home at 10:00 because I had to go back and get my wallet. It sucked. I left it, cause I'm an idiot —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and so I went to sleep at 10:00 and I got up at 2:00, and I was like, "okay, I'm kind of awake." Then I went back to sleep and didn't wake up until like 5:50, or maybe like 6:00. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>I have section at 6:30, and my plan was to wake up—and I have lab right after section—so my plan was to wake up at 2:00 or 3:00 and do all of my pre-lab stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't able to do that. I tried to do the pre-lab while I was in section but I messed it up and like I couldn't do it. So I went up to my TF after section and said, "Look. I can't do the lab today."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I'm not ready. I don't know any of the things." I'm like so far behind in both my classes.</p>

<p>And, um, he was like, "Cool. Well you can make it up on Wednesday night, tomorrow night, but you'll lose points for your pre-lab. You just won't get credit for it," which is kind of a big part of the pointing of the labs.</p>

<p>And so I was like, "Okay." And I was supposed to speak to the head TF to, um, to talk to him cause his lab is the one that I want to hop into for the day, on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I tried to speak to him, and he is the head TF and so he's like very—and so um, so anyway, he (pause for .02 seconds) he was kind of like not very kind. (laughs)</p>

<p>My TF understood. He was, "Okay. I understand. I just moved and I know what it's like to not sleep. That's fine. Just make it up on Wednesday."</p>

<p>And he was like, "Well, what is your reasoning?" and like blah, blah, blah. And, "Why can't you make it tonight?" I was like, "Well it's kind of (inaudible at 00:02:25) and he was like, "Well I don't have time to explain right now, or to talk to you right now. I'm starting lab," blah, blah, blah. And so, um, he's like send me an e-mail.</p>

<p>So I just sent him an e-mail actually right now. Um, and so I was like, "Okay," and he said to either send him an e-mail or wait around for 15 minutes until I finish the beginning of lab. I waited and then he was still really busy and at the end I was so frustrated that I was like, "Whatever. I'm just leaving," and so I left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then on the way home, I had a breakdown. I started crying the whole way. I couldn't stop—I couldn't even catch my breath.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you feeling? [00:02:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was feeling so stressed out, and I still am. I'm so far behind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say 'stressed out' what does that mean? What feelings are behind that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know. It's just like—just so overwhelmed, I guess. I don't even know where to start I'm so far behind. It's like finals again.</p>

<p>And, I don't even know—it was so—everything just started going around. And then it wasn't just school, it was everything. Then it was work and then it was personal life, and it all sort of jumbled together. It was like the longest walk home ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. You were feeling worried by all of that stuff? Or things are happening in those areas?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it sort of snowballed, right? So I was like, "Oh my God. These are—like obviously these are weed-out classes. What if I'm being weeded out? What if I can never be a doctor? Oh my God, what if my whole life plan falls through?"</p>

<p>And I'm already super busy and so like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thoughts were turning on each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I couldn't even try to stop it. (emotional) Um, thinking back I'm getting choked up. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, cause I still kind of feel that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your dream feels impossible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your dream feels impossible right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it felt just like—I had the same thing happen to me after my first semester, but at the end of the first semester of Divinity school. And I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing in terms of academic focus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had this one—this same walk home after everything, and I fell and after that I couldn't stop crying all the way home. Then what had happened—I think what sort of pushed me over the edge was that I spilled a Coke on myself—my TF's coke, I spilled it on myself—so I was wet and gross and sticky.</p>

<p>So I was just so—it felt like the same thing, except I was walking on the other side of the street, you know. (laughs) Um, and I didn't even know how to catch my breath; it was really embarrassing too to like—I don't know. (laughs) [00:05:04]</p>

<p>So I don't know what to do. I e-mailed my boss today and I was like, "Look. I need less time," and she was like, "Well, you were hired for full-time." And (inaudible at 00:05:13) blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, at this point, I'm willing to take out student loans, and quit—you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I need to—I don't know. Never know—like school's clearly my priority but I'm trying to see if it's even feasible to catch up anymore; you know what I mean? This is the third week of class: I shouldn't be feeling this stressed out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's really hard to work a full-time job so far away. It adds on—your commute adds on so much time, and the overnight shift adds up so much time that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you're taking on an awful lot. There was no wiggle room in the schedule as you described it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean but I'm usually that person that just makes it work, you know? And (pause for .03 seconds) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well human beings have limits. [00:06:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but I've never being very good at figuring that out; like when is my limit? I don't know, right? (laughs) I'm figuring it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've reached it. I don't know exactly where it was but it sounds like you were over it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't even realize it until last night, you know? I don't know—like I'm usually really good about knowing stuff about myself, but taking on stuff is just—I don't know. It's just a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think—if that's what it is—then it's a lot, right? It's not that any one of those things is too difficult for you. You know, you were doing the job over the summer and you were doing a great job at it. I'm sure these classes are completely within your ability. But the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: commute and the classes and the work all together sounds like it's too much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I think last night I even started doubting—like can I even do it? I don't even know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. Well you may not be able to do this combination; I don't know. This combination might be too -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I meant the classes. Like (pause for .03 seconds) like I know that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure you can. Why not? [00:07:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm good at my job and even last night—not last night—it feels like last night (laughs). Sunday night I was writing stuff and he was like—the doctor was dictating to me and I was writing stuff and I had anticipated the next four or five things he was going to say.</p>

<p>And he saw it before he said them and he said, "Wow, Leanne. You really know what you're typing (ph)," sort of thing. And I was like, "You know maybe I can be a doctor. I can be kind of good at this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I try the pre-med classes and I'm like, "Are you serious?" (laughs) I'm like—I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling right now as you talk about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .03 seconds) Overwhelmed. (laughs) I don't know where to start. I was just doing work before this and—Tim actually tutored me. He's a really good tutor. Um, and I sort of understood it but then I tried the homework problems and it's like extensions of what we had talked about. I have no idea how to apply them. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>I don't know how the formulas are derived and it's hard for me to just use formulas. Like I have to know how they work -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and I don't know that and I can't take the time to figure it out because I have three problem sets due on Thursday, and an experiment, and a lab to make up tomorrow, you know? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can do it, but you need time to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have to go to work tonight from 1:00 am to 7:00 am, so (pause for .03 seconds) (sighs) yeah, (laughs) I don't know where to start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. (pause for .05 seconds) It's okay to cry. [00:08:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (emotional) I didn't (pause for .03 seconds)—I didn't like doing that last night, you know and—(pause for .06 seconds) yeah. (pause for .06 seconds) And then I had a fight with my mom one day before class and (pause for .03 seconds) um, I called my brother to say hello.</p>

<p>He was like, "Hey, can you take a day trip to Mexico?" and I was like, "Ah, no. Like when?" (laughs) um, and I called my mom and I was like, "How ridiculous is this?" and she's like, "It's not ridiculous." And I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?" (pause for .03 seconds) (sighs) (emotional)</p>

<p>She called me the other day and I still felt really awkward but she didn't bring it up, so then it was just this awkward -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: but (pause for .02 seconds) I don't know. (crying) (pause for .08 seconds) I don't know. [00:10:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when your mom said it wasn't ridiculous, when she sided with your brother, what were you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was so angry. I was just so angry. I was—(emotional) and I was jealous of everyone else who didn't have to deal with that kind of shit, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The reason he wants me to go to Mexico is to renew my driver's license so that they can keep—they have a bunch of accounts and properties and stuff in my name cause it's convenient for them that way—but I don't want to have anything to do with that anymore.</p>

<p>I don't live there. I'm not seeing any of the money, you know what I mean, why do I care? (emotional) Um, and my mom was like, "No. It's not ridiculous. It's stuff that they have to do," or whatever. And, "You should try to solve this legally," and like, "Change the properties to other peoples' names."</p>

<p>Um, (pause for .03 seconds) (emotional) and I just don't want to have to deal with that right now. Like, plus like I don't even want to go to Mexico when I'm home. I don't feel safe there. </p>

<p>My brother's like, "I'll protect you," and I'm like, "Well, okay, I know you're a black belt but you're not going to stop a bullet," you know. [00:11:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't' know. So that, yeah, that was happening too. That was a few days ago. (pause for .03 seconds) So I don't know if I should like quit my job or quit a class, cause a withdrawal is better than a fail. (crying)</p>

<p>(pause for .03 seconds) And I can take chemistry over the summer, or something. Um, but then again this job looks good on my resume, and, (sighs) I don't know. Maybe if I quit chemistry, because I already have that like thing and I take it over the summer—next summer—and I could focus on chemistry. [00:11:58]</p>

<p>And I could focus on physics, which—ironically—is easier for me than chemistry. (emotional) Um, cause I thought that it would be the other way around —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. [00:12:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: so that maybe a good option too. But—and that would actually allow me to keep the job for as long as I really wanted to keep it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was what in your mind? What were you planning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was planning on one or two years but like, honestly, after a while, I have a lot of hours of clinical experience, so I don't need any more than I have. I have a year already—I have a little bit over a year already, so that's a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That might be a better solution actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you need the job for the money, for the resume?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. It's nice that I'm making money from a job that will look good on a resume. It's like killing two birds with one stone. Um, and I'm building really good relationships with the doctors so that one day they can write me letters of recommendation, which is important too. (emotional) Um, (pause for .03 seconds) it is really far away, like, you know? [00:13:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any way to do something similar closer, get the same experience?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really cause there's not a lot of programs near by. But I've been meaning—I kind of want to do research anyway, and research.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I could do that. But, yeah, that would be a good plan actually—drop chemistry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. (pause for .03 seconds) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you feel about dropping the class?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've only ever withdrawed (sic) from one class before, in college, and that's because I was taking 28 credits and doing eight extra-curricular activities, so it was like a lot. Um, and I slept through a mid-term.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's an understatement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) That's why it's hard for me to drop stuff, is because—like in college maybe my freshman and sophomore year I way over-committed. And so my junior and senior year I sort of learned, like okay, maybe do a little bit less. But even still, at the end of—like during finals, I was like completely overwhelmed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it was finals and not the whole semester.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then in grad school I didn't do anything except for school. I tried a job for two weeks—quit after two weeks. (laughs) Um, (pause for .02 seconds) so I don't know, it's just really stressful.</p>

<p>I would probably feel relieved but worried about my transcript. I mean, I'm sure at med school I could say, "well, I was working a full-time job and trying to do well in school."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But really, I think my greatest worry is the timeline and I could make that up in the summer, if I take chemistry. (whispering) I can do that maybe. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just to play with the options, what would happen if you left your job and kept the class?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause for .03 seconds) I might be able to catch up. (pause for .03 seconds) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But would that work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I wouldn't have a source of income.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is that possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I would have to take out more loans. It would be shittier -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I mean financially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Well, that's why we play this game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—I think financially it would be more difficult but (pause for .05 seconds) but my—I don't know—I mean I'm already losing points for that lab, and I like to be perfect on things. I'm like—yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perfection may not be attainable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, which (sighs) which is hard. (laughs) Like, even the way I do my homeworks—my TF who grades like 60 homeworks—I told him my name and he was like, "Oh you have really nice handwriting." Just the way that I work things out is just—I don't know. [00:16:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then once I lose it, I'm completely lost and I don't know what to do—you know what I mean? So I don't know. (pause for .02 seconds) I don't know. Um, (pause for .02 seconds) that really sucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean not to be able to do everything -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: just the way you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not used to that, especially because I feel like school is my biggest priority and I'm like failing at it right now. I'm giving up school for work, which -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which doesn't sound like it's your first priority —.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and doesn't seem to line up with how it feels in your heart. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So I don't know—um, (pause for .06 seconds) yeah, so this is sort of what's been going on in my life. (emotional)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot to process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) And I was really freaked out by last night, you know? I haven't felt like that since—well for a while back. And it was so weird. (laughs) I left the science center and was walking home, and behind this chapel or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm, yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was these people chanting in some language—I don't know—and I was like, "What?" and I stopped to listen to them; I was crying. Really hard core and it felt like I was really upset about science and was listening to religion and it made me feel a bit better. I don't know why—(crying)—it was really emotional. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like moving in between your two worlds —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (crying).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and maybe they're not so separate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah maybe. Um, (pause for .02 seconds) yeah, I don't know. (pause for .03 seconds) So—I don't know—I've just been really upset. I couldn't even do work last night. I was just like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you're probably also exhausted—in the true meaning of the word. Just depleted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. After I got home and sort of stopped crying and stuff, I couldn't even move. I was just like—(emotional) (laughs)—you know, I was just lying down and was like, I can't—so I just went to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You can't continue like that. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's really the only thing that's been going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Well, you know what I mean. (emotional) I don't know—I felt like really lonely, and (pause for .03 seconds) the cat kept me company which was nice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's not a whole lot of time to connect to people with the schedule that you're keeping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it sounds like you are making nice relationships with the people with whom you work, but there's certainly no time to talk to friends. There's no time for you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: those are some of the things that sometimes I hear about; a conversation that you had with a friend or something going on in the house—and that's all missing. And it has been for a while because your schedule is all reversed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may be another piece that adds to it feeling so overwhelming and feeling so exhausting, is that some of the support that you usually get you've been cut off from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I sort of expected someone to be home when I got home last night and there was no one there, and I was, "Oh. -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's disappointing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (emotional) Yeah. (pause for .04 seconds) So yeah, I don't know. (crying) It's really disappointing though. I don't know. [00:20:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's certainly not how you pictured the semester starting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not this early at least, you know? And I think that the deadline for withdrawing passed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. Well that might inform your choices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not withdrawing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Withdrawing without a 'W' showing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I can't really do anything about it, right? So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you can't change that but it (inaudible at 00:20:59) but, I mean, that's not your only choice. The option of taking out loans is there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If—it depends on what the consequences are for you and what feels more important, what matches with what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, if you want to keep the courses and leave your job and take more loans out, that's a possibility. You can get loans.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might be able to supplement your income with something that is closer to home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't have to be that it has to go one way or the other. And I'm not putting in a vote for one way or the other—but I want you to do what ends up feeling most right for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, at this point, I think about dropping chemistry and I feel relief, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Something to pay attention to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah cause usually when I have a hard decision to make, I ask people for their opinion and they're like, "I don't want to sway your opinion," and I'm like, "You won't. I promise." Sometimes it's about—do I agree or do I disagree. [00:22:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Testing out your reaction to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (emotional) Um, and I sort of feel like that would be—would give me relief, I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would make you happy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause for .03 seconds) I mean, ideally -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can play magic wand and then we'll dial it back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you had a magic wand what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could—I mean, I don't know what it would feel like to not have a job right? But um, probably doing that, quitting my job. But I like my job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and that's important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (emotional) I don't know actually. Um -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I were to imagine what the magic wand solution would be for you, it would be: keeping the job; feeling good and competent at that; feeling the relief that the money gives you; being able to have your classes done and they're easy -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs) [00:23:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and having time for—you know—to play with friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what the magic wand is all about. It doesn't have to be realistic. It's about having everything you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's all working perfectly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) Well, actually if I do decide to drop chemistry, I could work Monday and Wednesday during the day or something, and cut my shifts on the weekend down. That would be nice actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That way I would have time to see friends and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that actually might be really nice. I think I'm going to do that. (sighs) [00:23:54]</p>

<p>I think it—I think like part of it is that my self-esteem is really wrapped up in how I do in these classes, especially because—I feel so clumsy too. Obviously I identify with a student more than I do as a scribe or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and (pause for .03 seconds) and like not being able to do well, sucks for me. Like I just feel like a failure, you know? Like I feel like a failure, which is really hard to feel. (emotional)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the last time you felt like a failure before this—before this semester?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:24:35) yeah and that really sucked. Um, and that's when I decided to quit Divinity school and like I'm not going to finish. That was a big deal for me; um, that was rock bottom. But—I don't know—I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you decide to continue? [00:24:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't have anything else to do. (laughs) I mean, to be honest, that's really what it was. And I was like, "Well—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you didn't -</p>

<p>CLIENT: it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you ended up continuing it and not failing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean, I didn't do very well but I didn't fail. Um, yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) So, but the other thing is that in high school my life was all about science, and when I went to college I was going to be a microbiology major. Science was a big part of my life and I was good at it too.</p>

<p>In high school, I worked at a research lab and some of the people who had been taking classes for three years at the college couldn't do some of the stuff that I could do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they were like, "Leanne, you really need to do something in science." And now I feel like a complete failure, and like how is it even possible that I was ever good at this? Doing the math—and I mean, I haven't done math in like seven years -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so you're rusty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's—I feel like (pause for .03 seconds) it feels like the equivalent of physical clumsiness to me. Like if I were to go take a ballet class right now I would have no idea what I'm doing, and that's what I feel like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe, maybe that's adding to it too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. That you have this memory—almost like muscle memory—of this stuff coming more naturally -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and having more ease with it, and what's happening right now in real life is not matching up with that memory of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you mentioned—you compared it to the ballet class—I also think about it in terms of fluency -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: like if you've been speaking—if you're home and you're speaking Spanish for a really long time, to come back and do English feels weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you've talked about having certain friends who you speak a certain language with, and you don't like to switch, even if you learn that they're fluent in the other language as well -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: you know, it kind of reminds me of that. It's just not—it's just not the mode you're in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if you give yourself time to get into that mode, similar to how—you know—if you go home and you start using your Spanish a lot more, it's a lot more comfortable at the end of that trip than it was at the beginning. [00:27:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you come back, it's giving yourself some time to get fluent again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah, so maybe part of that would be dropping physics—or chemistry —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and then you would have time to really immerse yourself more in the physics —-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and it will start to feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That might be really good. And I kind of—I mean (sighs) this is all really embarrassing, but that would kind of make me feel better in terms of—maybe I can actually do this; it's just something that I have to get used to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's embarrassing about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I'm just used to being able to do stuff, right? But at the same time, my greatest insecurity is not being smart enough, so this is like right there. Um, (pause for .04 seconds) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Having to work hard does not mean you're not smart enough. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (emotional) But that's not—that's not really, like I know that I just have to do the work and that's part of it. I'm not wanting to do well without doing the work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just know that I have to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to have time to do the work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So I guess it's more like, it's kind of like trying to figure out a way to not feel stupid if I have to drop the chemistry, you know? (crying) Um, I don't know. (pause for .05 seconds) I think that's what that's about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. It's really hard not to judge yourself and see the limitation as being about you, rather than seeing the things that are limiting you. I see this as not really a limit of your intellect; it seems to me that it's a limit of the hours in a day, or the days in the week. [00:29:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. I was thinking earlier too—it was like—I did the math actually of how many hours I have between class and to get the work done before lab and it was like four, over the whole weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Well, that makes sense that I didn't get it done. It's not just me being lazy."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When we sat together last time and I had you draw up that schedule —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. (emotional)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and when you were calculating; 'this is the block that I'm commuting' and 'this is when I get home' and 'this is the amount of time I need to sleep', and then there's class—there wasn't any space in there. And it was like, "Maybe if I only sleep for four hours I'll have two hours to prepare for class." [00:29:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. (emotional)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't add up. You can't—I mean, your body told you—you weren't getting out of bed at 2:00.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean that was four hours of—and I think the other part is like I physically feel, like I feel physically ill like—I mean, I might actually be ill and be in denial (laughs) but I'm running fevers and stuff. My body's angry at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:12) and stuff. I actually think I have to go to the doctor but whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been suffering for a while. I mean, your asthma was bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now I think it's my kidneys or something. I don't know. I don't know. I might be in denial. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're consistently having fevers, your body is definitely talking to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) Okay, I actually feel a lot better. (laughs) Um, and I still don't know what to do about the whole go-to-Mexico thing. I mean, (pause for .03 seconds) I don't know. Last time my dad had me sign this, um, a couple of years ago, he had me sign a document that basically gave him the right to do everything. I guess it's kind of like a Power of Attorney, so he could—instead of me signing legal documents it could be him—and it would be equally valid. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, um, I'm kind of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that still in effect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Mexico, at least. I don't even know what accounts I have. I know there's a couple of bank accounts that are in my name but I don't know anything about them. (sighs) So this has also kind of been hanging over me, and (pause for .03 seconds) it just makes me so angry to like have to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to have to deal with it; like this is not my life. I don't care if I have a driver license or not. (pause for .04 seconds) So I don't quite know what to do about it. I told my brother to figure it out and he's like, "Well, I guess I'll figure it out." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me really angry at him because he never calls me, and when I call him he—he makes me so angry at him. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He wants you to do something for him, with no awareness of the burden he put on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and even just financially. To book a flight for the day —- that's like $500. I don't have $500 lying around to spend on a plane ticket, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. So (pause for .02 seconds) and he was like, "Do you have time to request for time off?" and I was like, "Are you kidding me right now? I can't do that." I'm sure that he was equally angry with me. I'm sure that it seems like I'm being really obstinate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like he doesn't really have an awareness of what your schedule is right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I told him. I was like, "Look: I have class Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and I work Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I don't have any days off."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I guess now I will. (laughs) But I still don't want to do it. You know, it's not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. It's not what you want to do with your time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, but I don't know if I'm just being stubborn or (pause for .02 seconds) I don't know. [00:33:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how do you feel about them using your name for these accounts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate it. I hate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems important too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not just the time. It's also that you feel really uncomfortable with the arrangement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I could do it—I would just want those accounts closed, you know? Like I don't want anything in my name and honestly, my dad never put any properties under my mom's name. He has a bunch of branches, right? And he never put any properties in my mom's name, as a kind of a 'fuck you', I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I think, like I really would like to have them under her name cause I think she deserves them after 30-something years of marriage, you know? Um, plus you know he's using that money to support a new family instead of for me and like, what's in it for me to have those accounts under my name?</p>

<p>You know, like—I don't know. I know it's complicated legally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it's complicated legally; it's complicated emotionally; it's complicated within the terms of your family dynamics. [00:34:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very -</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad's a lawyer. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's no way that I could do it without him being (pause for .03 seconds) —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, so that's kind of, that's kind of been going on I guess. Um, —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was kind of really freaked out though last night. I didn't—maybe, I don't know—maybe I just need to chill. I tried to think of other stuff and it didn't work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it doesn't sound like your reaction last night is worrisome. I'm not worried about you from a safety standpoint.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're going crazy. You sound—you're all here: you're oriented to time, you're oriented to place, your thoughts are logical. And your emotional reaction to that is appropriate. It feels so defeating and you're so disappointed and you're so worried. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>It's really scary to be that overcome with emotion and to be crying, and not to be able to catch your breath, and to feel like it's going to go on forever. But it didn't, and you're processing it now, and you're talking about it and understanding it and evaluating it in a way that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I was really freaked out because even—like usually I'm really good at being in control of everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm, and this is out of your control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it was very, it was—yeah, it was—I don't know—it was like I was scared of being out of control (emotional) (laughs), um —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, that was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So, um, yeah I don't know. I just feel like the whole world's coming down. (emotional) (pause for .05 seconds) (crying) Yeah, okay I feel a whole lot better actually. Um, (pause for .03 seconds) I feel—I think like the scariest part of what I was thinking last night was: what if I don't have what it takes to become a doctor? [00:36:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if? Let's do the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. What if I can't—I mean, the world doesn't end. That's a good thing—that's a start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have no idea. Usually I'm just so focused that—and usually the scary part about it is—like I'm kind of a pessimist, right?—so I'm always, "Okay. This is the situation: worst case scenario." Even with chemistry: "Okay, worst case scenario —I'm going to drop it." [00:37:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. The world continues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause for .03 seconds) but this was like really—I have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's stay with where you are because—so if you can't become a doctor, then we know: well, the world will still go on. You don't know what you're going to do, but maybe that's because you're not even close to finding out that you can't be a doctor.</p>

<p>Right now what you're finding out is: you can't handle these two classes and this current work schedule with this job. That's what you're finding out right now. You're not at a place where you're determining whether or not you're going to be able to be a doctor.</p>

<p>And maybe that's why you can't answer that question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that, like, okay? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To not know that answer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (emotional) Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think three weeks into these classes is the appropriate time to answer that question. I think we need to stay in the present and the question right now is: can you do this schedule for this semester? [00:38:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I guess focusing on the schedule (pause for .03 seconds) is —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Let's focus on where you are right now. You're not finding out whether you can be a doctor right now. You're finding out whether this is a sustainable schedule and course load and work load.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of the reason I thought I could take it on was like, well you know—it's kind of like residency, whatever. You're working 8000 hours a week and doing all this other stuff. I know that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they have breakdowns.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Maybe that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're—I mean, I think—there's all sorts of problems with the residency —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: from, you know—experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (laughs) but I think one advantage that residency has over what you're doing is that it's focused. [00:39:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They live in the hospital that they're doing their residency in and don't go anywhere else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not commuting and splitting time between classes and a job. They are all in there. And they're having freak-outs, and they're breaking down and crying, and wondering whether they can be a doctor too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So it's all practice. (laughs) Okay. (pause for .05 seconds) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So one step at a time, and give yourself permission to not do it perfectly. [00:39:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That one's really hard for me —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: because even—like I did the homework for chemistry for last week or whatever, the one that my TF (inaudible at 00:39:55) and I got a—what was it? like a 30 out of 32, or a 28 out of 30, or something like that. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sort of but not really, cause I was like, "What were those two points?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm, but that is pretty good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, hey?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From where I sit. Maybe it doesn't feel like it for you, and I can honor that that's not how it feels for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) Okay. (pause for .03 seconds) So, how—I don't know—I don't really know how to handle it with my boss that I'm asking for some, like, not 80,000 shifts per week, because—oh, so part of, I don't know if I told you this—part of the problem, part of the reason that I'm working so many shifts is because we have hired someone for part-time and she was really not very good, and so they fired her within the week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so there were all these shifts that weren't taken -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and they were like, "Just take them," and I'm like, "Uh, excuse me?" (laughs) [00:41:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're doing more than what you were required to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Um, and I think the shift that really hurts me is the Sunday night shift. She has Wednesday shift—or she had Wednesday shifts that I've picked up, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so why does it all fall on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, part of the thing is because I'm paid extra as like—part of my job duties is to pick up shifts that can't be taken by other people or something. And I e-mailed her today and—can I pull it out like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got it. Um, I e-mailed her about—where is it? Um, (pause for .06 seconds) so I e-mailed her and I said, "Hey, everything's going good, whatever, however I wanted -" well it's kind of long. But basically I asked for less hours, and she said, "Leanne, what do you mean by cutting back hours? Are you wanting to stay at full-time hours? You'll need to stay at full-time hours since you are the chief scribe and were hired for full-time. I'm also sure that you understand that until the new person is trained we can't cut your hours significantly as that would end up leaving holes in our schedule. I will need a little more clarification in regards to what type of hours you are wanting." [00:42:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So what are you looking for? Are you looking for your original full-time hours? Are you looking for less than your full-time? Cause you do more than your full-time right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right now I'm doing like 48 hours or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so, between you and me, what are you looking for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably like 36, which is three shifts a week, which is enough commute time. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause for .03 seconds) basically I don't want to do the shifts that I have to do extra.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, okay. So then I think you can write back to her and say: 'I understand there are holes in the schedule. I have been picking them up. I understand that I was hired for full-time. I have other responsibilities in addition to that and I cannot continue to sustain a schedule where I am picking up all the extra shifts. I would like to work 36 hours, these shifts.' and see what she comes back at.</p>

<p>That's polite. It's clear. I think—what she asked for was clarity. [00:43:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and she made a bunch of assumptions about what you were asking for because she didn't know, and she started getting nervous in her own head about you wanting to drop down to like 8 hours a week or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that if you're really clear: this is what I've been doing; it's not sustainable; this is what I need; this is what I want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just be really—you don't have to sort of like edge around the sides of pretending to ask for what you want. Just tell her what you really want. She'll probably respond better to that than if there's a lot of vague language in it, because then she's got room to think, "Ah. Now Leanne wants just one shift a week and I've got to find all of these other people." [00:44:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't give her room to imagine that —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: if that's not what you're asking for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just want a normal schedule.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And, I mean I can understand that in your position of authority that some of the responsibility falls to you to pick up some of the slack, but it seems really impossible for you to pick up all of the slack that there ever is forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like a really unrealistic expectation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause for .02 seconds) So it's not totally unreasonable to ask for less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound unreasonable to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, my field (ph) I've never worked in a hospital, um, but it sounds like a reasonable request. Does that mean that they'll meet it? Not necessarily, but it doesn't—but they're not going to hate you for asking for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they won't meet it if I don't ask ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Absolutely. They won't know. They're not going to say yes to something that you haven't asked that makes their life harder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause for .03 seconds) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should wrap up there for today and when are we on next? I know we've scheduled a bunch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's probably the Tuesday after today, after next Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're probably right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The same time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:45:24]</p>

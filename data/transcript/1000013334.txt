<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not too bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When did you get back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yesterday morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, just yesterday. Oh, okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I took an early morning flight back, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look like you got some sun</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little. The weather was warm, but it wasn't very sunny. It was overcast a great deal and all. So, I managed a little sun time. Yeah, that was good. So, overall it was pretty good. It was relaxing, you know. I had kind of set my mind to the fact that, well, I'm going down to a low key place and I have no money to do anything, so make the most of whatever I can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was all right and plus the fact that it was with relatives put a different emphasis on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't, it's hard for me to tell what that means exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What that means? Well, it wasn't like vacation that I like to think of, like, an adventure vacation. It wasn't that. No, this was, well, I happen to be at this particular point right now, so I would obviously love to be doing other things. I can't afford it, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I tried not to set myself up for disappointment. Like, recognize what I'm going into and because of that, it was fine. Ended up having a good time because the weather was not great, ended up doing a project for my mother. That was a lot of work, a lot of work and sore muscles. I ended up, well, before I went down she had mentioned that she'd like me to do some painting for her. But when I got down there and took a look at one room versus another room, I thought, well, you don't need to paint here. Oh, no, no, no. (2:00)</p>

<p>She has a, I don't know if you know, a sun room. It's like a room with a lot of windows. They call it a sun room down there. It's kind of like an enclosed porch and she has wooden paneling in it. And the wooden paneling just looked horrible where it's old, it's dark, it's scratched, it's. So, I convinced her that we should try stripping it and try to do something with it. So, ended up stripping it and we're going to try like a whitened finish on it and it just didn't work, you know. I tested it and it just didn't work. </p>

<p>So, we're leaving it natural with just what I hope is a tongue oil application. It's just a, it's linseed oil and something else and something else you put on it. And unfortunately when I did that, it like made it almost as dark as it was before, but it's supposed to dry up clear. It takes a couple of days, so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you didn't get to see the totally finished product.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't get to see, no. But what I thought was good for me is I was doing it and it was taking forever to get it done. And you know what I was telling myself was, like, it's important for me to accomplish this, to finish this. For me to take on something that I am unsure of because as I got more into it, I thought what the hell have I bitten off here. And to finish the detail on it just in terms of I felt like, well, this is a project I need to finish. It's like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm just thinking of, it's like my tax project. I need to finish this. Not get into it, think, I'm afraid I don't know what I'm doing et cetera. I had questions, I went to see people about it and then I went back to the hardware store and said this isn't working right what do I do here? So, and just like to follow that through, I just felt like I need to have this sense of accomplishment that I'm doing this. (4:12)</p>

<p>And also, like, I got a lot of skepticism from my younger sister who was there and two of my brothers called, actually three of my brothers called while I was there and they were like, what are you doing? You don't know how to do that? Why are you trying to do that? So, I thought, well, I'll try. So, it was okay. I mean, I was glad I felt like, okay, I've accomplished this, you know. I set this goal. I've accomplished it. So, I thought that was good. It was also, what was good, that I felt a little lonely while I was there. I didn't close down too much from my relatives, a little bit, you know. </p>

<p>I provided a little bit of space for myself. I'd go swimming sometimes. I'd go for a drive. So, I provided that. I also thought of the fact that hopefully Tanya is coming in February. So, that's like giving me something to look forward to, you know. So, it's like I'm kind of, I didn't get to practice. I also didn't smoke for 10 days, which was good and, you know, three meals a day, good sleep. So, it was just a nice, low key, relaxing vacation. And I needed it. I would have preferred more beach time, warm weather, but you can't control that. So, I went to the Y and swam instead, so. (6:13) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it was kind of somewhat mixed, but it sounds like you made a point of accentuating the positive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, I thought, okay, I have this, what can I, you know, what can I do with it, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, so you're telling me that you felt like, you know, getting that project done was a kind of accomplishment and it seems like you felt that was important. I'm wondering about how is it telling me? Or what, do you have any sense of what it's like for you to tell me about these things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To tell you about it? Well, I thought about mid-afternoon today, oh I have a session today. What's that going to be like? Well, I have a few things to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the first feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What was more on my mind was that it's, like, I have to focus, you know. It's like in the sense that being away for week, it's always tough to come back, you know. And then I felt, well, I thought it would be tough and it was kind of tough the session before I left, but I got into some things, you know, and was able to talk about them. So, I thought all right, I'll go with that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you meant that you anticipated, it sounds like you had a real feeling like today it would be tough to come in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I was being critical with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that weird of me? How?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like thinking how I won't be able to go in and focus on things. I won't be able to go in and talk about things. And I should, you know, it was a should have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should have something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I should be able to go in and focus on things. (8:03)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, was this, so you're kind of, was that your part of your way of getting sort of focused is to get reporting stuff or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm wondering...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And encountering, oh, I don't want to go. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Encountering that, well, can we focus on that though? </p>

<p>PATIENT: That I don't want to go?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if really you don't want to be here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that it was just the fact that I think that's, that it somehow feels that I have to come in and do certain things. I have to come in, I have to focus, I have to talk about things as opposed to I've been gone for 10 days where I haven't had to go for a lot of deep thinking about things. I have some, as I had the electric sander in hand. And or more when I'm doing the trim work, you know. It gave me some time to think about things, but not to verbalize them and in that sense not to make contact with somebody else. So, I think that's kind of what's there. No, I was, I thought oh, well it'll be good to go see Jillian. You know, my usual teeter totter routine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that's why I'm trying to get more of a sense of that because it sounds like there was some anticipation of it feeling kind of hard or almost like a, I almost get the sense of it feels like a chore somehow or that you, that sense that you should be focused. I guess, I'm wondering what you'd expect if you came in here and you weren't focused? I mean, it sounds like you have some feeling about that that wouldn't be okay. (10:13)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think it would be. I don't think it would be for me. I think I'd feel bad about it afterwards. I think it would be frustrating for you. I think it may be frustrating for me too, you know. In, probably in the sense where last time I knew there were a couple of things, either last session or the session before, I don't really remember where I knew there were couple of things I wanted to get through, you know. And you stopped me a couple of times, I think, as if I was flossing over something because I wanted to get to something else and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I recall last time you seemed to have a real agenda of things that you wanted to touch on and it sounds like today, in a way, there's a worry. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 11:17)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that seems interesting. I mean, you said something about maybe not making contact with us last week when you were working and I don't know I wonder if there's something comforting or to come in with an agenda not to have wanted, but there's some, do you have any sense of, I wonder if it had something to do with what it might feel like that, you know, the two of us together without your having a clear road map in mind. (11:52)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose in certain ways the dynamics might be different. Instead of me coming in and talking about things, it would allow you more to say, oh, we don't have anything to talk about. What if I ask you about this or what if I ask you about that? Now, did I think of that earlier this afternoon? I don't know maybe subconsciously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's what we're kind of yeah, I don't mean to suggest that you'd have thought that through explicitly. It's like you don't, I'm trying to imagine what yeah, that might be there, but I think what's happening, you look like you were feeling something as you said that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, what I was feeling was, well, that my sense of being afraid of questions and there was also a little bit of sadness because I am that way that I feel that I have to be protective of myself, you know. That I can't, that I'm going to have done something wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That somehow you'll be exposed for having done something wrong if...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and in the sense that, like my conditioning is that it's not just enough to say, for someone to say, oh you've done something wrong here or it's incorrect, but there's usually more to it. There's ridicule or there's humiliation or there's a lack of understanding as to what I may be doing. (14:01)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that's making sense to me, but it feels like a little general. Like, I'm wondering how would that apply to, like, you're coming in here without, like, if you let, you said you thought maybe leaving more of an opening for me might feel dangerous, like you wouldn't be protected somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then it could probably it could potentially be that you'd say well you're not working very hard today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, that's what you can imagine me coming out with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, some.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there anything that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's, but I realize it's not really you and it's not really your style, but the fear is still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I'm wondering if there is anything that you're picking up from me or you just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're energetic today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think, right? You're energetic today. You got energy today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think that's true, but so what, how does that feel to you for me to be energetic?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you're probably going to coax me longer. Come on, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Coax you to? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Talk about things or feel things or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then so what, and so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So? And especially since I don't, you know, I don't really have an agenda and then that's possible. (15:59)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's, how does that feel? That that would, is that scary?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little, yeah. Probably also that's a little bit of the remainder coming from the vacation where I would be closed down, you know. I was closed down a little. I had a good time. Most of the things, you know, were okay. The conversation wasn't deep in a lot of ways especially about me. I had a very good conversation with my younger sister the last evening I was there and I bordered on telling her I was gay, you know. Like, you know, and to say to her, well, you know, you're aware that I'm gay. How come you never asked me? </p>

<p>It was, we were talking about the rest of my siblings and having, she's very good at just, like keying into what's going on with someone. Not really being critical and not saying, you know, boy is she dumb, you know, like my older sister. But just saying, well, you know, I know she does this and this and this and this and, you know, I'm concerned about her. And I just thought, I think because she's like that it was feeling safe for me. But then I didn't do it. Safe, but not safe enough. So, maybe there's a little bit of that there too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I was, like, maybe you feel safe, but not safe enough with me. (18:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To kind of, I mean, you're talking about coming out to her. So, maybe I know you're gay, but maybe that's like in other words saying that being yourself or revealing, you know, being fully out with who you are in some way. Like, it feels unsafe to just, you know, to be yourself with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's, but it is, it seems like it's like uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm just thinking because as I say that I also think, you know, then I think critically oh, it's too bad I couldn't have gone and been open and talked about things. I thought, I had Tanya's picture with me, one of his pictures and I thought about showing it to my sister because I needed to get in touch with him while I was there because I was supposed to fax him something and I was having trouble with the fax number. </p>

<p>So, I was open about saying oh, I need to make a phone call to Asia at my mother's and, you know, there were like no real questions asked, you know. I think I said something like I'm helping someone with a business arrangement, but I don't know. I guess I'd be asking oh, Asia, you know, what's going on? But there's like no real questions asked. Again, it's kind of, like I said before, there's a certain amount that they don't want to know or for instance my mother and I were watching the Golden Globe Awards in between sanding, you know, oh who's on? Let me see and they gave a...(19:57)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I interrupt just for a second? I'm using my energy because it sounds like you wanted to illustrate something, but I'm kind of wondering about what's playing, you know, what's going on because I notice that we sort of touch on what's going on between us and then I feel like you, like just now, that you sort of veered back to well, you said you were kind of feeling critical and maybe sad or disappointed that you didn't and you're talking about your time in Mississippi. I guess, I was, I'm wondering, I guess I felt like I, you know, like I lost you from our interaction. I mean, do you have any sense of shift, you know, of shifting back to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, that you point it out, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just wondering if there's something important about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think it was more to kind of make a point, you know. I didn't, you know, I wasn't consciously thinking okay, let me just switch the subject, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But were you aware of how it felt to focus on our interaction or how you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt unsure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unsure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As you were saying that, I'm thinking, all right this is like, you know, question, question, question, like where is she going with that? How do I feel about that? So, I just backed away from it, I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it felt like I was asking, I was doing question, question, question?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was doing that more. Question, question, question like where is she going with that? You know, I don't know what do I think about this? That kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I said, you know, maybe it feels somewhat like...(21:59)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Opening up to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, hard to be fully open here and so and you were like unsure. Is that what you mean by you were unsure? You were unsure if that was so or you were unsure about talking or discussing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was unsure about discussing it. Or unsure of what you wanted from me regarding that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Like I, do you have any thoughts about that? Like it seems like I wanted something from you. Like you felt, so I felt, is that kind of like a feeling of pressure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt like unsure pressure. Kind of like what we discussed before spiral questions. The question kind of starts here, but instead of coming to me, it kind of going up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm doing feels that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit. Not, there's not, again, there's more energy behind there today, but I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure where you were going with this. And I suppose I don't want to, yeah, I don't know where you're going with it in terms of if you wanted me to respond to it and if so, I don't know what to say. Am I confusing? (24:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, I don't think I feel confused. I mean, I'm following what you're saying. I'm trying to understand more of what that sense of how that feels that you're unsure. It almost sounds like there's a sense that I'm going somewhere and it's unsettling or just that your not knowing ahead of time where it like, almost like I have an agenda or it's so. I guess I'm trying to understand more about what that means to you that you don't, that you don't know where I'm going. Like I'm leading you somewhere or I'm trying... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in the sense that when you entered the door that you thought okay, I'm going to go here today. No, I just got the feeling that in the course of conversation, as in the course of conversations we've had before, we're still working on what's going on between you and I. And I suppose in a reflection of how ultimately how I deal with people... </p>

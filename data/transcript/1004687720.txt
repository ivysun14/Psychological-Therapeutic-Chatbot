<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and to get here kind of any way I found out yesterday that the Professor I'm working for really needed the memo that I've been trying to get done for a week by today. And so we were leDanng at 5, and I had a program at 5:15 and he said it was going to be close. It's right next door. So at 4:58 I left the lab with my printout and it was raining and I was running and—yes. Sometimes I think there will come a point in my life when I'm not a disaster and, not in a serious sense but just not hDanng [inaudible at 00:00:44] in any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Racing in the rain at 4:58 with your printout.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And maybe that will probably never happen. Mostly I'm okay with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not so sure that I ran in the rain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad never made it there, I can tell you that much. So I talked to Dan finally. It was good actually, good. All this shit that I have been worrying about, it's just—I mean it's still there obviously but it just wasn't there in the competition. Talking to somebody I really like and trust and catching up. Yes, he called yesterday. After we stopped I've been kind of thinking about the last thing we talked about yesterday and trying to get it in my head and ended up being like I can't do work, being moderately upset, not super upset but I need to go home. Last thing I need at work has hit me, but whatever. [00:02:17]</p>

<p>So I went home and my friend John from William & Tanya was sitting on the couch with Kirsten watching the [inaudible at 00:02:25] women's soccer game. So I watched the rest of the soccer game and Kirsten said hey you guys want to go to the pub for a beer? And so it ends up being a beer and [inaudible at 00:02:37] and eventually ice cream and port, because that's what I drink, sort of at night. So six hours of talking, it was great, really great. So, yes, it's been a good couple of days. But also, well you know how my life is. Really good things enters first with pretty serious shit. I don't know what to do, I don't know. </p>

<p>So I was thinking you're right that to say—I mean I think the way you phrased was like a blossoming in a sense narrative in terms of saying well if you just don't talk about it then everything will be fine. That is self-deception. That is not—I know better. And to fixing it, I thought, I realized that I don't know if I was clear that I was really, I was trying very, very hard. As soon as I realized that I could be construed as flirting with Dan I tried very, very hard not to all the time. Very hard. And I only bring it up because usually I just trust you to get things like that, and this is something that I thought I don't know if Chad knows this and then I thought I really don't want Chad to think of me in that way. So I think it is something I should bring up. [00:04:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, there's a lot I don't know about sort of the tenor of things and type and number of interactions you had was and I—yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I ended up talking to him and Kirsten about this last night. I have so many relationships with men and people talk about flirting and again it's not a category that is closely enough defined for me. Although there's always this tension for me between yes, I like attention and I want people to like me and I want to come across as I don't know shiny or whatever, and really not wanting that to be the case, really just talking. I don't know. I feel like I run into the person, simply saying the problem where I think we're having a friendly conversation and the other person thinks that we're flirting, kind of a lot. And it's something that I really dread because I feel like I'm responsible for something that I didn't realize was happening. [00:06:44]</p>

<p>So I'm watchful and—really what I just wanted to say was that I was like oh God, Chad thinks I was flirting with a married man. I freaked out. That was the problem; that was what worried me. [inaudible at 00:07:16] But the thing that made me say okay I've got to go home, I can't keep working, was actually not really that inaudible at 00:07:26] past that. But I realized when I would think and still do think about Dan and me and that relationship, I always think of in terms of lines and boundaries and saying we draw a line and then it'll be okay and we have to do that and constantly using that language. [00:07:58]</p>

<p>And you're absolutely right. That is not—that's not true. I'm kidding myself. There is no line that you can draw. But that means that—I'm so careful not to hurt people. I try really, really hard and if there isn't any line then that means that I can't ever become [well enough] (ph). There's no such thing. I can't protect people. I can't protect myself. How do you fix that for [a total mission] (ph) sort of. I kind of think that would be great. Dan was 15 years older than I was and I didn't find him that attractive and he was married and I was engaged and he was my teacher and all of these things that I thought would protect us and they didn't. How do you trust any relationship? It's—anything could happen and I know that. [00:10:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's different from what you're experiencing then? Talking about in a way how can you trust how you feel in any relationship, not to—how can you trust that you, the things that you say no matter what you're feeling? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I guess so. I spent a long time and I still do spend a lot of time trying to bully myself into not feeling things or into feeling different ways. And I feel like it was a step forward for me to say no, that's just not going to work. And there's a—you can choose not to dwell on thoughts and you can say okay, that's maybe is one that I'm going to put over here and I'm not going to go there. But there was—being kind to myself about what I can and can't control in terms of my feelings. So then I say well what goes on inside my head doesn't hurt anybody, like I have to—I guess that's my goal in life. [00:12:27]</p>

<p>And part of what was so scary to me about this was realizing that I can't necessarily control how my actions are dictated by my emotions. Or maybe I can control them and I just don't. I don't understand about that. But I feel like I'm dealing—I feel like I'm talking abstractly about things that might not make sense and it's also I spend a lot of time kind of having this very detailed sequence of thought and I wrote it down because writing helps me think. And sometimes I have to write and then I try to talk about it and it's all gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you read it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, actually can I just give it to you and have you read it? Or do you want me to read it out loud? I know there's a recorder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's probably easier for me if you read it. Does that make you very uncomfortable? [00:14:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me uncomfortable but that's fine. If I need to stop...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If it gets too uncomfortable, stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. This is faster [inaudible at 00:14:39]. Yes, I had lunch with the guy who's dissertation I edited today and he's a writer and he asked if I wrote this stuff, wrote about my depression sometimes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much do you write?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Off and on. I don't keep a devoted or specific blog or journal. I find it easier to compose it on the computer now. So I'll just write in a Word journal and just leave the document on there. But I feel like when I'm writing, it's trying to understand what's going on in terms but through narrative and style. And I feel like when I impose too much of the narrative structure on it in my writing then when I come to talk to you we don't have as good conversations because I have had this idea of this is how it goes in my head. And, you know, once I write something if it works as a piece of writing I'm kind of in love with it. And so, I really just like that phrasing. And so [inaudible at 00:16:22] I don't know why. Sorry. [00:16:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Computers are impressing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said computers are impressing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I was trying to get all these things together and he (ph) slams it down and ran away. Okay, [inaudible at 00:17:15]. Okay? I won't say scary. Okay, so I said, "so Chad is right saying it will all be fine if we just don't openly acknowledge it was, is a self-deception. I just want to keep being able to keep being involved without worrying about it if he's right. Which ideally allows the choice of either continuing to deceive myself if I can even do that anyway, or acknowledging that there is no line, there is no boundary, the other side of which is safe. It tells me what I already know and dread and tried to deny within myself. Nothing is safe. I can never be sure that I will not damage people irreparably. Every relationship, everyone I love, everyone I like, everyone I wish well rests on shaky ground. I cannot contain the damage I do to others and I cannot protect myself from the damage they do to me. [00:18:20]</p>

<p>"If I do not say the line is here, talking about loving each other, where would the line be? I gave up on trying to turn off my heart years ago. It was one more example of me trying to control something that I don't actually have much control over and hating myself when I failed. So I said okay cut yourself a break for that. Your job is to do damage control. Keep your mouth shut for God's sake. Don't do too much, no matter how much fun it is. Work on keeping your focus on where it belongs. But what happens in your head doesn't hurt anyone. This is way too weird. [00:18:59]</p>

<p>"Did Chad think I was angry (ph) I was flirting with Dan? Was I flirting with Dan? Maybe, but I was trying really, really hard not to. The attraction was like a table in the middle of a small damn room that we usually walked around and sometimes we bumped into. But we never sat down at it and faced one another until we did. What am I responsible for? It is important to me that Chad know this, that I wasn't trying to flirt with Dan either. I was actively trying not to flirt with him. Suddenly here's something that I think he won't understand unless I explain it, that I can't stand to let stand. Interesting.</p>

<p>"Here is the place where I don't simply trust him to understand me, intersecting with the place where I need him to love me. I think there's a difference between becoming close to someone and making yourself available to him. Is there? I think there is. I loved being close to Dan. I wanted it so badly and it felt so good. And I thought he is married, he is so much older, I'm engaged, he did not think of me as particularly special, I do not think of him as particularly handsome; these things will protect us. I wanted them to protect us is maybe more accurate. I tried to be so damn careful and you can never be careful enough. You can never be careful enough. You can never be careful enough. [00:20:36]</p>

<p>"How do I live with that? I almost blew it with the best man I've ever known because I wasn't careful enough with the second best. Looked at from this angle, the loss of innocence as Chad termed it narrative serves to protect not just my actions in this specific dalliance let's say, but my belief that relationships are even possible, that I'm allowed to love people and be loved by them and even go one step further down the rabbit hole that life is worth living because if there are no lines that will protect us, then I can never be careful enough. And if I can never be careful enough, then how dare I risk other people's happiness. And if I do not dare, how can I bear this cold, dark, lonely life?</p>

<p>"Okay, so what now? I have to keep going somehow. Today I have work to do, and tomorrow and the next day and the next. I have work to do; people need me. Luke cannot do without me; Penelope cannot do without me. Everyone was fine the way they filled the hole [inaudible at 00:21:45], that mirror-shaped hole. But it would hurt and it would take a long time and it would be worse than the other things I might do to hurt them probably. Damage control. Is that all it is? Just damage control? "[00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well thanks for reading that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somebody probably needs to go home. What? You're looking at me like where do I start?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what you seem worried about or need is that I'm going to find or underline ways that you're destructive which I think would be entirely hurtful to you if I were to do that. I guess I imagine that a lot of what was scary about reading that out loud was that I would think badly of the thing that you think so badly of it or so worried about which is I think sort of like running around waving a gun, [inaudible at 00:25:54] what did I want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what it feels like in some ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But something like that. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I'm like come on, Tanya, you're [not that hot] (ph). Actually I mean what I really worried about is that reading it was that I write for an audience and that was just for me. And also when I'm writing things down, when I'm doing this on purpose I'm not like it shapes my mind, like aesthetic sensibility. I'm trying to create something that, I'm trying to write something that is nice, that reads well. So this—it's likely I'm not a very good writer, and I'm like it's self-indulgent to try to—I just feel like I'm being melodramatic or I'm romanticizing something that's not actually very romantic. So I worry about your judgment in terms of the familiar (ph) why I'm afraid to read it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I (inaudible) it's something like your worrying that I think you're too attention-seeking and [00:27:52] pay no attention to anybody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See the fun thing about having friends who are theologians is that they get drunk and have conversations about theology. Not that anyone was particularly drunk but we were drinking. And so we talked about vanity last night and just kind of all three of us saying yes, we're just really vain people. So trying to deal with that. [00:28:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I was saying and I can respect what was making you nervous was my thinking of better writing or that you were being melodramatic and you worry about being vain, I guess. And I guess relatively with how important in it for you I think writing is and kind of taking up marginal space, not just talking about how you feel about things per se, but in particular why you take up space about how you feel. Is that right? [00:30:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. It's something else but [inaudible at 00:30:56] Yes, I can the walk. I mean I'm pretty—I find it—it's so easy for me to put part of myself out there, like a very carefully curetted vision of myself out there that the idea of people seeing the rest of it is just on it's worst. I can understand why people don't give their papers to their friends to edit but do I dare [inaudible at 00:31:47]? I don't understand why people don't it's just because that's one more area where I'm more comfortable. Yes. I do feel like I'm walking around with a loaded gun. And it's like you're going to notice much. [00:32:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not going...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Point it out or I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could say my God you've almost done that thing, like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more like I feel like it's a continuing miracle that people haven't noticed how destructive I am and that's going to stop. We're talking about that and it's crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's one of those things that has a lot of intensity to it and really does take up a large amount of those days. But you just have to worry about how long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Dan, here's something where people did get hurt and that's just a fact. And so what I obsess over is that neither one of the people know that I didn't want that but I tried. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thought, the critical thought that you worried I would have is that you're kind of leery I care? There are times that you just can't be all that careful essentially. I mean in other words, like you were saying about drawing lines that I guess would be the same around me but like you've already said that it's—I guess I kept trying to imagine maybe you're worried about something that's more personal and less I don't know, [inaudible at 00:37:46] or something where I mean when you lay out the kind of futility of drawing lines it's as though it's sort of a fact of human life or social life or trying for something. But I think you're more specifically worried about you, that you will get swept up in a way that you won't want to see what you're doing and will tell yourself stories about it that you believe. [00:38:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I [inaudible at 00:38:59] that. One of the articles that circulates around Facebook recently has been on the necessity of a certain degree of self-deception in terms of helping people succeed and that's something that I can accept abstractly but I'm just am really not comfortable with it for the mainstream. I guess that's only if I think I'm part of what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What sort of self-deception?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, basically the study's saying that people think they're more attractive and better as their show of skills are just better at things than they actually are and that it helps them be successful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:39:49].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But it's very scary for me to think how much of my—how much of what I think of myself is built up on self-deception. Already I've had my ability to draw conclusions from the outside world kind of crumble at my feet in the last couple of years. So, yes, it is a kind of okay well maybe this is just the way things are but I worry about it because it's making this [inaudible at 00:40:52] for me and the way I work and I don't like doing that. I can't see it as a good thing. Look at her. I can't get over that. I look at her because I don't want to face something. I have no idea if I even wish that things were different so much that I just decide to act as if [no one] (ph) cares. I'm sorry. [00:42:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel really scattered today. I have trouble thinking clearly or thinking in a straight line. So I'm reading Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, by David Foster Wallace. Have you heard of it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I haven't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, there's a short story in it called The Depressed Person. I think you should read it. I don't recommend things a lot but I think you should read it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a good read?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm not going to say this one you really should read because the next thing that's going to happen is you're going to end up topping it. But it's just brilliant and hilarious and completely brutal. Oh my gosh, yes, it's just a menagerie of just capturing both what it's like to have really severe depression and more specifically having really severe depression and the treatment world, the modern world of psychological treatment. It's not a nice story, it's not something kind. I'm kind of glad I'm reading it now rather than two months ago for one it would've just destroyed me. I mean he's kind of an irritating, he's got kind of an irritating style, I mean I've got an irritating style, and it's one of those narratives. [00:44:30]</p>

<p>But it's about the depressed person, who's a woman, a young woman, and it opens by saying she's in severe and unceasing agony which she cannot describe to anybody. And the failure to be able to communicate this is itself a part of the true phases of the situation. And it just talks about this woman who's in this very intense therapeutic relationship for three years and has this group of support network that she calls. And she calls them late at night and she kind of pours out her soul. And she feels horrible about it and apologizes all the time and then recognizes that the apology makes her seem needy and is in itself manipulative and then hates herself for that. And by the end of the story, he's created in you the reader the same repulsion for depressed people that she herself is describing and that is real because she can't—you know, when you're depressed you can't look outside and you can't empathize well. You don't pay attention to other people's needs and you don't [inaudible] that. And at the same sort of, it was like [inaudible at 00:46:12] like fireworks in your head. [00:46:16]</p>

<p>So there's that and then at the same time just like pulsing through the entire story is but the pain is still there. It just hurts and hurts and hurts and hurts and hurts. And that's real too. Oh, it's so good, so good. But mean, often it's not kind. It's not kind to therapists either. The therapist is just a—I can't actually remember any of the terminology but I think you'd find completely dull. But in the effort to be non-judgmental and not use should statements you end up just going f***king going. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think I'd understand it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I guess so. Yes, yes. I haven't finished re-reading it yet so it's a little unclear. Like horrible and also fantastic. It's like getting punched repeatedly in the face in a really good way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks for letting me go on about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. [00:48:10]</p>

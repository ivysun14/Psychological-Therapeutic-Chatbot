<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so now we just do our thing.  What's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh come on, come on.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what's been happening?  You have to put, you have to put, you can just put [PHYSICIAN NAME] there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And there.  Um, you still, you're still doing the SAT prep, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is that going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, uh, are you taking, when are you scheduled to take the exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, in 2 weeks but they, uh, the woman doesn't think that I should take it like in 2 weeks because I just, because I already took it, like I got my test results back from like last month—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did really, really bad, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's because I didn't have enough time, like everything that I answered I got correct but I only got to answer like a quarter of each section.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, because like, just like, I just read like slowly but like I understand it, I understand everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do we feel that this is the ADHD, I mean do we feel that this is, that your attention wanders and you have to go back and then it wanders and you have to go back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well no, it's like, it's helping like, me like sit through the whole thing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, you know, without like getting like antsy or anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like feeling I have to like, you know, just feeling like jumpy or anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, you know, I just, I'm just, I've always read slow so, I mean I'm not like a fast reader in general, so I don't know what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So is that something that they can work with you to improve your reading speed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're going to try to give me extra time but they—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're going for testing to get un—timed or extended time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Extended.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about for math, is it the same problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well math, well yeah, not really, well math I know the things but I'm just not, I'm not, um, used to like the math that's on the SAT and it's really hard to review everything for like every single thing in geometry and every single thing in algebra because I, you know, I took AP calculus last year, I'm not taking a math this year—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like you forget like a lot of things and it's easy, it's things you need to know, like a couple [INAUDIBLE] and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've often wondered about that because the kids that are the best in math haven't taken that math for a couple of years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the kids that are taking it might do as well or better than someone who is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's a weird thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it stinks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But does reading slowly impact you, do you finish the math?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think, no, I don't, what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words, you said you don't finish the reading because you read slowly, the math, I imagine there's, it's not like you're reading like a passage and then answering questions on it, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's just, it's just if I know how to do it, I know how to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But do you finish it or you still, you're not able to finish that section either?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I finish what I know and it's not like, it's not like, um, it's not like if I know it, like it'll take me a long time to do it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like if I don't know it, then, you know, I'll try to do it.  It's just like a matter of like how much I reviewed and studied.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's different with math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she feels you ought to not take it but, um, do more review, maybe get—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Approved for extended time and then take it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my mom sent it like 3 months ago but they sent it back after a month saying that she didn't complete like something and then so we resent it and they still haven't gotten back to us, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's really bad?  How did you, what was your score?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it was like an average of like 450 or something on each one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what's, I don't know, what's perfect, I don't know, what's the highest you can get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twenty four hundred.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And there's three sections?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got like 1350?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's below average, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, like 24, like a good score is 1800 or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like 18, 19 and it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I take practice tests at home—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like, you know, they grade it and stuff, like my average practice test for writing, I mean for critical reading and writing and stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like, like my highest so far was like 640.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're there if you had more time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I would have never gotten, I would have never even gotten that on the practice test like 2 years ago or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like just practicing by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so you need the extended time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So bad, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and you're working on it.  And are you also applying in the meantime because now is the time, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  I really want to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really want to go there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I love the idea of being international, I love the idea of being in like a French dominated area with like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you, do you take French?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did take French.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For like almost 3 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like my uncle lives in France right now, he's lived there all his life and my grandparents, like my grandma is an immigrant here from France, she moved here when she was like 19.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her sister and like there's like a lot of our family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I just, I've always wanted to learn French, you know, I just, I love the language but they didn't offer it last year at boarding school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are there some students from your high school that went to [DEIDENTIFIED] last year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't heard of anyone go there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that there may be a couple from, uh, my daughter's school that did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think there's a, like you're describing, there's an intrigue with certain students, you know, for various reasons to go to a Canadian school and that's where they would go, uh, I'm pretty sure at least a couple of kids went to that or maybe another Canadian school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that is like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But isn't that a very top Canadian school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it depends because when I looked it up, the, um, the acceptance, the acceptance percentage was 52%</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Compared to, I'll say Cornell which is the easiest of the Ivy League to get into—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is about 30%, so it's like more than, a little more, like a tiny bit more than half of everyone who applies gets in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's, but only 15% are international.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so that's my question, do they have higher standards for kids coming from the United States?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They majorly like, they're biggest, the biggest thing they look at though is SAT or ACT which I haven't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Taken the ACT yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but then if you don't get the extended time, you're not going to be able to do well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I want to go there so bad though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are your other choices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I have, I wrote it down on paper, I mean I'm not really like, there's, there is like one, there's like 2 in South Carolina I liked—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One was like [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which was really nice because I just, you know, I like that area and I like the whole atmosphere there and it's like a small private—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, [DEIDENTIFIED] and there's another one that was really nice too, I don't know, there's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's very different, [DEIDENTIFIED] which is a huge university and a little private school, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I think I'd, I'd just like see the, um, I see like all the benefits, like all like, like how like a big school would benefit me with like, you know, like being like kind of like more independent, like French dominated so it makes it basically like forces me more to like try to learn it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then the private school, where like the private Catholic where like I could still keep like, you know, some of that, like I look at it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like city, I would like that, I would even like, you know, village area or like kind of like a down south area where it's quiet, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really mind, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Anything around here, [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], none of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] is really hard to get into.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't accept a lot of people.  They get like, I think like 90% of their incoming freshman graduated like top of their class or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're really hard to get into.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really, wow.  Um, anything else in New Jersey?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Anything else in New Jersey would be too hard, that's considered like really, like [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're used to being away, so for you to be in, where's [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really, so for you to be that far, it's not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's actually like a 6 hour drive, so it's weird because I went to Conneticut which was a 4 hour drive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't know, I think like Canada is like basically the best choose to go to if you really don't want to, if you want to go to a different, kind of like a different country kind of atmosphere—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you want to stay like still close to home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, because it's like, just drive up north.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Did you start meeting with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I met him one time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what happened after that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I was supposed to meet him yesterday but I, I came home from school early because I didn't feel well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, and what's happening with the Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean the Adderall is fine.  My mom probably talked to you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But let me get into a little more detail there.  We had talked about trying, uh, like 1, 1/2 , 1/2  or 1, one 1/2 , in other words, because it only lasts 4 to 6 hours—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Taking, you know, in 3 times but taking a smaller dose in the evening so that you could sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've been like the majority of like since we met until now, I've been just taking 2 a day, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One and 1?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because I just, you know, I just, I don't have like a need, you know, I don't feel like, like I won't be able to like do anything, you know, like I'm trying to keep it like, you know, moderate—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or whatever but, yeah, I've also done that a couple times too, the 10, 10, whatever, it kind of, it works like a little bit, like not, not as well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you take less than 20, it doesn't seem to have the same—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Benefit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you take 20 at, uh, first thing in the morning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And 20 when else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The morning though is when I told you, the morning is just, it's like the time where I'm like, like the afternoon is the time where I'm most focused and like I can get the most work done—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I sit down and really like concentrate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's why, I mean maybe that's also why the SA, when I took the SAT early in the morning and I took my Adderall, like it wasn't like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So even if you take the Adderall and hour or more before, you don't feel that you can focus as well in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe because I'm so, I'm just still so tired in the morning, like it's not like, you know, it's not like something, everyone, oh, everyone you get like wide awake from it, Adderall doesn't make me wide awake at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I can go right back asleep if I take it, like after an hour—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, you know, it's not like it makes me like, oh, something clicks on and I'm just like oh I can do everything now, like it just helps me concentrate on some things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's why everyone, that's why I'm like, probably like the people I know who take ADHD meds, like a lot of them like get like a little more hyper from it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't really get hyper from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, okay, but so you take 20 first thing in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then 20, when is the next dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At like 12.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twelve thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But do you find that it falls off by dinnertime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The effect falls off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then how can you do homework, uh, after dinner?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I usually do homework, I'll try to get the homework done in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how about the SAT course, what time is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh that's, that's at, um, 2:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see, so if you had some, a school project or something you had to complete, would you take a whole, a third dose of Adderall or you would take another half?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think there's been 2 times where I took a whole for the third one—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it was like, maybe like 5:30 or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, it doesn't, it doesn't bother me for sleeping—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't interfere you falling asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, no, like other things bother me for sleeping sometimes but not, it's not, I know it's not from the medicine because, um, like I can kind of tell, I'm like used to now like what my body—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I kind of like, that's what I like about like, you know, I like, um, something that like I can actually like know when it's not benefiting my body, like when it's like not benefiting me or when it is or like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stuff like that, like I get like a feel to it, I don't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it just, a lot of, um, like I'm really tired at night but I just, at night is the time where I like kind of think about how the day went or think about like what I have to do the next day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's when I'm, you know, that's, that's like kind of like a little of like my loss of sleep or like, you know, I just get like really like nervous about something or whatever, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I can tell, like when I used to take the Vyvanse or when I used to take the Adderall maybe like, maybe I took it like late at like 7:30 or something, like I can tell that I couldn't sleep from the Adderall—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it was just like obvious because my mind was just like constantly like, I don't know, it was just like, I just couldn't like fall asleep, I don't know but like, um, you know, when it wears off or whatever and, you know, I'm able to sleep, like other things kind of get in the way of me sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, does it interfere with appetite during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I really like about it too.  I really, at first it did and I was really nervous because I'm really skinny and I'm trying to like, my dad ordered like the Bow Flex home gym for me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like this big thing to put in the basement, like really nice, like state of the art and I really want to start working out and stuff before college and I was really nervous because I need like food and stuff but that's been fine.  I've been, I've never, I think, until this year, I've never eaten breakfast almost every day of the week, like I don't, I can't skip it, like I know I can't because I take my medicine right after breakfast and I know like if I don't take it, I might as well not take my medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so it really helps too because I've been getting like a constant like breakfast and then I've been getting lunch and I've been making sure I've been eating a lot of fruit and like as much like, when my mom cooks, like as much broccoli and like stuff, so it kind of like has this thing but I don't know, my, I come off different to my parents and my parents just have not been liking like, they think I'm so depressed and they think I have like all this stuff but, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why do they think that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, I, I do have like trouble with like anxiety I guess but not like all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like within the past like 2 days, I haven't really, it hasn't really been bothering me for the past like 2 weeks and like before that, you know, it was bothering me a little and then before that, that was, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean anxiety?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just like, I can't describe it, I don't know, like not, like not really being able to, um, like sleep because I'm nervous about something or like if something upset me in the day and, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there any hints that the Adderall causes that, you said no before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't correlate with when you take the Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wears off, like I usually, I don't even take it a lot at, at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I might like sometimes wait from like 7:00, instead of taking it at 12:00, sometimes like I won't take it until like 1:30 or 2:00, you know, like I just, I'm trying to, like or sometimes I'll wait in school, I won't take it until like maybe 9:00 or 8:30 and I'll wait until like 3:00 or 3:30, you know, like, like my mom doesn't know that, she's like if something, if I thought for a second, like okay, this is definitely what's causing it, like I don't like to have anxiety or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anything like that, like I would, I would stop, I would definitely like, remember with the Cymbalta and with the Vyvanse with everything where I was like okay, doing this and this and this is causing this and I really don't like, like I'm like straightforward because it's like my health and it's like my mental whatever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't feel the Adderall is causing the anxiety?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm nervous because, I don't know, like I don't, I don't like, like I don't cheat, like my mom was like blah, blah, blah, blah, like, you know, she doesn't like me on this or like she wants me to be on that instead and, I don't know, like it's not, I don't know, I just feel like she uses, she uses things like, instead of like taking away something or like, you know, making sure I can't go out and do something or something, like she threatens like something that like, you know, I've been taking to help  me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And stuff like that, like you, that's not normal, like don't, you know, like medicine, like that's like, oh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's threatening to take it away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She doesn't, it's not like, she's like oh well, blah, blah, blah, like I really don't think, you know, I looked online and it had all these symptoms and they're all the symptoms that you've been having—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like my mom, like I don't, my mom was like, oh, you know, the whole, you know, this and this, I'm like mom, first of all, I don't have heart palpitations, you know, when have I ever complained about that, that, you know, I don't have this, I don't, she's like yes you do, you told me, I'm like, I mean once like in the beginning sometimes or in the, you know, once in a while but it's not, you know, I know all medicines have symptoms but it doesn't bother me to the fact that, you know, I realize I probably have anxiety on its own, like just from everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when people say anxiety they're saying nervousness or worry, is that what you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of yeah but sometimes I don't know how to deal with it, like I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, give me an example, you said some things, sometimes something happens during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it's only been like 2 times during the actual day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like within the past like 2 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's usually at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean it's usually like, one, it's not usually at night, like that's the thing, it's not every day, like, and it's like usually when I'm not really, I don't think I'm worried about something but I'm trying to find, but my mind kind of like tells me, okay, yeah, there is something that I'm not, I'm not comfortable about and then, you know, just the whole, the like whole thing with like I worry sometimes about like my school—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, okay, well, what if my teacher is not going to give me an extension on this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's going to give me a zero for this, that's especially that, like things like that.  If I didn't, if I know myself that I didn't finish a homework assignment or something, you know, because I really need to get good grades this year, I'll like, I'll feel really like nervous and like kind of guilty and I won't be able to sleep from it because, you know, I just, I'm like so tired that, you know, I don't want to, I can't do anymore work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or something, I need to ask for an extension but I'm so nervous that, you know, I'm going to get an F or I'm going to, you know, the teacher is not going to like it or, I just, I'm nervous about like how the teachers are going to think of me and stuff and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The thing that we're kind of on the lookout for is that there are people who get a rebound when they take a stimulant.  In other words, it's working during the day and then it kind of, uh, the level falls in the afternoon or even and sometimes people can get moody, I would think that they could get anxious, you know, because it's a mood altering medicine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you said it doesn't make you jittery and nervous, it just allows you to focus but maybe as it's leaving, you get a little jittery or nervous, it's possible, I mean does that seem to make sense, is that, do you think that's what might be happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I know that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know that, for a fact, that's probably what my mom like wants, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, I'm not trying to make it up, I'm trying to ask you what you think is happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't, in other words, do you notice any change in your mood or how you're feeling or your worry in the evening on a regular basis.  Do you notice that something happens in the evening that's different than during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And sometimes I forget to take it too and, you know, I'm fine with like, like I'm kind of fine, like not, like not with like, I don't really like need it, need it, like you know what I mean, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really like, oh, you know, but, you know, like during the weekends especially, like I won't take it at all—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really, unless like it's like a Sunday or something and I wake up at like 2:00 in the afternoon and I take it like 3:30—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know, I don't, it's just like, I don't know and actually the weekends, the weekends seems like it's kind of like that's when, you know, like from like Saturday night and Sunday night, kind of that's when I feel like kind of a little, you know, that's when like I get once in a while, when I get once in a while those things, it usually occurs like on a Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On a Sunday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I have school the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it because you're apprehensive about, is it because you're worried about what's going to happen in school the next day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I hate school, like I dread going to school every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So Sunday night is a drag because you have to start the whole week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's kind of like not as bad, believe me, but it's kind of like when I used to come home from boarding school on breaks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For 2 1/2, 3 week breaks, it's kind of like how it would feel the last night before the break ended.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going back—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And facing it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's exactly, like it does, I don't know why but I get, I just, I don't have any, I don't have any friends anymore in the school—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't feel like anyone like likes me a lot and, you know, it's just like, it's not really, it doesn't make me want to go to school, like it makes me like not really like care about anything because, you know, like, I don't know, I feel like sometimes, you know, like I regret not going back to boarding school sometimes and just like the whole idea of like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's hard to jump around when you're in high school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I used to have, from having in that high school, from having, the last time I was in that high school was, you know, was in my junior year, from having all these friends, there's not even like, just like all of, you know, like all the parties and everything but like, like knowing everyone in the hallways and like, you know, having a little conversation here and there in school and then going to class and stuff like that and then now, you know, not saying anything in the hallway, like kind of feeling really awkward and like nervous—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they the same kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, half of them aren't and half of them are and they all don't, you know, I don't, it's like they completely moved on and I'm stuck in like a 2007, the 2007, you know, life in [DEIDENTIFIED] like I used to be but everyone moved on to a 2008, 2009—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it just, you know, I love, I love doing, the differences though, I get like this big relief after walking out of school every day and I, and then my, um, like when I go home and like I know, I know I have SAT and everything, like I like SAT class, I like my tutors and everything, like I, I become like, you know, relieved, I can become like, you know, I feel like happier kind of and I feel like, you know, that's, you know, I like really can like concentrate because I know like, you know, I don't have to worry about this kid staring at me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you take the Adderall on the weekends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  I mean sometimes, like not as much as the weekdays, like maybe 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 1 a week, I mean 1 a day, not even.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and you don't particularly notice a difference in terms of the mood symptoms or the anxiety symptoms other than Sunday night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean my mom and dad can say that I've had so many mood swings lately but I don't know, I mean, like I said to you last time, I think I said this, like I've always had mood swings —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just have a problem where I just get angry a lot and I don't know why, like ever since I was in 9th, like ever since I was growing up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my mom, like she doesn't, I talked to my dad about this yesterday, my mom doesn't, um, she doesn't realize sometimes how she comes off and just her facial expression sometimes, like when I'm in a good mood a lot and I come home from school, like, you know, she'll be like, oh, you're in a good mood, blah, blah, blah, and then she'll like say something and like upset me about something really little and it'll kind of kill it and I'll kind of just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it sarcastic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, like kind of like just her facial expression and like telling me, oh, well you need to do this and, you know, why didn't you do this and I'm just like, mom, like, you know, I don't know, it just, she doesn't realize how like her tone and stuff and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're saying—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We go back and forth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you get moody, it's not out of the blue, it's in reaction to an experience, a reaction to an interpersonal event, like your mother upsets you or somebody else upsets you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean if I'm in a bad mood, I mean if someone like really, like if someone says something to me in school that really like ticks me off, like, you know, I'll feel like uncomfortable about it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I might bring that home sometimes with like my facial expression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're reacting to something that happens—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With someone, it's not out of the blue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not like you're in a funk for no apparent reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's always something, like it's always like if I didn't do this or if I didn't do that or, you know, if like I just into an argument with my dad, if my dad says something to me that's really hurtful and he doesn't mean it and he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do you feel that, what you said to me when you first came in is you don't feel that you're having depression now, you don't feel that you're depressed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Define depression, I mean my mom like always like, always like says, oh, you know, you're miserable and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, depression means almost inevitably at some point feeling unhappy and down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but everyone feels unhappy once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right but it's not people who are just unhappy in reaction to an exchange with somebody, it means for no apparent reason, even though things seem to be going fine, they feel down, they can't enjoy things, they lack, you know, their energy is effected, their interest in things effected, everything is, nothing seems good to them, nothing is appealing to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So wait, depression is like, it's kind of like if things are seeming to go well but you're still just not satisfied or happy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like you kind of, see, no, I mean I don't, like I think like for the most part it's because of something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's because, you know, in the morning usually it's because I'm not, I'm not really, in class I'm more happy, you know, I'm more like engaged and everything, I love learning, I love homework and stuff.  In class, it's really not that, it's like kind of in between classes or gym class when I don't, I don't have these, you know, like someone once in a while might say something, you know, that like, you know, from like, you know, walk by me and call me a crack head or something or do something like and I don't know, I might like, you know, just get into like a brief, you know, but then, you know, I'll get depressed or whatever but it's not like going to kill my day, I usually, I usually like let it go, like I don't even know, I mean I don't even know how, like for me, knowing me like for a long time, obviously, like knowing like how I've been, like I would think, like I kind of relied on like having a lot of friends and like being, having people there for me and like especially in school, like not just like outside school  but in school definitely, just knowing everyone and feeling like welcomed and accepted but it's, it bothers me but it doesn't bother me as much as how I thought it would bother me, like if someone says something, you know, yeah, I'll get really pissed off but I'll start thinking about other things, you know, I'll walk it off and I'll be like, whatever, you know, I'm going to, I'm the, I shouldn't even be in school, this is, that's dumb, like people will be so like obnoxious and I'll try that but at night, I mean I definitely get into like an argument with my mom at least once a day, twice a day, maybe my dad—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, my sister once in a while, my, um, you know, my good friend [NAME OTHER], you know, the girl that was here, with the blonde hair, before, like we're really good and, you know, once, you know, I told you like, I don't know if I told you but sometimes with like my friendships I feel really like controlling and, you know, I just want things my way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I want to do something and I get angry but I think that, see I think that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't have any male friends that are decent to you at all in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have, well, I don't have any girls or guys in the school really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean but there's the 2 that came with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well that, she, she is from, my mom plays bowling with her mom—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For like a long, no, volleyball with her mom for a long time but she is someone who actually used to hang out with, and there's like a lot of different big groups of people that I used to hang out with 2 years ago or 3 years ago and she was from one of the groups where, you know, it was mostly guys but like it was mostly like, you know, everyone coming over my house, trampoline, pool, like going out, like, you know, smoking weed once in a while, she never did that but like that's, that was, they were those kind of kids, like the skating  like kind of thing, like riding and stuff and she, she was a part of some of the girls for like, sometimes we used to like, you know, fool around and play like spin the bottle and stuff like that and I kind of got like attached to her, not like, not so much as like that but like so much as like she was still calling, she was like one of the few people that still called me this year and, you know, asked  how I was doing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, said, hey, you want to go catch a movie or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, you know, I'm going to take what I got and try not to get so upset, you know, I'm not that popular anymore and blah, blah, blah but I'm, like for the most part, I'm fine with a couple of friends but sometimes, you know, it really does effect me that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I'm not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, let's see, let's see if she's here and we'll—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't even know I had to be in the room with her, I really don't like being in the room with her.  Like just like the way she like, it makes me really feel uncomfortable but I'm just saying like I only had one therapy appointment so far, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the main part, this whole thing with therapy, like I really like, like my few close friends, like I don't really tell them everything, like completely and like the main point of this was like to kind of like be able to talk to someone and like tell them like everything that's on my mind and kind of like ask for help with a couple things and I only got one appointment so far, so that was the main thing with like therapy with like depression, like some things I wasn't happy about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you need, you need to go some more and see if it's going to be good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know but every, my, the principal at my school is like, you know, you really need to, I mean it's like really, it's kind of offending a little, like you really need to focus on your mental health right now and medication, you know, with my experience is necessary for you and stuff like that and I'm just like, okay, well, you know, my mom, my dad is like kind of like more like, you know, my mom is more like, oh, medication, like, you know, screw the Adderall, let's go with anxiety and depression or just don't take anything at all and we'll see how you do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I really prefer to met with her with you here so everyone knows, you know, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let me just get my drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's right here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to tell [NAME OTHER] we'll be a couple more minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because I only have a few more minutes actually.  Well, you know, I looked at it sideways.  I don't sense that he has clinical depression at this time, in other words—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No problem.  In other words, you know, I explained to him that when someone has depression they lose enthusiasm, things don't seem interesting, they don't, they lose desire, interest, pleasure in things, their energy is effected, their appetite can be effected, their sleep can be effected, all of these things can be effected.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, not for every second of every day but most of the time—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean it, when people are in a period of depression, most of the time they're not really, you know, they can get out of it themselves occasionally but they're not happy, they're not enjoying things, they lack drive.  He doesn't describe that.  He more describes that he is interested in school, he is interested in going to college, you know, he is motivated, he's applying himself with this SAT class.  He talked to me about he needs to get extended time because he's not finishing the test but I think he has a very tough gig because, you know he was out of the school for a while, now he's back in the school, he gets some shit from people and, you know, he doesn't, usually senior year, even kids that you didn't like that much you get along with because you're all seniors, you're all graduating, you kind of pull together and so forth and he's not really a part of that, you know, he's really been plucked out and then plucked back in and, uh, I think it's a tough year for him and that's what I'm hearing is, you  know, what makes it hard for him, that, not that, it's almost the opposite of what usually, usually kids like to hang out with their friends but they don't, they're not that interested in school, he's almost saying the opposite, he's interested in school but he doesn't have a lot of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What about the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sorry, let me just, I know, I told, I mean when were describing like actual like depression and stuff, I was asking him like well what does it really mean and he said it's like, and I asked him, like is it kind of like, you know, if everything is going just even okay, not, it doesn't have to be like going great in your life or something but you're just still for some reason unhappy, you can't really, you don't really know why and it's just kind of this thing where, you know, you can't help it or anything but, but I feel like, you know, I'm not, you know, I am depressed some of the time but it's like, you know, in the morning, you know, it kind of, I told him like it's hard for me because I just, um, the school, like I'm so used to like, you know, going, driving to school  with [NAME OTHER] and, you know, driving with all these people and like meeting after school with everyone and going to all these different places and I see half these kids and they pretend I don't even exist and some of them even like, you know, say something like really like, some kid, my old friend, he was not really like my good friend, obviously, but he called me like a crack  head like, you know, with him and his friends as I was walking down the stairs and he was walking up and I kind of just try to like, you know, let things slide but some things like kind of like, you  know, upset me, especially when I go home and like I bump into something on Facebook or whatever where everyone has like all their pictures from like this party and that party and all these friends are getting together and, you know, most of them I used to hang out with and it's like, you know, I just feel like I'm, like look at me like looking at the computer like looking at all this, like kind of like the outside and I told him that usually like at night or in the morning I'll have anxiety, like I don't have anxiety in the afternoon, even like late afternoon, it's like, you know, I'm about to get ready for bed, if like something happened or, you know, like I told him that with like mood swings and stuff, like I get angry easily and me and you fight a little, like a couple times a day, sometimes it's big, sometimes it's not but we still have like, you know, back and forth things and then daddy, you know, it's just, you know, it's constant but I don't, I don't like, you know, like I don't, I don't know, like I don't feel, I don't know, I mean I don't have anxiety attacks all the time but when I do, like it feels like, it feels like it has to because of something because I know that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're anxious about going to school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably, that's the most part, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So what are we going to do about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I know on Fridays and today, like I don't feel anxious at all, I didn't feel anxious at all because I know it's the last day before—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What do we do about that, that's the question?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get so anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, it's a tough problem.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like on Sunday, that's when I couldn't, that's when I didn't, you know, Sunday especially sometimes, you know, stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, you have to work through it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He only has a half a year of school left.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right and he only has half days, he gets out early—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He'll just have to tolerate—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I don't know what more you really can do, I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean you can talk to us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can't, we can't get kids to be decent if they're not decent kids.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't want to start or anything like that but I'm just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I don't mean trying to get kids to like him—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like in trouble or anything if they say something.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's past that, I mean I'm not trying to do that.  I'm worried about him.  I'm worried about how he gets himself anxious on a Monday morning and, you know, what, like he's describing, you know, he's already talked to me about the kids, that they don't talk to him anymore, they don't like him and, you know, he begged us to come back to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I didn't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought it was going to be almost the same thing without all the stupid drugs and stuff, like I thought, you know, I was going to have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to have the same friends.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm not blaming you, I'm just letting you know, you know, we didn't force you to come back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but I was excited about coming back.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know you were, I know and now he's disappointed, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he didn't know how these kids were going to be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Neither did i.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't think like, I don't know, like the nurse was like, like one of the two times I had like kind of, I felt like a lot of anxiety and school, and kind of like probably like on a Monday or even like a Tuesday sometimes, I don't know, but I don't usually feel it in school as much, sometimes like I'll get, I don't know, a headache or something but like the nurse is like, you know, I told her that, you know, I don't know, I was just, I was feeling really like not right and like, you know, stuff like that and she goes, well, you know, you should  really think about like, you know, some type of medication, ask your doctor or something for when these times do happen and I'm like, I don't,  I don't know anything about medication but I definitely wouldn't want to be on something, I don't know, if anything, like during the night or something, like anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My guess is that the, the nurse herself is probably on something for anxiety or depression, you know, and that's why, that's not a typical response from a school nurse that, tell your doctor to be on medication.  In other words, look, obviously, it's what I do all day but I try and fit it exactly to the person, so it seems at this moment and everything could change but it seems at this moment that the Adderall is appropriate because you're having attention, it's not causing any problems but it does help you concentrate better and there's no debate in the medical community that when kids have inattention that we try and treat them with medicines that allow them to focus and concentrate and, you know, work up to their potential, so that we're pretty comfortable with.  I don't, at this moment, see that we ought to give you an antidepressant or an anti—anxiety medicine, I'd rather see you work more with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  You have a lot that you're dealing with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even when I have like an attack though or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because he can give you some strategies to deal with that, you know, I mean not everyone who has anxiety symptoms is on a medication.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Who is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that who he, he saw?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know his name.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, [NAME OTHER], he's not a doctor, he's a social worker.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't say his name.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's a therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, the therapist.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'm sorry, um, because, uh, there's innumerable ways to deal with anxiety, you know, like people do yoga and relaxation exercises and other kinds of exercise and, you know, there's like numerous things, medication is only one of them and in a young kid, it's not the first thing I'd want to do, the first thing I'd want to do is teach him how to cope with things better and give him a little coaching and education and strategies and, you know, practice and everything and very possibly he wouldn't need to be on medicine.  If someone has severe constant symptoms of depression or severe constant anxiety attacks then, yes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you mean by severe?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, like incapacitating where they can't leave the house because they're so, you know, gripped by anxiety or something like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is that how you feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, I usually, I usually end up going out somewhere, like to [NAME OTHER]'s or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think the first order of business here would be for him to continue.  He only met with a therapist once, get that started, we're heading to Christmas break, you know, have him see him a few times, you know, see where you get, um, we're going to continue to meet, if, if the symptoms get worse and you really can't cope with them then, of course, we could treat you but at this moment, I think that would be the first thing to do, you know, it would be like, you know, what do you do when you're hungry, do you build a restaurant, no, you know, you get something to eat, so you do the simple things first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like when I, when I hang out with like, you know, with like a friend or something, I kind of, I kind of like, I don't really, I don't feel anxious then, I don't really feel anxious like ever when I'm with, when I'm with like her, like you know how like I made, I went to her house Saturday night—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was all night, we were just, you know, like that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's more situation—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just I have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you see what he's saying, he's saying that you need to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but I don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Get out and do that more often.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but I don't feel like I until I, until I'm done with high school, I don't feel like it'll, it'll really, I'll really be able to like, like be like completely well and like for the most part be done with like any anxious or depressing feelings because I'll still be, I'll still be going to school, like I don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a social situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I just, it's hard for me to handle it, it really is, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It has nothing to do with academics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so maybe that needs to be the focus when you talk to the therapist about how to best deal with the situation because it's, it's an adversarial situation, you know, he's in a situation where, you know, there's always some jerks and he's not getting the benefit of the doubt, he's not saying, hey, you're back, he's getting like, oh, you know, this other kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Adderall, I was having a big conversation with him yesterday because I, it was the first time I went online to look at the side effects—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I was kind of taken back by the different side effects because sometimes he complains about different things, headaches and anxiety and, um, tremor.  The other day he was saying his hands were shaking and his knees were shaking and social inept—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would say, I would say this—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Concerns.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If Adderall were causing these side effects, it would correlate with when he takes it or when he doesn't take it, you know, certain side effects would be when he took it, like if he took the Adderall, an hour or 2 later if he was tremulous maybe then it's, it's peaking too high and we have to look at that but to the best of his ability to tell me, he said he doesn't feel that it's causing problems and he feels that it's more reactive to stuff when it goes on at school, then he comes home and you and he pick a fight with each other and so forth and so on, so, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I usually, I'm usually happy, I'm usually a lot happier in the afternoon, I usually feel like because I'm always, I always have come home, I'm like, hi mom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because you come home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but we have to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then you have to figure out how, with school how you have to deal with it really because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean I'm not, it's just, no, no—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We'll have to talk to your principal again and explain some things, maybe they can figure out something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like sometimes, I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he's been very supportive, the principal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not all the time in school though—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just, I don't know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is there a possibility, um, in the next week or so for, you can write a letter, um, stating his situation because I'm trying to go a different route with this, uh, getting him extra time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what do you need me to do?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, just maybe an explanation of his anxiety, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I mean, that's not going to help.  What's going to help, to the best of my understanding, is, you know, you had that psych, neuro—psych testing—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They need like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, this guy really has ADHD and he really needs these minutes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, I think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Whatever you think the letter should say, how's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I can, I can write—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] from the psychiatrist, I'll have that from you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'll, I'll get a letter from the therapist and then I'm going to be dealing with the superintendent of schools.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so I can write a supportive letter that I am treating for ADHD and he has shown response to medicine, I can do that.  Can you give me the results from the neuro—psych test?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They assumed that just because, you know, they, everyone says, oh, you have so much better of a chance if you weren't on medication but the medication, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Who says that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of people say, oh, remember, remember, even with, um, the child study team, they said well he is on medication so, you know, it's different with his ADHD because, you know, the whole—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because you're performing now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, yeah, because there's something, it's not like I don't have medication and I still have this bad ADHD but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] timing and everything, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does the person who did the testing, he said that he's a slow reader—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't need him anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, no, I can—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The child study team didn't test me.  I'm a slow reader, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, now, I don't know, did they say tough, you're a slow reader, a slow reader and you'll get a bad score or did they say that they will give some extra time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of that, I don't know what the answer is.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I still haven't gotten a response from the college.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't drop [NAME OTHER] off because I didn't have any more gas left and I put the $10 that you gave me [INAUDIBLE].  Sorry, I didn't want to be late for this meeting.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I asked her to stay with me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I'd really, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I gave you the change from 2 or 3 days ago or whatever but, you know, that's the only thing I had in my tank for 2 or 3—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, we have to also think about trying to find a job too, I feel like that would help too.  I want that back and make you give me the receipt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it brand name Adderall or is it, um, the generic?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's, the generic is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Amphetamine Sulfate?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what it is?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I can't stop my phone from ringing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I'm going to stop this.</p>

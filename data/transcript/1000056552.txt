<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0518-014, Client 0518 -014; Session No. 9, Session No. 9. February 12, 1970 - I'm sorry 1971, Session No. 9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me get the door. So how was your trial?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No kidding. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Nope. I mean, yeah, I'm not kidding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, marvelous. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a really great lawyer. She was just, pretty straight on and I think she ended up making a deal with the DA or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A deal with them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you just get probation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got something called court supervision which is the lightest thing you can possibly get. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see; not even probation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and that means that in a year if I don't get caught doing anything it comes off my record. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She had to really work for it. I mean, apparently the judge does whatever the DA wants him to do, basically. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So she rapped with the DA before the trial and I think she sweet talked him. I don't think she paid him or anything but sort of sweet talked him or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, that's great. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's pretty strange to divide court with women on one side and men on the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yes, that was women's court. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And they had these incredible matrons. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, those matrons. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The matrons, like I had the full work over when I was arrested and I was put in the lock up, I can't remember if I told you about that, but it was just incredible. I don't know what species they are but they are definitely not human, and they are certainly not women. And then beside that, the whole play was super weird, except for the other thing is that it wasn't a play at all. There were all these women who were getting fucked over. And they let in the people who were in the lock up overnight and these women were just incredible people. And the thing is, I felt like I dressed up, I put stockings on and shoes, and I haven't worn stockings since high school and I haven't worn shoes since like two years ago; I either wear boots or sandals. And I really felt like I was kidding somebody, basically myself, but it felt pretty unreal. </p>

<p>2:49</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you felt kind of dirty about it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I felt like I was cheating because these women would walk up, like these hookers would walk up, and she would look like a hooker. She had her hair piled high and sexy and she would walk up to the judge and stand there, and she was being who she was, and I was like in this pretty little dress that I bought to go to college teas and never wore it because by the time I got to college I decided I wasn't going to do that anymore. I felt pretty stupid being in there with stockings and shoes and all these women were being whatever they were, basically because they didn't even have a second chance. It was pretty bad - I felt really bad about that. But I didn't feel very bad about getting off so I guess I am pretty hypocritical. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the whole deal of feeling hypocritical and you got off and you are glad about that but you don't quite respect yourself for the way you are glad over it or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, I'm not exactly, not exactly. Well, yeah maybe. It just seemed as like there were all these women who didn't have lawyers, you know, all these people who didn't have lawyers. And if they had a lawyer they were these fat cat lawyers who didn't care if they got off or not they just wanted their money; and they want to squeeze people for more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were privileged. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I was privileged to have this hip, young, female; and she was like super. She is white but has an afro and big earrings and a flowered dress and is really young; about your age. And really bright, super eloquent, and just aced at the judge. But all these other women were ill represented or - and I kind of felt bad. Especially because I wasn't really paying for it; I mean she isn't going to charge me any money just whatever I can give her is fine. I was feeling lousy and kind of spaced when I walked here but I don't feel so bad now. How are you? </p>

<p>5:18</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm all right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a really ugly day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mind the day. I feel a little unhappy. You felt spaced when you came in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, then you said hello and I didn't. I just woke up too. I like didn't go to sleep until about four in the morning. I had this really icky dream that lasted on and on and on. It wasn't really a nightmare it was just an unpleasant dream and I knew I was dreaming or that I was dreaming it and I would say, "Oh gee, I need to wake up because this is really getting ridiculous and horrible." And I would try and wake up but then the dream would have something interesting in it so that it would draw my attention and I wouldn't wake up. So I was like teasing myself into staying sleeping. And I was like, "Why do I have to contend with that kind of shit when I am sleeping too." So finally I woke up around noon. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that plant is in bad enough shape already. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That plant is dying too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That one didn't get enough water during vacation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What kind is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's an avocado. It used to be really big. Maybe you remember, it use to be over here and it was really huge.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. When you first came in it was over there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Had you been growing it since it was a seed?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, somebody else did. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 7:29) Yeah, I feel like I've got a cold and just kind of blah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe one thing, you know a couple of sessions ago you brought up two things, you said about the tapes and you said that Emma felt that her confidentiality had been violated and also about the time lineup. Should we talk more about either one of those? </p>

<p>8:26</p>

<p>PATIENT: We can, I guess we can. I don't know. The timing thing I was dealing with like, thinking that I might leave right, like if I leave at the end of this quarter, so then that's cool. I have enough sessions left so that I can see you till the end of the quarter and then if I leave, then it's okay; right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I won't have to see Rene if I don't want to see Rene. And I will be making that move away rather than being told that I can't see him. So I haven't said that out loud until just now but that has been running through my head. I keep trying to figure out, well I have 15 sessions left and if I have to see you twice a week then that will be cool. That is one way of not dealing with it at all probably. But it is slightly soothing in that it doesn't feel like rejection so much if I leave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because the other way, like being told you can't see me; that is like rejection. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, for sure. Especially because in some way I want you to say to them, "Well, she really needs to talk to me," and I expect you to try and do that even though you're not suppose to. First of all, I know you can't do that, but second of all, I'm scared to find out if you would or wouldn't. I mean like it is all hypothetical and that kind of stuff is going on and if you said, "Well, you can't leave." Then that would make me feel like she's completely professional and why can't I get this, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is kind of like a test of my strength and the genuineness of my feelings for you whether or not I'm willing to do something I'm not supposed to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, because that's always, like that is really ridiculous but through my whole life I've always gotten in some way whatever I've wanted. I've always gotten into classes that were closed, now I got out of this court thing. I've just always - and it doesn't always happen that I always get what I want like that apartment situation and my having to go to therapy, it is not like that, but I always get bureaucratic type things looked at in my favor, and I am really spoiled that way, like I expect it in some way because I've always been able to connive my way in or out of something. And it is all part of my parents being Jewish too. I mean they like, bred me with that kind of egoness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That kind of the "ego-ness"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay, I see what you mean. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think of myself as an important person to argue for myself and say you should let me into this class. Just that "blah, blah, blah." So when someone doesn't recognize that it makes me not special, which is a big thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're special? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always avoided that. It is like the root where all this stuff comes from. </p>

<p>12:35</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have the impression that it was important too but say a little more about how it is the root because... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have so much to say. Well, I don't even know where to begin. It's like wanting to feel special and having to feel special is just this gigantic thing. It's always been my motivating force; I mean it purveys everything. Like I mentioned before about how I dress, about not being inconspicuous. Just like I wear clothes and not anything particularly fancy but just something that no one else would have and really bright colors because I can't stand not being noticed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not being recognized. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and just always in my relationships with people, if they don't think I am special and they just like me and then if they don't think that I am a special person then I feel crushed. I have to be this special person that people remember after they met me in order to feel even comfortable. I can't just be this like, "Yeah, she's okay." Then I feel like that's negative. And just in how I know that I want to come off to people as special. I don't have to be the nicest person around or the prettiest person or anything like that I just have to be really special which is - and that is part of it, in some way I believe it and in some ways I don't believe it. And the part of me that believes it is the part that can walk into classes that are full and not be registered and be able to stay. I can talk my way passed anybody almost. The part that doesn't believe it is the part that is always having to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part that doesn't believe it is the part that is always having to do that? Oh, I see. Like keeping on having to test to make sure that you still are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and also, you know, I mean I don't feel like "the" special person I don't feel like it is this completely singular thing I've kind of always had this theory about this rule for special people, which are the people that I love. I guess almost everybody thinks about it in those terms but I really think about it in terms of special being more interesting than other people. </p>

<p>16:11</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like these special, crazy, people in the apartment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and all across the country where I've traveled and stuff it's like - and it's been validated somewhat by other people who look up to a bunch of people. And also there is this network really. Like I haven't gone anyplace for a long time and I have met people or who know my people. I don't know, it's really strange I don't think - when I started to get into women's stuff I started to think about it and then I put it away and never used it. Like women's stuff really has held my head so that I can face a whole bunch of icky things that I was doing and I do. Things like making a group of special people is just like a very unfair and ridiculous thing. Every person is a whole complete person and when you meet them and get to know them each person is really full. And it was really hard to learn that, especially because I've been grooming this whole other thing in my head. Like my women's group is really hard for me to handle. The first class was a rap group and there were about five girls in it that I really didn't like, they weren't people that I would have chosen. I wouldn't have chosen to be friends with them or to spend time with them at all. And it was really hard to overcome that thing of, "Ewww, they're icky people." It took me a long time to, I mean, nobody else knew except for me and I would say outwardly I was trying really hard but it took me until about three weeks ago, really since the beginning of the first quarter, to really start getting into them as people and letting them be as full and as magical as anybody else. In some ways still I know that I wouldn't choose them but I really respect them and appreciate them a whole bunch. But it was like a complete struggle to do that. </p>

<p>Another thing is that sometimes gets to me like Emma, Emma doesn't strive to be special, Emma strives to be good and there are some things where she is into (inaudible 19:20) but I would rather be special than good; which makes me think that it's not a very good or there is something suspect about that quality. It is okay to be icky or bad as long as you are special. I also don't know what the definition of it is either, it is just this kind of amorphous quality. </p>

<p>19:44</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sort of from - it has a lot to do with being sensitive, but not just that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sensitive and crazy and a little imaginative. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, having some magic. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I got some kind of energy from that, just like this kind of person that you can touch in all these different places and every time you touch them something new and more would come out. Something is like always exciting about them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like never boring. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like there are outer recesses that you never got to and when you touch them a little bit more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you never get bored with her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd never get bored with her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel cut by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well I feel like you are leading me. I feel a little bit like I was saying all sorts of stuff on a general level and then all of a sudden you crept in and got me there. It was good and I'm glad but it is just kind of like - and also you said her. And all those things that you know and I have been sitting here telling you all sorts of things for a long time and I shouldn't be surprised that you know because I want you to, but also it is just surprising that you said that. </p>

<p>Also I did a really weird trip this morning. I woke up at about 12 and nobody was in the apartment everybody had gone. And Diane had gone - Diane went to New York this morning to visit her boyfriend Jobe, who was just here. He left just a couple days ago, he had been here for two weeks and now she decided to go visit him. And I felt pretty distanced from her and I know there is a lot there but we are pretty distanced. And we're much easier with each other, we can be in the same room and there isn't an incredible amount of tension. I mean I have had nice times in the company of other people and stuff and I felt a bunch more relaxed. And I haven't felt like I went back into a shitty way of being (inaudible 22:57). And I like who I was being when I was around her. But today nobody was home and I went into her room and like, I just sat there and looked at all of it. And it is not a particularly nice room, it's just a room. She hasn't decorated it all that nicely but I like looked at all of it and I really just sat there like really loving it. And I hadn't let myself feel that in that way and I just felt really strange and I almost felt like I was in an old boyfriend's room, that kind of nostalgic feeling. And I just sat there till, like I had to hitch to get here on time, because I just spent some time looking at all her books and her desk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scary; it's a little weird to have that kind of feeling for her like you have for an old boyfriend. </p>

<p>24:02</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem like you are sort of looking that one over or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just, another thought flashed across, I was thinking just that when I was talking about, when you asked me about the number of sessions and the time and stuff. I knew that I didn't want to think about it so I like put both of those things away and I knew that when I - and then just now I realized when I said it I didn't give you any time available to find out what you would have done or what you would do. Because I am scared and I said it really quick so you wouldn't have a chance to say anything about it because I didn't want to hear that you couldn't do it. Because somehow if I say it then it is not for sure but I suspected the worst so that is better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get use to it a little bit. . </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah; but if you said it then. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel stabbed or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I also realized what I didn't want to talk about. There is something about privacy that I care on and off about. I mean the thing - I have complete faith in that you would be, or it wouldn't cross my mind that you would be confidential or not but just the whole idea of having tapes sometimes that bothers me, and sometimes it doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I did want to say something about that but you know you are in the research project so that the tapes go with the project. Did you know that? And you signed a release and I wondered if you remembered what the release said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like they would be used for lectures or something or they would be used or listened to but no names would be involved. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, except for that all names on the tape are involved. And just that my friends are in, Diane is in sociology and just things like - it's a graduate student thing isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The person who is doing the research is a graduate student. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The project, I mean who - if I think about it I get upset but when I don't think about it I don't get upset. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the upsetting part?</p>

<p>28:29</p>

<p>PATIENT: The upsetting part is that somebody who knew me or knows the people that I am talking about would hear it. And I would feel really revealed, you know, I would feel revealed and it took me a long enough to trust you, much less, there is just no possible way I could feel comfortable saying this to people that I don't know. And I have listened to tapes in class too, you know, therapy session tapes. And I guess that's also the other part about it, it could be Diane, Holly, Jennifer, (inaudible 29:27) and all those people are in the class right and we listened to somebody's tapes, now what if that was my tape. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sort of the fantasy of sitting there and then all of a sudden you hear your tape come out of the tape recorder. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, stop it. I would die. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No ones tape is played in class until after they've left campus for five years. And these tapes probably - the chances are they will never be played in any class setting and if - I mean they just wouldn't be, it would be unethical to play them in class if you were still on-campus. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just realized, when you said that, that my body got really tight, in my back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About the tapes? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you want to talk to the research guy who heads the project you might be able to get that crossed out of your release because I don't think he needs - I don't think he needs all of the release. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can get one crossed out?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The class part, or I don't know what you can get crossed out but you would have to talk to him about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe I'll see about that; because also Emma told me horror stories. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sort of upsets me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But that was also long time ago. And she didn't tell me recently, she told me when she was going to the Education (ph. 31:37) Center how many years ago and it wasn't in relation to me having therapy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did her tapes get messed with? </p>

<p>31:46</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure if it was her tapes or just stuff, but she was like all completely involved in the center and she knew all the people there, and her father knew them and I think what ended up happening is that people - or it was gossip and a couple of important things got to be gossiped. And she heard them through somebody else and then flipped out and never came back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's terrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But also everything that she told me like Kirby was, kind of, one of her mentors. She lost a really good friend of hers. (inaudible 32:41) just simply respects you. And I don't know, I have a funny feeling that - I don't know. Kirby and I have been ideologically fighting for maybe five-years and I know everything about him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't gossip to me about him because I don't know him anything about him and it really wouldn't be right somehow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it wouldn't at all. I really respect him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway, there's one more thing, I was talking before about like to go talk to the researcher and you and he should sort of straighten it out and I wouldn't be surprised if you get the class thing crossed out of your release and that is sort of practical. But I also got, I have the feeling about, something about you sort of having like, "I'm okay but I'm sort, I'm okay myself but I'm kind of betraying you by handing you over to some stranger." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is (inaudible 34:28) and that is like in it. I mean, just kind of that I want, I just want it to be as big as this because that's all it is, that's how it feels to me and that is the only way I can say it. So somehow having it seen out there, then all of a sudden it's something - but that's also all mine, all my choice. I mean, I wanted to see somebody. And I was feeling bad enough about that too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, right; but that doesn't mean that you like it to put it mildly. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Also, I guess there's something else that's been on my mind. What were you going to say? You tell me then I will finish what I was going to tell you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I was going on with that, with it being out there it is not just between the two of us anymore. Something about it, almost like somebody finding out that there was a peeping Tom or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. At first when I came I wanted - I wanted just to be friends with you I didn't understand the therapy relationship at all and I was uncomfortable with it. And now I feel like I have more, like, grown into it and now it's like it's really this special thing and it's just you and me, right, and there is nobody else; except that tape recorder but that's okay because I just stare at it when I get spaced. It's convenient but it certainly doesn't have anything to do with any of the other people. And so now that I can finally start to more accept whatever kind of relationship it is between you and me I certainly don't want anybody else. I mean, part of me is just like...</p>

<p>37:12</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like it is some kind of violation, something that should be private. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I caught myself in my head saying, "Well, it's a little bit like rape." And it was like this little voice and it wasn't a whole lot but then I realized wow, the word rape is just too heavy a word but in some way it must mean that to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I bet that creeped to me too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even want to think about it really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like when you start to think about it, it's like a horror. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly, even to just say it. It is kind of - I deal with a whole bunch of things by not dealing with them. I really have this protective thing. Like when I use to miss the appointments, instead of calling you up and saying, "Oh, wow, I'm sorry." I'd wait a couple days because I didn't want to deal with it. Somehow I figured it would go away and I do that with everything. That is the same way I was doing that like I would hear you say and I would know I had to be here and I would just put up my protective shield and not think about it. Somehow I would have that intellectual place in my head but I certainly wouldn't think about what it meant to me because if I did it would just feel like rape. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like now you're kind of - we have said enough that you can't quite shove it out and you are taking some of it in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a tiny little bit, not whole lot. Enough to get me a little bit scared saying things and it's like, too late. There is also something else. There is something else I want to talk about because I think that I am doing the same thing with you, I'm actually, I'm not thinking about it, I'm putting that protective covering over it saying, "It's okay. It's okay, " when it really isn't. That is that thing I told you about Dexter, that boy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The surgeon (inaudible 40:19) </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I will see him today so when I look out my window he'll be there. I'm going to talk to him before I go there. Because it is one of those things that I'll think is good and I'll go far enough so that I know that unless I do something to untangle myself he is also going to get tangled up. And did I tell you about the letter he wrote me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure.</p>

<p>40:54</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he wrote me this - and it really hit home, I of course lost the letter. I read it once and then lost it. I put it in my book and I went to a women's meeting and lost it. And there is no possible way that I could have lost it between my house and the women's meeting, and I lost it. And it was at a women's meeting and it was this letter that ended with, "I worship you." It was just all these, I mean I have been not sleeping with anyone for all this time so I won't have that kind of or I won't do that kind of trip anymore because that was what I was doing for a really long time. And then I managed not to do it and I tried to straighten up and I wanted to be with somebody again and then all of a sudden I haven't learned anything. I'm doing the same thing I was doing a year ago. And I want someone to tell me that it is really bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want someone to just shake you and make you stop. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of me, I mean, because I don't want to do it but somehow when it is just me and nobody else watching and it is really easy to do. It is really easy to let him love me in this bad way. So I want someone to make me feel guilty and washed or something so that I won't do it because somehow this thing inside me isn't strong enough yet and that is also just a super drag. I mean, I have the stuff in me that says, "No." I mean I obviously have it because I think about it and I tell you. And it makes me feel ick, you know but something else in me says there isn't enough to make me stop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, some how doing it is like what is downhill. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have been good and I haven't been doing it for a long time and it was like, a decision it wasn't like you haven't had the chance. It was very much when I was in any sort of situation with new men I would just be very conscious of not creating that kind of a relationship because it is a creation. There is something that I do to make it happen like that. I consciously don't or haven't done it. And it really feels like I'm losing ground and it was hard fought for. I feel like if I let myself loose a little bit, or let myself want to be with somebody all of a sudden it's back into the whole overly relating to people. And I would never do that, that's the other thing I would never do that to a woman. It's almost like - oh, wow. I never thought about that before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never thought of it that way before. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Somehow there is a basic less respect for men because I just would never do that to woman. I wouldn't waste my time. It's not - I wouldn't waste her time or mine. If I didn't really like her just a whole bunch and really think she was wonderful I wouldn't spend time around her and encourage her. I just wouldn't get involved, at all. But somehow I do it with men. I don't know. The other thing that happens is if a woman likes me it doesn't make me respect her any less whereas that happens a lot with men. I wonder if that all has to do with sex? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh dear, maybe it does. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know there is this kind of thing and now I'm embarrassed. I don't know. I guess it has something to do with conquering them. I mean if it is on that level it's conquering somebody and then you don't respect them. I just never have that kind of relationship with women. It just always feels like we are closer as human beings and very seldom does it feel that way with men. Is that regular? Is that regular (laughter). That's classic. Tell me doctor? (laughter) </p>

<p>47:29</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saying something na�ve like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That is such a classic line, "Can you tell me if this is normal, Doc?" You know I would laugh at it if I read it in any kind of novel. I guess, I never talk to anybody about any of this kind of stuff. It feels even weird hearing out loud. I don't even like say it to myself in my head. And then whenever I say something like that I remember, I just got this feeling that I remember that I had before with you is that somehow this wanting to know how you, or what you, thought about it, not even therapeutic, which is kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want me to tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well somehow like, if it's, if you can understand that because you felt that way or if it is important to you. Just like somehow, how you are in relation to them, I guess because it's just hard to say and I haven't said it to anybody because I have never had anybody to say that's terrible or that's okay or I used to be like that or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like something that you haven't squared up with other people. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it has never been in contact with other people before so somehow I want to, I can't explain it real good but I know what I am feeling. And I don't remember feeling that so much in the past couple of times. Because I know at first I really felt like that all the time, I really wanted to know how you - and I guess some of it is just that I have never talked to, I mean the only stuff I talked to, or the only women things I have talked to other women who understand, you know, or who have felt that and it feels weird saying it to somebody who I don't' know how she is understanding it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is sort of like you have to bring it out, before you know it is okay. Like it's one thing to say something and, like, know that, like, it will be received one way and the other person will understand. And it takes some, sort of, like you have to grit your teeth a little. That is how it would be for me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To tell your secrets?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>52:10</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it just feels, I don't know, I guess what makes me feel close to people is when I feel like I understand their experiences and somehow if I understand their experiences even if it is something icky it is not as foreign. It is familiar even when it's an icky experience. And somehow saying stuff like that, that's really important to me, that I'm not sure how I'd feel about, things about women are not things that are talked about a whole bunch. And you feel a little bit guilty and you feel a little bit of those things like am I normal or am I - is there something perverse about all this. And somewhere in me I am convinced it's not but there is just all these years of women not being close to each other to say that there is something perverse about it. I wouldn't talk to Jennifer or any of them and I am really close to her but somehow it's only when I felt this certain kind of, it's not tension, but it's a certain kind of energy between me and another woman have I been able to talk to her about anything and that kind of stuff. And somehow it's the energy that like is circular. Like I can feel her feeling some of it too and I know that it's something that we both understand because we are both in the middle of feeling something. And I haven't necessarily talked about it so it feels funny to be saying it to you but the not funny enough so that I wouldn't say it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm still trying to get a quality of how it feels. Are you unsure? I keep doing how it would be for me and it keeps not being right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of, like after I leave or something you sit there and go, kind of like; can you understand that at all? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think so, sure. Like, "Boy is she weird." Like that. </p>

<p>55: 53</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, weird is not the quite word. Yeah, maybe it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I caught it in the gesture. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you understood what I'm talking about. And I don't, implicit in that is kind of want you to tell me if you know what I am talking about but on the other hand I don't' want to know too. That is part of it too, which I didn't realize. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is not wanting to know? </p>

<p>PATIENT: How is not wanting to know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess - I don't know. I know what it means but I don't want to say it or something. Something that is like a secret or something. Like it is illicit or something and then somehow it would be - I don't know. But all that conception and that feeling it also means that it is crammed full of feeling like there is something wrong with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be having this illicit secret or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, except for, it's a not so - because it isn't - it doesn't feel illicit or secret. Like when I talk to Holly or when I talk to Cathy but obviously they are not my therapist. I mean it doesn't feel any of those ways. I didn't realize that I had so much of a queer feeling about it until I met you. I am laughing at my (inaudible 59:00)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>59:00</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel better than when I came here. It's really nice because talking to you now makes me feel less spaced and I don't feel spaced anymore. Lots of times I have wondered what I would say or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in the beginning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's really good. Tuesday, 2:15? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is there, is it possible I could do it at 12?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm busy at 12, or 11:30 would be all right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have a class at 11:30 -</p>

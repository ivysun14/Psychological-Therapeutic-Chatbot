<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you look a little down, what's up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well since things have been, I stopped seeing [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What happened?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It just was -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly and I told her, okay it's a rut, I might be back, she said fine, whatever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was she in agreement with stopping, did she think -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She also found [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe we should find you someone different though.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's possible.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean did you value psychotherapy?  Was it something that captured your imagination?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I found, you know, I hadn't had a therapist like for twelve years and I went through that whole [DEIDENTIFIED] goo log I felt what we were doing, I pretty much do it all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's called a goo log?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I found I was doing it already and I found it was just, I didn't need it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and I felt there was too much explaining to do and, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  One of the reasons I like the idea of a social worker specifically.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was because services might be an issue with your mom.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And her, you know, and even you and social workers kind of know the ins and outs of getting home health aides and getting hooked up with the system so it's very practical.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I hope you've left the door open for it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh I did, we did, we said, you know -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you can do an appointment or two and she can give you the specifics of I called this agency, go to this appointment.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did, we did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your mom's not there yet, your mom's not there yet but I think at some point, you'll need home health aides.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have anyone coming in to help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, but I mean she's still low maintenance but as soon as I figure out what I'm doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It takes a while to set those things up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It might not be a bad idea for you to at least start it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Start it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Open a case.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For her just, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because I see this as one of the things that potentially destabilizes you, the massive, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm starting to realize, it's starting to drag me down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do feel a little down and I think that's part -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's in addition to the psychological part of watching your mother, watching this happen to your mother.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, there's the day to day of having to be responsible and take care of her.  All right, I saw you [DATE], you were on the Zyprexa 5 mg for ten days, it gave you constipation and eczema.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood lifted so you stopped it.  The Wellbutrin you pushed that, at that point, to 450 for a week, then you pulled back to 175.  Your mood was good, you weren't sad, anxious, or irritable.  You had some of these ideas of reference regarding strangers.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I still have that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A bit of grandiosity, you were getting pleasure; your mother was pretty stable.  Sleep and appetite were fine.  Energy is good, exercising, so we thought in the setting of your kind of chronic psychiatric difficulties</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were in a decent place, your head was above water.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now a month later, how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I started, about a week ago I stopped the Wellbutrin, I wanted to do a fresh start.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why would you do that without calling?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know I should call you, you know, I'm just so used to tweaking these things. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Also, I see no one as frequently as I see you.  Really, you would -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The average is once every three months.  I see you every month -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you can wait until you see me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For us to make changes or just call me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah, I didn't know that was -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now what was your reasoning behind backing off on the Wellbutrin?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's this whole, I thought I could do without it, then I found I can't do without it so I'm going to start fresh and see if I can just stay on the 150.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You stopped it about a week ago?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What was your mood like before that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were doing nice?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On the Seroquel, Wellbutrin combination, things were going well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then I crashed and I realized.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You stopped it and how many days did it take for you to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Crash?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Crash.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Three to four.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what does crash mean?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just couldn't get out of bed, you know, just depressed, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you were sad all the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sad all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you had no energy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No energy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were over sleeping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I couldn't wake up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you overeating?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So your appetite was normal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Normal, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No but just, you know, dark.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any voices?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any paranoid thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's always -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Chronic, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's always there, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But did it get worse, were you getting more referential, more -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, it was</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know what I mean, referential?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's a great term, I didn't know, that's always there too, those are, that's just like my basic -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a given.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's like the part -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's the hardwire.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's the trait, not the state, that's like eye color; I mean it's just -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Part of the wiring.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, whereas the state is depression, not depressed, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I call it rigid [INAUDIBLE], something like that</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  Okay, so you fell into that state</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You scratched your head and said maybe this is related to stopping the Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you restart it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I started it yesterday and already I'm starting to, I just want -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What dose did you go to?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 150.  I want to keep it at 200 because I get a feeling when I go over, you know how sensitive I am to these, the eczema starts, the constipation starts.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Eczema, really, on the Wellbutrin. The Zyprexa gave you eczema.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe it's still, I'm not sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Constipation and eczema, you can't blame them both, you've got to pick one.  We agreed that was Zyprexa.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think it was because before that, you're right, you're right, it was</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So there's no real barrier to raising the Wellbutrin</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I just didn't</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're just reluctant to push</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'll tell you something, something happened, this is really good, I weighed myself, I got a check up, this year I lost 45 pounds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I'm not on the blood pressure medicine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you lose 45 pounds?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That vegetarian stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the way, that's the secret.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 45 pounds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I really know what I'm doing.  I've been doing this vegetarian.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It ain't 5-10 pounds, 45 pounds</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's massive.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I had this girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's like thirty percent of your body weight.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's massive.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, in my [AGE] I had this girlfriend who was macrobiotic so she used to feed me this stuff and I used to read all this nutrition stuff so I know the game pretty well so that's what, I just haven't used it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to keep going?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still losing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know what's good too is my bad ankle, I can walk like two to three miles, it doesn't bother me because the weight is gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I figure -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your heart must be happier also.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, and your energy level.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I feel more young, younger.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Terrific.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I said, wow, I'm off the blood pressure medicine, now I can get off the Wellbutrin, so I was on that jag, you know, and then I was even thinking the Seroquel but now I realized, no way, no way, no how.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not seeing your psychotherapist.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was next on the list.  You're the man.   Maybe I gauged her in comparison to you when I, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well but that's not fair, that's apples and oranges.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's not fair.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You can't help compare, can you, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but I'm your psychopharmacologist, I'm not your therapist.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I know, but I realize most of it is, the problem solving, you know, I can do it, you know I can do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When did you make the decision to stop with her?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About two weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it was before you stopped the Wellbutrin?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It wasn't in a depressed state.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, it wasn't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was more clear eyed but you were jettisoning things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Jettisoning things at that time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She was one of them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But for a month, a month and a half before that I was thinking to myself, this is going around in circles, this isn't going anywhere, let's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what kind of things were you working on then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was just, I feel like I was, I told her I don't want to come here and feel like I'm pretending, like I've got to make things up, you know, it's not good for me, it's not good for you, so that was my argument, you know, you go in and you just make things up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So you know, it's okay, you know, I might go back -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if you value psychotherapy, we could just find you someone else.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That might be, somebody with more depth or -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like mommy daddy stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not mommy daddy stuff but more, I don't know yet, I'm still trying to figure it out.  I mean she's great for problem solving, she's a great listener but for, I feel like there's a certain level.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She stays on the surface?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I mean on one hand she's really optimist but she's missing the point that, you know, I may be smart, I may have money and everything but it's still been a really bum ride, you know, and she missed that, she missed, you know, I didn't go into the hell, you know, the hell worlds that I've been in but she missed that, she missed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Her experience is more with depressives I think.  I thinks she's not worked with the chronic populations that you've been part of.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh, okay.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Although you've been a, from where you came from, that population, you're almost the best it gets, you know, there are too many barriers to you working [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I want to but I don't know what it is, I know I don't want, that's another reason I'm depressed, the math, I'm finished with that, I'm too old.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Here's an example, this really famous English mathematician, he discovered [INAUDIBLE], being famous, I don't know if you know, he's very famous for it, but he realized, he said by [AGE] you're finished</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> As a mathematician?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And he [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he committed suicide and he was like at [DEIDENTIFIED], he was like the top of the heap.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And why is he finished?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just like it's athletics.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're mind is not [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's why it's very humbling.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, the fields medal, the Nobel Prize, they only give it to people under [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and that's like the, they're aren't, after [AGE], there are no prizes, they give you what's called a, if you reach [AGE], they give you like a [AGE] anniversary, a big conference, I've seen these guys that are [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They restrict it to below [AGE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and this is like the Nobel Prize because the juice, I don't know, the electricity, maybe it's a testosterone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Einstein was creative into his later years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> After [AGE] he was finished.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So he just rode it out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He just rode</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Rode out his earlier insights.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> General relativity, all that, by the time he was [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> By the time he was, he finished his [INAUDIBLE] at [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that when he finished?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, after that, he did alchemy, you know, for forty years, you know, that was it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it's very -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Freud was pretty productive until -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but that stuff is not -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But he got into psycho, he got weirder, he did his best work also in his early years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and he was fascinated by the occult.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In later years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, so I mean -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel like you're burnt out now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you always seem to get so much pleasure from it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is but I'm writing this letter to my friend who's like, you know, mid [AGE] and I'm saying here this is all I've done, you're a baby, I'm throwing him the ball and I'm glad I can have someone, you know, and he'll call me and ask me questions.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He understands what you've done and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And he said it will really help him, your work will help him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and he has more formal training, he has a degree, he's more formal, he's more devoted to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hopefully, he'll acknowledge you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he does, you know, he says you're still the master, you know, he'll call me and ask me questions, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is he a mathematician, is this what he does?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is he going to pursue it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, he's at [DEIDENTIFIED], he's going to graduate school.  He's got a girlfriend who's in astronomy and he said, I gave him all my psychics astronomy, he goes, so he met this girl, he said oh I've got all these astronomy books, she went out and they hooked up and says thanks man.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you got him laid.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he hasn't had a girlfriend in like almost twenty years, he was, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With all this psych crap and I said good, finally.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So is it his girlfriend now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they live together in [DEIDENTIFIED] and everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All from your books.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I've gave him all these great astronomy and gravitation books and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She must be maybe a bit odd herself.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Odd is the wrong word.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, [INAUDIBLE] astronomy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Someone told me there's a new TV show about these two really nerdy</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, what's it called, the big bang or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I haven't seen it yet, I've seen the commercial for it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Smart is sexy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what it is?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's been going around for fifteen years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Anyway.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, okay, so but we're on to the two subjects that -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm depressed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which is, you know, listen, we could shape you up a little bit but you're in the, you know, you're close to the zone.  A relationship, besides your mom -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that would be great.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And a job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Would seem to be the next step and if therapy will help you there then we've got to push therapy but, you know, I would suggest that that's the next place for you to advance.  I mean, we may agree at some point that you just can't make it, you can't get over that barrier for whatever reason and I'm -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'll tell you, it has to do with all that mysticism, that yoga, I think that saved me but that also -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it's not [INAUDIBLE] your relationship.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, from getting more mainstream.  I think it's, it's complicated somewhat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it can't be too complicated.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me in one or two sentences.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hard wired, it feels hard wired to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That, what's hard wired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This desire to do these meditation practices full time, hardcore, you know, it feels, I've been fighting, I mean I've been trying to compartmentalize it, put it under the rug or rationalize it and it's just so hard wired, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You need to meditate?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and just to be involved in a kind of ideology of Hinduism and reincarnation and everything, it's just, it's been there since I was [AGE] I believed in that stuff, since I was a little kid, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how does that interfere with getting a job?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it would have to be connected to some kind of service.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Helping people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ashram advisor.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Something like that -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it's not necessarily a contradiction.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, you're right, you're right, it's just finding the right hooking up with the right everything -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it's no, you know, it doesn't seem to be -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how about a relationship, how does it interfere with a relationship?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I have my eyes on this woman in the building.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, who lives in your building?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, no, no, I'm just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So is she age appropriate?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's a few years older, 10 years, is that too much?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's in the range.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is she good  looking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's good looking, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is she nice to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So do you have chats or, you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet, I have her number, I haven't called her, I mean.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you get her number?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My building, they had a board meeting, they want to build a terrace.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I said, and it's going to cost them a million bucks and nobody is going to use it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I said why don't we go green, why don't we thinking of doing the green thing, you mean a new boiler in a couple years have it running by diesel, look into solar cells, into hydrogen [INAUDIBLE], you know all this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they said no but she was really sympathetic and she had a meeting in her apartment with a few other people talking about it so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And she's single?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so you got to chat with her then, you were at the meeting?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, but I don't know where she is on all this, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean, on all what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, she's given me signals with her, you know, but I don't know, you know, sometimes signals can be ambiguous or I've just got to get the nerve and test it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, how sometimes your radar, you pick up things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That may not -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well you can find a non threatening way to engage her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't face the possibility of rejection full force.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's it, I thought, well call her and say how pissed off I am about this, the co op deciding to go with this terrace and talk to her about, then maybe go out for coffee.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you see how receptive she is on the phone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then follow those cues.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the thing that's mixed is she likes to talk a lot and that either means she's lonely or she likes to talk a lot, so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But for you that's a little, disarming because it takes the pressure off.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's true, maybe she just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you have a bit a social awkwardness too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes you get a little tongue tied.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Phobias.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so if she's filling up void -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm the listener, I'm usually the listener and it's good to find a talker, so you know, we'll see, we'll see what happens.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll be looking forward to hearing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's nice to talk about it to someone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't talked to anyone about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I just, I thought of it last week, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does she have email?  You don't have email do you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because that would be one way.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, less direct I guess, yeah, I'll figure it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you restarted the Wellbutrin yesterday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Pushed it to 150 and you're feeling a little better today.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and next time I'll call you if I do the med change.  I didn't realize, yeah, that's a good idea to call you and talk to you about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so your mood is lifting but, to be honest, it might not lift; I mean it would be nice to see you in a week to make sure that you're better.  If things don't go the right way, give me a call.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I will and I think you've got, my mom is dragging me down, it's starting to drag.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well we'll, is she getting any worse?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No but she's always, she's in bed most of the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it doesn't bother me but it does bother me, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's hard to gauge now because you're just coming out of this few day depression from being off the meds but before all that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you very down about -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You weren't?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's especially when you're depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That gets you more depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I think that's, you're right, I've got to start thinking about plan B, about getting a life.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, what you've been saying all these months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't want to push you too hard.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, without even, I mean, you have challenges beyond what would seem obvious.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We both know that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's deep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have real challenges.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the fact that you're managing them without much help.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is very impressive.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know and so I wouldn't want you to feel bad that you're not, you don't have like a normal life.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like you know, you really, for what you, for the deck you got dealt.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're doing well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you're functioning near the top of your range, near the top of your range.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The best I can handle with what I've got.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, but my job is to push you, you know, a little more.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, push you further.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you make it, you will, if not, you'll settle back at this level.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I just see you in the situation with your mom as potentially very challenging psychiatrically.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And increasing</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, the challenge will be increasing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is, it is, it's, you know, I can't go anywhere if I want to go out of the city, so that's a big thing, that's a big thing, no vacations, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you want to go like upstate New York.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just a weekend, you know, I can't even.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe it is time to start setting up those systems.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That safety net or whatever, I think it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what's available.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Social workers would know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I think they have people who would come for, you know, whenever, I mean society does not expect you to stay home all day with your mom.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Society has systems to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When she was in the hospital, they gave me a bunch of cards and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I've got a bunch of cards.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got time on your hands, you're not doing math all day long.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So now you could start following up with that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, now I've got the time and the motivation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, if there's any change, any problem, please give me a call, all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I will, that's understood, thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, take care.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll see you in a few weeks.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thanks again.</p>

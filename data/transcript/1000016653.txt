<p>COUNSELOR: Therapist Dayton, Interview 20, April 8, 1971, Client Number 1429-110, Interview Number 20. Therapist Dayton.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh man... (sighs) I took the day off today. I've been running around all day. Phew...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is your first chance to relax. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just didn't go to work and then I was running (inaudible 00:44) all over the place. It's so windy out that I was sitting downstairs reading and I think I fell asleep. I was down there for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I looked at my watch and I felt like... So this is number twenty now, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is number twenty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I started this group thing on-well it's a group class on women.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The one on Willow Brook that you told me about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this is at another one. I'm taking two of them. The teaching class I had to drop because I didn't fill out-there's a form we have to fill out for the State to pay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. And they didn't fill it out...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was not, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you dropped the one at Staples (ph 1:37), is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. The one at Staples I'm taking on my own money. And the one on Monday I'm taking over at Community Campus. But the one on Tuesday, which is the teaching class, I think it was that month-the month when I was gone was the month we should have filled out a form and I didn't do it, so I dropped that. But anyhow, a weird kind of thing happened that could-we had to pick-well, first of all, there's eleven girls and just two guys in class. I think there's two more coming. But it's real imbalanced as far as that goes. But anyhow, we had to pick a person-it was the second time. We had to pick a person or, you know, it's the second thing we did. It's supposed to be class on communication. And we had to pick someone we felt negative toward or we felt you know, like, zero toward. And so I picked this one girl and then the instructions were that we were supposed to sit-this was before I had even...you know I had never even spoken a word to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm [03:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said we were supposed to sit and look at each other without talking for a minute or two. And I was-I didn't think it would be so bad-but when I was sitting there, I was really weird because I started-I was very uncomfortable and I started-well, I laughed a little bit. But it was very-I started getting sweaty and I put my hands behind me. I really didn't know what to do with the whole thing for that length of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible 3:48]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It was really embarrassing. And I think it was because of her eyes that I couldn't-I could look at her eyes for awhile, but then I got embarrassed about it. I don't know, I mean it's-well that whole thing, you know, like in the individual places like here, I can think about things more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm going to say something, I think about it. There, I don't get the-I don't get the chance to think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then, you don't really get to understand why there either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, from here, I think I can see a lot of different things that might be going on with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But nothing, nothing seems to change within me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like today-like I really wanted to get up for work, but last night I was gone-I haven't gone to the bars for about two weeks, but last night I was down there-and I got, you know, half bombed, wound up going home with this girl I didn't really want to go home with. Fell asleep over at her place and then I got up this morning I had to get my car and when I got my car, then I didn't want to go to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was like I really didn't care again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Same thing that happened before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It hasn't happened for a long time, but it happened this morning. And it's like when I-it's like, then I've got to go out and I've got to think of-and it was a nice day, to boot-and I didn't want to go. Then I have to go out and think about things, think how I'm going to get things back together again. [6:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I can, you know, I can pick up again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've actually-like now, I feel like I'm a thousand miles away from everything. I can't, I just can't even bring myself down here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's because the wind was blowing in my face all night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's nicer to be outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like the things that are most difficult for me to understand...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I can't-they still are difficult to understand. I know a little about what they are, but-and that's how I change them, I guess. </p>

<p> Like a thing I really don't understand now is why when things were going very well with Kathleen, why I started dating Jane?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't under-that I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't prefer to get trapped with Kathleen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but now I kind of wish that I wouldn't be in this situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want-what situation do you want to be in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would rather just be dating Kathleen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then, cut Jane out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there's only one problem there. She's missed her period now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that-I don't know how I got into this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you feel trapped with Jane.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I wouldn't. She's only missed it like a week. And she's been irregular, too. But I-what I don't understand is why -it was almost like before I could settle down with anybody-I had to see Jane again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you saw her...and now maybe you've impregnated her. [9:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't even say that-that's-that I don't want to see her anymore now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why is it you feel that you have to settle down with either one of them? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel like I'd like to date one. You know, just one girl for awhile. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See what that-try that on and see what it feels like, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because it boggles my brain. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that, right now, you can't do it because you don't want to cut either one of those two out, really. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Except I know it will come to a head. Irregardless of what happens with Jane physically. It'll come to a head eventually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I leave for a weekend-I didn't see Jane all the time-but if I leave for a weekend, you know, that will probably-I'll have to make a decision then. I think somebody will make me make the decision. What I don't get is why-like things were going along pretty nice-and just right then, when maybe things could have developed and maybe things could have been fairly decent, then I had to go and make sure that I'd be, you know, I'd be out in the middle again somewhere. It's like I have to do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're suspect of these compulsions which take you away from something you say you want. [12:22]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But, it happens with most things. Like, you know, I think I want to be a good caseworker, but then I don't do anything about it or when I do something about it, I'm not consistent about it. It's kind of like a pattern I always make sure-unless whatever it is that makes me, you know, that keeps me from following through on something is (chuckles) what I'm really all about. It's just all very confusing-I don't-something like a feeling of just being very tired with the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless it's just my mood now-maybe because I'm tired. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tired of yourself? Is that what you mean when you say you're tired of the whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm just tired of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shitting around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That, and kind of tired just, you know, like having to fight things all the time. Kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fight yourself all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep putting everything outside of yourself. Fighting things all the time, tired of putting up with it. All this time we're talking about you, aren't we? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you talk about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you were, but in a way which made it seem to me it wasn't just you you were thinking of or you weren't giving yourself full responsibility for those things. You weren't talking that much in terms of yourself. You were talking about "it" and "things" and stuff like that. Like circumstances doing things to you rather than you doing things to yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's-well, it's kind of that way. It's like, it's like the part of me that I don't understand-you know, like fouls things up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that's still part of me, but to me, when I look at it later when I get in a situation, then I wonder why I ever did that. [16:28]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I do that-when I wonder about that-it doesn't seem to me to make any sense. I guess in a way I think it is not a part of me, but it's something which I don't understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why it doesn't like feel that much a part of you because you don't have a good hold of it, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was like in this-it's the feeling that-it's like the stranger part of me that I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I see it sometimes when something happens that forces me just to-it's like another person has said something that isn't me. Which, I don't know, I just call whatever it is the unconscious part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like in this girl-in these group things, I had to introduce my partner to two other people. And I said "This is Diana" and I said it like when you know somebody's name and don't have to think about it-like you really know their name, you know when you introduce somebody. I was positive that's what her name was. And she says "That's not my name. My name's Kelly." And I says, "No, it can't be because I made a note when they were first going around that your name was Diana" and I says "I knew it was your name because usually if I was uncertain, I would have to hesitate and think about it." I says "I knew that seat map was what your name was." Well, it wasn't her, it was the name of this one sexpot chi-you know, girl-in there whose name I am sure I didn't catch when they went around the room. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Only her name stuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only her name stuck in the back of my head. And that's what I gave this girl-this girl's name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I just shook my head and I says "Now, why did I do that?" Because the girl who made the-this girl Kelly had told me before-or, no, told me afterwards-that she instinctively disliked this girl Diana. That would have been the one she would have picked as being the one she really didn't like. And later on in the session, I didn't like her either. But, for some reason, I was just-I was like dumbfounded this had to happen that way. And that part of me I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What part of you? What are you talking about? What is the big deal with this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The point is-it meant-it meant that of all the people in the group, this person's name was the only one that stuck in my head. I didn't remember it consciously...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, the sexy girl...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so-called sexy girl was really hard for me to talk to because we had to because we had to go around another time and they...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. So what does this mean? That you like to f**k, but hate to admit it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does it mean? What does this mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know! I don't know what it means! I'm a dumb fool!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is happening about this incident?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it-well-I guess maybe it's a part of me that I don't have under control. I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Remember-not remembering somebody's name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, not no not that. That didn't even bother me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well what did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I told this girl I didn't like her anyhow, of all the people in that group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: What bothered me is why I would have the error or thinking of this other girl, you know, and giving this girl this name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why does it bother you that you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it, it-I can think of no explanation. I can think of no reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about the fact that you just met these people and weren't that familiar with their names? Jesus, Johnny, people mix up names all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but-not-see, it would have been all right, but why just that name. That's I think what bothered me, that it was that name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, when you think of that name and that girl-you told me she's the sexpot. [21:45] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, kind of a ding-a-ling, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But a good screw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh. Just a ding-a-ling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody you really wouldn't like. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I didn't like her by one meeting. And I can't really say why. It just made me really feel funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you would have isolated her name out of all the others. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like why should you care what her name is or why should hers be the only one that sticks out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh? Yeah, it-and I also tried-I don't know, there was something too about the-I don't know, I don't know why I thought it'd mean that much. It didn't bother me; it was just that, it was like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Molested (ph at 22:50) someone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like this part of me that I don't know, that I couldn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that part you don't know? What is it? What are you talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the things that to me-to my head or at least, whatever-seem to make me do the things that in the long run just don't pan out. It's the things that, for instance, make me-it's not a "make me"... Yeah, it is like something makes me-like and the morning when I'm going to go to work, I come to work compulsively now, ten minutes late. Everyday I come in ten minutes late. No matter if I get up at seven o'clock, I have to come in that much late.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do I. So?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughter) I don't know why I can't just come ten minutes earlier. I guess then I wonder "Well, do I really want to be doing what I'm doing?" If I come in late every day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I like to think I am, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then, why don't you think so? If you'd like to think so? Why does coming in ten minutes late put that much doubt in your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give you all this weight. What makes it so important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I guess just the fact that I can't lick it. If I can't make myself-like if I say I want to do something and then I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go to bed earlier, get up earlier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Have you ever been psychoanalyzed?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have I ever been to therapy? Yes. Have I ever been psychoanalyzed? No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I-I guess what it is, I don't believe that if I rely on just what my reason tells me and my outward head and all this sort of thing that I'm going to get that. I always think that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I don't believe that and I guess that's why I haven't been psychoanalyzed. I think a lot of that stuff is irrelevant. (inaudible 25:44) That's not to say all of it is bad, in my opinion. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I mean is that if you-if you're-if you sleep late, maybe it's because you go to bed late and not because you don't like your job. And maybe you go to bed late because you enjoy going out and dating and screwing and it doesn't have anything to do with not liking your job. What I mean is that you don't always have to dig into the unconscious to figure something out, because it may be a pile of shit. And I have chosen not to waste my life worrying about that stuff. And you may feel differently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's as though, I guess-what I think-it's like there's this key somewhere. There's this key to me. There's like, it's like a really deep, dark thing way down there somewhere. There's this...I don't know, it's all I can say. It's like a key to myself that, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That somebody else put there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean put into myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's like it's been lost. I don't know how it's been lost, but it's like it's been lost. And whatever it is, it's like I've got to find, you know, I've got to recover. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What'll happen...how will you be different after you recover it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I understand if I would know for instance why...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd get to work on time? You'll remember girls' names properly? You'll be able to choose one woman and not get confused about wanting to date two? Are those the things that will happen? You won't go up to the fondue and burn your hand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's like if I know, I'll feel better about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'll know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could it be? Done your mother, done your father. And your mother's dates. And your sister. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, you know, it's like in everything that I attempt, I still don't really believe in myself. And I think I don't believe in myself because I don't know myself that well. And that's like if I want to go back to school, who's to say that I probably won't just f**k off again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trust yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother didn't trust herself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't trust you, either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really. She doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course, if your mother can't trust herself, how can you trust yourself? I mean, good old Ma. She'll be solid as a rock. If she can't trust herself, who can trust himself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and she always warned me like, she always said "You just wait when you grow up, then you'll find out."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll find out how hard it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you can't trust other people-can't trust other-you can't trust anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she's right. You can trust her, though. You can trust that what she said was right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I can say what she said was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't say what she said was wrong. You say it's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My Ma felt that the whole world was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believed her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I probably felt with her. I don't know how to change that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you still do believe her. Maybe because you love her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't feel anything. I can say I love my mother, but I don't feel anything when I say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you believe anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't believe her anymore. But I feel that she's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's not the same thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. To me, it's two different things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you feel she's right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that I can't help. Because when I was little, that's the way she created...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not little anymore, Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...yeah, but in a way I am. I always say, like, emotionally I'm still a little baby. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but you want to do something about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but how do you change your emotion?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By recognizing that she's wrong, but still being able to love her. It's okay to be wrong. [35:12]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but-you mean just by saying that, you-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not feeling that she's wrong. We talked about feeling that she's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The way-the way-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 35:32) feel that she's right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For the-I imagine for the same reasons that I can't-because I can't help what I feel. What I feel is-like, are you going to trust me? Pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, she was wrong about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well, maybe you know-now I-I don't know. Maybe I don't know really know what emotions are. I don't know. To me-the way I-a strong emotion is like when I feel hurt or angry or something like that. Which rarely happens and usually only maybe once a month or something like that. A very strong emotion will come upon me. And that I can't really control that. It just comes on me. That's what I think of as an emotion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, Johnny, I don't know anybody who can control their emotions. Why does that make you think that there is something wrong or that you're so different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay Well if my Ma kind of had that attitude that you've got to really watch out when you get out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And watch out for other people because they're out to screw you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if that, you know, that kind of mistrustful attitude is in my head and in my gut...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but how about the evidence that you have that can confirm what she says or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, for the most part, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you just go feel that she's right. Why? Who's hurt you bes-who's hurt you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think people hurt me. I think I hurt myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she was really talking about you. Was she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was she talking about you hurting yourself and you hurting other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was she talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She would say other people are not, you know, like she never knew that-there's a word-there's a church word she'd always use.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'The World", you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have hardly ever gone into the whole religion thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Which is taken to mean what? Everybody outside your family?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. The world is not only everything out there-all the people out there, but also that within each person that is really bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) And I believed my whole up until two and a half years ago...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that I was, you know, I was a rotten person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's what God said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. So you haven't much-had that much chance to or that long a time to really feel any differently. I mean, you spent twenty-six, seven years thinking that everybody's bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying to me is "That's why I can't feel any differently even though I'm beginning to think that way now."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the last...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what made your mother God for you? What made you think that what she said-now that's unfair-that's obvi-that's an unfair question, I mean. It's obvious why you thought that. She was your mother. But now, how do you think you felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do I think I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, if the world is bad, maybe she is too. Maybe she gave you the wrong advice. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's part of the world, isn't she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of other people did, too, then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. I can buy that. A lot of other people could, too. You know, (inaudible 40:40). Is that what they told you in the Seminary also?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much in the Seminary. But a lot of places along the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Have you ever been in a Lutheran church?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been inside one on two occasions, maybe three.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they go through a thing, now most Christians-are you Christian or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm nothing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay, well good (chuckles). There's a thing you go through every Sunday and I was approached-I never did talk about religion. That's wild. I don't think I ever talked about religion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 41:37)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never mentioned it. I wonder why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's not worry about that. What were you going to say? I mean, there you go obsessing again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, every Sunday for as long as I can remember-and I never missed church. I don't think I ever missed church. I never even missed daily chapel or evening chapel or anything until I turned-well turned twenty-seven. Because even when I was out at Concordia, hell I went to all the chapels. Everything! So it was church every Sunday, advent-you know when they have these Wednesday night things-every one, Holy Week like, what's today? Thursday? I'd be in church tonight, I'd be in church tomorrow morning, I'd be in church Sunday mornings and once in a while, we'd even throw a-you know, on Holy Week-a Saturday night shuffle in there.\</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should have done a month.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I came as close as I could given my church. But in all those services-and for the most part, you were lucky maybe if you got a guy that said something. But they all used the phrase-well when you go to the service, there is always what they call a confessional part, which you admit that you're really rotten...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Public confessional?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah! Let's see what the words are. When you go to communion-communion was the big thing-oh the one thing, before you go to communion you always have to have a clear conscience. In other words, you've got to believe that, as far as you could, you've made restitutions for everything and now you're ready to go to communion. Let's see...how does it go...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's not get hung up on the words unless...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, because they're important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "I, a poor miserable sinner confess unto thee all my sins and inequities with which I have ever offended thee and justly deserve thy temper and eternal punishment. I am heartily sorry for them and sincerely repent of them and I pray thee of thy boundless mercy" and it goes on like that. I can't hardly remember them. That, that, that thing was repeated every Sunday of my whole like that I can remember. There is another part where you're getting forgiven...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believed it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes, yes! I could always think of a lot of different ways. I think I believed it. I'm not so sure now. I was just at church-and it's funny, any time when I go back to church and I was just at church this Sunday after having-I haven't gone for a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I was there-what I come out now with-I'm usually hopping mad. Although I'm really tamed down because I said, you know, if I can't accept it, then at least I'm not going to knock it completely for people who want it. But every time I go-especially if I go with Jane-we hear some old preacher. We heard some idiot last night...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I came out with just this feeling of anger that, you know, like it was kind of (inaudible at 45:06) in me. I was trying to remember how I would have felt hearing those words when I was little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I never-like that was a really highly significant thing for me. Religion. It was where I kind of made up for all the things I lacked in other areas. And like three years ago, I didn't even-when I dropped out Seminary, I substituted by going to bars. Doing all the things I'd never done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which eventually led me to the point where I am now. Like the other side isn't any better really either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, is it that it's not any better or that it makes you doubt yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess-I don't know what I believe in now. I've got to believe in something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just your Ma, that's all. Right now. That's what it sounds like. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) So if I say like "Ma, you're wrong" then she's still-like she's still the one I relate to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand. But once you believe that she's wrong, maybe you'll start believing that you're right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I, even when I'd be off, when I'd back-when I went back home, I'd always question most of-what's my Ma told me? She says "You never think anything I say is right." Because I would always-I would always ask her. You know, not ask her, I'd-maybe I do ask her. But I would always-she'd start bitching about a relative and I'd say "Well, what's the other side of the story?" And then she'd-she'd try to say it that way and I says "Why, you know, it's..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm talking about the important stuff now, not the gossip. I'm talking about the basic stuff that your life is made of . Your beliefs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I'm alibiing, I'd have to say religion was my main belief, you know, as it was given me by my Ma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's your Ma again. [48:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And as it was reinforced, you know. So if I say my Ma is wrong, then I've got to say God's wrong-and all my understandings are wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or-yeah, that's right. Or your understanding has been wrong. Or your Ma's interpretation has been wrong. Or, God is wrong. It doesn't have to be God is wrong just because your Ma is wrong. But I think that's the way you feel-because Ma and God are, you know, kind of like the same for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You really think, though, you can-like what do you do, you know, when you do something and it's not in your own best interests?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I say "Oh shit, why did I make that mistake?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then what do you do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I try to rectify it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) You don't wonder any more about it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have the time. Sometimes I do. Yeah, I think about and hope that by thinking about it I won't make the same kind of mistake again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't talk to-you don't talk to stuff that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I used to-until I discovered that I was spending more time and energy sweating over what I'd done than actually doing things. And I figured what the f**k am I doing!</p>

<p>PATIENT: What if you know-what if you repeat the same dumb thing again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe I'm blind about it and don't see it, but I just don't do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm...What good...well, what good is Freud then, to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A very interesting theorist. Daring of him to talk about sex when nobody else would. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It is kind of like I'm fascinated by him because I think, you know, I get the same sort of things that I did-that came into my head when I grew up and that there something really bad at the heart of me. But I don't know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like your Ma said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like the confession says.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aren't you sorry you believe that? What a cross to carry! </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it seems, you know, like when I do something dumb. Actually when I do something that is very dissatisfying to me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that I just don't like at all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I don't like the feeling I have when I'm done with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like last night, I didn't like the feeling when I woke up this morning. I said-I didn't like when went over there. I didn't like anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said "All right, no more of this. You're not going to get in the situation where you're half-bombed and you're not going to...you're going to make sure you avoid it." Just because I didn't like the feeling I had. You know, I have this sneaking suspicion I'll do it again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the meantime, you picked somebody up last night, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, but it-somebody-in the-it's just the, the thing of it was, was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) ...this crummy feeling I had...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...this morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Tomorrow you might not have that. So? So, we're finished.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How long do most people usually stay in?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're liking therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Forget it (chuckles). Forget the question. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't have to take these tests. I think that Daniel will contact you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is he the one that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a preference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really, just so he has my number-does he? Because we changed offices since last he contacted me. I started in November, I think. No, he should still have my right number.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's his phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I give you a number? (writing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll be contacting me, then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking what I'm going to do is see what happens in this group for a couple weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you going to be in the city? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so. At least through the summer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I hope to be in contact with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do? You're going to have to (inaudible 56:15) the nerve.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I never thought about that whole-the whole religion thing, so I don't know. Let me see what happens with Jane. Because if I've got to have money, I won't go on a trip to Chicago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

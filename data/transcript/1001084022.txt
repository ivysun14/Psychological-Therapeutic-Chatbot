<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how have you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, about the same, sometimes some good times and sometimes not so good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did this trip go better than the last one I hope to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It did and we're actually going to go again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I kind of feel wild about the next time but we're going to housesit a home that's for sale until it's sold.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is this for the same one you just house sat for or different?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Different, yeah, different.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we're going to be leaving as soon as we can next week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they're anticipating two to six months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To sell it so we'll see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And where is this house.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's in [DEIDENTIFIED] also.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so my brother and my mom had spent years of her childhood there</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she's seen some of her old friends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I love the [DEIDENTIFIED] so there's a lot of good things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it is, I'm finding that I'm looking more to, I don't like all this change, I've known that for a long time but what used to be, would have been like total thrilling adventure, to me it's like I keep trying to say that it's okay if we're not putting down our roots that we're going to be moving around a little bit -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm working on that, not panicking about that but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing okay, I'm doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got two, I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] yesterday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And by the way, he wanted to know who my psychiatrist was and I told him and he seems to know you, he really endorsed you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's nice of him.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have not seen him personally for years but I've known him over the years professionally and years and years ago had dinner at his house.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my goodness.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's probably been fifteen years ago but I haven't seen him since then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's very good and well respected.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He was very, yeah, very glad that you've been helping me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's nice, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I had been keeping track and I'm positive now that I have, I guess I am menopausal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I arrived there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I talked to him again about maybe trying to be on hormone replacement, maybe, maybe that it might help the depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we talked a lot about it and the thing that I recognized is that my depression didn't start, you know, when my periods started to taper off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it had been going on a lot longer ago than that but he said it's okay to try, even though I have some coronary artery disease, you know, and the diabetic issue, it's a very, to me it's a very small risk compared to maybe, maybe, maybe it could help, you know, even if it could just help two notches up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It would be wonderful, so I just thought you'd like to have a record for your records.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> These are the two meds and the estrogen is going to be taken as written and the progesterone is going to be, instead of 2 cc, 1 cc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But he wrote it for 2.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so when are you going to start this, probably this week or so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm supposed to have a stress test tomorrow.  It's the one that they initiate with chemicals, I can't remember the name of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I know what you're talking about, I know what you mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember things at all anymore but, yeah, I'm going to have that done tomorrow and then I will have seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who's the cardiologist and I'll just run it past her and make sure, in light of the results that they get tomorrow, if it still seems to be an okay risk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That's sounds like a good plan.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, good, so that's one thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, thank you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the other thing, I had, before I left, I had asked for the two psychiatrists I'd seen, one is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and the other one was the doctor out at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To send my charts over, did they do that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I got records from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], yeah, but nothing from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Boy, he's a real stinker.  Okay, I'll contact him again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And where is he?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I walked over a request, I sent him a request, you gave me the form.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, I called.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't understand why but I guess, if you have another form.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess I'll take it to her too but those are the main things, yeah, those are the main things.  The Vivactil that I have been taking -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had been off of it a day by accident, I just, I think it was a day we were traveling or I forgot, I don't know, my pills weren't in my pill box and I couldn't get to them or something but anyway I went through a couple days where I didn't take the Vivactil as ordered.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I really had a lot more depression that following week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it was kind of like a trial run without it and even though I always have felt that nothing has really made a substantial difference in the level of depression, I think that must be doing something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's a good thing to know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I was taking two in the morning and two at night, I think, they're 10 mg.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds right, let me double check though.  They're 5's actually.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 5's, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you were taking just two twice a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was taking two twice a day and then after that happened, I started taking more and I was up to 2 two times a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so 10, 20 mg a day, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I would take more, I just wanted to talk to you about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I was also taking Trileptal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And again, I don't have the dosage amount, but a half in the morning and a half at night, is that right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, the Trileptal 150, you were taking half twice a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 75, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And one of those was making me have really peculiar visual disturbances.  I kept trying to think of how to explain it to people but it was almost like my eyes would take snapshots of a scene and everything would be just in one frame and stop action, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I'd blink my eyes and I'd see another picture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, very disconcerting, it was hard to drive because, you know, I'd be constantly blinking to try to keep the image moving.  I don't know how else to put it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I think maybe now I stopped taking the Trileptal altogether last week and I haven't noticed anything like mood changes or anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did the visual thing -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think the visual thing is better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm thinking that maybe it was the Trileptal that was doing that and it really was, it really was becoming a problem so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So at least right now, you know, I'm not taking that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then you had given me samples of the, is it Lunesta?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think, I wound up with two, four, six, eight pills and I've taken them all and of the eight, two times it helped me sleep, the rest of the time I was just still really up all the time and really wakeful so the things I did for that, you know, I kept trying it because I did have the two times when I slept so well, I just was, it was a wonderful feeling.  I thought maybe if I stopped taking the Trileptal or if I didn't take the Vivactil in the evening that maybe I'd sleep better, I don't know.  I was out of town for all this stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then, I'm sorry, say it again, you thought you'd sleep better if you took the Vivactil</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe if I took the Vivactil, instead of taking two in the morning and two at h.s. maybe two in the morning and two in the mid afternoon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's certainly worth trying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's a reasonable thing to try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, then I'm going to try that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because if it's helping me -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And also the question is, do we want to go higher on that one because you're on 20 a day now, the maximum is 60, so we have room to work with that one still if you want to try going higher.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to try like three in the morning and three mid day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And see if that helps more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll try that, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Excuse me.  Okay, so three each morning and three mid day.  Are you still taking the Neurontin too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> One twice a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and then the Lunesta, it sounds like it's iffy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ran out and it just didn't seem, you know, I can't remember anything at all anymore, yeah, the percentage of help was pretty low.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So did you go ahead and stop it then did you say or did you get your prescription filled?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You gave me a prescription and I lost it but I don't think I would have filled it because it didn't seem to be, you know, that helpful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And all along that time too, I think I was having neuropathy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> More in my feet, so that might have been it and, you know, with the menopause stuff, maybe that's, I guess that's one of the, you know, occurrences with menopause is you don't sleep real well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And are you having trouble getting to sleep these days or is it more waking up during the night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's more, yeah, waking up frequently during the night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and then how's your energy during the day, are you tired or do you have enough energy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm really tired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I, you know, I thought it could be the diabetes, although it's been doing pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It could be menopause, it could be, you know, it could be the depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How's your appetite been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No appetite but I'm not losing weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm up to 122, which is about the tops for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, you know, I guess as long as I'm maintaining my weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But nothing ever, you know, mom will say, what sounds good for dinner?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And how about anxiety, do you feel much anxiety?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The anxiety is horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And are you using the Ativan or Lorazepam?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am, I'm using the Ativan.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it work when you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It does, uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it does and I'm very grateful for it.  I'm concerned about taking too much but like on the worst days, I will have taken, on the very worst days, I would have taken two whole ones, so a whole, they're what 0.5.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so that's only a mg a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I just say, you know, if I need it, I need it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good attitude to have because it's effective, use it.  What about concentration, is it difficult to focus?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm learning to just take things on a little bit at a time, you know, like I like to read books and I'll read something and then go back to it the next night and I can't remember that I read that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm trying to just, to learn and retain two or three things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and see how that goes and so far that's going pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the anxiety is just awful -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just hate it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME], have you had any suicidal thoughts recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you know, I don't think, I think, yeah, when I'm really nervous or I'm really feeling down, I think not so much that I'm going to kill myself but just that life is hard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't know how to put that.  It's not like it used to be, as bad as it used to be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So it sounds like right now what you've been doing is taking the Neurontin twice a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two Protriptyline twice a day or Vivactil and the Ativan as needed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So maybe what we could do is bump up the Vivactil to three, twice a day and see if we can get more out of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even at that dose, that's only half the maximum so we could even go higher if we needed to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then use the Ativan for the anxiety and the Neurontin, I don't know if it's doing anything or not but probably with you getting ready to leave, it's not a good time to try stopping it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I was thinking and I do, I have taken extra Neurontin when my feet have really hurt.  Like I've taken Tylenol and I'm still really restless.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it seem to help?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it must.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think it must.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now I'm just thinking too, what are you going to do about your medicine when you're in California if it's like five months.  Can you transfer the prescriptions out there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yes I can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the other thing was, you know, I've been thinking that way too, oh my gosh, five, six months.  It doesn't mean we're going to be there that long.  The house is going to be up for sale.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And maybe, the housing market isn't the greatest but it's in [DEIDENTIFIED] where land is very scarce.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so maybe it will sell quickly, I don't know but I'm, you know, it's not absolutely going to be six months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, and as long as it's okay for the prescriptions to be transferred, if you need a refill you can call me and I can call them in then too, here or there, whatever works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For the pharmacy.  Any other stresses right now, that's plenty but anything else going on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think there's anything new, just our unsettledness.  In a sense it's a relief that we're not selling the house because that had been the plan.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To sell it  ASAP, so that's not going to happen and somebody's going to be staying in our house for us so I think my mom feels more comfortable with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we will be, we will be out of the state if it does take a long time to sell, you know, we'll be in California in a colder climate but it certainly won't be like being here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so I mean we've got to still face the music and when I start thinking about what's it going to be like in January and February and March, you know, I start to really get upset but I just can't do that anymore.  I have no control over that and it doesn't do any good to think about it, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Any ideas of what you're going to do after you're done housesitting out there yet or you're just going to wait and see?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just wait and see right now.  I feel more and more sure that my mom and I will together till one of us passes away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so, yknow, can't get too wild and crazy with my mom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well it sounds like you've got a good attitude about things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, the truth is none of us know what's going to happen six months down the road anyway, you just live one day at a time and kind of see where life takes us.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you've got a good plan right now, it's working and you're taking good care of your health so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm really trying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.  Okay, well anything else going on that I didn't ask you about that you wanted to talk about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh boy, I don't think so.  I was thinking about it this morning and then when I got into [DEIDENTIFIED] and got all wrapped up in what I was doing, I kind of got off track.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thinking but I think that's about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well then why don't we stick with this plan then and if you're out there and you have any problems or questions, you can always call me too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I can always, you know, call out there if you had questions or if we needed to adjust the medications or anything and then, maybe what we can do is just whenever you come back, you can just give me a call and we can check in and see how things are going.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I appreciate that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does that sound reasonable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Yeah, because it doesn't make sense to even set an appointment now because you just don't know for sure what your plans are going to be.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're not leaving are you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, I'm not going anywhere.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm planted here so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You are, good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've been here for eighteen years, well I've lived here my whole life really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Except for when I was in training so I'm, I don't have any plans to go anywhere so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The lady that I see for counseling is going to be moving to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm feeling bad about that but, you know, everybody has changes in their lives.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I'm sure she'll help me find somebody else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When is she leaving, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't know, first I thought it was going to be this Fall</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm not sure, I need to ask her but I'm going to be gone anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you'll leave before she does it sounds like, yeah.  All right, well let's, let's see, I didn't check to see if you had refills now.  The Vivactil I did six months worth in May so we're good there.  Ativan, oh gosh, it's been a while, that one I'm not sure about because you don't use it every day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Neurontin, I think the last time I gave you refills, that was July oh six.  Do you know if you have plenty of that left or not?  Maybe a different doctor may have refilled?  Oh here it is, I did a years worth in October so we're good through October on that one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I think we're fine on everything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I'm going to sit down and look at all the meds and make sure I have enough, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've cut back on, I only want to take what I have to take right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I'm not taking the, somebody told me for blood pressure to take red yeast rice, red rice yeast or something.  Actually, it was a doctor's office who told me to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I stopped doing that because I don't have hypertension so why am I taking it, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But two or three things like that, that I quit taking and just try to get it honed down to the absolute necessities.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a wise choice I think.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good.  Well, I hope you have a good time out there housesitting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hope it goes smoothly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm looking forward to going fishing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I like to fish.  The only thing that's kind of hard is this is the first year without my dad.  My dad was, we were fishing buddies, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And every place I go up there I went with my dad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, sometimes I think maybe it's good to go back to those places and cry it out a little bit and, you know, move past it, come to grips with the fact that he's not going to come around again and, you know, deal with it but that is a little painful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's natural I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think so too, grieving and letting go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And moving forward and we have to let go in order to move forward so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I was trying to think of those three things I've been trying to learn and one of them, let's see, I'm nervous now anyway but one of them was my friend [NAME OTHER], she's a quadriplegic and she's been in a wheelchair for like thirty seven years and she's a Christian and one of the things with her is that, you know, when she feels like she's confronted with something that's just terrible, like she has pressure sores, you know, pressure ulcers and she has to be off her feet and, you know, all that and just that, you know, there's a reason for all these things happening and even for the depression and if I really believe like I say I believe that God is using those things for his glory and my good and instead of getting lost in what I've lost or what I'm missing or what's hurting me, say back to God, even though I don't fully understand it, I thank you for it because it shows that you're still working with me, you know, so that's helping me a lot, that's the praise part.  The prayer part, you know, everything I see, this is so scary but I see a deer hit along the freeway, I cry.  I talked to a friend who, you know, is having a physical problem, I'm crying about it.  Everything makes me feel sad and hopeless and I realized the other day that instead of taking that all on myself like I have my whole life, before I was a nurse, I could make a difference, if somebody was crying, I'd sit and hold their hand and see what I could do to help, that's gone, I don't have that opportunity much anymore but I can pray for them, instead of what can I do or there's nothing that I can do, there's nothing that can change, just pray about it and take it off of my chest, it's not my job, I can't change it for people and that's another thing and then the third thing I can't remember but those two things are helping me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, that's the secret is to find what works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So [PATIENT NAME], I think you're doing well.
PT Well thank you so much for helping me [PHYSICIAN NAME].  It's just I'm so scared of losing you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no, like I said, I'm not going anywhere.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll be right here a long long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if anything comes up where you need me, just give me a call, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, very good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have a wonderful time and good luck with the fishing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you, yeah, I hope, I got a new rod and reel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's no excuse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The fun is just to be there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, take care.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye bye.</p>

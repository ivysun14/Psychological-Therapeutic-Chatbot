<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were talking about your new office. I was explaining to her that she could stay on the first floor. She goes, "Yeah, why don't we take it to the third floor. We'd have to sprout wings." (both laugh) Yeah, I'm sure she's done with long flights of stairs, that's for sure. He always has this big smile on his face, really genuinely nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'd meet with you right after, right? So you would see each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was commenting how long it had been and saying, "I usually see Frank on Tuesday, but it's Wednesday," and I said, "Yeah, I usually see him on Monday but... "[00:01:06] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've got a shop at 3:00 today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for having this spot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're on for 11:45 next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Let me just check that to be sure. I put it on my calendar. Let's make sure we're on the same page, 11:45. (pause) 11:45 on Wednesday, the 21st. Okay. So - several things. [00:02:05] I taught; this was on Monday. There is a place that takes care of kids, a franchise, and they typically are very nice,. They seem like they really - they really are very, very professional and they really do a lot in terms of early development. My boss has a contract with them, so we teach at various locations. I was going to teach at 10:00 on Monday. It was a holiday, right? I show up and get there at 9:25. I wanted to be a half-hour early so I could set up and not feel hurried when I'm there. I go and ring the bell - nothing. Ring the bell - nothing. Ring the bell - nothing. [00:03:08] No lights, no nothing. I think that maybe it's a holiday and they just haven't arrived yet. There are supposed to be 14 people that need training. Then I went and got all of my stuff and put it in the entryway. There was a gym right next door, so I put my stuff there. Every five minutes ring the bell - nothing. Ring the bell - nothing. I walked around the whole circumference of the building looking in windows - nothing. I decided to call my boss and tell him. Martin calls twice - no response. So I wait until 10:05 after ringing every five minutes and leave. I'm all the way through the tunnel because I was going to take the turn-off to go home. I get a phone call. I guess they were there. [00:04:01] I said, "This is unbelievable. It is impossible that 14 people could have gotten past me because there is only one entrance and I was standing there for 35 minutes. He said, "No. They were inside the entire time." They didn't answer my phone calls or "I know you were ringing the bell." Nothing. He goes, "You don't have to do it. I know you have other things you are doing today." It was already 10:20. He goes, "If you could turn around and go do it, that would be really helpful." I said, "All right." So I turned around and come back. I show up at 10:35. [00:04:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not bad. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'm thinking about all of the stuff that I'm bringing in, but I just take the manikin. I just bring the manikin in. It turns out that they're in a room. I ring the bell and someone comes to the door. It turns out they were in a room that was right in the middle of it that had no windows. I was irritated. If you're expecting somebody, leave a note, expect a phone call, expect the doorbell to ring. (laughs) I went in. I was irritated - this is the thing - and I thought, "These people..." It was not the right thing to do, but usually when I teach - no matter what's happened, I was very upbeat and pleasant, a fresh start. That's what one should do. [00:05:59] So I walk into this room and I look at all of these people sitting at tables. Clearly they've been there for a long time. They've been in with the training. The person who was in charge came up to me and said, "Do you want to use this table here? You can stand here and work." I said, "Yeah, but I really am going to have to leave at 11:00," and it's now 10:35, and it's an hour course. I said, "So, given that, I won't have time to actually teach it. I hope that some people here have had training already. They can come up and they can start doing this and other people who have not learned it can watch and then we can be very efficient about this." She sort of looked at me. I said this in front of all the students to her. I said, "I was here for 35 minutes ringing the doorbell every five minutes. I even received two calls." [00:07:06] She thought - and, granted, I was irritated. I was absolutely irritated. Anyway, she felt that was impolite or snarky, and it probably was because I was clearly agitated and sort of possibly dismissive, feeling "what jack-asses." You're expecting somebody and now I'm inconvenienced, now I've been delayed. I my own mind I like to show up, be prepared, everything is right - and then the class goes a certain way because I really enjoy doing it and I want it to be a certain way. I don't want to be hurried. So she leaves and apparently - she did; she called Martin saying I was impolite. As I'm teaching - once I get into teaching mode, I can't help but be pleasant. [00:08:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You turn it off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, and it's genuine, right? But there was that first 30 seconds of me just sort of wanting to vent, right, which I shouldn't have done. So Martin texts me. (laughs) This is like three minutes after I'm into teaching and he said, "Just take a deep breath. Be nice. I know it's a big fault. It's a big contract. Take it easy." (laughs) Which is fine. He gets it. He totally gets the fact that it's a pain in the ass and he's just telling me like "okay, I know this is totally bullshit, but chill," which I needed to hear because he wasn't mean. He was on my side. So there was that and then afterwards I called him and said I was probably a little bit abrupt, but I felt good about what he said and I shouldn't have done it. [00:09:04] He goes, "Don't worry about it. Truly, don't worry about it." But I felt bad because it's one thing to tell the person who's running it privately that this is bullshit, but not in front of the students. It's not their fault that they're in a room with no windows. It's not their fault that their boss didn't answer the phone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They are the other care workers or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. The other teachers. It's not their fault. So there is that. And then last night, it's a minor thing but it just irritates me and I wonder... anyway. I was supposed to teach. [00:10:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's one over there? Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's massive. It's up on the fourth floor. Really, it's the largest one I've seen. And even though parking gets paid for, I'm aware of the fact that I have to wait to get paid back and I'm looking at the scheduling for the parking. A two-hour course - plus or minus - and you've got to get there early and it takes time to clean up. The parking situation is six, nine, twelve, thirty; so if you're over 2 1/2 hours, it goes from 12 to 30 - big leap. So I'm thinking, "Okay, I know these people don't ever really start on time. I know that it's always this sort of rigmarole because they're disorganized and they truly can't start until 6:00. How late can I show up? How quickly can I break it down? Can I speed up the class by 10 minutes so I can pay the $15 of parking instead of the $40 of parking?" [00:11:15] So I call and say, "Where should I park?" There are two garages. They say, "Go up to the sixth floor, sixth level." I said - I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. (pause) My third-floor guy wants to help out and do the insulation area. I'm expecting at 6:00 I'm there, again, at 5:15. Traffic wasn't as bad as I thought so I was 45-minutes early. I thought I'd wait until 5:45 and then I'd go to the garage - easy-peasy - and unpack. [00:12:07] I call - you know, when I asked where to park and they say, "No problem. Just get here when you can, but we'll start at 6:30." They said 6:00, and it's 6:30. So I'm like fucking hell, what's going on? First of all they're not answering the doorbell and then they're off by a half hour. So now I'm going to be there 45 minutes early, and I have another half-hour. So I fire off a text to Martin because I'm irritated. I'm like, "What's up with these people? What's up? Should I call in advance very time because I can't read their e-mails?" knowing full well that it might have been him. Sometimes he gets times wrong. So it's like I cancel something in order to be here for 6:00, but I wouldn't have had to cancel if I'd known it was 6:30 because it was only a 15-minute issue. [00:13:04] I like being there a full half hour early. So there is this issue of feeling like I've come across as the guy who just gets really irritated, even though he knows he's a good teacher and he always gets really positive feedback and I'm requested to teach. He knows all of that and he likes me and I like him; but there is this sense prior to actually being there and doing this, where - I don't know what it is. It's only a half hour, but it so irritated me. It so irritated me, and it's like why can't people get it together? And she said something. She said, "We tell everyone 6:00 because sometimes people are having a hard time finding us, so it is 6:30." (pause) [00:14:11] I thought, "Well, you can't assume that the person that's going to show up is going to get lost." That's a negative way of going through it. Maybe your teachers initially show up late. I'm never late. So I have an hour. I thought, "Did Martin mess it up?" because sometimes he does. Did Martin get it off by a half-hour? Anyway, whatever. I sat in the car and I contemplated why I was getting mad and I thought, "What is the silver lining to this?" The silver lining was that I could listen to the end of [Felguard Mass] (ph?) and I could hear the angry, toney bit, which I find funny. So I thought, "Well, since it's 6:30, I get to hear that. That's good." [00:15:03] And I thought, "I can just sit here and think about why I'm mad; and that's good." And I went in and thought, "Fresh draft. Blank slate." I just go in and it turns out that it was not like the experience because I go in and it's this giant party and they've ordered bazillions of pizzas and everyone was very happy. They knew it was going to be a long day for everybody, but they were going to try and make the best of it. I thought, "They're trying to make the best of it, I'm going to just to be - They've had a long day and I will be entertaining and I will do my usual thing at making people feel good and treat them seriously. Make them laugh and that will be a positive thing and they will feel like it's edifying and they'll feel better about themselves because they'll all feel good. Anyway, so that's what happened. [00:16:05] I do feel like the wrong thing to do is, just as a matter of course, call ahead of time to verify. Don't text Martin and say "this is absurd." It's only a half hour. Yeah, it's twice in a row now, but I just need to deal with it myself. I will make phone calls in advance. Always call before, never assume that they're correct or that Martin is correct; and, yeah, it takes five minutes to Google the phone number and call. It's well worth it. So it' s sort of dot your i's and cross your t's. That way I'm not left being irritated. [00:16:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. One thing I was thinking about as you were describing the irritation that you felt in that moment with that teacher, what I observe in you - and sometimes I'll notice this kind of consciously - that you will shift into a really different state. You will shift into a really different state. You almost embody a certain kind of - again, the irritation that you felt was very palpable, it was very real and I could easily sense it into you. And then you shift back to this other state where you feel more pleasant. You feel more pleasant. I tell you what, it's the same exact state that you talk about when you talk about Barbara being irritated. There's a way that it's a similar matching kind of state of mind. [00:18:06] I was thinking about this whole question about of course you were irritated. That was an irritating thing to go through, and yet it didn't mesh well with you feeling also kind of like "hey - I want to teach the class. I'm also this guy who teaches this class and, as a teacher, it's almost like that irritation or wanting to be professional and be that good guy doesn't belong. It's almost kind of sequestered. There's another experience, another mode of experience. And I was thinking about it when we were talking last week - I think it was last week - about the multiple Barbaras. [00:19:01] There's the one where she's at the airport - the airport Barbara, and yet she's not there when this irritated Barbara is there and the irritated Barbara there's none of that. I don't know what to say about it. It's... (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I was also going to text you a picture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Of what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I saw Barbara and I thought, "Oh, Frank would totally get this." She is in her black lulu-lemons and her lime-green lulu-lemon top and she (laughing)... I come home - what was I doing? [00:20:03] Oh, I taught Polish history. I came home from the first teaching session and the place smells of bleach. She's on her hands and knees and she goes, "Don't come in the kitchen." I often hear that. "Don't come in the kitchen." (laughs) I said, "Okay. That's fine, but I'm hungry." She goes, "All right, but let that portion dry. Then you can eat and then I'll finish." So without her knowing it - she's on her hands and knees, right? (laughs) A bucket of bleach with gloves and is just on her knees scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing - and, of course, it was attractive as well. I have this weird fantasy of a girl on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor; and so I took a picture of her and I thought, "Isn't that interesting?" It's not a posed picture where she's sort of smiling and dressed up. It was sort of like no, this is Barbara in action. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's in the raw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is classic. Really. This is classic Barbara. (pause) Anyway - and she was in good spirits; but, you know, her shoulders hurt because whatever she does in nursing, her shoulder hurts and her lower back can hurt at times, right? She had gone on a long bicycle ride the day before so her neck was sore because she was up like that. And yet, in spite of that, she's hands and knees for 25 minutes - scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub. (laughs) I'm thinking, "Why are you doing this to yourself?" Of course, she has to do it to herself. She has to clean the floor even though it's going to hurt her back and shoulder; and she has to scrub the hell out of the grout of the big, white tiles. (pause) [00:22:14] Anyway, I saw that and I just thought, "That's the worker Barbara in action," but I'm not the recipient of any ire. She isn't upset with me. She's just telling me to wait before I walk in to make a sandwich. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's the dirt on the... scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is, too, getting back to this shift. Me sitting in the car is this asocial experience. Whatever anxiety I'm feeling, perhaps for some of it, when there's a scheduling issue, it doesn't comport. I feel that it's sort of me against the world and it's these jack-asses who won't open the door or it's these people who are off by a half-hour. It makes me feel like I'm not being expected or valued, like they're not looking forward to me and they're not waiting at the door or leaving a note. It's okay to say, "Ehh - 6:30. It's only a half-hour of your time." But then once I showed up and am actually in the experience of teaching - granted that I had to vent for that little bit - but once I'm in the mode of it I'm with real people and I can't help but believe in what I'm doing and believe in being nice and believe in making people feel good because I'm in the moment and I'm connected. [00:24:08] But the irritation I always feel is when things go off and I'm just alone and I've got my phone and I can text and I can complain to the boss. Anyway, it does highlight the alone self and whatever is going on with the alone self versus being sort of enmeshed - which raises the other point. </p>

<p>I had the exam on Monday for the proofs course. There was a lot of build-up for that. There was a very long study session with Carrie and Sarah on Saturday. [00:25:04] Le Ann is pulling her hair out. She's like, "I'm an engineer. I build bridges and I don't understand this mathematics. I understand a lot of math and I don't get this math." It's making me feel better because I'm like well, we know it equally well and she knows a hell of a lot more math than I do; and she's confused. So I'm feeling like okay, it's a different sort of math. Prepare, prepare. I was teaching on Monday and I had all that anxiety like there is this mid-term, 40 percent of my grade, and this half-hour or hour of being delayed and them not expecting me is an hour that I can't study. So there was all of that when I showed up. I go to the test and - bam - I'm really like, wow. Somehow everything clicked, which I thought it would. [00:26:04] Somehow I thought whatever is going to happen, it's all just going to come together and I'll just turn it on, so I did. I felt - bam - excellent. So that's good. What we're actually studying now, and this wasn't on the test, but we're actually studying the foundations of mathematics, which is called axiomatic set theory. So it's not just set theory, it's what's behind set theory. From what I have read and from what we're learning, it really is the absolute basis of all the math and all other mathematics is simply an instance of sets. [00:27:03] Axiom number one in axiomatic set theory is - let's assume that a set exists. That's the first axiom in all of mathematics. Let's assume this set exists. It doesn't specify there's anything in the set. It's just we're creating, which we signify with curly braces, just the idea there's a container. And then there are some axioms that follow that and, when you get down into all nine axioms, you find that you're dealing entirely with sets and you haven't yet defined a number. [00:28:02] There are no numbers. And yet when you look back on it, you can look at these sets and the various little things you define and say, "Well, if you have a set inside a set inside a set inside a set inside a set inside a set, you can call that seven," and you just keep making more parentheses. We'll just call these 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and we can define it and we can have the infinitude of the natural numbers. All it is, is just braces inside of braces. Something into something, yet there are no numbers. You just call it a number. Sometimes this happens in math, I'm looking at this and thinking, "This is fascinating. It's absolutely fascinating that the first thing in all of mathematics is to say ‘let's create a space.'" [00:29:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's create a space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're not going to say something is not in it, but we're not going to say there is. Let's just deal with the idea that there is a container and let's play with that idea. After nine axioms - bam - you have all the natural numbers, just based on the little tweaks on the idea. Well, now if you put a set inside set? Let's do it. Let's call it "two." You look at functions and really are sort of like, "Well, this function... da-da-da." For most people who are in calculus or just regular algebra, it's just a set that's define. [00:30:00] We started with nothing and we said, "Let's put this thing in it and let's qualify it." If you look at it a certain way, the various things you put into this little container you can match it up and it's functional. There is a riddle and there is a paradox to this because you can say, "Well, if you can have lots and lots of sets inside of a set, is there a set that contains all sets? Is there a set that contains everything, including itself?" and that's the paradox. A set can't contain itself by definition, so you keep putting more and more stuff inside; but the one thing you can't do is to have it include itself because otherwise it leads to disaster. [00:31:06] So in life, I've been thinking whether it's metaphysics. There is an ultimate set of parentheses and it can't contain itself and it is that last set of parentheses. There is that, but in terms of just experience or in terms of brain structure, consciousness, I'm thinking, "What if you say - let's just call ‘A' a set. Let's just call it "experience A,'" and that's with parentheses around it. Let's call it "the set;" the set containing consciousness or the set containing experience. So A is experience. Put parentheses around it. [00:32:01] Now we're on the outside looking in. Is that consciousness? It's the set containing the experience. So, of course, I've gotten sidetracked; instead of actually doing math I'm puzzling over this notion of parentheses because you start out with just a container. But what happens if you're on the outside of that? So it's this Russian doll effect, and yet the smallest Russian doll has nothing inside of it; so everything begins with nothing. I'd like to read more of that. The problem is, of course, I have to learn more math to be able to read it, but I feel like there are a lot of useful metaphors. [00:33:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what about it? What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just find it outstanding and I do think about whether it would have been helpful to learn this when I was five, and I would be much less troubled by the idea of one, two, three, if someone had said, "Let's just say there is a container." Okay. And there's nothing in it, so it's called zero. Nothing. Zero is nothing. Let's put one thing inside it. But looking at it we have our sets. Let's put a set inside of a set that has nothing in it. Let's just put a set inside of a set and let's call it "two." Let's call it "one." We'll call it "one." So you're counting these things, which have nothing in them. [00:34:01] And the basis is nothing. You're counting; you're summing up nothingness, which I feel is a relief (chuckles) because it's just a complete mental conscript. It's not one door, one room, four lights. It's not identifying anything particular in the world because there is a difficulty, I think, in matching up what's in one's mind to the real world. If we can limit it to the mind and just create these mental structures, there's something very nice about that because you don't feel obliged to then make the leap to the real world. The way it's always taught is that there is the real world and let's be able to understand it. Let's match it up. [00:35:07] What that implies is that math essentially is understanding the outside and bringing it inside and understanding it, as opposed to sort of the Descartian idea of just sitting and it being this entirely internal structure which happens to be externalized. It happens to match up because that's how we see it. When you start closing one's eyes and just imagining a space. Nothing. Maybe there is, maybe there is not; just a space. [00:36:05] You can build up from that. I find it phenomenal. It's a new idea. Within the past 100 years, this has been the thing to contemplate. And the various axioms - except the last axiom which is called the axiom of choice, which I find phenomenal and is debated - for practical reasons it's just sort of accepted. I just like the name. We have all this stuff and we don't really need axiom of choice, but it makes life easier if we include it as an axiom. We can just choose to make a set of something and another set of something and we can say that they could be equal. It's useful. We don't have to say the sequel of that, but it's nice. [00:37:06] It's all very brand-new to me but, as I was sitting in the car last night, I was just contemplating it. There is the set of all experience, my experience is a subset of that. It's okay. They're people. I'm a person. It's all okay. We're all just inside of one big set of parentheses and there's nothing there, and yet everything is there. That's the key. Everything can be created out of this. [00:37:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's like it gives you peace of mind or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking as opposed to the experience where you're feeling in the car or waiting, ringing the doorbell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe analogously it felt like I was on the outside. I was not being included in the experience, in the [...] (inaudible at 00:38:25) if you want to think about sets, not the axiomatic approach. Just the notion of being on the outside and not being happy about it, because the fact is when I'm doing my thing all eyes are on me so it's this toggle, having no connection with people to all of a sudden having a lot of connection with people. That switch happens very quickly and it does feel like being on stage. Maybe every person that teaches feels that. (pause) [00:39:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it reminds me of the old concept of the work ego. You become this sort of - not false self, but just that self emerges in those situations. That's like a whole way of functioning. I think a separate kind of consciousness. I was thinking, too, how it's funny you using the idea of sets and brackets. I guess what was going on in my head was that, in some way, this experience - where does this experience in being irritated fit in with your experience in being a teacher then and being somebody who is also interested in having people getting along and liking people and being liked. Where does that irritation fit in with this woman? [00:40:16] Almost like there is a kind of way you feel very on the outs. Part of your experience of that state of irritability that you were in is that you're very much outside of that. You put it really well. There's something almost implicitly there is a sense of feeling of not belonging. "They're not listening for me. They're not inviting me in. They're not even waiting for me." [00:40:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is not how it usually is because usually people are a little anxious. They are expecting me, but they don't know what to expect because they know they're going to have to do something and they're a little bit intimidated, perhaps. I'm the new guy and I'm going to be with them for a couple of hours. That's if I haven't seen them before. If I have seen them before then they're very happy. That's nice. So I feel like there's always this feeling of trying to bridge a gap. They don't know me, I don't know them, but I kind of do because I can anticipate the usual questions, the usual anxieties. I can use that to my - not to my advantage - but I can use it for everyone's benefit. It's okay to have a little bit of anxiety at times and let that be there for a bit because it helps them to think about it; but it's also good to relieve them of that anxiety at times because then they're calm and there's comic relief. So I stand up there and they look at me. And yet, in the course of an hour or two hours, they feel really good and I know that's the outcome because it's never not been the outcome. Everyone is always happy and every class people always come up and want to talk to me and shake my hand. [00:43:04] I don't know. I know that. Prior, I'm not holding onto that idea. Prior to that I'm not feeling like - oh... I'm not already in teaching mode. If I already were in teaching mode prior to showing up, if I already felt connected to people prior to actually really being connected to people, I would be already inside the parentheses as opposed to being on the outside of the parentheses. So instead of having to cross that, I would already be in it and so I'm already pleasant. I'm already accepting of who they are - that baseline. [00:43:56] They'd already be my students before I'd even met them, as opposed to there being a confrontation. I am now going to enter the room and see a bunch of strangers. But if I already see them, if I'm already connected, it's like you're walking in your front door. It's that feeling. It's sort of like - huh. This is familiar, it's nice. I'm back home, right? If I already felt that, it would be a wonderful way to approach life as opposed to knocking on a stranger's door and having to get to know them, which is actually how it works. And then after knocking on the door and they let you in, there are the niceties and so forth, but then over the course of the hour or two hours, it's sort of like - oh, we're old friends now. [00:44:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, familiarity has to be achieved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's sort of like when I was driving on the way over there there was this guy, this total jack-ass, tailgating, big, black fuck-all-of-you SUV, right? A stupid bumper sticker which I couldn't read from the distance, but it was in red. It was probably somebody pissing on Puerto Rico, one of those little guys, probably one of those things - Dominican Republic. I thought, "Here we are in our rich lives driving along, everyone generally well-intentioned, and then you've got a total asshole." And I'm thinking, "Maybe his wife is pregnant and I can't see her sitting in the passenger's seat because she's reclined. Maybe he's racing to the hospital." (laughs) I'm always trying to think, "What explains this? How does this fit into people generally trying to be nice?" (pause) [00:46:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's almost like that's what you're kind of feeling about yourself towards that teacher, that first teacher. I wasn't trying to understand her perspective or trying to be accommodating or understanding about her. You were feeling irritated. You were pissed off. You had to turn her in. And maybe in some way there was also the feeling that she wasn't reciprocal. She wasn't doing that for you. She wasn't trying to be mindful and thoughtful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She was not apologetic. She was not thankful like, "I'm really glad you came back." None of that. [00:47:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's interesting. Right, right. I was wondering if she had said anything. She hadn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She hadn't. It would have changed everything had she acknowledge and sort of said, "My bad. I'm sorry we didn't hear the doorbell ringing."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I should have warned you." Something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And meanwhile in my brain, I'm thinking I've got an exam and I have one more class to teach and I need to make the most of my time because there are some proofs that are kind of short-term memory that I really have to be thinking about prior to the exam. But then I thought, on my drive home from all of this, I thought, "You know what's positive about this is that I was so thoroughly distracted with my irritation that I didn't think about math for about an hour." (chuckles) It was sort of like pressing pause, like it snapped me out of math mode. [00:48:03] I was worried about the exam, but I wasn't actually thinking about math. I wasn't sitting at the kitchen table actually doing math so I thought, "Ehh. That's a plus. Maybe everything worked out perfectly. Maybe that's why I just showed up and nailed it, because I had an hour to just be totally distracted." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's interesting. Well we should stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I owe you. On Wednesday - I'm waiting to get paid.</p>

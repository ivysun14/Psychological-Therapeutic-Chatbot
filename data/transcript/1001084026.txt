<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, [PATIENT NAME], it has been about three years and three months since you were here last. So we've got a lot of ground to cover here. But tell me, um, what's been going on, um, and, um, how or why you've come back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's been going on. Have you been taking medication? Have you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been hospitalized at all since I saw you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, where were you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, what's the name of that place?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no, it was the [DEIDENTIFIED] place down near [DEIDENTIFIED]. Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Couldn't tell me. When was that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> August of last year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DATE]. And how long were you in for?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, only five days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's when I really got screwed up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that the only time that you were in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it was a dual diagnosis place? What was the, what were you having a problem with, the substance?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, painkillers.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was, I've been in AA and, um, sober from alcohol since ninety one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I just had a bad run of pain. I think it's myalgia, yknow, fibromyalgia, and, and migraines and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, [PATIENT NAME], what kind of painkillers were you taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] with Codeine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, but just that one, nothing else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And were you getting these illegally, off the street or anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was giving them to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And, um, how many were you taking at your worst? How many?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh god, at my worst, 10 to 15 a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. How long have you been doing that for?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Didn't take me long to hit bottom. I don't remember how long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Now what medicines were you taking at that time for your depression?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For my depression. I can't remember which ones. Since I left you, um, I had to find one that was covered by, yknow, our provider, and they set me up with a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he's an excellent doctor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And he's an asshole.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. What was the problem? Well, yknow, look, [PATIENT NAME], with all, he works for a place that they run people in and out like a, yknow, a factory, yknow. What, he didn't spend a lot of time with you, right, and he can be a little bit?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, but that's, yknow, that's medication visit. You don't spend much time. I understand that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, see, but the insurance companies say you need to spend at least fifteen minutes and some will spend five minutes. Okay, so, but anyway, he can be a little bit, um, different, all right. So you're not unique there. So what did he do with, what happened that you didn't like him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't remember the list of antidepressants that I've been on, that he changed me from and to and added to and took from since then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But all of them, bad side effects.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's not his fault.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but he wouldn't listen to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, when I went into, what the heck was the name of that place, it was a dual diagnosis place, it was right on the edge of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't remember. It treated like adolescents to geriatric.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I had a 20 minute intake with this doctor who diagnosed me as bipolar. I don't have ups.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I was put on Depakote.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Okay. At that hospitalization?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I tried to tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that I don't have ups, yknow, I just don't. It's always down. And he kept me on it and, yknow, when it came time for the blood tests for the liver and the levels and all that he said I wasn't on a therapeutic level and I was already having side effects from it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I upped it. Well, I fell asleep behind my wheel, totaled my car, ended up with a ruptured spleen, flat on my back for six days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they take the spleen out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. At [DEIDENTIFIED], helicoptered.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, boy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When was this though?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This was, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> September, October?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, this was April of this year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> April this year, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. This was when he upped the dose. I mean, I could be sitting in a chair talking to people and I just, I'd be out and I didn't realize I was doing it. When I would wake up I didn't know I was out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And, um, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he would not listen to me. And insisted I be on a, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mood stabilizer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mood stabilizer. So he wanted to put me on Abilify?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, Abilify.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something like that. And I refused to take it and he refused to treat me anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now when was that now? That was after your accident?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, that was about a month ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Okay. Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It took me a while to figure out, yknow, with my family's input and all that, that I was just toxic on the Depakote.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. So what are you taking now, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing. And how long have you been on nothing? A month?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A month to two months. After, um, he also, I was on Cymbalta too and it wasn't helping at all and I told him and he accused me of quitting medication when I thought it didn't work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, wouldn't listen. He absolutely would not listen to me when I told him about my accident.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Insisted on putting me on a mood stabilizer and I'd take it or he wouldn't treat me. Told him that, yknow, the Cymbalta wasn't doing anything and, yknow, I'm just tired of drugs messing with me. I'm, I can't do the depression, but I can't have my mind messed with anymore. And so he said you tell me whatever has worked for you. And I remember back in eighty one I was put on something called desipramine and it worked for me for a couple months. And but then I got real bad headaches. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I went off it. So I told him desipramine. Well, so he put me on it and made me, told me I had to take the Abilify or not come back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I didn't take the Abilify, but I went on the desipramine and had just horrible side effects. I mean, within two weeks I was driving down the road and seeing visions of driving into a bridge abutment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You had thoughts of suicide?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now you've been having crying spells, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, god, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been having thoughts of death or suicide again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I would never commit suicide. I had a best friend that committed suicide say five years ago, and I know what I went through and I could never do that to my family. But I can't say that I don't go to bed every night and pray not to wake up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And thinking about it. Okay. All right. Excuse me one second. Sorry. Okay, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I'm basically nonfunctional.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, how so?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't get off the couch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't force myself to do anything around the house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Problem with concentration or focusing like?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I look at a task it can be so little and it's so overwhelming I can't move.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Now, [PATIENT NAME], refresh my memory here, you are married?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're living with your husband?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, and three kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how old are they?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-three. I have to say I have a granddaughter and oh my god.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Makes you happy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. But she won't let me watch her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How come? Unstable? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They can't understand depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. [PATIENT NAME], you've been sleeping okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Appetite's okay. But I don't sleep. And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] has me on 100 mg of Seroquel at night and I still don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. So you're on Seroquel. You take it every night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. Um, [PATIENT NAME], any thoughts of, um, that don't make sense like not rooted in reality, yknow, hearing voices, believing you have special powers, anything like out there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Tell me, um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a lot of paranoid thoughts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like, um, well, ever since I went into the.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Um, my family doesn't trust me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Trust you in what way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I stole pills from, I stole pain pills from people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who's people, family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, and they think I'm a louse because I don't have a job and my life is on the couch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I know they talk amongst themselves.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Okay. [PATIENT NAME], let me ask you this. Are you still taking pills, yknow, for pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For pain, yes, but I'm not abusing them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not abusing them. What are you taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Fiorinal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many you taking now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How many am I taking now? When I need them only.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On average, once, one a day, two a day, five a day, six a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two a week, yknow, what's the average?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, maybe ten a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ten a week, okay. And, um, are you drinking at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven't drank since ninety one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. How's your memory? I mean, if I start rattling off some medicines, how do you know if you've been on them or not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mentioned desipramine, you mentioned the Cymbalta. Were you ever on Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Were you ever on, uh, a patch, Emsam?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Those are both very good medications. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. I've been on, I've been, I've been seeing someone for depression for 25 years now, so I've been on tons, but those two I know I haven't been on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Lamictal has been out about a couple years. The Emsam has been out I don't even know, has it been a year, it's a patch. Um, they're both excellent. The Lamictal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do they have, um, success with people who haven't had success with anything else?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's exactly what they're used for.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've lost all hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. These are drugs that we would use, we would say have been for, excuse me. Um, these are drugs that have been used for people who have had treatment resistance that they failed other medicines. Um, I'm going to give you a choice between those two. We'll talk about both of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Lamictal is terrific, terrific drug. Unfortunately, you have insurance right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For medication? They're both ungodly expensive. Um, but they'll both be covered, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. They probably, most of the new ones need precertified.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, the Lamictal will not need, I've never had anybody have to precertify that one. The Emsam, maybe, but you've been on so many different things that you've failed that shouldn't be a problem. The, let's talk about the Lamictal first. The Lamictal is a drug that is very safe and very easy to tolerate. It's not going to make you gain weight. There's not going to make you tired. Um, but.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I gained 40 pounds on Effexor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Unfortunately, you cannot race the dosage up. You have to start off with 25 mg, 50 mg, yknow, up to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever it takes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It takes, you may get better on those lower doses, but usually, [PATIENT NAME], it's at 100 mg we start to feel better. What happens.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever it takes, however long it takes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Listen, it's the kind of drug that, I mean I'm not going to tell you 100 percent effective for 100 percent of the people, but I will tell you that if somebody tells me that their depression didn't go away I'm surprised and I'll keep pushing it up. Usually between 100 and 200 is where people really start to do well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and I don't usually have to go higher than that. Some people, uh, I go higher. I have a woman that called me the other day that told me that she's taking 150 twice a day. In any case, um, you've gotta go with this program and I can give you samples for five weeks. At week five you'll be taking 100 mg. I don't want you to stop the medicine before you get there unless you're having some serious problems, okay? Because you've got to stick with it. And they spent a lot of money on this starter pack because they want to keep people on a fixed schedule. If you go too fast and take too much you could have an allergic reaction and break out in a rash and it's not just a regular rash, yknow, where you're itching. It could be potentially very serious, um, and while it's not unusual that people break out in rashes with these kinds of drugs, um, sometimes the rash is a more serious rash and can cause a situation that, yknow, could end, you end up in the hospital or end up dead, okay? Now I haven't had any of those things and the reason I haven't is you just follow the rules, okay? Um, I had a woman who was on this medicine and I was really hoping she would do well. She was actually in the hospital. She would come to see me from like a nursing home. And she was at 100 mg and they decided over at the hospital to increase it. And instead of increasing it slower, they went from 100 to 200, she broke out in a head to toe rash and they stopped it. Now that was a problem. But she was fine. I mean, it's just that they took off the medicine. And we didn't get a chance to see if it was going to work or not. So that would be my first choice for you. The other medicine is called Emsam and it's a patch. It's a monoamine oxidase inhibitor like the old ones were.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> MOAI?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> MAOI, right. Parnate, Nardil, one of those drugs. But except because it's a patch you put it on your skin once a day, it's absorbed into your bloodstream, doesn't go through your GI system, you don't have to worry about any kind of interaction with foods, okay? Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a lot of drugs you can't take with them too, isn't there?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, there are, right. Um, you're not supposed to be taking stimulants, um, you're not supposed to be taking other antidepressants, um, and yet I got a call from a guy who seeing somebody who runs a clinic in [DEIDENTIFIED] at [DEIDENTIFIED], um, and he was on Emsam and Ritalin which are a big, big no-no, and they do it because, yknow, you've gotta do what you gotta do if you're that resistant to something you've gotta take a risk. But you can have a risk of having a hypertensive crisis and we'd like to avoid that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now, I don't know if you remember, but I am ADHD.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't taken Ritalin for a long time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember that. I remember that. Um, I tell you, [PATIENT NAME], for my money I would put you on the, the patch sometimes is a bit of a hassle sometimes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't, I've heard so much bad stuff about MAOIs or whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, yes, but the difference is, you see, MAOIs were the drugs you go to if somebody was really bad and was not getting well. The problem is they had, you couldn't eat certain foods. And there's a lot of foods you couldn't eat. And you couldn't take medicines like, yknow, cold and cough medicines because it might make you have this hypertensive crisis, foods, etc., other drugs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about asthma medicines?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You can take them?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, some of them you can't. So the thing is with the patch.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I need to take them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, with the patch it hasn't been so much of a problem. But so and I've had people on all kinds of different medicines that haven't. The patch has worked out good. But sometimes, yknow, um, people don't like putting a patch on every day. You can get some skin irritation from the stickiness and stuff, but not a big deal. It's a good drug. It's a good choice. But I would go the Lamictal first. Um, I'd like to give you a sample pack.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like I said, um, I'd like to give you a sample pack, like I said, I think it's two weeks at 25, two weeks at 50, and then you go to 100. So I'll give you the five weeks of samples.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now can I take a sleeping aid with the Seroquel is not working?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Seroquel is a mood stabilizer. It's not a sleep medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But people use it for sleep and use it for agitation. It's not a bad drug. I wouldn't want to take it too long, but 100 mg, um, I mean you could go up, you could take, yknow, 250 or 300, but, um, that's a drug that has some serious side effects that could be associated with it. Um, if you want to stop that, we could put you on, what other sleep medicines have they tried with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know you were on Trazodone before.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Trazodone and Ambien would be hot ticket for me. When I came out of [DEIDENTIFIED] [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] took me off Ambien. I don't know why.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know why either. Um, Ambien is fine. It's not addictive, it's safe. Yknow, ten mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. Yeah, that's what, in fact, and what I liked about them was they had a thing and you could break them in half. Some nights, yknow, I didn't need the full them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why don't we do the Ambien. You were taking that, I see in two thousand and three. Let me do the Ambien. You want to just stop the Seroquel? What do you have 100s?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why don't you break them in half?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They don't, no, they don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can't break them in half?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum-um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're coated and they have no split bar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I always break them in half anyway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do I have to wean off?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have to, no, I just thought that, yknow, 'cause it is sedating and even though you may be used to it now, if you stop it, it may be more difficult for your sleep.

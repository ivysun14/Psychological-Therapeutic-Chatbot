<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 9. Interview 9.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you lose like everything in the fire?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty much, that's why I'm making up my inventory list for the insurance company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my God. The whole apartment building went through that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, not the building, just my apartment caught fire. It was only (inaudible at 0:00:15.5) apartment. The big room in it was really good and so all the stuff in there was really brilliant (ph). It was climbing up the walls.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually, after a fire there's smoke and just about everything is pretty well destroyed anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Just like all my clothes that even weren't ruined I took to the dry cleaners.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's pretty almost impossible to get that out. Wow, that's really horrible. That's too bad. Geez. You had insurance, though. You were lucky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but they're not... the insurance community is the [crookedest person anyways] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: We didn't even have any in ours... I don't have any (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it burn down yours?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I hope it never does. I figure you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a happy experience to go through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was in Manhattan... living in Manhattan, the top of a very old house, and every time the fire whistle blew, I was sure that my house was burning down because it was so old, and it looked like a tinderbox.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's what happened. I was in the apartment and it just goes... it went up instantaneously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you were in it when it started? Oh, God. That's really horrible. Man, I really feel for you. That's just a terrible experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really was frightening, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did your furniture... Oh, dang. That's too bad. It really is. Man, I just can't imagine. Sometimes I've imagined what... like hearing me say, "What am I going to do when I walk home and the place is all gone?", and like there's things you can't even think about losing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, even there were things, like things where I got them in my first travels in the world (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and they're not necessarily real expensive kinds of things, but they're totally irreplaceable, and wow, that's really rough. Geez.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. I'm probably much better than you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not so bad. It was bad for the first couple of days, but now I'm getting things organized and finishing my list for the insurance company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm coming down from an (inaudible at 0:02:42.6). I'm going over to the health clinic to make certain about what's the matter with you. Otherwise, I'm sort of okay. I haven't really... maybe it was when the receptionist called last week and said your apartment... and I thought, "Jesus Christ, that's just the horriblest thing," and I sort of haven't thought of anything because I was in sympathy for you going through this horrible mess. Geez.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know you look kind of like you feel like it's... you're uncomfortable to talk about it yourself. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not. It's just that I really get it, and not having gone through it, but as much as possible I really feel for you. It's a cruddy thing. I don't know.</p>

<p>The funny thing that did occur to me which isn't... I don't know. I was... the classes that I teach, well, last Wednesday we didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The training.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the training group, we didn't meet last week. We sat in on a class at a junior college. Somebody is teaching it and it was a phenomenal thing, but that was something that was really wild. There's this big, fat woman in there. We were talking about sort of alternative lifestyles, and this big, fat woman would not shut up and she couldn't hear a word anybody was saying, and all she wanted to know about was, was the communal sex life going on in all of our living experiences. She just kept going on and on about this and I had... we'd broken into groups and I'd been in one group and we were trying to dis... well, what the lifestyle is, and so I was kind of trying to get these people, who are sort of dodos anyway, to come up with something...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and this woman starts rattling on and on and she wouldn't shut up. They got to questioning me about what I was doing and I don't think that I'm living that alternatively really [but she was offended] (ph). But, man, she put her finger on me and she wouldn't let me loose. It was really weird. 0:04:55:0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean she kept trying to make you into what you really weren't or was trying to find out if you were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, well, she was just sort of picking on me, trying to make me ang... I'm sure she was trying to make me angry because I was getting very angry, but I refused to respond to her except very point blankly to questions because... Well, what had come up was that in a large group we were talking and that I was saying that I was going to live in Milwaukee next year and the one girl said... oh, with my boyfriend... and the one girl said, "Well, are you going to have any children?", and I said, "I don't plan on it right now and I'm certainly not thinking about it. Well, I don't know, we might adopt kids," or something like that. So this woman says, "Well, what's the matter? Can't you have any kids?", and she started blurting this out and I said, "That's kind of a personal question," just to shut her up. That was just... she was just going on and on. That was just an experience; bitchy woman on young (ph) people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So what do you really know?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But what happened was that after that we all went out. This was the people that were in the class; the dullest (sp) people and part of the staff and they were talking about programming. Well, then we met last night at the Play House, and I had given out some stuff for people to read that was really just basic stuff on groups, what groups development, and it was really very simple. I knew it was really simple and a couple of the people, who I feel are really sharp and who are probably far ahead of the rest of the people, were saying, "Like where did you get that?", because I think I'd read it before or it was very familiar. I don't know it sort of hit off in me a feeling of fear, like I'd really felt on top of this thing for once, and it was like running into somebody who was questioning sort of the... what the... well, this wasn't just first grade crap they were going to get from the girls (ph). 0:07:18.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds to me like you felt pretty solid about it, but I guess there was some kind of unsureness there and it kind of like opened up that in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, unsureness and then it was a new thing, the new thing that I've never done. That definitely would... but I felt pretty confident when I started it that it was okay, and I knew there were some people at different levels and some people that were more sensitive, who wouldn't maybe need to look, but I felt confident that I'm working with such a different, heterogeneous kind of group that it wouldn't... was necessary maybe to...</p>

<p>Well, this girl was talking about this last night, and one of the other fellows said something to me about it also, sort of... I got... I didn't get as uncomfortable in front of them as deep inside I sort of felt "eeew" and like a pulling out confidence kind of thing, and I... and I don't know where it puts me except that, I guess, realistically I'm going about it the right way, because there are some people that are really very much beginning in terms of working with people and they need to go over some simple stuff, but it's just knowing somebody else is in there who's probably at least the same level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like they're at the same level and it's kind of like you don't seem so authoritative to them. Is that kind of what you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to be authoritative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I remember you like you were talking another time about it, like how you sometimes could pool your knowledge with them, but you didn't know was it 0:09:10.0? Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like it's harder maybe to do that and to feel sure and secure, the kind of security that gives you, because you know that there's someone there... 0:09:21:2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who may realistically and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who really... who might see, uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess part of it's that. I got into that kind of a thing last Wednesday after we were out, and I don't know part of it was probably I'd had a glass of beer or so, but I was... Gary and I were talking about the young people in this agency taking some control over what they're doing, and I said, "Whether they fail or not, that's part of the process they go through of learning to become self... actualizing themselves and determining what they want," and I really was spouting Wednesday night sort of off on my tangent. It was like... and I sort of knew I was listening to myself talk, but it was... it was really weird. It was sort of like formalizing things for myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the process of saying those kind of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I didn't feel like I was offending other people. I felt like it was okay, except that after a while I realized that I'd been talking for about 30 minutes, and there was all this silence and I sort of went like that for a second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of was the feeling, "My God," all of a sudden you realized you probably had been babbling on and they probably might not even be listening to you, but they might be saying, "Listen to this woman babble," and kind of feeling kind of embarrassed all of a sudden, and you turned inside yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was okay like when I was sort of on this soap box sort of thing and kind of wanting it. The weirdest that I was talking to people was... and, I guess, maybe it was that they really were listening to me that was sort of... got scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how good was what you were saying? So what (inaudible at 0:11:24.1). Well, what did they do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, at that time, it was okay and I think I said some good things. Like the next afternoon one of the guys said like, "It didn't sound like you and Gary were saying that much different, more like the two of you were sort of battling each other" - Now, what's the word he used? - "taking each other on," and I hadn't thought of it that way. Maybe that's what we were doing, because we have a good working relationship and he's got a lot more experience than I do, but it's like I have a lot of trust in him and I'll take risks in what I know. I guess Ted had just said that, "You really were going on," and he wasn't sure about all of it, what it was all saying. That's all that someone said about it and I didn't feel so bad about it. It was a just kind of awareness of what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Building, not something from what you just said because they're kind of babbling on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then we met and picked up on a lot of it Sunday, but as we sitting there Sunday talking about what we're going to do with this program at the Y, and I guess I begin, being a part of the staff, I sort of begin to have a feel for where people are and I know there's like four people, four or five people who are really kind of beginning, and a lot of what's being covered is probably needed, but it's just like I need to show these other people, like I need to show Ted that is on top of them kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why, do you know? Well, you know... do you know what it's about? 0:13:29.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I sort of thought that I need to know myself that I know something and that I'm worth something in terms of, well, in this case teaching, that I need to prove...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're competent and you're seen as competent, and it's important for you kind of to have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a terrible fear of not being competent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because like I remember you saying that as the very first time you were here, you're like the feelings are your unsureness about being competent in your work. Isn't that kind of like when you see yourself saying competent-sounding things to people and you kind of give them the sense that they're being impressed that you're competent, it gives you a sense of competence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. And also it's like when I see people who are obviously incompetent, or maybe not so obviously incompetent but that I think are incompetent, it just really irritates me, particularly if they're in a position where their incompetence destroys something that positively could be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Incompetence in the position (inaudible at 0:14:49.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like I'm really scared that I'm... that I may go out and finally get a job and as a result of having this degree and this experience, that I'm going to be expected to produce, and really scared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like kind of you're going into something and then you'll get a degree, but do you have kind of what you think that should represent? Kind of like when you go out there and you're in the real world with a real job, not kind of a training... a job that may be part of a training or whatever, when it's really real and you're making $10,000 a year or whatever you make in teaching, will you measure up all that you're supposed to do? And you feel you're supposed to do, I guess, what other people feel you're supposed to do. Can you do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Part of it's like I sometimes I feel that I cut corners at school, because sometimes I find it boring; sometimes it's not... sometimes it's probably too hard and I avoid stuff that's... that may prove me to be incompetent or professors who are very intimidating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you stay away from things where you feel like you might fail. Is that it? 0:16:24.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's actually faculty who might put you down and make you feel incompetent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like there's this one professor, who I have a great deal of respect for, a brilliant woman. I had her for one class, but she's the most intimidating person I've ever met in my life and she scares the hell out of me, and I considered taking a course from her and I thought, "It's not worth the anxiety I'm going to go through to have to deal with her," and I just... and then maybe that's an extreme where it's very justified to avoid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of like you said the case of the (inaudible at 0:17:07.1), where you can feel yourself avoiding it. I guess kind of the general thing is avoiding things, contacts where your sense of competence might be threatened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm not so sure how intelligent I am. Like I have lots of doubts about insights that I have, and I've said that before, an insensitivity toward people, and so I'm really afraid of failing. I think because I'm... because it'll just prove that I'm not good, and I guess I don't feel that this... think the volunteer training is that serious. It's just sort of... it did come... it came into my mind. It's just kind of a... but that does happen you know, and maybe that's not so bad a thing or uncommon a thing, but it tends to keep me from even wanting to get a job. Like there's certain kinds of things I know I can probably get into and be very successful at, but they're mediocre kind of jobs that I really don't want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the kind of stuff you want to do is the kind of stuff that requires that kind of proficiency and sensitivity you're not sure you have, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it'll be challenging and then they'll probably continually challenge whether I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, I guess, they're kind of scary because you run the risk of going down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of not being... of not being able to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seeing yourself fall down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess also I find myself very much sort of competing with Don. Like he sort of directed in the same kind of work, like we met working with kids in an Upward Bound Program.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Is he a teaching?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, he's in college, but he's doing... he's got a job working as a... he's got the job that I used to have, and I guess I feel... and I don't like it, but sometimes I feel I'm very competitive. Like the summer that I took over working full-time as the assistant director was while he was still a counselor. Like he's got good ideas and he's very sensitive. It's like I... like we just got into fights all the time, because I couldn't take criticism. I couldn't take his suggestions. 0:19:55.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But was it that it was from him that made it so hard. I mean, do you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it was really important for him, too. You really felt a real want to have respect for your knowledge or competence and whatever from him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I wanted to be able... I want to be able to take things from him, just as I like want to... like I know that there's going to be things that I might be able to offer him, because he doesn't have some of the skills I've picked up, and it's very hard for us to give and take things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to get... it sounds kind of like there's a general thing going there. It's like you want to give... take the criticism from him and be able to give it to him, but it sounds like it's very restrained.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it is. It's really hard and I don't like being told, particularly to someone I can stand up to, and that's like... like I've been brought up in authority... I hate authority figures, but I take crap from authority figures, like bosses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The ones you have to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like bosses, but when there's someone I can question...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some kind of peer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...a peer, and in a close relationship as Don and I have, I have no qualms about standing up to him. It's almost like the same thing, like a threat to my intelligence, a threat to my competence. 0:21:28.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess it's also... in part it's because of who he is. I mean, it's in part because of who he is, like you want him. Like a lot of your... kind of like a lot of your sense of your self in part comes from your sense of adequacy about your work, and Don is someone who is very important to you and you want him to view you as that kind of competent self person to work with people. And kind of when he suggests things to you, it's kind of probably like you don't take them neutrally or undisinterestedly until you hear the edge of them, which is a comment on yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure the edge is there, but I interpret it that way I think. Like I can take...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like it may not be there. You might be oversensitive in interpreting it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can take help like from my roommates. I'm not sure, but I may have... it may also have a thing to do with his being a male, too, and that I feel very much a need to be an equal, if not better than men in doing things, and I'm not sure if part of it might be his being a man talking to me and giving me suggestions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And men, I guess, the thing about men is... your man is that women probably feel like the men, I'm not inferior and I'm not inferior to my man, and I don't want to be put down kind of like this, what you're saying here to me, "You're big and I'm little." 0:23:05.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it occurs to me that I might also from not being able to take stuff from him is that it's almost like I've... I almost like feel like I have to be superior to him, and it sort of goes along with that little thing about the clothing thing, the way I said to him, "What are you wearing all that stuff for?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you wearing it to impress me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that maybe I put him down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of put him down to push yourself up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel with him like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I've wondered if I do that and I think sometimes I do that to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because in a way it's kind of something similar to putting... flaunting your knowledge or something like that. Do you understand that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, it's a similar kind of thing, kind of a push down so you can be up.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I guess it scares me to think that I'm that way to him and I'm really afraid that I do that, that I am dominating and I... sometimes I'm conscious of that feeling that I'm dominating him and like he called last night. He's got this one course from last semester that he has to take an exam on and he's got - What was the other thing? - and then like I always ask him about, "Well, did you get that taken care of yet?", and I think I say it in terms of just, "Are you getting it done?", because I know he sometimes just lets things go. Sometimes I'm afraid it's that same kind of thing like playing mother, "Did you do this?" </p>

<p>Like a couple of months ago he was stopped by the police in Ithaca. He got this huge ticket and got in a whole bunch of crap from them and then he got a lawyer and he hadn't heard anything at all from them. He got his license back and he wasn't supposed to and I said, "Well, you ought to check it out just in case," and I keep asking him, "Have you checked that out yet? Do it. Don't let it catch up with you," and I know... because part of it's a fear that... see, last spring he just went... he was... he went into a great deal of debt. He was working for Upward Bound last year full-time and then he quit and he kind of... he comes from a very poor family and he said he went bezerk having money. His father started borrowing a great deal of money from him. In fact, most of the debts were because of his father, which is another thing that I have very little tolerance about as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you say more about this, because I remember another time you said like you there were a lot of warrants (ph) or something. You were getting statements and letters from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like he... well, last year... well, he didn't let me know all this, probably because he knew I wouldn't be very...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd be hard on him. 0:26:33.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like when I finally found it out is that he had about $6,000 worth of debt and he was really lucky that some very close friends of ours gave him some money to pay it off. Most of it was... I'd say about $3,000 to $4,000 of it was probably his father had borrowed from him, or he had taken the loans out to give his father because his father couldn't support their family, and then he was buying clothes. He bought this car. He went just crazy.</p>

<p>And so that was all taken care of and, I guess, part of the fear that something is going happen now, and I'm very afraid of his parents asking him to do all these things. Well, now, he doesn't have a cent to his name. He's barely getting through school. When I did know, I knew his father was borrowing money from him last year and I used to really be hard because I said, "Look, you've got to set some limits just realistically," and I don't know how I came across. Maybe it was... at the time, I was just so upset that his father kept doing these things to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they were kind of... you were unsure about kind of like are you coming on too hard or being really fair with Don in respect to money and, I guess, kind of like with respect to doing things with people socially, kind of like you feel like you do put him down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know he's good with people, and I know he's probably better with people than I am, and it's probably harder for me to take that kind of criticism, and it's probably a different thing then for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like that's something that's really... that's something that's really a part of you that you know... kind of know even better, but you don't want to kind of see him or feel that he's being above you and he's better than this. You kind of mothering him, I guess, is just another kind of thing that you do. It is a different kind of thing isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I... I want him to be... I know he's good with people and I respect that in him, like I respect that a great deal, and I want... I know sometimes he's got good things to say. I can sit and listen to him now. There were times when I couldn't even listen to him finish telling me something,and I want to be able to take from him criticism or help and I want to give it, too, without feeling that I'm being put down when, in fact, I'm not. I want him to fulfill... be able to fulfill his needs and his abilities. It's sort of a selfish kind of thing, a selfish need that I... kind of like, I guess, I feel right now. It's like selfish need to be better than he is and when I don't like... like I don't like that, but the first summer I knew him, I needed a lot of support because I didn't know what I was doing. I'd never worked with kids. I'd never worked with Indian and Black kids before. Didn't know what I was doing. So his help, I took it all. Sometimes...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You needed it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did and I knew it. At the end of the summer, I'd look back and I'd say some things were kind of put down, not giving me credit for what I might have and all these things. Well, maybe that's part of why now it's very hard for me to do that is that I had to take so much. 0:30:51.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You needed it and now you kind of... you're not feeling unsure like you were when you worked with those kids or as much I'm sure as sometimes (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Patience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you're kind of saying, "Well, I've taken a lot. No more."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it's the way that we give and take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what... I mean, because you were saying you don't know if he's intending it as a criticism. Can you say something about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to think. I guess the last time we sat down and we were sort of talking about working with the kids, we were drinking and when I realized that I was getting drunk I said, "Let's not talk anymore," because it didn't make... and it wasn't. But I'm trying to think. I guess there was one, a couple of kids. I go and I see them, but it's like once a month at the most. I'm so far removed from it, but I still have some good relationships with kids. If I were there more often over a longer stretch of time, I'd probably be a lot more effective in really helping the kids work stuff out. I guess I was sort of asking him about what kids... or how the kids were doing or what his contact with them was and stuff like that and it was, I guess, just sort of general things, and I felt better about that conversation than we'd ever had, that I was really listening to what he was saying, but he was close to the situation I was in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other times does he kind of... you know how kind of when people are saying things, they can say the same content that they've been saying with different toneages (sp?). When he talks like... gives you help or gives you suggestions, does it have kind of that putdown (inaudible at 0:32:53.7) or is it kind of... you know there's another kind like where you just say things. You're saying it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think I read into it that's it a challenge, not so much that it's a putdown. I think I read into it that it's a challenge. I have to prove that I'm capable, because I find myself easily put on the defensive when we're talking. You know, I don't know that it's my reading into it, but then he would say to me like, "I'm going to start working full-time again and I'll need your help, like you know some things that I don't anymore," or, "You've moved into some stuff that probably would be helpful," and I guess I'm not sure that... the feeling I had about his saying that was that, "I'll let you help me and maybe you'll really have something," rather than, "I really need a resource once in a while, really need something," and I don't know. I guess that's what I read into it. I don't know whether I had formulated that kind of feeling then. As I think about it, it's sort of... though it seems to me that I felt, "I'll let you help me and I'll let you give some suggestions." I guess I would have to really pay attention to what happened. 0:34:41.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's kind of like what's... well, he has to pay attention to what's happening with you. It's kind of like... I mean, you could hear something being said to you, a suggestion, and you kind of... immediately it kind of sets off a flashing light. I mean, talking metaphorically anyway; incompetence it flashes in red (ph). So you can't even listen, and even can't listen to even not just what is being said but also to how it's being said, but also substantively that it can be helpful because it has all this tension because it's loaded to you. It has connotations, that flashing light of incompetence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last night when we were talking, we were throwing about suggestions for... we're going to have to pool all these kids together on Saturday morning now. We're figuring out how we're going to work this to get ideas out of them. I kind of threw in a model that I've picked up in this education class. It's really kind of neat and I think it offers flexibility to really be kind of an interesting thing. Well, it'll be interesting for me to try it and see how it works in this situation. Other people threw in other ideas. It's like we were... I stopped after that, but I was so afraid that like, "Wow. I hope we aren't going to compete with these proposals to see whose gets picked to use," and like Gary did a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That probably... did it kind of take it out of significance to you, "Gee, his gets picked and mine don't"? Do you know what I mean? 0:36:28.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: You think... yeah. And I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't... I guess I didn't think that as much as...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Think it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't think that out as much as it sounded like we were doing that and I said, "Wow. Don't be competitive like that. This isn't what you're here for," and Gary did a very skillful thing in sort of integrating all of the things, which is very good to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After we're all through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to avoid any of that. I don't know, except that it did occur to me that it was almost a competitive thing that we're doing, and I don't think that the other two people... I don't know. Maybe I underrate myself in thinking that the other two people wouldn't look at it as a competitive thing, but it went through my mind and I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of knew, and kind of what you're saying in general leads to that, like when you... like how you're unsureness about your competency, how it kind of gets in the way in a lot of areas when you're working, and how do you act, and with Don, too. There's kind of a need to prove your competency to yourself and be supersensitive about something that would reflect on your incompetency or make you feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had thought of what Ted had said in terms of the class was... it was pulling out the confidence in myself, but it's also I guess is that challenge to being competent in what I'm doing. I don't like... I don't like being competitive, but I often feel that it's sort of something I've grown up with.</p>

<p>Like I'd always had to compete with my brothers, or at least my one brother who is much bigger than I am and older than I am, and I always felt superior to him academically and intellectually mainly because of school. He barely passed school, but I know he's an intelligent person but school-wise he wasn't. He didn't make it very well and I always felt like I was the intellectual in the family, like I was the superior one that way. 0:38:47:0</p>

<p>Like there was a lot of competition in athletic kinds of things. Like when I was little, there weren't girls in my neighborhood anyway, so I was competing with guys all the time. I was playing baseball and football and all that kind of stuff. It was like I was good and I felt like I had to be good. I had to be really good in order for them to let me play, but I don't like the feeling of having to feel competitive with people, which probably goes along I don't like to feel like... and I wish I could be comfortable with my competence. Okay, I have some limitations and accept them and, I guess, things come in the way of that when I find myself threatened sort of.</p>

<p>Here's the thought that goes through my mind like right now, I don't know if talking about it helps me. Like I guess I... it's that same thing about figuring a way to deal with it so... to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like... yeah, go on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Figuring a way to be more comfortable with what I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like, "Well, I see it now, but what should I do about it?", like, "This is the way I am. It upsets me, now how do I cancel (ph) it? At least I won't be upset. It won't bother me anymore". 0:40:17:1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I just say that to myself, accept myself. I have to accept what I have, deal with what I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you do that, like when you say... well, can you... do you ever find like you can say, "Well, this is the way I am. It's not the ideal way I'd like to be, but it doesn't mean I'm horrible". I mean, do you understand what I'm saying? When you... like, I guess, you hear yourself saying these things. Like does it make you feel awful about yourself ? I mean, do you feel like you can accept it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sort of helps and I have... like once in a while it's like a rationalization and, I guess, it sort of helps just... and it kind of helps me come back to earth and stop looking at expectations that are beyond, too hard to reach. It sort of helps me stand on the ground...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See where you are in the here and now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it sort of helps to say that to myself, "Well, look, you have some limitations. Just accept where you are". Sometimes I get mad, because I don't I do as much maybe in terms of listening to what people have to say in terms of school studying types of things to improve what I have, to improve on what I have. It's like the thing of sliding through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I agree with that, sliding through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like sometimes I feel like I take an easier road, that what I took earlier and, I guess, that sort of makes me angry in the sense that I might be more competent. I might be better. 0:42:11.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might be selling yourself short, like you might go up to this intimidating professor and find that you can, indeed, not be so intimidated and hold your own. It's kind of like your fear isn't fear in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like when you suggest that, I could never go up to her and talk to her. Like having to go and talk to her about a paper was an excruciating experience and... I don't know. I just don't think I could... every time I see her it just sends fear through me kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're remembering it and kind of when you think about it now, you still have fear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I've ever been so intimidated by anybody who I've had so little contact with really and I'm... I couldn't begin to deal with her and attempt to overcome that fear. I don't think I would even try to do that. I guess it's more wanting to deal with what I find easier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's kind of not in the realm of possibility. It's kind of, well, that's kind of like at the end of... I mean, there's a whole lot of things that are a lot easier to deal with that I'm afraid to deal with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of a feeling that maybe some day I can deal with a woman like her or a man like her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like that will be the ultimate thing, but it's no reason to kind of plunge into the hardest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She'd just put me down without doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's so kind of like the fear... like when you're saying like maybe - or I was saying it - I thought you were saying it about selling yourself short. Kind of like you have. There may be a lot of... like you do feel kind of unsure and stay away from things that might threaten it, but maybe you're staying away from too much. Like maybe you can be doing things that, indeed, might just give you kind of a... that kind of feeling about yourself. 0:44:40.04</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sort of place that in the realm of a generalization in terms of people never use themselves to the fullest of their capacities. And like, I guess, I rationalize my not using school, not getting as much out of it as I could, just to never reaching the capacities that I may have, and maybe there's a fear that I already have, too. I don't know. It's like I often wonder how the hell I'm even in graduate school; that I had never, never expected to see myself being able to get through any kind of graduate program, even though I don't consider SSA's graduate program to be very difficult, and it sometimes amazes me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of... one time in your life that seemed like one of those things that might have been a little beyond what you could do or felt you could do and why, but here you are, not through you but inside of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I don't why I was thinking - it was this morning or something - about high school and this girl that was in this... well, the people who are all the real smarties in these classes. Oh, I know what it was. I was thinking about psychology. I've never had psychology classes. Took one semester of a course in high school and I was remembering that I had slept through most of it, because the guy was extremely boring. And all of these... or these numbers of people and this one girl, who was extremely articulate, she was smart, and how I used to really kind of envy them being very smart and sort of feeling a little bit better that, well, I haven't done so badly. I've managed to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean dropped out of high school and here you are in graduate school</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that kind of thing, but it's really weird that... look at them having... using themselves fully, doing as much to get out of something as much as they could and, I guess, just sort of an inadequate feeling of not doing as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a sense of not really... well, you kind of look at them and you can see kind of what... well, they were people who seemed to really fully utilize this potential. Is that kind of a ((inaudible at 0:47:23.7) and then your potential is that you kind of feel like haven't really... you haven't really tapped and given it a chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sometimes think that the reason I don't is just sort of an inadequacy in itself, that I just can't ever use it myself fully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you (inaudible at 0:47:47.2). Do you mean like there's... that's kind of like the higher level of feeling and that the thing you feel inadequate about is that you don't use your adequacies.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess it's hard, like one of the (inaudible at 0:48:01.7) is that you don't use some of your potential is in part because you're frightened a little bit because it's like a test.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the higher up level of using myself or attempting challenging things, the closer I come to finding my limit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and more likely to fail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like, I guess, I don't want to know where that is in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to know where it is, because it might be kind of lower than you'd like it to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know whether I can really deal with a big failure on my part. I don't think I've... most everything that I've tried to do I've been successful at it. Well, maybe not at the highest level but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But within some kind of... you've been successful in a reasonably acceptable way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess the thought of failing at something... like going out and getting a job now. That's something that I'd really like to do that would be a challenge. That's very frightening, because that may be a big kind of failure and I'm not sure I could even admit to it, which is part of overcoming it being a failure to my way of thinking. It would be, well, okay, like that's too much, and I'm not sure I'd even be able to say to myself that's too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might take a little (inaudible at 0:50:01.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I guess... I don't know. I feel sort of like quitting. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Your time is just about up anyway.</p>

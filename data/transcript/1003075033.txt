<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That our clinic is closing here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We just found out a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I knew there were, that there was a shakeup, but I didn't know the clinic was closing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  They actually had the wrong information in the paper, so, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  So what happens with you then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I'm not sure yet.  Um, the plan is to consolidate everything at [DEIDENTIFIED] office.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, about a third of the clinicians will be laid off.  We don't know who they are as of yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and even if there was an opportunity at [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't know what it looks like.  So once we get that information, um, and when people decide what they're going to do.  And once they decide what day they're going to close the clinic —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Apparently, there will be a letter going to you that's indicating all that information.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So my guess, though, it will be probably within the next three months or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So are you leaving one way or the other?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'm leaning to looking at everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there are a number of opportunities out here.  If I don't go to [DEIDENTIFIED] office, I'll be practicing somewhere else down here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And how would I find you?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, the, well if, uh, I'm laid off that will, they'll indicate things will be, um, where I'll be going at that point.  Um, if I elect to leave, then I'll just send out a letter to people just indicating, um, here's where I am.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so you'll be aware of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've had some doctors that have left that don't, they don't say where they go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's, I think that more of people voluntarily —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Leaving.  [INAUDIBLE].  Um, and if we're laid off then they'll put that information in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So stay tuned.  A, again if you, should be getting a letter in the next couple weeks.  If  you don't get one by the end of June, uh, why don't you just call here and find out what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I assume they checked your address and everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, they did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how have things been going for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  Uh, we just got, my last, my youngest daughter just graduated high school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, big event, and, um, we ha, my, my mother—in—law and mom came out from New York.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they come together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But everything went well, so that was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And where is she, uh, this is, daughter, you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where is she going to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going to go up to the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did she pick that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well my older daughter lives in California, in [DEIDENTIFIED].  And she kind of brainwashed her into going out to California.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it snows, and the cold and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Forty degrees in June.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  And, yeah, and my youngest daughter doesn't really like the winter, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's a good time to give it shot somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and she starts in the fall then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Will she be living on campus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where is that located?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, right in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've been there a few times.  I just don't recall really —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a beautiful campus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just beautiful out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well good.  You have a place to go to visit in the winter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That'd be nice, but it's going to be hard to see her leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I assume she'll be back for the summers or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, I'm going to try, we're going to go in August to bring her out there, and probably in October, I'll go out and visit her.  And then she'll be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Going to try to make it so that she can come whenever she wants.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you had, have you had a graduation party or are you going to have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We didn't have, like, a big open house type party.  We just did our family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your family?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We had everybody over to our house on Friday when she graduated, and then on Saturday we went down to [DEIDENTIFIED], and we went on one of those riverboat cruises.  And we had, they have, like, a buffet dinner and stuff, food stuff.  So it was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On Saturday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  In the rain.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the rain.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  Friday was a beautiful day —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Beautiful day, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But Saturday it rained.  Yeah.  But they had, you know, the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's enclosed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's enclosed.  Yeah.  So.  And, um, I wanted to tell you, I don't know if it's true or not, but I found out that, um, I have lactose and fructose intolerance.  And, um, I was doing some reading, and it says that if you have fructose intolerance you don't absorb some of the hormones that make you feel good.  And now I've stopped taking fructose, and I feel a lot better, so I'm wondering if it's, have you heard of any correlation?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Heard anything.  No idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Because from what I read —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, if you have fructose intolerance and you stop fructose, you are going to feel better.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have that irritant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The reality, though, is, um, you still need tons of fructose in your body.  You need fructose to survive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, fructose or regular sugar?  Because I can have regular sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, but, [COUGHING], fructose is in all, in just about all carbohydrate kind of things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hard to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  The reality is that, I mean, your body breaks down sugars into stearic based sugars, and then they build them back out, and all of them put together are fruc, and the body needs fructose to service.  So, um, it's probably not complete a fructose intolerance, because if that was the case you wouldn't be alive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, uh, it may be that the enzymes that you need to break down fructose aren't as active as they should be, and that's probably why you don't feel particularly well eating a lot of fructose.  And if you cut back on the fructose, well then you feel better.  Much like people who have, had the lactose —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have that, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And  it's not, even if you have a complete 100% deficiency, it's relative.  But you need to have —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lactose as well to survive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I was just curious, because I had read that you absorb some of the hormones in the intestines, and if you don't have the enzymes to break, break things down properly they don't get absorbed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I, this, I mean those enzymes you're talking about are a specific kind of the lactose, or lactase and fructose, maltase.  These are all enzymes in the GI system that absorb the, allow for the absorption of the sugars.  I don't know how it at all would relate to hormones, which are proteins and these are completely different things.  There may be some theory out there if you have a deficiency in the ability to absorb the, um, sugar, uh, type products that may mean you also a deficiency with the protein [INAUDIBLE] enzymes that help to break down the proteins to amino acids.  I don't know about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Again, hormones are proteins.  Fructose, maltose, lactase, all those things [INAUDIBLE] for lactose or sugars [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, I, I'm lying, I do feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Feel better, well that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're, um, still with the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The 2 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how do you, how are you sleeping with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, appetite and weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  I lost 15.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So since getting off the Zyprexa how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, since I've been on this lactose and fructose —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, watching that, because I was, I was drinking a lot.  Coke and, you know, I, I think that was making me gain some weight, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.  The fully caffeinated, full calorie?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I was drinking around three cans a day.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, let me see, that, it's about, uh, 400 calories.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you drink tap water, even diet beverages —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something , that, that would help with a tremendous amount of weight loss.  And the Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, still taking 100 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And the Ativan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take that at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you doing on your supply of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I need refills on everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  Are you still on the simvastatin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how about the Protonix?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I don't need that any more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And which pharmacy are you using?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I have to do the mail order.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Which, uh, mail order company?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> CVS Caremark.  So it, do you think that I should keep everything the same or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you're doing so well.  I'm more apt to say, "Yes."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because every time we've tried lowering the Ativan or the Zoloft —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or get you off the Zyprexa, these [INAUDIBLE] agents for whatever reason, uh, the symptoms start coming back again, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're on a really low dose of Abilify.  So, yeah, I would say stay with them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now do you want me to fax the prescriptions to Caremark?  Because, if you get it out of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um, do you have the fax number?  Because I don't have it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We can fax it there.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that'd be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So even if you do leave voluntarily, will send me a letter?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.  I will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Ativan is the only one I can't fax, because I have to hand sign that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'll do that.  And we are making appointments beyond, uh, [DATE].  So I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you're getting, um, well, within the next two weeks we'll have our, we'll figure out what we're doing here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if I do stay with [DEIDENTIFIED], then, uh, you can just call and make an appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, um, probably by the end of June.  But if you haven't heard anything by the end of June, I would just call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, when do you think I should come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Six months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Great.  Well good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All righty.  Have a great summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.  Good luck with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, please, let me know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll let you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll meet you out front here with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, uh, okay.</p>

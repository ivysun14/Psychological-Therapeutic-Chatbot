<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) Seems that all I can think about, whether I'm here or at h—, outside at school or at home, is this confusion I've felt recently on what I'm trying to do as a teacher and how, especially since Monday, I feel as if I've just lost sight of all my goals and, and standards and expectations and so forth.  And I just will feel, when, when I get up in the morning now, that I don't even know how I can go in and teach because I just don't know what I'm trying to do.  I felt that way especially today because I had a mother come in just to visit the class.  And the temptation was to go back to the way I used to do things, which would be just to have them marching around not making any noise.  And I, I just, but I, I not only didn't want to but I just somehow there's, I don't have any heart in it and I just can't do it if I don't have any heart in it.  So I continued to sort of muddle along in what I've been attempting to do and it worked out better than I thought it would.  But still I, I have this feeling of being extremely uneasy because I don't know exactly what I want and how much of it's, what I'm doing, is good and how much of it's kind of ridiculous and how much of it's freedom for the children to explore and how much of it's just sort of license.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I, I find I don't have an entirely clear picture about the, the sorts activities you're referring to.  Could you give me some instance of —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, they —</p>

<p>ANALYST: How they kind of conflict that, sort of things that seem at issue?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, it just seems that the whole time I've been at the school what I have seen as the goal, the good teaching, was having the children be very quiet, doing a lot of paperwork, sitting at their tables or sitting up in the front for discussions.  And there was, the only time they could ever just sort of roam around and do things that were set up in the room for them or that they'd brought in was at the very end of the day.  And as the year went on and, and art activities that they did at the end of the day became something that they spent more time on they might not even have time then to do it.  So I began to feel that the time in the morning which is the first hour or a little bit less than an hour, which is used for the main work, the reading and writing and so forth, uhm, that there should be more opportunities there for them to just work with each other and talk and explore and move about.  And I just began to feel more and more all I was asking them to do was something that they shouldn't be asked to do at all, which is be quiet and sit still and, "What's the matter with you if you can't?"  And it got to the point where I couldn't ask it of them and yet I didn't have anything to replace it with.  Or, I've begun to, I've had been working a lot on different kinds of games that they can play which use knowledge they know now of the sounds.  And we're using i_t_a so they can, if they know the sounds — and they were working on blending them so they can read their own words.  And they, they like these games but still you do get noise.  And you get a lot of movement.  And I don't know when it's to a purpose and, and when it isn't because this isn't something the school accepts, on the whole.</p>

<p>And so I'm fighting myself in, in what I think is right and not knowing what I think is right, really.  And then the fear that somebody might come in and just say, "What's going on here?"  But I don't feel I can know unless I experiment this way and see what the results are and sort of feel it along with the children.  It's just that it makes it awfully hard when you're having to help guide them and you don't know (laughs) exactly where you're going.  And, or I've tried to do more with letting them have times for dramatic play inside because they only have, at the very most, 20 minutes outside for any kind of dramatic play.  And then they're on the roof which is a very small area.  And the equipment is quite limited.  And not that we have that much in the room but we try to, once in a while, to do activities that are set up, since they don't have dress-up stuff, and, and let them act out.  And of course, sometimes if they're being animals they'll be very noisy and wild.  And I don't know, I've never seen children do this so the only thing I know about it is what I've read in books.  And I don't know then when they're naturally being noisy and loud and when it's just getting overstimulated and out of hand.  And so this will bother me because, again, if the headmaster walked in when they were doing this, he would absolutely die because he just doesn't approve of this at all.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But I gather, from what you've said yesterday and the day before, that you, you're not certain about where your supervisor stands on this.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think she approves of it but I don't know in what form.  And I th—, and this is where I would like her guidance because I think she has a much clearer idea on how, how this type of thing can be best used, whereas I'm just finding out now.  Because I've never, I've never even observed it, except in play of individual children in homes and things like that, which is entirely differ—, it's not entirely different but with 20 boys it's much more stimulating if they're all together there acting out.  (Pause) And I th—, the other thing that was bothering me was, uhm, that made me start to just say no matter what else I'm doing to supplement the program that LKC has, I've got to do more to give these children more freedom, this particular class anyway, is because they were so easy to boss around and to make them fear not getting my approval that I could just see I was, without even meaning to — I had tried to keep things fairly free all year, but still within what the headmaster would approve — and I could just see that they were just kind of losing everything.  They, they were beginning not to have personalities and they were beginning to all have this scared look and not fight back or do anything.</p>

<p>And last year I had a class that had enough individuals who just weren't going to take it, if they couldn't sit still they weren't even going to try, so that I don't know, I just, it never hit me this way.  But this year it just seemed awful what I was doing to them.  And I think this, since Christmas vacation, for some reason it's all just come to a head because when I got back and different times we were discussing things, they just didn't seem to have any life at all.  And now at least they have a lot of life.  But I don't, (laughs) now I don't know what to do with it.  I'm just afraid everything's just going to turn into sort of a free-for-all.  And the other problem is, too that we have a very small room so that probably some things that would go in a much bigger room can't go.  And I don't know, I'm always afraid that there's going to be some horrible accident because I won't foresee that something's getting out of hand until it already has.  I, I think I have a real fear of that too because it would, then if there's a terrible accident people will know about it.  And I guess I'm afraid it'll reflect back on me too and make people think, well, that wasn't very responsible of her.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think there's another aspect of it too that is disturbing me.  And perhaps this is really what bothers me more about it.  There's something, as much as I didn't want to misuse having them want my approval which gave me a control over them, now that I'm taking, changing my approach, I don't know, the, other things become important enough so that I think they still want my approval but as in, just because I'm an adult but, you know, you don't get that quick obedience or anything.  And I don't know quite how to handle this, either, and when to be upset by it and when it's just a natural thing on children's part.  (Pause) And I think I'm getting afraid how it'll affect what they do in other rooms too because I came in at the end of their music period today and by letting them be more boisterous, they naturally don't settle down as easily.  And in music class they're expected to sit very quietly and unless she gives them the chance to move around and make noise, they're not supposed to make any for 20 minutes.  And I don't agree with the way she does things but it is the way she does them and it's going to make it v—, harder for her to do them that way.  So unless somebody approves of what I'm doing I guess I'm afraid that I'll get criticism that now my class is going wild.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I guess I'm just feeling frustrated about it too.  Even when I think what I'm doing is right and that things are working well and I feel that I know what I'm about, I feel frustrated because I just don't have enough resources so that I can use the opportunities that arise.  I don't think of activities sometimes, that could fit into a certain situation.  And for helping individual children I don't have a very big repertoire of things that could be good and that could be done by individual children while others are making noise someplace else.  So even when it gets to the point where I think I could handle it, I still wouldn't know what to do.  And I just feel I have to read and read and read and that, well, naturally I would assign myself a task way beyond the normal amount, I guess.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, what I hear, uhm, you, you, you seem — the central point of this, ah, as you put it, always comes back to the fear you have that, on the one hand, the boys will either be cowed and scared and completely obedient and follow direction, ah, without question or, on the other hand they, ah, want to do exactly what they want to do and in that sense be out of control and wild.  What occurs to me is that you have several times lately described your own dilemma in just those terms, in your relationship with MSCZ and some other contexts, that you feel very strongly yourself that you either want to lead and control absolutely or follow totally, in much the way you describe your fear about the boys.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, so it's almost that I can't conceive there could be any middle-ground with them because I can't, I haven't experienced it myself.  (Silence) I was just thinking that, uhm, what came to me first in terms of how do you reach the middle-ground with the children, and this is probably why I don't experience it too, there's something about being respected for what you are.  And I do know that with the children, the times I've felt this type of freedom that I've been trying to establish has been working, is when I am honestly respecting them for what they are and what they're doing and listening to them without any idea of where I want it to go so that I'm only listening to what I want to hear.  And then from what I hear them say, because I have really listened, I can just contribute to their ideas and those times they aren't at all either just plain obedient or disrespectful or whatever to me.  I mean, it's a very nice relationship then.  (Pause) So I can see, thinking about it that way, or I can understand a little bit more how I can work it out.  But I still don't see how I can help myself.  Because that must be why I'm so afraid of things like how my reports were going to be accepted.  Or, I'm sure today I was even more nervous than I'd admit about the fact the mother was coming to visit. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I sometimes wonder, too, how can I really, honestly have respect for the children, however close I think I am to it now, how, how can I really have it if I don't feel that way about myself?  And if I don't feel that what I do really counts or should be respected, or that it's right for me and, and might be criticized, I don't really see how I can work out this other dilemma at school.  (Pause) And that, there's another thing that has bothered me this week and off and on has bothered me ever since I've been the teacher rather than the assistant in the room.  And it's something — well, first of all, I know I'm very competitive with my assistant or feel very jealous of her successes when I don't feel I'm successful in those areas.  But there's something, there's a quality to the boys' response to her at times, at least at times I notice it or think it's there, that, I don't know, it's almost as if they just have more confidence in her.  (Pause) And I thought of that, I guess, because uhm, she appears to be, as far as I can tell, a very confident person.  (Pause) In fact, sometimes I think it just makes me mad because she's so confident and I'm so unconfident. (Pause)</p>

<p>  And my thinking even used to be, when I was an assistant, working for a person who was, I think, as confused as I am about herself and not having confidence and also she used to order me around and treat me in sometimes in very much the way I have, on occasion, treated my assistant, I used to just think, well, I am only an assistant so I don't really count.  And so I would avoid setting up situations that could make the person I worked for then jealous.  But really that was probably an excuse for just not mixing with other faculty or entering a conversation as if I had just as much right in it as she did if we were talking together.  Because she always wanted me to be sort of in the background.  And so now I think in a way, when I'm feeling upset about myself I get annoyed at my assistant who doesn't sort of do the same, which would be being a foil for me, really.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's almost like, times when I'm feeling this way, I'll keep trying to think, well, here's the problem and now what's the solution.  But then all of a sudden I'll just think I can't do anything and I'm just a failure at everything.  And, and then I'll think, well, now all I'm doing is feeling sorry for myself and even if I am, I have to keep pretending I'm not.  And so then I kind of go back into, essentially it seems what I'm doing is just trying to hoodwink everybody else and cover up for what I actually believe are my terrific inadequacies.  (4-minute silence) But there's something else that I tend to do, which I became aware of particularly — well, just now I was.  I was beginning to think again on what can I do specifically at school with the children to be a better teacher.  And the time when I thought I had not taken some materials down for a mother to pick up and, and was afraid that we wouldn't get them after I'd told her they'd be there, I couldn't stand it because I just, there was nothing I could do.  It was late at night when I realized it and I had to wait till the next morning.  And it was extremely frustrating to me.  And I think I always feel this way, that I have to immediately, as soon as I see that something has gone wrong and I might be criticized or get some kind of a negative reaction, whatever it is, I have to do something immediately to make the situation better.  Even when I turned in my reports, I couldn't just turn them in and say nothing.  And I didn't even, I didn't want to, but I found myself saying something about how I didn't like them or wasn't sure about them or something so in case she didn't like them, I would already be telling her I didn't too.  And, and whenever I do that particular type of thing as when I turned in my reports, I just, I almost hate myself because I do it without wanting to do it.  It's just because I don't have enough strength not to, that I do. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just began to think about something else that happened today with my assistant.  I, I know when I'm in these moods or feeling particularly unsure about something, as I was this morning with the mother there, that I'm inclined to demand a lot from my assistant.  And even knowing it, when I'm actually in the situation I do it almost as if I had no awareness at all.  And so if she doesn't obey me exactly when I want her to then I'll become annoyed.  And I think this morning I was feeling a little bit that way.  So at one point she asked, we had, we were working in groups and she was going to do one more thing if there was time.  And it was questionable whether there was enough time so she asked me whether she should do it or forget it.  And so I answered her, I've forgotten now how it went exactly but the way I answered her, it was a little bit, if she listened to what I was saying exactly she would know what I was saying but it was like saying — she was asking me a yes or a no and I was saying no for the wrong thing.  I was saying no meaning yes or, I don't know, it was sort of silly but anyway, she knew what I meant and just was teasing me about the way I'd said it.  And I just was in no mood to be teased and so I pretended I didn't know that she was teasing me.  And I, I don't know what tone I used to her but I imagine I got kind of nasty to her because it just, the whole thing just annoyed me.  And now when I think about it I feel just awful because it was such a small thing on my part and so stupid for me to do that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think I, it's not exactly the same thing but similar to, I think it was, Monday night when I first started talking about all this.  And I was probably feeling more upset then than I have since when I've talked about it.  And so when the time was up, I was feeling sorry for myself and I was annoyed that the time was up.  And I was annoyed at you because the time was up.  And I don't know what else I was annoyed at but I was feeling in a particularly unhappy frame of mind.  And so when I left I would hardly look at you or say anything, just be kin—, I was just acting like a grump and almost as if I were going to take it out on you the same way I was taking it out on my assistant today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

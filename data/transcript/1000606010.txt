<p>This is an EMDR session with a 45 year old woman whose son, George, was killed in an automobile accident two years previously.  The client is suffering from traumatic grief.  The EMDR is being provided as part of a treatment weekend for survivors of people killed in auto accidents.  This client had received EMDR at the workshop the previous year and wanted another session at this workshop. (The previous year, EMDR was utilized to process the trauma associated with hearing the news about her son.) The client has a regular counselor who does not provide EMDR.  An observing therapist is also present. </p>

<p>The client wanted to work on the extreme pain and distress she experienced when thinking of her son and his death.  The goal of the EMDR session was to further process the trauma associated with her son's death and facilitate positive adaptation (e.g. enable her to think of her son and have positive feelings/positive sense of connection instead of only pain).  EMDR is not a short cut through the grief process.  Rather, EMDR enables the grief process by processing the obstacles that can complicate the grief. </p>

<p>The current session initially focused on a moment that occurred a few days before when she was driving and experienced a very painful realization that her son was dead.  During the session, the Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUDs) significantly lowered to a 1-2 (out of 10), which seemed to be ecologically appropriate.  Then the Installation Phase was implemented, with the Validity of Cognition (Voc) rising to 6.  The body scan was skipped because there was still was some disturbance, and insufficient time to process other issues that may have arisen.  The session ends with some discussion of treatment outcome, with the client now being able to think of her son with a positive connection instead of only pain. </p>

<p>Typically during EMDR the counselor stays out of the way of the process and does not talk or make suggestions if the material is shifting.  However, when a client is very emotional, the therapist can nurture the client through the process by talking in low, soothing tones.  This is illustrated in this session.  The material in this session moves very well, and the therapist is only talking to nurture the client through the process.  After the tape ended, a safe place
exercise for to ground and relax the client was provided. </p>

<p>CLIENT:   And "I can thrive again, I can go on and thrive." </p>

p>COUNSELOR: When you think of that moment in the car, how true do the words, "I can go on and thrive" feel on a 1-7 scale, with 1 being completely false and 7 being completely true?  </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just had a realization...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (blows her nose) ...that it's like a kind of, being robbed the second time. 'Cause when I looked at his face, or think about his, you know, his beautiful smiling face. Instead of being able to experience that love and that person, that is George. It's just horrible. It looks like its not even allowing me to enjoy that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Uh hmm. Hmm. Uh hmm. Go with that <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (breaths heavily)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughs out loudly) Excuse me. (sniffles) (calms down) (sighs) I  feel like I could have more of a sense of believing I'd be able to heal. And then it will be worth making the effort, although I'm still feeling sad. (sighs) (cries)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Go with that <b>(EM)</b> </p>

 <p>CLIENT: (sniffles) (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: <b>(continuing EM)</b> Yeah. I know, I know. </p>

 <p>COUNSELOR: Tissue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (blows nose) Thanks. (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's there now? What are you noticing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just sort of, occurred to me that when I clear some of that, there's this de- devastation. These are feelings about George that I couldn't come out...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Okay. Go with that. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (cries) I still don't want it to be true. I still...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (silence) I feel more relaxed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Go with that <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of, feel like, some of the burden are lifted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds strange but when you're doing those last ones, I felt my body was processing residual effects of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Let's just keep on going. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. Let's say, let's uh-- So, now- now, when you think of the moment when you were driving, the moment we where we started out when you were driving and there was just a sudden realization of his death. What's there now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I feel more peace. A lot more peace than I had with it before, which.......... But, I feel, much more peace about the fact, that if I continue to heal, it doesn't mean that I'm going to lose him again. That, maybe if I continue to heal it, I'll be able to connect with him more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Go with that. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (whimpers)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: <b>(continuing EM)</b> Uh hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (whimpers)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: <b>(continuing EM)</b> Uh hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (cries continuously) (calms down) I feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels better. (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you think of George, what comes up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: His love and, and I feel happy but I also, I mean I feel sad but I also feel like a little bit of happiness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go on,  <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (sighs) I feel more of something. (sighs) I just-- A thought just came to me that I don't have to expend so much energy fighting it, I guess that I don't have to expend so much energy fighting the fact that George's dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, uh hmm. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (sniffles) Maybe I could possibly come back to trusting the universe a little. (chuckles) (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Go with that. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm done. I think I'm done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:   Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (giggles) </p>  

<p>COUNSELOR: So, okay. So, let's go back to the moment we started with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how is that now, when you think of that moment? The realization when you were driving out, how is that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't feel so emotionally charged. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. And zero to ten, with ten being the absolute worst it could be. Zero would be calm and neutral. Not that you feel good about it but that you would feel calm and neutral. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say like, a one or two or something in that range.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Just notice that. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, what are you aware of? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel pretty good and peaceful at this moment in time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Just- just notice that. Just notice that. Okay? <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs)   I-- This is the first time I could think about George's image. And that it's beautiful, smiling face without hurting so, so bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, let's just go with that. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, so when you think of-- When you think of George, how is that now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffles) Bitter sweet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like- like a feeling of warmth and love and sadness mixed together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, of course. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: <b>(continuing EM)</b> Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, I'll be able to live through it.  It's not that I'm not going to still be sad but- but I won't be stuck on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Good. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Better. It's that I feel more-- I don't feel like I can't say that I accept his death. But then I'm feeling more willing to move through the process because I want to honor him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (cries)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's just go with that. <b>(EM)</b> Yeah. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (cries continuously) (sighs) (someone coughs) (sniffles) (sighs) I feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Alright there, good. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (sniffles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not feeling sorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you go back to that moment in the car, How distressing it is now, 0 to 10? </p>

<p>CLIENT:  About a 1 or 2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go with that  <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels a lot better, but its still sad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you go back to that moment in the car, How distressing it is now, 0 to 10? </p>

<p>CLIENT:  About a 1 or 2, its better, but its sad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (Deciding that this level of disturbance is appropriate to the situation, the counselor now goes to the Installation phase):  Okay. Yeah. Of course its sad, that's only natural.    Now let's just go back to that moment we started with, to the realization in the car. We talked about the words, "I can go on and thrive."   Do those words fit, or are there better words now. </p> 

<p>CLIENT: When I think about the realization that George is dead?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.   

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) You know, the words are that, "I can learn to live with this."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it is. And because I know that George would want that and I would be honoring his life.  So it's also I can honor his life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the words are, "I can learn to live with this and it's honoring his life"? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And when you think about the realization about George's death, how true do those words, "I can learn to live with this and its honoring his life" feel on a one to seven scale one being totally false and seven, totally true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt pretty true. Like, a five or a six or seven...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...somewhere in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Just put the two together and you can just think of that memory and the realization. And those words, "I can learn to live with this and its honoring his life," just put them together. <b>(EM)</b> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How true now, one to seven?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, it's probably a six. (laughs) If I had to pick one number.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's alright. Okay. Okay. Good. Just stay with that. Uh hmm. <b>(EM)</b> Now, how true do the words "I can learn to live with this and it's honoring his life", one being totally false and 7 being totally true? </p>

<p>CLIENT:  6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Go with that <b>(EM)</b>    Now, how true are those words, one to seven? </p>

<p>CLIENT:  6</p>
 
<p>CLIENT: It's going be okay.  I guess, I could imagine not just surviving You know, which I know I could do but, you know, maybe thriving and maybe like, wanting to invest in living, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.  <b>(EM)</b> </p>
  
<p>CLIENT: And making-- Doing something to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, having some purpose and meaning, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Go with that <b>(EM)</b>    Now, how true are those words, "I can learn to live with this and it's honoring his life", one to seven?</p>

<p>CLIENT:  6 </p>
 
<p>CLIENT: I'm done. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're done. (chuckles) This is a good place to stop. (Counselor decides to skip the body scan because there is still some arousal, and he does not want to open up other associations.)  You did some wonderful processing, I know it was tough What was this like for you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It depends upon which moment you're talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, overall. I mean, you know, it's difficult to go there but I do all the time anyway...  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that's how I can go through the new feelings that I haven't experienced. But what was good was being able to move through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I feel some sort of, resolution, you know. Some small bit of, I don't know, like, I don't want to say some sense of accomplishment exactly but that there were something to be gained from moving through that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes, there's something to be gained.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that's the challenge of this, that as you move through this, there's something to be gained. Something that you can benefit from, grow from... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 'Cause often it feels like when I'm having that, just like totally gut-wrenching, devastating, horrible feelings. It doesn't seem that there could be any good coming out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you're realizing  what will come out of it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is growth and you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...some freedom.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Okay, it's wonderful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (To the other therapist)  Do you have some comments on what you observed?</p>

<p >Observing therapist: What I saw was when you allowed yourself to process the traumatic aspects of it, you were able actually to, in some regards, get closer to George...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>Observing therapist: ...because the things that you would back off from,   you addressed and moved through. So, in some way you have a stronger connection now that you've gotten some of that trauma out of the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly true.</p>

<p>Observing therapist: Yeah. It's still sad. EMDR is not going to take away sadness but it can resolve the trauma that made you not be able to have a closer connection with your son.   But that's so important because it's hard enough to lose him in real life and when the residual of the trauma interferes, its an awful place to be.  Now you are able to have a closer sense of connection to him.  </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly...</p> That's exactly true. I also realize I did not want to let go of my grieving because of fear of losing that little remnant 

<p>Observing therapist: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think, there is definitely a certain amount of truth in that for me. And, that's it-- I was able to like, realize that internally.</p>

<p>Counselor: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, that I know that it's not true. In fact, it's just the opposite, you know. Hanging on is going to prevent me from connecting.</p>

<p>Counselor: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you can think of George. You can feel closer to him and connect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because the pain isn't there. You could feel that connection there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly--</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See his smiling face.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>Observing therapist: I think you've learned that you can have better connections than pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I think maybe, the fear before was that, if I really fully allow myself to heal and to move through this, that it would be mean moving farther away from George. But I see that it's not the case.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>Other therapist: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonderful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, thank you.</p>Thanks for the session.--</p>

<p>(A "safe place" containment exercise was provided at the end of the session.)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) I've been thinking about something that happened last night.  And, I don't know, I find this subject very hard to talk about.  And I just, I've been mainly thinking, since I came in, how to begin and sort of hoping it'll go, maybe I'd stop thinking about it.  (Pause) And I've sort of been wondering what actually happened in the way I reacted too.  It, it was something that, well, MSCZ, uhm, came home and he said he didn't feel well at all.  And then later in the evening he did have a fever.  And I think, unconsciously, when I knew he had a fever I probably thought to myself, "Well, I'm safe tonight, he won't want to have intercourse."  But I wasn't aware of doing that.  And then later in the evening — he'd been reading a book that, from what I gather, is quite erotic.  And later on in the evening he did want to have intercourse, which I just couldn't conceive, since he was so sick as he had said he was earlier.  And anyway, just the whole thing, it was perhaps a good excuse, I don't know, but it just seemed to me very distasteful.  And I just couldn't, couldn't even think about doing it.  And so then he wanted me to masturbate him and I found that equally distasteful.  Well, I always find that distaste—, or almost always find that distasteful.  But there was something about, here he was sick and then he still wanted this, that was very disturbing.  But he was just going to keep pestering me so finally I did.  And I had to just sort of disassociate myself from it all and be very cold to him and, and almost punish him for asking this of me.  And I just couldn't understand why he'd want this when he could just be so separate from me and still accept it.  And also, how he could feel that way when he w—, he had, if he had been feeling as badly as he had said earlier.  {20} And, I don't know, just everything seemed to be so incongruous in the way I've set up the way things should be in my mind.  And — (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think there was something, too, about the fact that it was the book that made him feel that way and not anything to do with me, that bothered me about it too.  (Pause) But also when I was in the middle of the situation, instead of sort of accepting, well, this is the way it is and what am I, how am I going to react to it, I kept asking how can he feel this way?  And I can remember at the time just being completely frustrated because I couldn't understand at all how he could feel that way.  But now when I think about it, it seems to be sort of a pointless question since he did feel that way.  But I was kind of, well, almost mad at him for feeling that way when I couldn't understand at all how he could.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just began thinking about my hairdresser — I don't know quite why — and, well, thinking in terms of, lately he's been rolling my hair differently and I don't like the way he has been.  But I'm sort of afraid to say anything.  Yet I find it's much easier if he combs it in the way I don't like, I find it's much easier to leave and then fix it the way I wanted it, at home.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Then I jumped to school and, uhm, I think the way I did was thinking just sort of how I have this vaguely uneasy relationship with my hairdresser and then how I have an equally vaguely uneasy relationship with my supervisor.  And then that made me think about a boy, the boy that I've always thought is a little sad.  And, uhm, I just received a note yesterday that he'll be going away for, well, I think it's a week, on a trip.  And, ah, his mother's the one who's getting a divorce.  And it sort of upset me because I don't think, I think he'd rather be at school.  He's been doing fairly well in his adjustment lately.  And I also don't think she's thinking of him at all to take him away like this but, I don't know, there's something there that I don't quite know what I'm thinking about it.  {8} And then it occurred to me that I wasn't saying any of these things because somehow I have to see a point to them or they just have to seem important to me in some way.  And then this made me start worrying that I won't be able to go through analysis successfully, which sometimes, I think, has been on my mind.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What would keep you from it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  From being successful?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, this time I was thinking in terms, I, I'm not doing it right but I don't know what doing it right would be.  But sometimes when I've thought about it, it's because of, I think it's only because we have a friend who's going into psychi—, psychi—, what's the word, psychiatry?  And, uhm, so MSCZ likes to ask him a lot of questions about analysis.  And one time he made a comment that some people can't go through it because they resist their, what they're thinking, or he, some comment of that nature. And then I became afraid that all these times I'm having such trouble it's because I'll never be able to get through to what I'm really thinking.  And when I jump around, like I am today, instead of feeling it's just a natural thought process, I'm always afraid that it means I'm avoiding something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, maybe it's not always clear, ahead of time, what, how things are connected or related.  And that's, that seems to be you idea, that it ought to be before it's, be evidently important before you can say it.  I think maybe that's a kind of a trick you play on yourself so that you can keep yourself from letting these thoughts just come out as they will.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And another side of that just, I was sort of feeling it when you were talking, is, well, it's just mainly I can't, I guess I can't free myself to just, what I term it is, rattling on and on.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Since you have this feeling that you may be avoiding something, it occurs to me, I wonder if, eh, maybe there was something in connection with masturbating MSCZ, that you didn't go into or there were details that you preferred not to say about what you were thinking.</p>

<p> PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I suppose the other things is just that feeling of being unclean and, well, just, I was very aware of an odor I didn't like.  And I had to wash my hands as soon as it was over.  And just the whole thing is — or not exactly wash my hands but, I don't know, the whole feeling of something being very dirty, unpleasant.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You say, not exactly washing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I didn't go wash them but I wiped them off. I couldn't, just — (silence) I was just thinking that — I don't know whether I use this as another way to sort of excuse myself from talking about things but this whole thing is something that I almost don't even talk about with MSCZ.  And so I don't really know what words to use.  And then if I don't know the words to use, it seems very easy not to talk about it then because I keep telling, I can tell myself, well, I don't know what words I should use.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And there was another feeling I had, I just thought of it.  When I was masturbating him, it, the only kind of pleasure I got from it at all was when I was, well, really hurting him.  Then I had to sort of control myself but I think what it really was is I wanted to hurt him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  By being too rough, I guess.  It's the only way I'd allow myself.  Probably I, if I were just letting myself do what I really wanted, it would, I don't know what I'd do but— (pause) whatever it is, hurting him through doing something to his penis, I think is definitely what I'm doing, what I'm concentrating on.  (Silence) And there is something too — I never know how much of this comes from reading and how much it's really something I'm feeling — but I am aware sometimes of just sort of wishing I could forget he has a penis and not wanting to have any signs that he does or being made aware of that he does.  Or then other times, when I'm mad at him, because he does.  Sort of that, if he didn't, then there wouldn't be any of these problems that I have.  So then I don't blame MSCZ, I just blame his penis, which seems kind of ridiculous.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I just thought of something, again, that for some reason I thought of the last day or 2, uhm, that after reading "The Boston Strangler", which I had thought would upset me very much, the only thing that really bothered me in the book, or that affected me personally enough so that, — I don't know, I sort of disassociated myself from the fact that these were really people strangled but the thing that I could feel was the fact that some of these women, as far as I understood the book, at some point had to put the penis of the Boston strangler in their mouth.  And that, to me, was, well, I just can't understand how anybody could do it.  Because I can't imagine doing it with MSCZ's penis and certainly not with somebody who's a stranger.  And I don't know quite why I feel this way except that, again, it's somehow feeling that it's an unclean thing and you don't put unclean things in your mouth.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And then this leads me to thinking again something that has often occurred to me.  But because of this feeling I have about this, uhm, just sort of how vulnerable I am if a man ever got power over me.  Well, it even sometimes I feel that way about MSCZ.  But often I'll think of it in terms of just thinking about women during wars and how so often they're raped and so forth and just wondering how they can stand it, I guess, not exactly live through it but just sort of stand it.  And that, I think that's what war means to me, almost more than anything else.  Or other things can sometimes seem horrible to me but, but never do I r—, have a real feeling for the horror except when I think of this kind of thing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I remember once, when MSCZ was at RZG, we saw a movie that had been made by some of the RZG students during one summer.  And it was, well, almost a takeoff on the incident when the girl was being attacked by a man in PJN and nobody came to help her.  But this was a girl being sort of followed by a man who eventually tried to rape her and then killed her when she resisted and how she just couldn't escape him and nobody would help herShe tried to stop cars in the street at one point and everybody just thought she was kind of crazy and nobody would listen.  And even though I knew the whole background to how the movie was made and so forth, and it was a very short movie, I got so involved in it that I was very upset at the end of it.  And it just seemed to me like it was a newsreel or something — I don't know how well the film was actually done but just the subject was something that, I don't know, it seemed like I lost all perspective while I was watching it.  And I can remember being so shocked because most of the people who were watching it knew the different people who were acting in it and they never forgot that they knew these people so they were just enjoying it. And at the end, I've forgotten, something happened and they, they were, many people were sort of laughing.  And it was such a contrast to the way I was feeling that it was just a terrific shock to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I just wondered if the reason I've been thinking, first remembering last night, which wasn't on my mind at all until right after I came out of the subway, has anything to do with the fact that when I come out of that particular subway entrance or exit, it was the one that one day I was, when I was going through the revolving door, the, or the revolving thing, the boy stopped me. And I remember I talked about it that day and it had upset me.  But now every time I come through there, sometimes more than others, I feel very tense and I'm always relieved when I get through, as if somebody might jump out and stop the door again.  And today I was particularly sensitive to it.  And then it was right after that, that I thought of last night.  It's, again, something sort of ridiculous because it's almost as if I'm afraid every man that I see is going to rape me or do something awful to me unless I'm in some kind of a safe situation.  Because now that I think of it, even today coming up in the elevator, I was in the elevator with another girl and then we went down to the basement which has never happened before.  And 2 men got in and my thought immediately was, well, if anybody wanted to do anything awful to some girls this would be a wonderful place to do it.  They could have just pulled us right out and we couldn't have done anything.  And also coming up in the subway, ah, when I went home, I had to go up in the elevator from the subway level and it ended up for the first time I was in this huge subway, the elevator alone with a man.  And again I was just sort of standing there hoping that he wouldn't try to attack me or anything.  So it just seems I'm always thinking about this.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

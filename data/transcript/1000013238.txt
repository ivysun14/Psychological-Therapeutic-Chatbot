<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 9, August 27th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [See, I've had a vacation] (ph). It's two weeks now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've had vacation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. Kind of getting used to not working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's easier? You don't mind it so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At first, the boredom was tremendous. I just kind of accept it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [What do you mean] (ph), it's still boring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like you get up in the morning and there's a whole long day ahead of you and nothing to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just kind of stay in bed. What makes it better is that you can stay up late the night before and you don't feel like getting up until like 11:00, then half the day is gone, so you don't have too much to ...too much time to fight that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm curious why you don't get a job if you're bored?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's (ph) not really too much of a drive for it because I don't really need the money that bad. I mean I need it ... I will need it pretty soon. Have little right now. [I think] (ph) the incentive isn't there. [0:02:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean even if it's boring, it's better than having to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Kind of, yeah] (ph) It doesn't really make that much difference whether I'm working or whether I'm not working. Of course (inaudible at 0:02:29). That was kind of an exception.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're still bored even when you're working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because most of them ... seems like a dead end, really, working, because most of the jobs that I CAN get are the kind that are boring and that are just kind of menial and any 14-year-old could do this stuff. I've had jobs ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just can't get an interesting job, so ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking what it would be like to be a truck driver. I've been thinking about that for about a week. And a couple of days ago, no, a bit longer than a couple days ago ... but in that time, there was one day where I was very intent on calling this one man, he's a truck driver, he has his own cab and everything. And he's very accomplished at it. He's a good driver, and he has all kinds of contacts with different trucking firms and docking facilities and people that rent things, and anything about driving a truck, or any contacts, he would know something about how to get into it. And he's a fairly good friend, so I was thinking of calling him. And I was driving down this road near our house and all that was on it ... there's a main highway about two blocks from our house, and all that was on it was semis. And right in the middle of about four semis that were all spitting out their exhaust and the air was kind of ... (coughs to illustrate) you know, like when you're following a bus. I just [want to go] (ph), "Am I going to start adding to that now?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going to start what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Adding to that. It just doesn't seem to fit me. I like driving. I love being around machines that I can control and that are kind of ... I don't know, I guess I can just kind of feel with the machine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can feel WITH the machine? [0:05:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not "with," but I can know exactly what's happening in that machine. Like my friend's Barracuda, which he totaled out, used to have four speed transmission and a very good engine. And I liked driving it. It would take five miles an hour in first gear, another five in second ... [it was killing that car] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like you really know how to handle ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not used to driving a four-speed. In fact, I have an automatic, but still kind of car (inaudible at 0:05:43) I learned on a stick two years ago, three years ago. But then I've long since forgotten that. I mean, not forgotten ... been out of practice. And driving about four blocks in this guy's car, just driving around the block, I got so that I could shift it better than he could, and he's driving for four months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can really pick that up very fast. Get in tune with the machines.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could just kind of feel, he didn't have a tachometer in his car, and I could just kind of feel when the engine wouldn't go any faster without (inaudible). And he thinks he has a real (inaudible) for a car and it's not that bad (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're really sensitive to it. It sounds like you're very pleased that you could do that too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could ... in his car ... he has a 273 Barracuda, and I think it would be very easy to beat a (inaudible) 86 (ph) Chevelle in that car. And he can't even take on a VW! Well, I shouldn't go that far, but he has a little trouble between shifts, he'll take a lot of time between shifts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you were him, you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:07:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's really fun to handle the cars and see what you can get out of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like to take his ... I used to like to take his car. It's no longer running (ph). Somebody hit him. The car is totaled now, which is a shame. But anyway ...I almost wiped his car out once going around a corner. I wasn't really wiping out, I was just out of control kind of, but it never seemed to really get out of control. It just looked kind of [going out] (ph). It was fish tailing and going down the street sideways and I suppose it looked kind of wild. It felt kind of wild but it's instinct for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's instinct for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Getting out of hairy situations driving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting into them and then being able to know how to get out of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I put myself into them. It's almost suicidal the way I do that sometimes. [0:08:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's something about getting into them that DRAWS you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not so much with the car I have now, that's kind of a pig (ph) doesn't do anything. But with other cars that go a little faster. I'm kind of the opinion where ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have kind of a theory about how people get really good at something. How you practice it until it becomes unconscious. And if you do it and you're conscious of what you're doing, you're going to blow it. But if you do it when you're UNCONSCIOUS in doing it, like if it's just, it happens so fast that it's automatic, then it comes out right. And the army has proof that they have these people who site for gun ranges for flying missiles, for flying targets. I don't know really what it is, but there's this one person that does the job of calling out the range and the bearing of the target. And they found that if you can do it within three- or four-tenths of a second from the time that's expected of him, from the time he sees it, if he can get on a bearing in that time, it will be more accurate than if he waits one or two seconds. Which, to me, is amazing. Like the way people play pool sometimes. They have to kind of get into a trance before they really get good. [0:10:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that how you feel about you getting out of these hairy situations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Driving. I just ... I don't even bother thinking about what I'm doing, I just do it. I wish I could do that all the time. I was wondering whether I have too much time to think, just staying at home [like that] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm thinking maybe you did have too much time to sit around and meditate and mull things over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [And again] (ph). Well maybe it was too much time. Maybe I overdid it. I started thinking of things to do that were destructive rather than constructive. Well, I don't know. Maybe it just seems like [they were] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you mean it seems to you now that ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like in the past week, [I broke up kind of with my girl] (ph), I almost wrecked my friendship with the girl in the hospital (ph), become kind of generally intolerant of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you've been feeling more critical towards people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And disgusted at them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that seemed like it might be better than [the way things are now] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just kind of a general negative feeling. All I can see is the bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A negative feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it's just the whole way I view things is coming out negative rather than positive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean right now, when you think about things ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like now, and for the past couple days or weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean, that you feel angry at other people or what? [0:12:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just kind of ... not so much worried about other people just ... maybe angry at myself sometimes. Like this morning, I was driving down the street. It's a four-lane highway. And I ... I guess you could consider it cutting this guy off but he was [only doing 10 miles an hour] (ph) I was doing about 15 (ph), so I didn't really cut him off, but I went between him and a truck and I should have known better because I couldn't see what was on the other side of the truck. And I get on the other side of this truck into the opposite lane where I could have passed the truck, but there's a car (inaudible at 0:13:25). Stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that sounds like you were disgusted at yourself for not being careful enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've been thinking of all the ... not now, but (inaudible at 0:14:02) after the moment, after the past week, I've been kind of thinking of all the different reasons for breaking up with my girlfriend. (inaudible) Monday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I hear you saying that you broke up with her, but I really don't get much of a feel for how [would that release you] (ph) or what it meant to you or what it did to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It didn't do what I expected. I expected it would give me kind of ... I don't know if you could call it "freedom" or not, but I wouldn't be so dependent on her. And it hasn't done that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you still feel dependent on her? [0:14:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. But it's more like I expected her to stop being dependent on me along [with that] (ph), and it didn't happen [at all] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you expected that you would just stop seeing her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't expect that. But I expected kind of a change in the kind of relationship we would have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow giving her ring back would change everything. But it doesn't seem to change anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:16:19]</p>

<p>I just sit at home like this sometimes [not saying anything] (ph) or really thinking anything. Just kind of a daze.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing really happening inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, except my mother's always screaming at me. And that makes it a rather unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not ... there's no peace because she's always yelling. Intruding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if not yelling ... yeah, intruding. Always running [in the room to put clothes away] (ph) or banging doors or slamming the doors down or just kind of stomping about, making noise. She makes more noise than three people I know, any three people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just want a little peace and quiet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, although I wouldn't mind something happening, but not that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like it's a kind of thing that's happening, but that ... all the banging and clatter and ... it's like you can't get away from it. It's loud. Irritating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she expects me to talk to her all the time. Like today, she [called me out for being a poor conversationalist] (ph), and I didn't even answer, which I (inaudible). [0:18:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you feel like you can't even talk when you want to and not talk when you want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) There's no desire to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can't even be quiet in peace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I tried to sell my engine last weekend. Had ads in two newspapers, two ads in each newspaper and I got two calls and I wasn't home for either of them. When they called me back, I wasn't (inaudible at 0:18:43).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that didn't work out either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to try again this weekend. Just one ad this time in two papers. Maybe I can raise that money to pay (inaudible). Anyway, it will get this stuff out of the garage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will get this stuff out of the garage without throwing it out. I couldn't stand throwing out ... I'd give it away, but I wouldn't throw it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're too attached ... you're really attached to it? Too much to throw it out? It's too valuable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never ... I don't know why, but it seemed to be valuable to me but to nobody else. In their present form, they're not really valuable. They could be more valuable except I don't have any money to put into them. And it takes a lot of money to (inaudible). [0:20:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like when you were talking about when you were at home before and now that there's always sound, that somebody's always wanting to talk to you, just you really feel like things are bearing down on you all the time and you'd like to get away from all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's quite impossible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like physically you have to be there, at least ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I suppose if it gets bad enough, I'll decide to get a job. [Like I even] (ph) feel kind of trapped sometimes (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trapped how? [0:22:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of like ... [I don't know] (ph) ... she wants to have someone who is very close to her, to really appreciate her all the time, that makes her feel good. And just knowing that, I feel like it's kind of expected of me. And it seems like kind of a demand that sometimes I really don't care about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you know that she wants you to be close to her and to be kind to her. But sometimes you don't (ph) want to do that. Sometimes it's too hard. It's a burden to [be there] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's what I was trying to get out of by giving back the ring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like saying, "I'm not bound to do all these things for you because we're really NOT in that kind of relationship."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of like I wanted to ... to be just as close to her but not all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you want to be really close to her and sometimes you wanted to have a feeling of more freedom because you didn't want to feel that way. [0:24:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [And then] (ph) sex keeps coming up too, which kind of confuses everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that makes it even more difficult to know how you feel and how she feels?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it's kind of ... it's a different ... it's different, it's ... sometimes, because it's so frustrating to be so close to her and yet so far away. And I'm very tempted to go out with other girls and I know I couldn't ... I couldn't justify that to myself when I still had her ring. So I gave back her ring and I still can't justify it to myself. It's kind of like a block in my mind that says no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you feel guilty if you go out with other girls? [0:26:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. I just don't feel right about it somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow you should be more loyal than that to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm. And then it's ... on top of it, that kind of seals the trap, you know? Because it's very frustrating. It seals the feeling of being trapped to Mary because she doesn't really satisfy me at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking about sexually?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she doesn't even try. That's what's really bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that part ... it doesn't ... it isn't enough for you. It isn't right for you. And the bad part is that she isn't even working on trying to satisfy you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a dead end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that hurts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because [there's no place to go] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like being stuck in a corner with no way out. It sounds like part of the reason that you're so stuck there is that there's no way to make her try and there's no way to justify yourself going out with anybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm hmm. [0:28:19]</p>

<p>Sometimes it almost becomes an obsession like it's the only thing I think about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having sex. And coming out with the ... my friend in the hospital Sunday and that's how it was. That's all I could think about. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How attracted you were to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and she's not really interested in that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then it's very frustrating to be thinking about that and not being able to do anything (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to know that if I just say one thing that isn't new [with that] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [With that] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I just ... like if I just would say to her anything having to do with a personal sexual relation with me, that I think it would completely ruin our friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not only the fact that you're thinking about it, but that you have to be very careful not to mention it so you don't alienate her. That sounds very hard when that's what you're thinking about, and you have to keep pushing that away, making sure you don't let that slip out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:30:05]</p>

<p>For the first time this week, I've actually felt like going out and getting drunk and actually doing it - getting drunk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean, that you feel depressed or like doing something exciting or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's a desire to kind of get rid of everything that's [bugging me] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's just too much. There's too much of [it there] (ph), too much pressure. It would be nice just to get away from all that. [0:30:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I always did like getting drunk. I usually (inaudible) alone or with someone that I would really feel close to. And I usually had a ball (ph). Just in my own way, kind of. Sometimes (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean it's not only getting away from things, but it's also fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can get real happy when I'm drunk. Most people get mad or belligerent or depressed. I get (inaudible). [I can kind of] (ph) see sometimes how thinking about things winds me up in the circles and then I kind of lose all perspective on everything. [0:32:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling that way now? Wound up in circles or lost your perspective?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that like? Like, one thing that you think about seems ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like not being able to understand what's going on from any point of view just because of chaos and confusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A very confused ... none of it makes any sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I was trying to read Bertrand Russell this morning, and normally anything with abstract logic in it is just kind of child's play. It's very easy. I just kind of breeze through it. In fact, I can skim the page and get more out of it than somebody who studies it for an hour. Well not everybody, but some of them. I've known people that I can do that to. And this morning, I couldn't understand it at all. Like I would read it, I would see the words but nothing together. I didn't even see the point he was trying to make sometimes, let alone the logic behind it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that ... frightening that you couldn't do that, or ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it leaves you kind of lost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there are all these words around and you're right in the middle of them but none of them make any sense at all. [0:34:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did get a couple points out of it, and I tried to compare that to some of my own thoughts that I think are fairly (ph) original sometimes. And I couldn't do it at all because I couldn't even remember my own thoughts. Things that I had worked out in my own mind I couldn't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were disturbed by the fact that you couldn't get things straight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when they were straight in previous times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were wondering what had happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That little cabin at the top of the hill in the middle of Montana somewhere is looking pretty good again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were by yourself there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I completely stopped listening to AM radio. [0:36:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I were (inaudible) there's some significance in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next to none.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I stop listening to FM, next after that would be records.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean what's happening to you ... it sounds like you're feeling like you're just really stopping thing after thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's very ... very BAD in some way, but that you keep on doing that. It's almost like you have a whole progression of things mapped out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like selling my engine was a major decision to me. Not because I thought I'm going to sell them and might even get some money out of it. It wasn't like that at all. It was kind of like ... cleaning up your estate before you commit suicide. [That's what it felt like] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's how all these other things feel too in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like taking care of things and getting less and less involved in things. So it sounds like you're just really, really feeling ... it's like "I just sort of ...things are really bad" or "I just want to get away from them and get into a corner and shut them out." [0:38:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My parents are planning on moving (ph). They have this lot all picked out and the bid has been accepted on it and it's about 10 miles from ... farther from the city. And they're planning on building a house on it. Supposedly everyone's going to have their own rooms and it's going to be all cozy. I just wonder what it would be like to have [to have a room of my own] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you would really love to find out I bet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Yeah, then I could lock my door.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The more you talk to me today, the more it sounds like you just feel pushed in on all the time by your family, like there's no room for you. There's no space. I don't mean just a room, but that too. But like there's no part of your life where you're just left alone and free. It's very confined (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I took my brother for a ride, well he drove actually, [he drove me in] (ph) my car, and before we went, my dad wanted to know the exact route we were taking driving. [0:40:22]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you couldn't even GO somewhere without telling ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And on top of that ... well, that I'm kind of used to. He does that all the time. But then he holed (ph) my brother up for about half and hour. I'm just standing there waiting, and he's yelling at my brother and [my brother] (ph) (inaudible) sitting there thinking how stupid my father is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sitting there thinking that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can see that he was doing that. Because I felt that way when I get yelled at. He's a lot like me. [I think we can understand each other] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must make you really ANGRY that you had to wait all that time ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The point that ... the main point they were arguing is about ... my father makes up all kinds of little arguments about coming home late and leaving without previous notice. He wants to be notified of everything three hours in advance, but he's not home more than a half hour [in advance] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) is it ridiculous. And impossible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he wants to know the exact route and he wants to have it timed so that he knows the exact minute we're supposed to get back. The thing that he was concerned about is my brother going out with me because I'm such a bad influence. And he won't say that. He'll never admit that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you (inaudible) really know he feels that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's so obvious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're feeling his displeasure of you and [him feeling kind of] (ph) ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then he won't say it and that's part of the problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't like my brother to go anywhere. He'd rather just have him sit home. But yet he complains when I sit home. I (inaudible at 0:42:10) but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like your brother can do things and that's all right. But when you do it ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just ... that wasn't the point I wanted to make.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just threw that in. But see my brother, he would rather have sit home because if he doesn't go out, he can't get into trouble. And so anytime he goes out, he gets this hassle. He gets it doubly much when he goes out with me, which has only been, like, twice. (inaudible) never taken him driving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that must make you really upset, I mean, to ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then what makes it even worse, is that my father has a suspicion that my brother might end up driving. (sarcastically) "And oh, that would be awful! My brother driving. Oh dear, he's only 16." And he's so afraid that kid is going to get out of the house and actually see somebody that's alive. That is pitiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To see somebody that's alive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I kind of think that our family is dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see. So it's like coming out of a funeral parlor or something into the real world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a cemetery almost, it sounds like. Gee, it sounds like not only ... you must feel, "Not only does he get mad at me for sitting around and so forth," but like he really thinks that you're a bad guy. And it sound like everything you do, he expects it to turn out bad or he's afraid it's going to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when we went out to see this lot ... was it two nights ago, that he had picked out and everything, and we were surveying it and doing this little test (inaudible) with it, to make sure that we had the proper septic system to go in there. And when we got all done, we were driving home and he gives me this little lecture about how I shouldn't take my brother out without his express permission and all that garbage. And it was so ridiculous. I just helped him for three hours, probably if he would have had it done, it would have cost him a small fortune, but yet because he had help, he can do it. But if I wouldn't have helped him, he couldn't have done it because you need somebody to hold the pole (ph) when you're surveying it. [0:44:56]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean you felt the least he could have done was appreciate it and not give you a lecture immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he comes on with this lecture about how I was pulling stunts on him, you know, like that. It's the only thing I do is try and sneak him out behind his back and that I'm just bringing my brother to corrupt him. It was so ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you laugh at that, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did, I laughed in his face. It was so ridiculous. How ... it almost seemed like ... like people yell "communism," you know? It's like a big bogeyman, and that's the way he looks at everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he's afraid that things are going to happen all out of proportion. And that to you, it just looks really stupid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can see the same pattern is forming what I found in my kind of ... well I think it's kind of a fight to get out and be independent. It only took me from 16 to 19 and I didn't really start until I was 17. Well he's only 16, and he's already starting the patterns and he's well advanced on any stage that I was at when I was his age. In fact, he's beating me by about a year-and-a-half in progression on things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you watch that, and you can just see it all repeated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Only faster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Only faster.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my parents are making the same stupid mistakes. They never learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really scornful of your parents, it sounds like. They're in such dumb things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My brother went on this island (ph) last week for the whole week. I guess it was seven or eight days. And when he went, I know he took along at least three or four pints of alcohol and I don't know how much his buddy took along and then his girlfriend [went with too] (ph). It was like a church retreat. And it was pretty nice up there. (inaudible at 0:48:08) and I guess he had pretty much of a good time. And it was a big plus having his girlfriend along too. (inaudible) And he came home with ... he was unpacking and he's throwing out all this assorted contraband that he either brought with him or picked up at this (inaudible). It's evil in our family to smoke, so he comes back with two packs of cigarettes and a lighter. And it makes it fairly obvious. It doesn't matter to me. He knows it doesn't matter to me. So it doesn't matter to him (inaudible). And so he piles all of this stuff in the drawer (ph) and (inaudible). He shot off all these firecrackers. He had (inaudible) and cherry bombs that he was blowing up [all over the place] (ph). And he was telling me about some of the stuff they were doing up there and how he and his girlfriend just didn't bother to go to these activities that they had all planned. And how he kind of ... he just used his brain and he just pretty well did what he wanted to and no one (inaudible) difference the whole week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is this, part of the thing you see him getting independent as you did or is this ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, except a little bit more intelligent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you wish you had been a lot smarter about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then he came home with the ... he threw this pack of cigarettes at me, I'm sitting on their bed and he said "Here, have one." And I said, "No thanks, I don't smoke." He says, "Oh, why not?" [There's a roll of joints and papers.] (ph) And I just looked at it and I said, "You've got to be kidding. Any different than alcohol?" And he said, "No, it's all the same. It doesn't make any difference." [So I don't know really what's going to happen to him then. I hope he doesn't get too deeply involved] (ph). [0:50:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're concerned about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's something that he's going to have to figure out that I really can't do anything about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you must feel pretty locked in, in the sense of not really liking what's going on and feeling put down a lot. But not being able to get away and having to stay there and live with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just keep waiting until this (inaudible) over. Maybe I'll be allowed to [go somewhere] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking about the court thing? [0:52:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you're allowed to go somewhere else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Allowed to just be ... just do what I want. I think the first thing I'd do if I had any money, would be to get in my car and start driving west.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just take off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe [up to Canada] (ph) or Montana. [Or I] (ph) would just drive all over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel pressure just being not able to leave the area too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wonder what it would be like to sleep in my car.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wonder what it would be like to sleep in the car.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just be on the go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That would be pretty [lonely too] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be fun, it would be free but you'd miss people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's not that many people I can talk to here (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be what you'd really miss. What you'd really like is to have more (ph) people you could talk to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just afraid to talk to people now. I think there was only a couple people I could talk to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid? [0:54:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah, like I'll say something and it would be kind of unacceptable. [I know] (ph). Like I've made a few friends, you know, and I have my girlfriend who I can talk to sometimes. Like while I was making these friendships, I could just talk about what I felt. And it seemed that they liked me for it. Now I feel kind of guilty because I can't really say what I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's keeping you from that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel kind of guilty about what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. It's what's ... I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, sometimes when I'm thinking about sex, or just getting away from everything including the person I'm talking to, and I don't feel like I can say that to a person right to his face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't just say "I wish I could just leave you. Go somewhere else."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there are a lot of times that you'd like to say that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't say to my girlfriend, "All I can think about is sex tonight." It doesn't make any difference. It doesn't help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's because what? You can't say that to her because she ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could say it, yes, but it wouldn't help. It doesn't make any difference. It would still be the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel a little bit frustrated right now because somehow I ... we only have five minutes left, and I feel like we've been at the edge of a lot of things today and not really into them. Do you have that same feeling or not? I want to check that out with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I'm kind of closing in and all I can talk about now is things that seemed important to me that maybe I'm missing something that is really important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, wait, did you take ... I want to be clear about this. Did you take what I said as some sort of criticism, because I didn't mean it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know what you mean. Like there's something behind all of this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I have that feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something bigger that ... I don't really see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you don't see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's why I wouldn't talk about it. I can't talk about ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I didn't even mean that. But I just ... like I'm feeling frustrated because I feel like you have, for example, a lot of feelings about you and your girl in sex. And we just haven't ... like we sort of said today, "Yeah, there's a problem." But we haven't really gotten into what it is. See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. That's kind of, kind of goes along with the same line where I don't really feel like ... I don't really feel like talking about some things or that I don't think it will help by just talking about them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it would help change anything by talking about things sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the sex thing. I take it what you mean by that is that you'll still feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well that's true, you know, probably. But there might be some way in which you'd feel differently about feeling that way or maybe think of some way to do something if you talked about it. It sounds like it's a pretty strong feeling. I mean it's a real pressure not to be able to talk about it with anybody anytime. But that the more of the pressure sounds like it comes from not being able to DO anything about it. Well I guess I wanted to know because I wasn't sure because of something you said last time ... have you and your girl had sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [And we probably won't either.] (ph) We talked a little bit about that too. And it just kind of ... I don't know. It just ... it doesn't seem to satisfy her at all to even think about it. Like she just has no desire for it. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that leaves you not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also disappointed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: See the reason she really has no desire is just ... she just doesn't feel right about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She feels guilty about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I can't really be disappointed, because that's just the way she is. I don't feel right about feeling disappointed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. You mean like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it would be like expecting something that she can't possibly do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like, you might feel disappointed except it isn't right to feel that way. Is that it? So you won't let yourself feel that. It sounds like in that, that somehow if you let yourself feel disappointed, that that would somehow be doing something bad to her or be unfair to her in some way. [1:00:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think it would show through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would show, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would make her feel bad. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd rather have her feel bad than you feel bad about the relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just the opposite. I'd rather just kind of try and forget ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right, the opposite. Yeah. You'd rather feel bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not really feel bad. I'd rather just try and forget it. And I don't know, maybe I'm just forcing myself to do something that isn't going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forcing yourself to do what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To forget.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean maybe you can't forget. Yeah. It sounds like you go way ... really out of your way to make her feel good, even at ... sometimes at really expense to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes I think how stupid I am and then I go the opposite and I become very intolerant and cold, kind of nasty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that makes it sound like it's hard to hit a balance of getting what you want sometimes and then being considerate of her sometimes. That's really hard. We're going to have to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

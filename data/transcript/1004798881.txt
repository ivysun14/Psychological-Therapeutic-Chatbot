<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So James is having a hard time. He had lunch with Franco yesterday, who's been kind of avoiding us for a couple of weeks. And Franco said basically he needs to take some time off from both James and I. He didn't break up with Sascha. And I'm not exactly clear what's going on, but I think it's something like Sascha's still pretty upset with James and Franco is seeing this as a way to actually talk with Sascha about what is wrong between Franco and Sascha. So, but that's pretty hurtful (ph), you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 01:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no no. So, Sascha feels like James and I both really kind of took advantage of Franco in that and, like, the ways that we asked for him to help us were kind of above and beyond really what she was OK with, and also really (ph), but she feels like anybody can ask of one's friends, in terms I think specifically of, like, me staying with Franco when I was not doing well. And (sighs), you know, so somehow that's not my fault and it's not Franco's fault, but it's James fault, for her. Yeah. (laughter) And so, you know, it's pretty clear that, like, she's really angry with Franco and she's kind of displacing that (inaudible at 02:10). So, Franco's like, "Well, it's kind of (inaudible at 02:13)." You know, it also seems like this is—I haven't talked with him about it today. I probably will talk with him today—with Franco. I haven't talked with Franco about it yet. I haven't seen him in a couple weeks.</p>

<p>But that'll (pause)—it seems like it's, you know, Franco just really, really fighting for this relationship and thinking that, like, this is what he needs to do if he's going to stay with his family. So I'm kind of pissed at both Franco and Sascha in more or less complicated ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You (inaudible at 03:02) heard about it more (pause) angry, more like you see this as kind of Sascha's problem and Franco's trying very hard to make things work with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I see it as just as much Franco's problem as Sascha's problem in that, you know, I think it's not fair to Sascha to put this all on her because, you know, it takes two to make decisions. This is Franco's decision also and I think that there has to be some real logical disconnect when she wants to both be saying, "This isn't your fault." Like, he doesn't think any of this is James's or my fault, but he also is willing to have James and I be the ones who suffer for it, and to me that's a real problem. [00:04:02]</p>

<p>You know, if that's what needs to happen, that's what needs to happen. But you know, it's not fair to either James or I, just really not fair and especially not fair to James. And (pause) I just see this is making things more difficult for the four of us in that, like, I'm going to have a hard time not holding a grudge about this and I don't like that, but that's what's going to happen and (pause) so [I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>Yeah, so James and I talked about this for a long time last night and right as things were winding down, of course, I was kind of saying, like, "Yeah, I'm kind of pissed at them." And then (ph) said, "Well, but, you know, I'm just really angry lately. Like, I'm just cranky and pissed off at everybody." [00:05:04] James said, "OK, have you been angry at me?" (laughter) I said, "Yes." (pause) No, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Yes, goodnight] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now I want to go to bed. (laughter) Yeah. And so we talked (inaudible at 05:29), you know, I said some of it is, like, actually what you're doing and some of it is about me and some of it is about nothing in particular. (pause) But, like, I wasn't in a shape to talk to him about the things that were actually (inaudible at 05:53), I just wasn't. And I said, I just need to go to bed, so that's where we left it. You know, of course, all of my impulses were to kind of reassure and take that away and say, "No no no, none of it actually about you," and you know what, I can't do that because that's not true. I can't say that. But I also, just—I was really tired. I've been working since 11 in the morning till, like, I got off at, like, 8:15 and this is at, like, 10:30. And (pause) it's really hard for me to tell James when I'm angry with him. And it's really hard, and I feel bad about that. (pause) But [that's what happened] (ph). [00:07:11]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You (pause) sound like you expect one of us to be a bit critical of you for not having (pause) talked to him.,</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am critical of myself about it, but I have a long track record of having these discussions with James when I am really too tired to do it, and they don't (inaudible at 08:11). You know, it's not pretty and I always end up miserable and exhausted, and things never come out right and it just takes for fucking ever. So (laughter), you know, so I feel like I did the right thing, I just don't feel like I did the right thing, you know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I understand what you mean, and of course you can have it both ways, but (pause) you feel like you didn't do the right thing even though you feel like you did the right thing. (pause) I guess (long pause) the feeling you did the right thing part, I gather (ph) that seems pretty clear as you say, you know, you're really tired (inaudible at 09:45) discussion. You said it happened many times before where you try to do that when you're really tired it doesn't go well. That part to me sounds pretty straight forward. I haven't thought about the other part, but go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, just this whole thing about, like, self-sacrifice tied up in there and that, like, (pause) it's just really hard for me to talk to him about, you know, for me to be upset with him and to tell him what he is doing that is upsetting me. That is especially hard right now and it's really hard when I'm tired and (pause) there's something about feeling, like, despite or maybe because it's so hard it's all the more reason that, like, I should have to, like, [talked about it] (ph) all that. But I think that's crazy married (ph) reasoning. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 10:52) masochistic (ph) all the way around, like, you're kind of screwed either...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Way from that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe that's it. Maybe you're kind of screwed either way. Like, if you didn't do it then you wimped out and you, you know, didn't step up and do it and you failed and, you know, that's lame. And on the other hand, if you had done it, you would've got good and exhausted and it would've been miserable and awful. And there's a part of you that's, you know, then you would be doing some penance for being angry with him. So maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in the end, I probably would've moved out anyway, and he (inaudible at 11:41). That's just to make it stop. And I don't want to be part of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:52) you're kind of, I think, self-flatulating (ph) (inaudible at 11:54) for being angry with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which pretty much sucks for you, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I hate being angry with James but also am, you know. I am living with my husband. People annoy you when they live with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've heard about that somewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, occasionally and, you know, I did—when I tell him or, you know, the things that are more about me, which is most of the time, like, my real desires right now [in so far as I have them] (ph) are to hurt myself and not to be alive. James is kind of the biggest obstacle for those for me, and so there it is. And so I told him that and, you know, I think that was distressing for him but, god, I hope it wasn't a surprise. [00:13:06] (pause) It is a huge part of me that really wants to shield him from that, like, that's what I want and that's how I feel a lot of the time right now. I don't think he should have to deal with it, but he does have to and I can't shield him and (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>So I didn't really buy it yesterday morning. I may not have managed (ph) this. (laughter) When you said that, you know, I probably would still feel pretty crappy, but then it's good that I knew what I was feeling and that that was a good thing. I'm coming around to your way of thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) Well tell me about not buying it, which I guess it where it starts. [00:14:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Mostly I've just felt like there's something there but I can't get to it? You know, like when you have an itch, like, way down in the back of your throat sort of thing? (pause) Yeah, and so, like, knowing something's there is not the same as knowing what it is or experiencing it or being able to do anything with it. (pause) But, you know, I feel better this morning, so there's that. [00:15:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I shouldn't. (laughter) It's (ph) James in a tough spot and probably going to have some hard conversations today (inaudible at 16:15) and I still have to keep going (inaudible at 16:23) and I don't really want to keep going. [All of that's more OK] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is part of why I may have been right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suspect so. I don't know, I don't really know how you do what you do. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, it's like, I talk to you and sometimes I feel better and I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 17:25)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible at 17:29)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I don't know what I'm going to say to (inaudible at 17:59).</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I don't know whether I should talk to Sascha or not. I'm assuming not. I really don't want to. The thing is that I (pause)—I'm really angry at Sascha, but I also really care about her. I really care about her. James does not. Yeah, you know, I feel like I understand her to some degree and I know her and she's pretty fantastic in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [How so] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's very loving and generous about some things and she's very funny and kind of sharp.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, I'm wondering (inaudible at 19:14) if she's a little (ph) like your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Not really. They're similar in both (pause) kind of having really good sides to them, but (pause) I want to say being very damaged in some ways, but I feel a little icky about that sentence. But I get to see a lot more of Sascha's good side than my mom's. And (pause) yeah, you know, she is really hurting and, you know, (pause) I just (pause)—you know, I'm not as close to her as I am to Franco, but a lot of that is that I just have more of a history with Franco.</p>

<p>(pause) I don't know. (pause) I feel like Franco really [let me in his life in a long time] (ph). [00:21:14] I'm pretty angry about that also. You know, [that's really looking into my eyes] (ph). I don't particularly enjoy (pause) talking with somebody that I'm supposed to be close to and just knowing that you're not really talking (inaudible at 21:49). But, you know, I pretty much hate everybody right now, so if Franco needs to not talk to me, like, now's the time. (laughter) I don't want to be around people.</p>

<p>One of the professors in my department came into the coffee shop yesterday. It was rough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I said hi. I took his order. (inaudible at 22:39) working at the coffee shop. Not somebody I know very well that's (inaudible at 22:52). That just hurts.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I'm good at my job (inaudible at 23:54) been there for very long, I guess, and (inaudible at 23:59). (pause) So, why do you come to a coffee shop for a double espresso? That's stupid. I mean, [inaudible] is right across the street. IF you want an espresso, go there. Seriously dude. (laughter) But I guess I'm not allowed to say that. Lots of people leave. I mean, you're not going to, like, stay. If you don't want to make friends. Like, if you don't need a friend, don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it hear it a little bit like, "You're just going to come in here and make me feel like shit [when you could] (ph) be getting better espresso across the street." Everybody wins (inaudible at 25:05).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, I guess there's that. Well one of my friends from the department came in the day before yesterday, I guess, which was kind of another matter entirely. Like, he had come in specifically to see me, which was very nice except, like, it felt very—he's, like, a little bit self-absorbed and so he kind of saw I was working bar and he kind of came over and kept talking to me, and I was just really trying to concentrate or not screwing people's drinks up and they had a big line. So, like, you know, I talked to him, kept working, but—and it was, like, if he was going to talk and I could just, like, listen and nod, but then he wanted me to, like, have a conversation. I was like, no. Go away. This is over now. Like, this is not going to happen right now. I do actual work here. (laughter) It's not just like I sit around lightly (ph). I'm always having to do something. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may have noticed that I seem to be busy here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) You know, I guess it was (inaudible at 26:26)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause) I'm not sure (inaudible at 27:06), but there are some uncanny things about this job that seems to me. I mean, one of them you sort of mentioned to do with (pause) being nice and being friendly and, like, only getting to kind of a certain depth with people that recapitulates some things about how you are with people when you're depressed. And also, the other one I was thinking of is (pause) how visible you are, including to people you work with in your department or know from your department and from school generally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, people want to know about the (inaudible at 28:11), like, they want to know about my life. They ask me who I'm seeing, they ask me what I do. (pause) It's tough. I mean, obviously I'm not working on the (inaudible at 28:29) we get a lot of school kids. Oh god, some of them are assholes but, you know, they're young. Some of everybody are assholes, so (pause). You know, like, I'm scarily good at this stuff. I like the talking to people part. (pause) I don't know whether it's very good for me (inaudible at 29:05).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's the question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it might be really not good for me. This job, the job I get. And in some ways, it is really rewarding. Like, it's really nice to be thinking very fast, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I guess I want to be clear. (pause) I don't mean to be saying I think it's a bad job for you—that's not what I think. (pause) It's more (pause) I guess it seems sort of uncanny in how it fits with some ways that you cope or, like, (pause) (inaudible at 30:23) the patterns in your life, some personality, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 30:29) and I have experience now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I mean, in a way it adds up and it makes sense, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It rewards coping skills that maybe aren't so good in other areas of my life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. At the same time, like, (pause) (inaudible at 31:05) put that front and center where it's easy to look at. In other words (pause), it seems to underline, like, how this fits with other things and how that cannot work for you in some ways. (inaudible at 31:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 31:21)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but, I mean, from my point of view, I don't (pause)—I don't see the job as a bad thing, per se. I mean, (pause) you know, if you were in a relationship that had some abusive aspects in ways that also reconfictulated (ph) things from your past, I would see that as a past thing. Apart from issues that are being stood up, I don't see the job as being like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Well, good. (inaudible at 31:58) finish training (laughter) and (inaudible at 32:04) (laughter)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Sometimes I really like myself when I'm working. Sometimes I really hate myself. Sometimes those are coming from the same behaviors. (laughter)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>It's not like I can actually talk to anybody [as many of] (ph) anyway. [00:34:32] And I guess it's good enough to be able to [melt the time till it's gone] (ph) (inaudible at 34:41) (laughter)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>(inaudible at 36:47) (sighs) (inaudible at 36:55)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there are ways that the job (pause) is confronting you with (pause) the fact that you're not doing one of the things you love, I think, and have trained for, and the ways in which you are (pause) kind of work (ph) deeply upon your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a very different business to run (inaudible at 37:55) you know. It's kind of a little more of a problem (inaudible at 38:05) couldn't possibly know anything about the intellectual life. I mean, (laughter) I say this to basically all of my coworkers though, as far as I can tell. You know, more of them are in the arts. Most of them are really smart. I would say, I don't think anyone else has had to drop out because they were depressed, but I don't think anyone else would think that of me, so. What do I know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 39:09)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it would be very satisfying work if it didn't hurt so much (pause) not to be doing nothing else. (pause) [It works for the time it doesn't] (ph).</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Even that I'm embarrassed about needing to take time off, or it's not even that—I wouldn't be embarrassed about needing to take time off if it were just me. Or maybe I would be. (laughter) It feels like I talk to people who are in my field and already (inaudible at 41:44) came in yesterday and it feels as though they're thinking, "Oh well, I guess she just wasn't good enough. I guess she's not smart enough."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they (inaudible at 42:06) coming from me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [But if it hurts you] (ph) (inaudible at 42:14)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>There are all these things that hurt me that I just can't do anything about.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>[I want] (ph) to be slightly less surprised when they happen. [00:43:25]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 43:53) for now. (inaudible at 43:57)</p>

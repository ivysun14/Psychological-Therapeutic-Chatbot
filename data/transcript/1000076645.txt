<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is January 25, 1971, first interview between Tyler and -  now I want you to pick a code name. Something to identify the tape with. Maybe say something about where you're at, maybe not. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can change it at any time. You're not stuck with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a regular name?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or just anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, any number or name. Something that might signify where you're at. Or maybe not. Something you feel comfortable with, or not comfortable with. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Carrie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Beg pardon? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Carrie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do I spell that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: C-A-R-R-I-E. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: C-A-R-R-I-E. Carrie. Anything I ever write here, you can look at any time. This is yours.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It belongs to both of us, but mainly belongs to you. [0:01:12.3] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ordinarily I do a preliminary interview. I do some testing. But you've been tested to death, probably by now. And interviewed to death. All right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we'll do without that. Is there anything else I want? No. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But everything's recorded, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I do think that was the agreement that they, yeah. I've been rushing. Very speeded up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Barry (ph?) too. Are you a priest?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's one of my costumes. Missionaries are (inaudible at 0:02:00.9). Just one of my costumes. This week (ph?) In other words, legally I am, but it's just a ruse. I mean it's, well, it's for certain things, but it's just a legal thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has something to do with social change. Something to do with the redistribution of power and things like that, but that's a whole other story, unless you really-we could do that later or something. But it's a whole... functionally no, okay. Anywhere you want to start, that would be great. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, see, I don't know-I've never been to anything, you know, like, and I'm really nervous about coming. [0:02:40.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay (inaudible). What's going to happen here, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't-see, I don't really know anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about if I give you 2 minutes of dialogue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, this is what I think we should do. Three things ought to happen. One, you should talk about how you feel. And I should listen and try to help you with that. Point one. That's something I call "I Processes". </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a mirror image of that, something I call "Out processes", which is I say how I feel, and you help me with that. Ok?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then there's another everything else. That's the type of one (ph?) that I call "Out processes". And then there's everything else that I call "We Processes" which are things that you know, like sometimes get in the way of the one (inaudible at 0:03:22.6) "Out Processes" like "Oh, he might be angry at me" or I might be angry at you and we can't listen to each other and we're not talking about it, that's when we talk about it. </p>

<p>And we do "We Processes". Or you might be liking me, and you want to say that. And you can't say that, so, that might get in the way too, so we talk about that. And we do "We Processes." Now the way I think it ought to go-it's up to you though-Anything is up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From now on it's up to you. We did our thing, we tested you. Interviewed you. Evaluated you. We did all this terrible stuff to you. Now it's up to you. I suggest, however, I'm an advocate for a certain way. My advocacy - my advocacy is your feelings on a 'we' issue, then my feelings, then back again to you. Ok? So, I, you're first. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you want to be. Or anything. Questions. I'm just..</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think I should tell you my feelings, like, you know, about being here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Good idea. I like that idea. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that I, you know, would really feel-I feel guilty kind of about being here. [0:04:31.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taking up, just about, all our time, and you're paying so much money and it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and I -  then they both say I'm going to-I don't - I guess I really have sort of missed the boat. You know, therapy and things like that. I mean, you have to be really sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you got to be-or otherwise, you're just wasting our time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really - -we have to, we have to pull you in, right, we got to be-</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We got to give you a patient (inaudible), you're really out of it, right, otherwise you're wasting our time. And besides that, you're not worth it, right? I mean, who are you to take up all our time? Right? Is that the feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, yeah, and almost like a cop out on myself, like why can't I, you know, like you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why can't you do it yourself? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like when I first when into counseling, it was during exams. You know, at Christmas, I just felt horrible. I felt horrible for the whole month of December. Because I was just sure that I was intellectually the most inadequate person here, you know. And I just sort of hated myself, kind of. And I judged all that I was, in terms of my intellectual form. [0:05:34.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you weren't feeling very well. Not only that, you needed help from somebody else. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and I just felt that I couldn't keep on bitching to, you know, everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At everybody, friends, and, I mean, friends are wondering why. Ok, that's-did I get that, like, did you feel I was with you on that or no. This will be awkward at first, but we can get-</p>

<p>(voices overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - awkward all right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:05:52.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me tell you how I feel, ok. That sounds exactly like when I went into therapy cults or [inaudible] or whatever that stuff we do over here. Of course that's when everybody goes into is-graduate school-uh-ok, graduate school is, very oppressive, it really is. Particularly on women, particularly on women. Particularly at the NYU. Terrible. Yuck. It's really true. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) Yeah, I-it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, now where are you? What does that do for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel better. You know, I just, I just feel kind of funny about being here. See, I was going to be-I was in a Gestalt thing for 3, I tried it three times. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) whosy, whatsy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was horrible-</p>

<p>(voices overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been in one of her groups, too. That's why I selected you, by the way. I've been in one of her groups and I thought it was horrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really? Then I - well - and I reacted by thinking I was just a closed person, I can't relate. And you know, I didn't go the fourth time, I just-because I was just doing nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so, that's a sign of health. [0:07:03.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering how you would fall on that dimension, because I just went once. Of course, it's my business so I, you know, I probably could catch on a little faster. But she's incredibly good diagnostically, like, knowing where you're at. But in my opinion she sets up a bad process by doing everything for you. Telling you who you are, and molding your personality for you,</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought, no-see, no, I thought - she was channeling everyone-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I meant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so, I - I didn't like it at all. And she-there's certain things that she kept on reinforcing like this one guy-everything anyone did he'd start crying. Apparently she thought that was just great, that he could cry in front of a group. I thought after a while it was silly, but no, I didn't like that at all. Then I had this friend here who was in counseling she-they had that experimental counseling thing in the fall. 0:07:55.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she just really, really liked it. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who'd she see, do you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: His name was Dave. He was in - I - he's in the theol-in... And she really, really enjoyed it. Got that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My sister's in it. In clinical psychology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, at Penn. And she's in therapy. And she's been in it, for about, I don't know, for maybe 6 months. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so, why did you come? You didn't come because they were in clinical psychology and all that. You came for other reasons. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because Jessica New said it was really good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? So what's your problem? What are you doing here? Why are you taking up my time? What are you doing here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Millions of problems. Oh that's really hard. [0:08:49.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to tell me. Come up with something vague, doesn't have to be specific. Like there's some fell sense that there's something not right with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I really feel like there's no reason that I shouldn't be happy all the time, and I'm not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot of reasons, from my point of view. You're a graduate student; you're a woman graduate student. That is enough to make you unhappy right off the bat. I got the feeling that you think there's more to that or that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't think that-I mean, you know what, I think people so easily say all their problems kind of stem from being here at the NYU.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That may be right. (inaudible at 0:09:27.3) for you like there's more. You have a sense there's more. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always just felt, sort of, that you should be able -  that like that's almost a cop out. I mean, if you're in a place, you should be to, you know, try to build something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "We issue". Let's do a 'we issue'. Now 'we issues' are like we don't have to listen to each other. We just express how we feel and like, we don't have-when I listen to you or you listen to me, and I adopt things, like, we really try to understand what it is inside. On the "we stuff" - just - we can argue or laugh at each other anyway, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, so we have a disagreement there. Fine, I think. That is, I think the major - I mean, I was a graduate student here at one time and I was impotent. I was terrible, yuck. And I went upstairs to the therapy here, right here in this very office, as a matter of fact. And a lot of it had to do with other things, but a lot of it had to do with the plain fact of being a graduate student. </p>

<p>You're evaluated all the time, you haven't had a good idea, then that's terrible. Stuff that like. Challenges the status quo and all that mess and that's not good. Particularly if you're a woman, because women don't know anything, right? How can they have those ideas? And it's a really terrible for them here. Wow. So, I think that's a big thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's really true, in the English department also. You know, like you just feel that if you're a guy you get ahead anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you in History?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:10:51.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Oh the History department. Oi, hates me of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I am in the MAT so I take summer courses in education. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who are you connected with in the History?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who is your advisor or main teacher or whatever that is? Do you have one of those?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anybody like have a stick over your head in History?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One professor, but he left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who?</p>

<p>PATIENT: White, Hubert White?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's in American History, and I just really hated him right from the first time I was in class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meade is terrible by the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Meade? Oh he taught American Civil War, I didn't have him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's just a personal opinion. Confidential tape, never say it in public. I might say it in public actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) He was horrible. I just felt that, he just sort of judged me. I knew anything I said-also, you know what happened? This happened in another-we were talking - I was saying with this one book.</p>

<p>That for the first three parts, you could really build a case for her being a lesbian. This is why she's so involved with Thea's hair and all that, and all the sexual imagery. But this one was really involved with Freud. And I couldn't, see I couldn't talk in classes at all. You know I was just so intimidated so I could talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I hardly talked in this class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably were in fact intimidated, not just-it's more than a feeling, I suspect. [0:12:21.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you have to stay away from authoritarian males as advisors. They'll kill you. (clucks tongue) I've seen it happen a zillion times here. These guys who have great reputations for being friendly and warm. Pschew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that was White. But anyway, so, I finally kind of talked, and I said this. And I said you know it falls part in the 4th part, I think, trying to say that there's a whole sexual relationship between you know, Hedda and Thea, we had been discussing. And this girl said, "Oh god, I can't stand all that shit." She says, "What kind of woman are you? Do you know what Freud thought of woman?" and she just -  all everything with Ibsen. </p>

<p>We did Ibsen and Shaw, especially Shaw. She was just all attitude towards women and this great wonderful women's liberation and things like that. So I said to her -  I turned around without even thinking-I just felt like I was really angry and if I didn't say anything to her, I'd never say anything again in that class. I said "Before you go off half-cocked" and the whole class started laughing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's very good. 0:13:30.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: But afterwards, she was the one who sort of interrupted me and everything, but I felt some sort of need to say something to her. So I said I didn't mean to, sort of, cut you off like that Diane, I'm really sorry, because I know you wanted to discuss it. </p>

<p>And in front of everyone she said "Well frankly, I think that was really a bitchy thing to do." And she walked out of the room. And I just kind of-oh I just wanted to-I felt really horrible. I couldn't talk at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just walked out of the room?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's scared of me anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that, yeah, that's like... You couldn't have-there's nothing there to defend yourself, like you were guilty (inaudible) like you were standing there holding the bag, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no, but I just felt rotten by myself because I always kind of thought of myself of being able to, you know, when speaking about things I felt about, I just felt like I couldn't do any of that anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The rotten part for you is having a stop here, right? At the neck? Like it's all blocked up? It's clogged up your system. 0:14:42.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, then I just feel like a failure in every sort of role.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Ok, I understand that. There's another instance for me anyhow, with the system here of graduate school, it's just designed to have it stop right there and clog up your system. I really think so. Very heavy here, very good example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really worse here than other places?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. I am connected with some people who do some serious social change. And in terms of racism and sexism and all of that, you always use NYU, no matter where they are in the country, as a prime example. It's good in other-I don't want to put it down completely-but on those dimensions, wow. Incredible. And since it's just a great-you know, the problem there is not that that's it -  I mean, that's not your problem. The University is also great in other ways, and you get things confused, and you say 'oh, look, this is a great university; there must be something wrong with me." Ok?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a great university. It's also a racist institution. Also means -  racist I mean broadly defined, like oppression of women, too, in that. But it's also a great university too, and, it can be a good university and don't do those other things too. And then, so if you look at just the great university, you feel so inadequate, then you look at the other things and maybe you're not so bad. </p>

<p>PATIENT:Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's my opinion, for what it's worth. [0:16:17.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it... But I'm here (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you're here, yeah, right, so there's more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's like how do you handle it, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you handle it, right. That's what we do in all these tapes. We talk about how that-first of all, we get to know how you feel about it, and then we talk about what the hell to do about it. I don't know what we should now. Talk about what to do about it or talk more about it. Maybe talk more about how you feel, I don't know. Whatever you want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well this quarter is better because I'm student teaching. And so, first of all, I'm like really planning everything. I don't try to do-In my class it's-I don't do that much talking or anything because I don't want that. But I mean, I just feel like it's my ideas that are coming out because I have to structure something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it sounds like that's a situation where you have some choice over how you live and do and work and so that's good. And like, and the other stuff is not like that at all. You just take your rote notes and spit it back on the exam or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure and plus, you know, this is incredible pressure. I'm taking a course with Donkin now, and American Society of 1920. He put everyone in a little seat and made a seating plan. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh beautiful, great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He didn't get your name, but he'd associate a name with a face so he'd realize how much you contributed to his class. And you just feel, I mean, it's like show and tell. All these kids have their arms like halfway there, kind of, you know, before he starts, you know, so they can get it right up there and answer him. </p>

<p>And what they say is not important at all. They don't really care. It's just that he'll, you know, have to be repeating their name enough so it'll stick in his mind. [0:18:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm recommending a book to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I've read it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you? Ok. It speaks to that issue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's kind of what - the whole self directed learning thing is like what I'd like to do in my class. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's really a fine book. But not at all. The whole thing that they don't do anything with teaching people, you know, how to teach, sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I hear in there is, I hear evasion anger. Am I right? Do you hear that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. But you see also. I just have this feeling that a lot of the professors in the History Department feel that the people in the MAT program are inferior. First of all - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure they do. [0:19:08.4]</p>

<p>(voices overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - it's a lot of girls. And isn't it nice? You see, one thing that really makes me angry here is it... you know, the guys I've dated here tend to, almost have a similar thinking "Isn't that cute". </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, aren't you cute. Put you in your place. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you'll be a cute little teacher. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A couple years, and you'll raise babies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what they feel, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had, the first time I had my class, I tried to explain to them what I thought, you know. Just explain to them what I thought we would do. I really don't start teaching until next Tuesday, tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-oh. (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I thought maybe we could follow the theme of love to literature. It's just sort of a loose amorphous thing I thought we could follow through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's great, great, (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so they said, "We ain't going to do that, because that's white women's love and you don't know nothing about black women." And I really didn't know how to handle it. I really wasn't expecting it. You know, I didn't do that really good a job. And they kept on saying to me, "What-How would you get married? What do you think of marriage? I suppose you think communal living would be really cool-well, baby, we've been doing it for 300 years." And all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you ask them what they think about it then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I - - yeah, I didn't then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's a good one-yeah, that's a great thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said there's a difference between love-you know, is it black love and white love. And see they wouldn't separate it from sex, sort of, and they just thought that I was going to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you were feeling pressed to the wall or something like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can we do a 'we' thing on that? Let's try to analyze what's going on there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all, they're irked your tail. And they were goading you in that direction. So the issue is not the content as far as I can see. Ok. Now I don't know how you want to deal with that. It's harder to deal with that. But I think the issues ought to be straight, like, the content was not it. Like they were flirting (inaudible) or whatever you want to call that. Did go across your head, maybe. [0:21:15.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I don't know how to deal with that except to reflect their feelings. Do "I Processes" with them. Just get at their feelings and like, try to get from them what they think it ought to go. You don't have to answer those questions. You may want to answer "They... [You know]." (ph?) You don't have to let people put you on the spot, if you don't want to be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I didn't want to define myself for them. I felt that's what they do, they put me in a box. But I didn't. I just said something like "Well, I don't really want to discuss what I feel personally about it now. Maybe later after the class." But it didn't come out right. I didn't do that good of a job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's all right. That's a hard, hard situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the school is an all black-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: St. Thomas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:14.9) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right next to Jimmy's. (inaudible) All black girls school, maybe half of them are nuns who teach them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is grammar (ph?) high school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: High school. I'm teaching eleventh and twelfth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh well, yuck. Aaah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dynamics of that classroom, you know, because I come in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I bet it'll be easier in the little run, maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could've put [in Queens] (ph?) because I wanted inner city teaching. And they really told me not to come. They said the first teaching experience would drive you out of teaching. You just really don't know - you won't even know the language. Jargon with the kids. So I'm thinking maybe they were right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be hard. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to laugh. (ph?) So this is sort of in the middle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let's do some "we" stuff. I see you as wanting to fight. That's who you know how. How are you at expressing anger? I mean, is it easy for you? Hard? Do you do it? How do you do it? What do you do with it? Why is it there? What do you do with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I maybe swear. I mean, I don't hit things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do-do you get release from it, or does it still stay all up in here? Wherever it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't, because I know I rationalize about them, so I don't feel a release, no. [0:23:48.8] </p>

<p>See, all the time I think, there are certain things that I get angry about, but I can handle them, right there in the situation, I just feel someone is really stepping on me, or something is not going right. </p>

<p>For example, I was just really angry when my master's teacher said I want-have you thought of grading, and I'd like an organized plan of what you're going to do, day by day for the first two weeks. And I just said "I don't teach that way. I'm sorry." And that made me angry. I felt like she was trying to hem me in. I don't like the way she teaches. </p>

<p>But there are other things, especially with feelings, like depression and stuff like that. I feel like I really shouldn't be depressed, sort of. Naturally, I kind of rationalize it. I say "You're a disgusting bitch. All these other people that have such horrible things happen." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like depression isn't it? That's one step away from depression. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I'm a no-good bitch" is one step away from depression. I think. Anyhow, that's (inaudible at 0:25:10.8) Say more. I missed your point though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought it was really neat (ph?) how you said I deal with anger. And I don't deal with it. I think I really sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't seen a woman in 'therapy' for my entire experience, my entire career, who hasn't had problems in expression and anger. And I'll tell you why. Little girls are socialized not to be angry. Not to express anger. It's not-good girls do not express anger. Good girls do not smart-they're nice and they're warm and they're feeling and all of that and it's pathic (ph?). They stilch (ph?) anger. </p>

<p>And then it gets hard to a situation like this, not only in this university, but in the MAT program, where everybody looks at the (inaudible) where you're all good girls but you're not very smart. We'll tell them what to do for two years and then they'll get married. Right? Now if you have any other aspirations, you're a dead goose. </p>

<p>You're going to run into situations every day where anger is just going to bottle up in you. So the trick is to find out either how to knock down the structure or how to express your anger. That's one way of expressing your anger by punching your teacher in the -  whatever you do good, kicking (inaudible at 0:26:36.5) Or tearing down the structure in some way alternative, sometimes called social change. Or something. I do all of those things. Plus I have to play squash and tennis and run. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to do physical things?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I punch doors and tables and things. I have to do all of that because I'm in a very similar position. Here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And what you're doing...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm kind of in an oppressed position myself. Not like you're oppressed, wow. You're the prototype of being oppressed, just about. Yeah, you are the prototype. Let me ask you this. What does your father do for a living?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He is president of a college.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, of course. </p>

<p>PATIENT: This is an education centerhold or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to make a list of ways you're oppressed. You're white, you're a woman, and you're middle class. Now if you were black and a woman, you'd be in better shape today. In graduate school today. But you're white, middle class. In the MAT program, phew, wow, you really are, it's really amazing. I meant it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, a shitty (inaudible) on top of it all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) On top it all, the (inaudible at 0:27:57.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know what the hell to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The students enjoy life better than the faculty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are not kidding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But no one knows it but those few students, and they're girls, and who cares what they think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, too, we've kind of been trying-in English. We've been really dissatisfied with the full theme (ph?) of the program. And they just sort of treat us differently. It's really fun what they do to us, you know. It's like "All you kids to is bitch (inaudible at 0:28:24.1) so I'm not even going to listen. And why can't you be like the people in History or, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Shut up and do it." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus the History Department is so crappy, also. The way they run their program. The way everyone takes it. All the pressure. The girl lived down the hall from me just freaked out and left, in History.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, my roommate was in History, he'd been in it for 4 or 5 years. That's why I know a lot about it. My ex-roommate. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You're a (inaudible at 0:29:01.0) too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give me any advice (ph?) particulars, about the History department. Maybe I can help you on that. I don't mind giving advice. As long as you don't take it seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) You don't like to or you do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I do-I don't mind it. A lot of people in this building don't give advice. I do, all the time. You don't have to take it. That's 'we' stuff. 'We' issues, and they're very tentative. They never know anything about 'we' issues. The only thing I really know about it is how I feel (ph?). Sometimes I have trouble with that, and you can help me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You can help me. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now we are we? See, I'm talking too much. I should shut up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's good, because you know that's how therapy works. Someone could (inaudible at 0:29:44.8) and just stare at you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, exactly. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Until you talked. And if you didn't talk, just stare at you. Or you didn't talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way most therapy is, most frankly. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be so uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's very uncomfortable. See, that assumes that all the problems a person has are intra psyche. That he's (inaudible at 0:30:05.7) and we give him a blank wall, they'll all come out, all these problems. And that's been a prevailing view, pretty much up to the last 2 or 3 years. And a few of us are saying that's not really so. </p>

<p>Most people are, there are socio-structural things to deal with, like the parameters. There are real structures out there that are pounding them in the head. And you got to work those out, otherwise. Especially with women. Women's problems are very rarely, in terms of getting in touch with how they feel. </p>

<p>I don't think that's your problem, frankly. Where was I? I feel that particularly with you. You're a very good example of a person having a problem, not with how you feel. You're not crazy. In any sense like that. Nor are you that far away from how you feel, I don't think. But I see your problem lies in two areas. </p>

<p>Correct me, if this an off the wall guess. One, not getting touch with how you feel, but finding a safe way to express it that is productive for you, that doesn't get you in more hot water. Two, that's one. Expression of feelings, such that, it's productive for you, or at least not harmful. The second part is changing structures you're in. Which make you feel that way. </p>

<p>Like, expression of feeling under most of your situations may be harmful to you. Big risk, high risk of saying "Fuck off" or "Back off". High risk in that. So maybe you have to come in here and pound on my head or something. That's okay, I don't mind. I'm very good at anger. </p>

<p>You can always be angry at me. Even if I did nothing wrong, you can be angry at me. That's okay. So, that's two things, two ways we should talk about today. I'm going too fast or something, right? [0:32:19.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's just that it seems really neat. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:32:29.8) tape record you. There's three of us in this hour (ph?) now, the tape recorder and you and me. What's wrong with it? (refers to squeaking noise)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably should be oiled. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, thank you. No, where are we?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember, it's really like awfully-it's just like I have to make all these decisions like where I want to go next year, and it's just really lonely, being here, too, I would say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's all these decisions to make. Also, I don't want to be an adult. I don't want to make decisions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hear a little pain in that. When you said 'lonely' your eyes changed for me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I just-have you been to (inaudible)? Have you been in to films (ph?) - Swedish films? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, should I? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh god, that's fabulous. They really are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I should do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's one that's called-well, it's called Swedish Love Stories. It's a very sensitively done story about two thirteen year olds adolescents who fall in love. But it was just so strange because it was Friday night, and I didn't realize it was the opening night. </p>

<p>And I went and the whole middle section was saved. It was all these-it was like the Swedish Consul was there, and all these sort of upper middle class people, like from the North Shore, [Radilan, Majoran] (ph?), things like that. </p>

<p>I said "I don't want that. I don't want to be any of those women." I don't think. They just look all hung in, and handled (ph?) with all these heavy furs on them. And they all look the same. They really all look the same. Frosted hair, and how they all did their exercises every night, and were on the grapefruit diet. [0:34:14.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That reminds me. That feeds right -  nicely into a issue I wanted to talk about before we... I'm just in costume today. I'm a faculty member today, a clinical psychologist. And I had to go through a critical faculty meeting today. And they don't take me serious anyhow. So I thought I would come in costume and look like a professor. I don't usually-this is not me. This is a costume. So is that a costume. I usually wear jeans, and if that's okay, I like to do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll wear jeans if that's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh sure, sure. I'll be in dresses. This is the last time you'll see me in pants. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to teach usually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Starting tomorrow. But, so that, you know that really bothered me, you know. And then on top of that, in the movie, there was, the thirteen year old boy had the girl. And the girl had a twenty-six year old sister-in-law who'd never been married. And she just kept on crying all the time. </p>

<p>And she said to this girl "Well I can't stand" She said "I go down the street and I know everyone is looking at me and saying 'What's the matter with you? Why aren't you married?'" And she said I see them all pushing baby carriages and things like that, and I just think I'm really strange. So I have this friend (ph?) and we were talking about that, and I just-because that's sort of what you're getting. But there's just no -  how many options are open for you when you're a woman?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. That's right. You have to make the cut. That's painful. That's going to be very painful if you do want to do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you get-now it's all right, then you get all - and your friends just go off, kind of, and they're all sort of married. But actually I graduated from college last year, one of my roommates, she married this guy. I can't stand him, he's an idiot I think. And she just sort of does everything for him. </p>

<p>And they think I'm strange because when I go there and say that, if he's eating the food I cook, he should help me do the dishes. You know, that's all there is to it. Things like that. And, I just really felt that she's kind of losing out. I feel badly because I really love her. I care for her deeply. And she's just really happy. She's not doing anything. She was going to go to graduate school, but now she's not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of an example of what you want to get away from. That's painful to see someone you love or (inaudible at 0:36:54.60). Even though, she's happy, though, there's probably some pull for you in that, too, I bet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, there is a pull, because she did a funny thing. All these things come pouring out. Whenever I-there's 3 girls in my family. We were all pretty close in age. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's the oldest? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a sister Rose, who's 25. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're in the middle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm in the middle. And I have a sister who's a junior in college. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how old? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Twenty-two. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Twenty-two. And your other one is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fifteen. And I have a brother who's twelve. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my older sister and I are just incredibly close. I just consider her, a sister but also a really really close friend. My younger sister and I really have problems, arguing all the time, and things like that. But, you see, the one thing that has always kind of bothered me is that my mother is always sort of ignored the emotional side of our lives. </p>

<p>She'd never ask me who I was dating or anything like that. She never does, now. And that bothers me. They sort of emphasize the intellectual part. Yeah, I guess they emphasize the intellectual part of it. And we've all been sort of on paper really successful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that you don't feel good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and I don't - I feel less successful every day. [0:38:47.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's big for you, that's heavy, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that really bothers me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say more. Lots more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not. I just sort of feel like parts of, you know like parts of my life are being-it's hard to explain. I could go on, like my mother writes me letters. They're just so superficial. I can't stand it, you know. It's like six o'clock, Daddy's not home yet. Dan's playing hockey. Mrs. So - people I don't even know. Mrs. So-and-so came over and she's on this hospital aid committee. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, I got enough information. Let me see if I know where you're at. When I say that, now, you can keep giving me information, but it would be strictly for you, I think at this point. Let me try to get where you're at. You know who you remind me of? You remind me of Sandra Markowitz. Parts of Sandra Markowitz. You know who Sandra Markowitz is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That movie? A Thousand Clowns? [0:40:00.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, [Jolly lady...Gladys] (ph?) I hear you being very lonely now, and needy. And that's good. I don't want to take that away. I want to talk about that for a-because that sounds very good. That ought to be filled. We oughtn't talk that one away. We ought to not do "I processes", like when we talk about that-well, we can talk about it too much, but not so much that it goes away, I don't think. What we want to do is find something to fill that. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. Now, get into that loneliness. Don't try to push it away. Get into it. It's going to say something to you. It's going to tell you what to do, when you get - you got to get into it more. There's all kinds of things here too-we're doing a whole number here today. [0:41:06.5]</p>

<p>Ok, let's talk formally now. Because I want to talk. We got five more minutes. Let's - is that okay? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still nervous and everything. How're you feeling? First how are you feeling? What is that? That's okay, what is it? What? Where are you now? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just-oh my god, I almost just started crying in here. I couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Terrible! You can cry in here. It's okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but no, I never cry-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look at that, I got 3 boxes of Kleenex. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I just didn't think I would. I mean, I really-that's what just shocked me about that Gestalt thing, to hear that guy crying. I can't imagine crying in front of people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's ok, I like that. I mean you don't have to do it, either. You don't have to do it every time, but if you want to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) But I don't want to today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to today. Okay. Because like if you keep-you'll eventually cry here. Either you will or I will. One of the two of us. </p>

<p>PATIENT: We'll do it together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm serious about that. One of us will. But we don't have to do everything today. I want to give you something. Now I am going to give you something but you don't have to take them seriously. You don't have to look at them if you don't want to. </p>

<p>And particularly if you don't feel good, don't look at them. But if you're feeling good, and you want to diddle around in this business here, okay, but it's not required. Particularly this one isn't required. None of these are required. Peruse through it a little bit, and try it on yourself, try it on your roommates, your (inaudible at 0:42:59.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I live in [inaudible]. (ph?)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh ick, phew. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Harvard Surf. University Education] (ph?) whosy program. Wow. Woman.</p>

<p>(voices overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It'll blow your mind! (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not impressed, at all, so. Another thing, here. There's parts of this that you might find interesting to try out on yourself. </p>

<p>(voices overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only [consolation to you UL] (ph?) in (inaudible at 0:43:39.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to get a bunch of copies of that in the mail pretty soon. So I can give you one of mine. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Great. Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, one more thing. I have something that I'd like you to do, and this is just for me. I'm doing a - one more thing-none of this is required. I'll give you 2, to give you an idea of what I'm doing. I only got (inaudible). I'm showing this to (inaudible at 0:44:14.1) What did I put down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm give you copies of this. I'm going to have them Xeroxed today. I had three papers on this. On what I think I'm doing in here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'll give you those, maybe next time. I have to get those Xeroxed today. And you, machine, we have to have a discussion with this machine. What else? Oh, one more thing. I have in here - before the next session, I'd like you to do this. I want you to put down one word-at least one word or sentence-what went on today for you, or where you re at. Or anything about today. Okay? </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just stick it in my mailbox, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I come back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, before you come back. This is confidential too. And you can take this back so you (inaudible at 0:45:14.4) I want to keep a file on you. I'm going to give it to you; it's your file, when we're done. And you can take it home with you and bring it back-whatever. It doesn't matter. Okay, now, next issue is do you want to come back again? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, okay, then the issue is when do you want to come back again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I almost left, you know, [when I was downstairs] (ph?).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This girl came with her parents, to therapy or something like that. Her mother was horrible, and the whole thing was awful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad you stayed. I like you very much by the way. In case you were wondering. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I like you. I really do. I was-I feel much more comfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, when's good for you? When would you like to come in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Monday's are good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, when else? Do you just want to come next Monday? Is that it? You want to come like a week day? In general? Next Monday is good, that you're saying right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you what I want to do. I don't want to put down once a week or twice a week or ten times a week or anything like that. But what we'll do is appointment by appointment. Whenever you want to come. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this time okay? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. How about 11:00 AM? Because I get off teaching at-that's good, yeah. (inaudible at 0:46:40.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My name is Felix. You know my name is Felix. What's your name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jennifer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-D-O-L-F-O. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) got to call Harry. Something I got to do about nervous (inaudible at 0:47:22.7) Okay, Jennifer? </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a shoebox downstairs. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I put that in there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll go down with you, and show you. Phew, phew. You made it through, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Horrible. What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You made it through, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You weren't bad, you weren't bad, you weren't bad. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) </p>

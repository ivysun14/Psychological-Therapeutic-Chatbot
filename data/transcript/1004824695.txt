<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't smoke.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh. So I'm sorry about this Wednesday (inaudible at 00:06) I don't know if you saw my text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did. I needed to check through something. I need to be at the  store tomorrow for a little bit, so I think it might be better if I just skip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can pose some alternatives. I mean, I could do three o'clock even.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to be, like, I think it might be easier just in general just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of, like, regardless (crosstalk) meeting at the regular time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I also have a spot (ph) in the morning. Would that be any good for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that just right now, I think that it might not be any...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:39) OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In order to be on my game, I need to do some stuff that morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I feel bad you missed, like, this will be the third one today (ph) you've missed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's OK, that's OK. So, any extra activity right now has been exhausting, so it's not necessarily—I don't feel neglected. I just (pause) I really need the downtime in other ways, even though...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it betters you, it feels OK, that's perfectly fine with me. I just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you have anything that opens up on Thursday or Friday let me know, but for now, I think I really do need the downtime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I absolutely understand. I'm going to be out of the office on Friday, but if I have anything open up on Thursday...</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, just let me know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it happens (ph) I will let you know. We will meet then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was actually a part of the exhaustion thing that I've been thinking about this. I am considering trying to find a way to pay to see a geriatric specialist, (inaudible at 01:43) weight loss technically, it (inaudible at 01:44) the phrase over at the hospital, because at this point I'm just really frustrated. I have the data to show that I am getting an awful lot of exercise, I'm gaining weight like crazy, I'm taking in very minimal amounts of food. There's no reason—and I'm exhausted. I mean, I am flipping exhausted all the time. And so, all this, like, stuff that you're supposed to be doing, like, I'm not even on steroids right now, so it's like, you know. And I got, like, real good valid data, like, GPS tracking data to show that I've been, like, walking around, you know, several miles a day, those kinds of things.</p>

<p>So it's like, there's something else going on. And even back when I was very skinny, it was very hard for me to lose weight. I was one of those people that was very, like, I had to go through—I mean, it didn't really matter, I didn't really need to, but I had to go through, like, crazy things to lose weight anyways. I just sort of stuck at whatever it was. And so, it's kind of a weird thing and so I'm just really frustrated. And I don't care if they have to, like, wire my mouth shut or something. I'm sick and tired of lots of things related to it. I'm sick and tired of the pain that I'm feeling. I'm sick and tired of—I actually put my—this is why it happened. I accidentally put my husband's pants on today and they fit. That really freaked me out.</p>

<p>And so, because I just, like, rummaging through some laundry and I'm just done with this, you know. Really done with it. And, you know, (pause) I mean, part of it is vanity. Part of it is identity. A good bit of it is I'm sick of feeling like I'm carrying this weight around with me right now, because it is painful, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure (inaudible at 03:46) to your joints, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's a lot of pressure to my joints. That's probably more than half of it, but then it's, like, (inaudible at 03:51), it's partially, like, actually being startled every time I see myself in the mirror, you know? Like, I'm just sick of it. Really sick of it. And I'm just getting so angry because I'm doing all the right things and I'm not getting what I'm supposed to be getting out of this. And, you know, I would love to talk to them and say, you know, I've looked into this, I've been doing things, you know, like, I'm taking less time (inaudible at 04:16), you know, I've done these glycemic things so that—the worst part is, every single day this week I've come home from work and immediately gone to bed.</p>

<p>Sometimes my husband has brought me dinner in bed, you know. And I've gotten, like, ten, twelve hours of sleep at least. One of the days in the last week I got I think—it was something ridiculous, like, almost 20 hours of sleep, you know. I don't know if I have a tape worm or what, you know. I mean, a tapeworm, I would be losing weight, but I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I'm sick of this. And I finally feel like I am now no longer giving them, like, bias perceptual data. Maybe I can give them some real things and be like, "OK, so if you don't want to give the blood test, can I just pay separately to get, like, my thyroid tested again, or something?" You know, it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have objective data of how much you're walking and it's not hard to figure out how many calories...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I take a picture of everything I've eaten. Like you said, for years, I've been eating (inaudible at 05:16) because it helps my stomach. 90 calories, you know. This is not, like, I'm not, like, waking up in the middle of the night and eating food, because we don't have it, you know. There are people that, like, you know. Yes, I know that people are very non-objective about this kind of thing, but I'm not. I'm really not. I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling at life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, you're just frustrated as all hell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have experienced more and more people in my life that are more and more petty about it and, you know, I'm just sick of it. I'm really sick of it. (sighs) And it feels just the one thing I can control, you know. I should be able to control. I mean, I am, you know, when speaking to a couple of people that I know closer to me about this, you know, I've had friends make jokes that I would have an eating disorder if I wasn't actually overweight, you know. Like, because I throw up a lot from not, like, from stress. Or not like a lot, but there are periods of time where I have thrown up more than a few times in a week, you know. [00:06:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's from stress?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stress, I think it's from stress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to being, like, from medications you're taking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, it depends. Right now not, because I'm not taking the stuff that makes me nauseated. But I think it's stress, you know. I haven't in over a week, but it's not like a binge-purge kind of thing. It's not even really like I make a—sometimes I make a conscious decision, but most of the time it's like a, you know, my stomach is extremely nauseated kind of thing, you know. And (pause) I'm kind of getting afraid to go to the dentist because of that. And, you know, it's just, like, I'm just freaking sick of all of this, you know. And I'm just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have every reason to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I should be able to vaguely control at least part of this kind of thing, you know, but I can't. And it's making me so damn angry. So, I actually—I sort of avoid finding a new gynecologist even, because I'm officially at the weight right now where my birth control doesn't work anymore. They (inaudible at 07:43) for that. And therefore, I get that great talk about that too and, you know, it's like, oh god, you know. Like, I'm sick and tired of having conversations about my weight, I really am, you know. So (pause), like I said, it's really frustrating. It's frustrating because I'm exhausted all the time too.</p>

<p>Part of it's, like, the fact that I'm not getting things done. I know—and this is something that Mike used to do back when I had to spend a lot of time in bed because I was injured. He just sits right next to me the whole time and does nothing. He just sits on the Internet. So, like, if there's, like, a bunch of dirty dishes or if there's something to be done around the house, nada. I understand not vacuuming, maybe not putting away dishes out of the dishwasher because you might be afraid of waking me up, but there are tons of things that you can do without—and that's not—he may under duress may say that but it's not his thoughts at that time. And so it's almost like time stops. It's not like the world stops while I'm' asleep, you know. And that's even more frustrating because it's like, yeah, I can't sleep because I have to do this now, you know.</p>

<p>So, it's even more frustrating me. I just, like I said, I'm just so over (pause) all of this. And no, I'm not responsible for keeping him on task. I don't even keep him on task. Usually, he sees me doing something and after a while he feels guilty and he asks if he can help out. I never really tell him, "OK, now it's time for you to go, like, take stuff downstairs," you know, wherever. But it's (pause)—and when I sleep this much at all it also makes it, like I said, it sort of amplifies our problems, you know, because I start to notice it more. The percentage of the time that I'm awake and that there's problems is much higher, you know. Like, if I'm awake for 18 hours a day or, you know, 12 hours a day or something like that, instead of some larger amount of the day then the amount of, like, (pause) his issues are diluted over the hours of the day so it doesn't seem like that's the only thing I'm dealing with, you know. Does that make sense? The hours of awakedness (ph) per, like, bullshit, ratio (laughter) is lower. Therefore... [00:10:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wakefulness to bullshit ratio?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't seem like as much bullshit? Or is it packed into a smaller amount of hours?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just, like, it's a lot worse, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if (pause) it's also that you're just really fucking fed up and pissed with so many things, you just don't have patience for it. I mean, I would imagine that you generally have tremendous patience for it. I mean, I don't mean you don't get frustrated ever, but you're putting up with a lot, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I apparently accidentally—and part of it's my fault, I guess. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:07) story up, but I'm guessing not. Go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, according to him, I sort of accidentally triggered him into looking at pornography.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, by doing what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, so I was looking at a picture. It was a hand drawn picture, and I was making a comment about the fact that this is supposedly supposed to be—first, I made a joke about it being porn. It wasn't actually—it's very cute, endearing, two people in a bathtub. And I said, "You know, the only thing I'm looking at is this bathtub because I am obsessed with, like"—I'm like, there are two people naked in a bathtub. You really don't see anything anyways. It's a cute little drawing. And all I could do is think of myself as going, "Wow, I really want that bathtub," and I keep staring at the bathtub. And I keep telling him about this and, like, how I keep coming back and obsessing over the bathtub, because my bathtub's crap. And I keep looking at this bathtub.</p>

<p>And apparently, like, mentioning the fact that making—the problem is that I unfortunately (pause)—and this is a problem. I've gotten better about it over the many years, but I previous to need to having knowing about Mike's problems, I have a lot of phrases that were very unpolitically incorrect that I picked up that are not appropriate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:20) technology engineering world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For example, whatever we at (inaudible at 12:26), when I worked for my old company, there used to be, like, all kinds of brochures and stuff like that, and it was referred to as missile porn. Because they have this, like, layout, like this pullout thing. It's like a, yeah, like a centerfold. And things like that. And so I got, like, and I mentioned...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:46) porn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And I'd gotten—especially because, you know, I'd been strongly involved in a fraternity and this, and I always lived in a male-driven life. And so, I've gotten very desensitized. And it isn't like I went out of my way necessarily to act like the boys, but it was just sort of a second nature thing to me. It never really bothered me. And so, yeah, so every time these phrases like this (inaudible at 13:15), you know, I just made a joke like, "I'm totally looking at this picture and it's pornographic." You know, (inaudible at 13:19) it's porn but [I was just] (ph) looking at the bathtub. It's not porn, it's two people in a bathtub, like playing with a rubber ducky. It's drawn, it's cartoon. Yeah, there's no body parts showing. But I'm making a joke about this and I'm like, I keep staring at the bathtub, wishing I had a bathtub like this. And apparently, that kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I stand by that not being your fucking fault in any possible way (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Can I get that on tape? (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (inaudible at 13:47) around, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's actually far more, like, illicit than that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could've left, like, you know, anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 14:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't like this was a blame thing. He just wanted to say, "Hey, you know, the way you were talking about that really triggered me and, you know, I just wanted to let you know that, because I ended up accidentally using it." And it wasn't like a look-what-you-did thing. I said, oh my gosh, how amazingly insensitive of me. I shouldn't call something like this actually porn when it's not, you know. I should've said it's a cute picture of two people in a bathtub. I just belittle that kind of stuff, you know. I just do that (inaudible at 14:31), you know. And (pause) it just sort of (pause)—you know, the funny thing is that usually I don't have this much trouble with it. It depends on what groups of friends I'm around, but I tend to not usually have a problem with making, like, comments like that, but I guess I've been thinking—it just changes my behavioral habits. Just like going to therapy here has made me swear a lot more, which has actually given me slightly a problem. Because apparently, like, I'm, like, swearing a lot more, like, on days that I come home. Luckily, it's not before work, but, you know, it's just (pause)—I'm a chameleon when it comes to speech patterns and things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you picking it up from me swearing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know where I'm getting it from. Maybe I'm just getting used to it, I don't know, because I only usually swear when I'm around my fraternity brothers. At work, that's sort of, like, the role I play as the goody two shoes who finds, like, words to say about people that are even funnier than the actual swear words. Or occasionally, we've made up new swear words. Like, we totally tried to make zune into a swear word. Like, we totally tried to, like, turned it into shit or fuck or something like that. That didn't really work, but....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 15:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we've been trying to do a galaxy too, occasionally. But, you know, it's like I'm definitely—and this is something I've been, like, all my life. I am a lot more of a chameleon. But at, like, work, although some people do swear, it's just sort of a persona I put on as the person who says something funnier than actually anything that you can actually say in terms of actual swear words. But, you know, and it's just like, you know, I don't know why, but I guess it's just because I've just made some—oh yeah, now I kind of know. But the point was I've been very lax with my speaking about things. And, like, it would've never been a big thing at all for making a joke about, like, you know, making a joke about something like that being, you know, calling it porn but not really being porn. And I even showed him the picture. He's like, "Yeah, that's not porn. Like, that looks like it was done by, like, you know, the special tender woman's dolls. Like, it's like cutsies (ph)..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 16:49) use of the word when (inaudible at 16:52) picture?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, he didn't see the picture at the time, but I totally was not. But the point though is using the word was very, you know. And he even admitted that it wasn't really him, but it was something that set it off and that was all something. But I still feel like maybe I am being disrespectful on some level to his struggles right now, you know? And yeah. So, that's, like, you know, that's, like, really frustrating. And so that makes it a lot harder, you know. He just shuts down. Like, I don't know what the hell he's doing right now. I don't necessarily know all the time he's—he (inaudible at 17:39) upset about, like, eleven days of sobriety, but, like, at this point in my life right now I don't necessarily disseminate that the pornographic use with the video game playing that much anymore. Because the same thing, it's like this obsessive, like—I'm trying to remember the word that we talked about using this. He becomes very disassociated afterwards. If he's been playing—I actually have seen this with other people, these long term turn-based games like Civilization, after playing 12 hours of it, you're disassociated because you've been playing 12 hours of Civilization, which is unfortunately not all that strange in my world (inaudible at 18:21). But they get kind of, like, spacey and not really altogether there either. You know, kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that way both will (inaudible at 18:31)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't necessarily know. It's not bad. It's not nearly as bad, but it is definitely—there's a little bit of a personality change, but I can't ever—that's one of the few things he has fun left in his life, so I'm not going to be, like, raining on his parade about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he often play that long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I hope not. I don't know. Probably not that long, but I could see three or four hours. Like, the amount that, like, to me seems like inordinately long, you know, but, you know, it depends. I mean, and the thing is there's a difference between social gaming and, like, you know, that kind of thing where there's, like, a bunch of people together and everyone's sort of part of what's going on, but you're—it's kind of a social activity. And doing this kind of stuff forever. But to me, actually what bothers me more is the fact that when he does this that because we are broke, he has been stealing and that he pirates a lot of the stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The games themselves.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The games themselves. And me being, like, the only person on the planet who really cares about this, I don't know, but I programmed for a living at one point in my life and I am hardly—I don't care what they say about sim buyers having enough money—he doesn't justify any of that, by the way—I think it's wrong and on top of it, I think it opens up a whole window to things that are much worse. Because once you start getting these programs that are hacked so they can do this, there are other things that come along with it, you know. Trojan horse type stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, like, malware type thing (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 20:11) play them when you don't have the disk, the software that allows you to do that or, you know, there's a lot of things that open up the gate for that. And on top of it, these type of websites have very unsavory practices in general that we've had problems with. So it's like, yeah. I just feel like—and this is—I hate being one of those people that's very black and white in this though, but I really feel like it's, like, the easiest way not to, like, have these troubles is just never to go there. Just like the easiest way not to have, like—and you know, things in life, by playing by the rules for the most part. Not everything's fair, but for the most part you're going to get mostly a clean break on it, you know? You don't steal, you (inaudible at 21:00) in jail, you know, that kind of thing. Well, although some people do. I mean, these are, like, these are the super super small, like, outliers when, you know, innocent people have these things happen to them.</p>

<p>But as long as you keep above board—and maybe this is because I was raised by attorneys, I don't know, you know. But, you know, like, as long as you obey the rules then, you know, that's kind of a thing. And I know that if we had the money he would buy them, but he doesn't actually try—there's a lot of people I know who justify, like, piracy. He doesn't try to do that. He just says he's broke, you know. But I just, you know, it's a lot to have to deal with. I am sort of—especially, like, I don't know. I feel like at least when it's on a console, it's out in public on it too, because a lot of its secretive stuff. You know what I mean, like, a lot of the gaming is, like, him and his—he's very secretive. He doesn't believe me. I work with a lot of people. By the way, one of your colleagues comes to my store. [00:22:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible], yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible], yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she stood us up two weeks ago. And boy, that was hard. It was a friend of mines, it wasn't me though. But yeah, so, like, I deal with a lot of different people and I know what is and is not secretive computer behavior, and he still doesn't believe me on this. Like, doing a lot of the full screen things, have a million windows that you swap between, like, you know, having this, this, this and this open, but you can only see one thing at a time, like, and being, like, it's very secretive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like the equivalent of walking down a dark alley in a bad—I mean, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more than that actually. It's more like (pause) I don't even know how to explain. It's like, OK, if somebody had, like, their windows, like, tin-foiled over, it would seem a little bit suspicious, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. Or all of a sudden someone put up these ten foot, like, fences that you can't see through? That's kind of weird, you know? And at first, it became like, "Oh, you only work for the elderly." No, I teach a lot of video editing. I deal with a lot of people and they're not that, like, shady about this. And I tried to explain to him that the (inaudible at 23:28) and he think he's started getting it now, sort of, that all of the secretive behavior is leading to the, like, addiction, you know? He doesn't see it that way though. The problem is he doesn't—and I hate—I don't want to be the policeman, but there is nobody else who sees this except for me. And so it's like, yeah, like, nobody would know in the world that he disassociates (ph) if it wasn't for me, because I'm the only person that sees it. Or the playing the games about being at one, like, location instead of another one? And at the same time, it becomes like a, "Well, Debra must be exaggerating this kind of stuff." No, no not really, you know. [00:24:07]</p>

<p>And so, even with the secretive thing, like, because or—this kind of behavior, like, no one would see it except for me and therefore, like, for many years it was completed untreated because he seems like the best patient in the world. Then he comes into therapy, because I don't know if he just doesn't know about it. Like, I think he's keeping it secretly from himself. Like, I think that he doesn't even have a clue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, like it's not just sort of conscious deception, it's (pause) like he represses it, disassociates it from what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like it happened to somebody else. He, I mean, regularly, he doesn't have a memory from one minute to the other so, like, this is pretty, you know. And (pause) I don't know. That makes it easier...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are a number of things that you said about him and his (inaudible at 25:08) that make all you're saying seem very sensible or plausible to me. In other words, the combination of the way his mother has treated you guys, you know, some of the things you've said she's said to you and to him, him not having really hardly any memories of his childhood, the extent of his use and addiction, you know, disassociation—it all sort of fits, like, for somebody who would, like—my, like, from doing my type of work, like, it all fits together. It all makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to get really, really angry that they were not being—because they're all claiming that they really want to help with his recovery, they want to be really, like, forthcoming, but they're not telling me what's going on. I realize they just didn't fucking notice. Like, if there's nothing to tell, because they didn't know. Like, they didn't pay attention enough to know, which is just as bad. You know, like saying...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah, because I follow that's kind of where the problem started. Not just the addiction but, like, the potential for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, not being (inaudible at 26:27) notice because obviously (inaudible at 26:29) noticed was, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well they weren't paying attention to him. That's why [he's got] (ph) a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the same, it's not like the mother who goes out partying. She's in the same freaking house, sometimes in the same freaking room. And that doesn't, you know, she just didn't care. There is actually something else that I hadn't really thought about in a long time, but makes me believe something even more to that. About the time that we got married, Mike had to get a copy of his birth certificate so he could get a passport. And (inaudible at 27:03) we had to get it, and the first time there was a passport that was just "white baby male" and, like, we thought it was kind of strange.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 27:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's it, along with a couple of other things. And then we called them. They're like, "Oh, this is wrong, you know, let's send out this new one." I am starting to think that they didn't name him for a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because apparently I guess back a long time ago, you could actually leave the hospital with a birth certificate that was just "white baby male." So, I mean, this was not like a they typed it up—this was, like, a photocopy, and then they sent me a new photocopy. So I'm starting to think that they didn't name. I know that they called him "the baby," well, OK. I mentioned for a long time that I was totally blowing things out of proportion by saying that they called it "that baby." It's actually "the baby" instead of "that baby," because that's a totally different thing to say, by the way. Completely different. There's, like, extra bells and everything.</p>

<p>But yeah, they referred to him as "the baby" for a long time, not, like, any identity at all. So, that doesn't seem—I'm not, like, looking for something to be more angry about, but it—whether they did or didn't doesn't really matter, but it does show, like, there's a potential for, like, neglect. Like, they didn't even call him by his own name and possibly didn't name him for a while, you know? All because he was male, and that's the thing that's even weirder is that it's, I mean, it is obvious the way that females are treated differently than males in this family, completely. And the biggest friction I have had is being without, you know, basically having two X chromosomes but having what they perceive as a very masculine behavior, being kind of a problem, you know. I mean, that's—to them, you know, these things that they don't like. [00:29:06]</p>

<p>Like, just saying things like instead of, like, asking, like, you know, where would you like to, you know, there's people—I hate this. Like, if somebody wants to go somewhere to eat, I wish them that they'd tell me that. Not like, you know what I'm saying, you know, what did you have—like, if I say, "Want to go out to eat?" If I really want to go to one place I would say, "Let's go out to Uno's to eat," not, like, "Let's go out to eat." They would see that is as what do you have in mind? It's like, I would've already said if I had something in mind. Literally, when I say I don't care it's because I have no preference.</p>

<p>And (pause) it is so creepy and so weird knowing that the females in Mike's family and now seeing this next generation having this happening again, the girls dominating the crap out of the boys and even making fun of them, like Mike had, you know. It's really upsetting. And (pause) it (pause) brings me so much inner conflict, you know, with this (inaudible at 30:25), you know. Especially because if we adopt, we will likely adopt from China, where almost always it is girls. I mean, that just tends to be what, you know. Although he said that he would (pause)—it wouldn't bother him gender wise, I think that on some level I wouldn't want to have another—it's weird. Like, I just (pause)—the whole, like, raising children and making sure these patterns don't happen are so damn important to me, you know. And it's (pause) I mean, we've discussed the concept of not even just—if we had kids, like, you know, by whatever means just not really telling them until it comes up that we have kids? Like, if the conversation comes up that we do, sure, but not, like, going out of our way too, because well, you know, that's kind of (pause), you know. [00:31:31]</p>

<p>But (pause) (sighs) it baffles the imagination. But when he's around (pause) the right influences, he's such a good man. Like, when he's around my fraternity brothers? Fantastic, you know. When he's around people that are not, like, (pause)—or when he's not isolated, great. You know, being around people who are derisive is actually kind of about the same as isolation, because whatever he cooks up when he's by himself is worse than probably anybody else can think of seeing. And I feel like (pause) he gets (ph) so much better when—and that's probably the biggest reason why for so long it wasn't noticeable until we got married and, like, moved away, is because of the fact that we lived kind of almost dorm-style. [00:32:36] Like, we lived in a shared house with a lot of different people, you know. There was privacy, but there wasn't room for secrecy as much, you know what I mean? Because there almost somebody awake all the time. And it's so tempting to get ourselves in to some sort of situation again where this is a lot of people around, all the time, people that are good for him, you know. That because of the fact that it is so—I mean, but that's not really practical as an adult, like, living in a shared house with a whole bunch of people, you know, it's just really not. But he just responds so well to being around people, you know?</p>

<p>And it's just so heartbreaking because (pause)—and maybe I'm, like I said, being over dramatic on this, but it is not I don't think a stretch of the imagination that he could've been extremely (pause) fucked up in a different way, like, killing children kind of a way, you know what I mean? Like, people who are, like, ignored like this, that kind of pathway tends to go, like, it's possible that it could've been a lot worse. [00:33:57] And to me that really feel like he has a strong moral compass because he didn't give into the terrible things that could've happened, you know, and he has overcome it and, you know, when he was at this all boys school. And when I met him, almost all men, you know, like, things like that, he had a great experience, you know. If it was, like, mixed gender it was fine, but, like, it's like (pause) it could've been really bad. And maybe it's just, like I said, my entire, like, knowledge of this is from watching television but, you know, whatever somebody, like, ends up killing a whole bunch of people on a spree, it's always, like, the person who was neglected and, you know, and this and that. That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think people who have been extremely neglected as it sounds like he was often wind up doing that, but they don't necessarily wind up being a kind of decent (inaudible at 34:59) and it sounds like he can't (ph) either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and not always dysfunctional either. To most people, it would seem like he's a lot more functional. But, like, he has an amazing sense of empathy, you know. He always thinks of other people first, you know, and this and that, and (pause) yeah, you know. And so many people that know him would never ever guess, but also not just never guess, but wouldn't believe me if I told them. Not because I try to be cruel....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it just doesn't seem like him to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: that's just not the person that they know. And that they would, just because they know who I am, they would take it into account, but it would be very hard for him because it's a different person completely. And it's just so (pause)—it's so hard, because I love him so much. I just don't love the addict, you know. [00:36:00] And (pause), you know, we're trying to make it, you know. And as the holidays come up it becomes a lot harder. We're trying really hard to find real traditions to have that—because his family doesn't have a whole lot of tradition. Most of the traditions they have revolves around ladiness (ph). I thought that the reason why they put the Christmas tree up on Christmas Eve is because, like, everyone's there and it's a Christmas tradition. He told me, he's like, "Yeah, it's just because my mom didn't want to really bother with, like," he's like, "having to go up to the attic and get it till, like, Christmas Eve came around then it became kind of depressing without a tree." That's like, OK, great, you know. [00:37:03]</p>

<p>Some of the traditions revolve around junk food, that kind of stuff, you know. I remember at one point that when we went there for Christmas to Mike's sister house, we had a fabulous dinner of—what's it called—Taco Bell. And I totally get it that sometimes people don't want to cook for that kind of thing, but don't invite somebody over if you're going to all go—unless you're saying, "Hey, you know, we're all going to go out and get Chinese food or something like that." Tell people that ahead of time. Don't, like, invite people to come up from Florida, from Orlando, drive up five hours, you know, and not tell them. Otherwise, we would've bought food, you know. I don't know. I want them out of my life. I mean, they're not in my life, but yet they are every single day because they have influenced things, you know? They influence everything about our lives right now. And then occasionally, we get random, you know, letters in the mail saying, like, "I'm stopping doing this," or, you know, some sort of random threat about something else. And it's like whatever you least expect it something weird happens, you know. And so, I don't know. [00:38:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they've caused you tremendous grief, mostly through seeing [I think] (ph) the things Mike's suffered through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The worst part is having them say that they are so on board for helping him and they care so much, but they really don't give a fuck. If they gave a fuck, they would've helped him get into innovation therapy a long time ago. He had an actual therapist had everybody come into the office and said, "He's probably not going to get better unless we send him off to rehab." That's more less what they said. And everyone sort of looked at each other saying, "Oh, well I hope he gets the money," you know. And (pause) at this point, maybe I am ridiculous but I feel like they did this to him, they should undo it, you know. We can't afford it—if we could afford it, it would be a different story. Not everyone call shell out, like, you know... [00:39:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, those places are incredibly expensive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Extremely expensive. And, you know (sighs) (pause) we all sort of a little bit admit to this kind of stuff. Like, oh yeah, I wasn't really all that, like, helpful with being around, like, to understand Mike or, like, this and—you know, they're all sort of skirting around whether or not this way, you know, responsibility, but why doesn't anybody just man up and say, "Damn it, I'm sorry, you know. No one was around to make sure that you got taken care of it." Or damn it, "I'm sorry. When, you know, you were supposed to be coming to visit me for the week because it's my weekend as a dad, you know, and I let you stay closed in the room with a video game all the time. But, you know, I really should have taken you out and engaged you and, like, had some conversation," you know. [00:40:32]</p>

<p>I'm not talking to them about paying a bill, though it would be nice. You know, I would actually feel OK if they just never even said I'm sorry and just paid for it, but I don't (inaudible at 40:42) if it'll work. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they're track record is not doing anything, except for pretending like they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It's so weird. For a long time I blamed me because it seemed like—well, I saw, like, they stopped doing when they met me. Because they had paid for, you know, private school, you know, this and that, you know. It looked like—at least from my point of view, it's like as soon as I came into his life, they just gave up. But it looks like it was just easier to (inaudible at 41:22), you know what I mean. Not easier, but (pause) it looks like he went out of his way to find a way to make it easier to go to private school, you know. Because his best friend was going there they (inaudible at 41:36) whatsoever. There's no reason why you never go to judgment (ph) school, but his best friend was going there so he found out that there was, like, a test he could sit for a potentially get, you know, a scholarship and—like, it wasn't all free, but it was definitely a lot more affordable and, you know, and things like that. But it was not as obvious to me at that time, for a long time. So it looked like took care of him, they fed him, they put him through, like, a relatively good education and as soon as I came around—like, this is why I have the same blaming thing, like, there's something wrong with me. And they were more than willing to make sure that that was totally helped (ph) along the way, you know.</p>

<p>And (pause) the worst part is that I am, if something were to happen to me, I don't necessarily know that they'd ever step in to help, you know. [00:42:35] (pause) I don't think anyone would come out to help him. I mean, my parents would, but I think on some level they would be worried about first of all, taking care of, like, the situation where I was gone, but also, like, on some level, also not trying—they're always so worried about stepping on somebody else's—like, too much responsibility for Mike's family, because they're not exactly great communicators for what they feel comfortable with or what they don't. So I don't necessarily—I think that he would fall through the hole and that he would just (pause) sit in the house and nobody would care. And that's pretty fucking sad, you know. [00:43:35]</p>

<p>And I just can't reconcile what is. And this is me oversimplifying things, like, to the nth degree, but I can't see what in the world a fucking, like, Y chromosome has to do with why in the world he's so impalpable as a human being. I mean, I'm really oversimplifying by saying that about masculine qualities, because the people who are homosexual in the family are perfectly OK. They like them. I think that his mom, in theory, wanted him to be single and, like, around him all the time, but maybe—but there are people that are not necessarily treated badly. So, I think that (pause) there's something, like I said, it's oversimplifying, but the fact that he is male, he's get treated so much worse, and I just don't get it. Again (ph) it's so wrong. [00:44:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [We'll stop] (ph) for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 44:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 44:50) next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, sounds great.</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [You do the same] (ph).</p>

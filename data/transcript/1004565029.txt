<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I kind of wanted Chris to come today. I didn't know if that was okay or what happens — if I should send you an e-mail or if you are okay with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Well let me know what your thoughts were about bringing him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I wanted to bring him just because we resolved everything on Monday evening when he got home, but I wanted to bring him because I feel like when it's just the two of us I have a really hard time [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:00) . I feel like in this instance I wasn't expressing myself the way I wanted to and I just feel like sometimes I'm kind of railroaded and I wanted to bring him here because I felt like he would be a little calmer and a little more open to seeing things in a different light. He apologized for his behavior. He bought me flowers and the whole thing and I explained to him . . . Our conversation Monday was very long — very long — like a lot of crying (chuckles) — a lot of me crying. That's what I expected. It wasn't like a shock but I had wanted him to come because I think partially I just knew I didn't want to deal with it. I wanted to just say, "I just can't even deal with this right now. I don't even want to deal with this because it was so infuriating, so upsetting to me." [00:02:17] I don't know exactly why I wanted him to come. As the conversation progressed on Monday, I was trying to explain to him because he was like, "You were in a great mood and then all of a sudden you were so upset because I said that." I repeated what you had said and I was trying to explain to him that I wasn't fine. I was already upset about him not really recognizing — he did make a point of saying . . . He did compliment me on the party, but I said, "Only after I prompted you. Only after we dropped your parents off at the train, after graduation. I don't know. That just feels like if I have to prompt you — if I have to say like, 'What did you think of the party?' something doesn't feel as good and I think you know that." And he was like, "But I said after you asked me and I said . . . " Am I just asking him for something he can't do? Am I just asking him for something . . . because that's not his family's . . . he just didn't grow up with people that compliment people. Is there a piece of apple in there? It's really distracting. And so I'm just asking something of him that like . . . Did you know there's an apple in your trash can?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. 00:03:51</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just felt like maybe I'm just asking him for something he's just not . . And so I was explaining I was upset about that and I kind of expected it and I got really silly feelings like I'm demanding to be recognized for the role I played in your law school career, but I was upset about that, too. You didn't even mention me during the toast you gave at the party. I just expected that you, at some point over the weekend, bring me a card — anything, right? Something that would stick, you know? I don't care what it is. I just expected at some point over the week or the weekend for you to acknowledge me in some way. It feels like I was trying to not have those feelings especially right on the surface on Sunday during, you know, it was the day of your graduation, our friends were in town, I was trying to explain to him that at the bar, I was already upset. So when you said to our friends what I just said, I was already raw and I'd had two cocktails and I was emotional. I just started crying. That's just what I do. [00:05:22] As the conversation kept going and going, we just would say the same things over at each other and over and over and over, and that always drives me crazy. Like why are we still doing this? And during the conversation, I put my shoes on and I had my bag and I said, "I can't be here. I have to go for a walk at least. I can't even be here right now. You're not listening to me. I'm not talking. I'm not saying what I want to say. I need to just leave for a minute and I need to come back. He was like, "Oh, yeah. Run away like you always do. Run away," because that really makes him mad when I leave and he thinks I'm doing it to make him mad. No matter how many times I tell him, "I'm not doing it to make you mad. I'm doing it for myself because that's what I need," he doesn't believe me. He thinks it's just something I do because I know how much he hates it. It always feels cheap for me to say, to play the childhood card, like that just feels cheesy to me. In these situations I feel trapped and it makes my anxiety skyrocket and I can't think clearly. We can't have a productive conversation because I dissolve into tears and emotions, and that's not helpful. I can't say that then because I 'm too upset. Nothing makes sense, and so I always just need to leave for a minute. I always need a break, and he hates that. So I don't know what to do about that, because it's something that I know I need. [00:07:18] And even when we just totally skimmed around it, I was like, "You just can't follow me like you did when I left." I was trying to say you can't do that. I totally freak out. You can't do that to me, but I never said the words. It's like, "I feel like you're acting like my dad" or "I feel like a little kid again." I never said those words, but it was implied. But I always feel so stupid even saying it, like it's just cheap. And like, "You should just know that." That's how I always feel. "Don't you know that's a totally unacceptable thing to do? Aren't you thinking about where I'm coming from in this? Why aren't you thinking 'This is totally going to freak her out'?" And he said to me, "What were my other choices there. Tell me what my other choices were because I think you should have just stayed." And I said, "Well that was not an option for me." And he said, "Well, you should have at least told me specifically that you were leaving." And it was like, "Well, then if I were to walk over to you and your friends and we would have had an awkward conversation in front of your friends, I would have been crying and I would have embarrassed myself, and I wasn't going to do that." He says, "Well, you can't just cry over these things." He was like, "I tried to talk to you when we were in the bar and I had said what I said and you wouldn't even say anything back." And I said, "I couldn't say anything back because I knew if I opened my mouth I would start crying and I wasn't going to do that in front of everybody." And he said, "Well you can't just cry about everything." I was like, "You can't really tell me to not cry, because that's just not going to happen. That's like me telling you 'Don't get mad if I leave. Don't get mad about it.'" That's just not going to happen. 00:09:39</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he understand that analogy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a good analogy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I said that he felt bad. I agree with him. I should have said something to him specifically. I should have pulled him aside. I should have waited until everybody left and pulled him aside. I know the mistakes that I made. And . . . I don't know. (pause) [00:10:19] We resolved it. It was like an hour-and-a half conversation and we resolved it. Then we spent last night making dinner together, watching TV and at the end of the night we came back to it and said like, "Are you feeling okay? Is everything okay?" We just talked about it briefly again and I used the word "abusive". I was like, "It felt like borderline . . . I was talking about it out loud Monday morning and it just felt like the way I was talking about you, you were this abusive guy, and it just felt weird and totally wrong." He was really devastated by that and, thank God, upset. It was like, "I don't think that's who you are, but that's how it looked to me Monday morning. That's what the picture looked like." He was like, "We both agree that this instance is a common occurrence for us. This thing has happened. This happens for us. I get mad. I shut down. I can't talk. I just don't talk, and he loses it. He can't handle it. Then it just escalates and escalates and escalates, and the madder he gets the more I shut down. I say that and it sounds like it's all him. It's really not, because I'll have said something earlier to instigate. I will say mean things. I'll say really mean things. It's not all him but then I get to a breaking point and I shut down, and that's just not fair either — to disengage, to just outright refuse to talk. 00:12:39</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of mean things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I called him a f**king psycho.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought that was after you guys started fighting. You mean before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. After we started fighting. I mean even the other night when we were talking on Monday night and I was saying, "Chris, normal people recognize their spouses for doing things for them." It was intended to be a jab. It was intended to be like, "Your manners aren't normal." That was intended to be a jab. 00:13:22</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you wanted to jab him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because his feelings are kind of weird sometimes. I just want him to fit into this . . . because his behavior isn't always so typical. Sometimes he really hurts my feelings and I don't think that he recognizes that he is a little bit different with manners and just like kind of sentimental things. He's kind of an outlier. I know that it's not just my opinion on that. And so, I wanted him to know that, "Your behavior isn't normal." I don't know. I don't know why I wanted to jab him. It was like, "You hurt me and you were wrong," so I wanted to prove my point like, "That wasn't normal. This is what normal is." I don't know. 00:14:33</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you hoping that he would do something about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was hoping he would say, "Sorry," and say like, "You're right. I should have." What he said was, "I was going to tonight. I was going to buy you flowers and thank you for the whole weekend." I guess I have no choice but to believe that that's what you were going to do, but it's just kind of lost now because now [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:59) and this is, like, so lame. (pause) I don't know what else to do in those situations because I just can't talk and I know that if I do start talking, it's just going to keep escalating things because I have like an "on" or an "off". I don't have an in between and I don't know how to find that because my attempt to do that is to take a break and to remove myself and take a break. So I guess what I need to say is, "I need to walk away for five minutes and come back to this," or like something, because I just can't in the moment. I just can't deal with it. I don't even think straight. 00:16:12</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why he has a hard time with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's OCD and he just . . . I don't know. I have no idea why he has a hard time with that. I should ask him. (pause) He's probably told me but it's probably been during a fight and I just don't remember anything. When we're in a fight I remember certain things, but for the most part I just don't remember it. I remember like, "You called me an idiot," and "You called me a loser," and those are the things I remember. I don't remember the whole picture. Sometimes he says stuff, but he'll remember things that happen in fights and I just don't remember it at all. I'm like, "I don't remember saying that. I don't think I said that." I probably did. He remembers everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how do you feel about where the two of you are now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great now. We're fine. Now it's great. I mean — not great, obviously. It's still (inaudible at 00:17:42). Last night we reiterated like, "I really need you to promise me that you're going to try to work on your temper because that was really scary for me and something that is totally unacceptable." That is exactly what I said to him last night and he said, "I need you to work on . . ." He said it nicely, (chuckles) "I need you to work on shutting down and not responding to me when I'm asking you a basic question like 'what's wrong?' I need you to work on that." I just don't know what to do to work on that. When he says, "I'm going to work on my temper," I want to know, "What do you mean? What are you going to do?" I feel fine, but we just have so much going on. Like we took last night and tonight to just relax and just not really do anything and spend time — just the two of us, relaxing — but then starting tomorrow we've got to pack and we've got to move this weekend. (snickers) It's just one thing after another.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are packing? I'm sorry — when are you moving? 00:19:12</p>

<p>CLIENT: Our lease is up June 1st.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're going to do it this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're here until the end of June?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And where do you stay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With our friends James and Emma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So you're both staying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum. Yeah. So — I don't know. I feel great — not great — but I feel like we really touched on every aspect of what happened on Sunday, so we're good about Sunday. I feel fine. I feel like we both covered more, like we repeated ourselves in the time that we had and I really feel we both saw each other's . . . I really do. I know that he just doesn't think of it. He just doesn't think to pull me aside and say, "This is great, sweetie. Thank you so much." I know he just doesn't think to do that. So I just either have to accept that or ask for it, which was what I was trying to be like "This is something that I need. I need you to kind of recognize me if I do things for you." He's gotten better about it. When we first started dating, he just didn't do it at all. (chuckles) I know that it's just not in his nature, which is the other part of it, which is why I was trying to repress it over the weekend. He just doesn't remember to do that. He just doesn't think of it. It's just not in him. [00:20:52] I really need to work on not shutting down. Anyway, I know that we have those things to work on and I'm still always nervous. I'm just always scared that something is going to happen, that we're going to have a big fight. We don't have any little fights. We never have any little fights. It's always like a huge fight every once in a while. I don't know. (pause) It just freaks me out. 00:21:51</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they are so intense and we're both really intense about it, and neither one of us is the calming presence. Neither one of us keeps their voice down, talk in a regular voice, neither one of us can maintain a regular voice. I always fall into tears. He always goes into . . . I feel like I'm in a courtroom where he's bringing in Exhibit "A" and it's like, "Shut up — I'm not opposing you in some courtroom drama. This is our living room. We need to be normal about this." (pause) It just turns into this huge thing. It takes us a while to come back down from that. Most of the time we're great and things are great, but then we erupt. I know it usually happens around these times when we have so much going on and bunch of stuff is happening. There is so much to do that obviously nobody's marriage can be perfect, but it's a huge flaw with us. I don't want us to never fight because that's completely unrealistic, but I don't think they need to be screaming matches. 00:23:37</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the out of control part that upsets you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, oh my God, our neighbors can hear us. Oh my God, uggh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you think about bringing him in? When did you start thinking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before I even got home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just didn't want to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you start thinking about it in the session? Before the session?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Part of it probably is I feel he needs to go see somebody, too. I don't know if that's part of it but . . . [00:24:42] I don't know. It's just all very upsetting. We had a great time last night. Everything was fine and we were [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:09) and we addressed it briefly and calmly and both were very calm about it and said what we needed to say. That always makes me feel better that we can talk about this calmly after we've kind of resolved it. We can talk about it not in a way where it's like, "Okay, well you were wrong." Not in a way where it was like we're keeping score, but in a way of like it feels really honest. "This is what you did to hurt me." This is what you did to hurt me." "This is what I'm going to do to try to fix it." That feels right. I think that's what we both want out of it, is acknowledgement of what the other person did — that they're going to try to change that. I think that's all you can really ask for. [00:26:08] Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It doesn't seem like — it's sitting better, but not well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just a little scary for me. There will always be a fear that he's going to turn into some sort of demon. I'm going to be afraid of that. I feel like sometimes I poke him enough to see if it will come out. I feel like sometimes I'm testing him. Sometimes I just feel like I'm totally the one who is screwing all this up and that he was just such a fool to marry me. I'm just always going to mess with him because I'm never going to believe that . . . I don't know. (pause) 00:27:50</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he's good. That he loves me. Like I'm waiting for him to really hurt me. I'm just going to poke him and poke him and poke him until he does it. (pause) It's almost like somewhere in the back of my mind that I want that. That I want him to just totally be this monster, because sometimes when we have these fights it's like, "Was he really that bad or do I think of it as this terrible thing because . . ?" I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I have my guard up and I have this whole perception of, "No, no, no. You won't do this to me because that doesn't fly." I'm like, "Am I putting that on the situation?" I can't tell. Like on Sunday, was that really as bad as it was or am I making it that because I've got my defenses up about abuse and that type of behavior? Am I making him . . . am I characterizing . . . (pause) [00:30:00] I feel like it must be such torture being married to me. (chuckles) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're wondering, "Is he a monster? Am I creating a monster or am I completely fabricating that he's a monster?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or is he just a guy? Like sometimes the top blows off and he's just angry. He's just an angry guy. Some people just get angry. Am I saying, "You're mad and you're my husband and you're not allowed to get that angry?" Is that what I'm saying to him? And because my dad abused my mom and was a scary guy, you can't get that angry. Am I making those rules for my marriage? [00:31:07] So I don't know how to look at just my marriage on it's own because it's like . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:31:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He just got really mad. That's not okay. He should rein it in. But did I make it worse in my head than it needed to be? I do have a flare for the dramatic. I didn't need to storm off. I just get so upset. In those moments when I'm so upset I can't bring it back down. I need to leave. I don't know how to fix that. That's just always been my impulse. I need to leave right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And why (inaudible at 00:32:41)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my husband is telling me that this aggravates me to no end that you do that and if I told him something that aggravated me to no end I'd want him to work on it. I feel like he deserves that, but I feel like there's a middle ground somewhere. I said before — we've had this same discussion before — so I've said "Can't I sometimes, if we're having an argument, just say like 'I need like five minutes. I need five minutes by myself to go take a walk and just be by myself for five minutes.' Can't I just have that?" He was like, "Yeah, but you never say that in the moment. You say like, 'I'm going to Emma's.'" I was like, "Well, if I just say, 'I need five minutes to walk around the block and just cool down, can I just have that?'" He said, "Yes, that's fine." But then I never . . . The other thing is our fights are so far . . . like our last fight was months ago, so I don't remember in the moment. All I want to do is leave. All I want to do is get out, and so I don't remember to just ask him to take a walk around the block and he's so heated in the moment that he's like, "Go ahead. Leave like you always do. Leave like you always do," and then it makes him so mad that I'm just going to leave that I know if I leave even for five minutes and come back, he's going to be even more pissed off. He's going to have those five minutes to stew. And that's going to be another thing. That's going to be just another piece of ammo. Like, "Oh, no. Just take off again. That's what you do." [00:34:35] That was also partly the other reason. I need somebody else to tell him, "It's okay for her to ask for things like that." I feel like just me saying it isn't valid. Sometimes I feel like me saying it isn't enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so if I said it, it would be valid? Based on what? Why would it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because you're a professional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. To tell him what to do or tell him how it is. Not what to do, but how it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if you said it was okay for me to ask for that, he would have to listen. (chuckles) 00:35:13</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like bringing a parent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you don't feel like he's going to listen to you as a sibling or something but [the therapist] [00:35:24] saying it, now he has to take it seriously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (inaudible at 00:35:33) He would. Like in a calm moment he says, "That's fine. You can ask for five minutes," but in a heated moment he'll be like, "Fine. Just leave. Go. Just leave then," and he'll be mad at me. I guess he's already mad at me so what the hell? What do I care?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does this feel like your voice is not strong enough but maybe there's someone out there whose voice is strong enough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. I just always feel like he's smarter than me and better equipped. I feel like the only defense I have is screaming and tears.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like you feel helpless at those times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like "You're not hearing me. You're not listening to what I'm saying." [00:36:53] I know in those moments everybody is, no matter who you are, you are trying to be heard. Most people don't really care what the other person is saying. [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:15) The urgency to have your point heard makes it harder to listen. I just feel like there are so many good things in our marriage, but then we have these huge fights and it scares me so much it damages huge chunks of the marriage and I can't get past it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it definitely seems that at some point, maybe when you move to New Hampshire, that you guys could see someone together. I think it would help with some of these issues.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably not a bad idea. I don't think I'd ever want our kid to see that — to see us yelling like that. I think it's okay for your kids to know that mom and dad fight and then they come back together and everything is fine. I think it's healthy and good for kids to know that, but I don't think it's healthy for them to hear their parents screaming at each other, even if it just happens several times a year. I don't think it's okay. 00:38:59</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you certainly don't want that little kid inside you to hear it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't. (pause) It's much harder when it's not just one problem. It feels like our personalities are the problem and it's both of us. It's not just one of us. It's both of us. We both are bringing so many little pieces to the table that are making this an issue and that feels so much harder (inaudible at 00:40:02) The good news is I was very scared about my job and got exactly what I needed and wanted with no drama, and that felt very good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you got?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The final week that I am working, I was supposed to be working the last two weeks of June but they enrolled the girls in camp, which was a little frustrating for me because I had told them I would stay through the end of June. So I said, "Well, I'm going to go to New Hampshire then so my mom doesn't have to find child care for Mark for that final week." She was disappointed and I said, "But I'll help transition the girls the first week of camp." And they are like totally flaking on the schedule. They wouldn't even address it, so I wrote an e-mail last week saying, "I'd like to figure out the schedule as soon as possible, please, for this week." Almost a week went by with me asking every day and so on Monday I wrote an e-mail and I said, "I'd like to really figure this out today, please." And they wrote back to me like, "I had a bunch of ideas, a bunch of thoughts," and I said, "Basically what I need is a minimum of a 30-hour commitment for you for that week if you want it to be hours with the girls or hours with me running errands or doing cleaning. That's up to you but I need 30 hours at least that week." And they said, "Absolutely no problem." I felt very productive and very good, even though their behavior was a little irritating to me, I asked for exactly what I needed and I got it, and that felt great. That was good. 00:41:43</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is what you were saying before bad news? Because you're saying good news.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. It's bad news to be at each other's throats all Sunday. Not good news. (pause) I don't know. That's all I can say about it. I don't know what to think about it. Part of me thinks, "We'll just grow out of it." Part of me always thinks, "We'll just grow up and figure each other out and kind of grow out of these things," because we have. We've gotten better about a lot of things. Like the first year we were here was really hard and we fought a lot. Maybe that was a because of a lot of things. Part of me feels like well — we just have to work out some of these kinks. We will always have problems, but some of these big issues will just kind of work themselves out - I mean us doing the work, obviously. It was scary for me to hear you say that you guys should go see somebody. That was scary for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it sounded like, "You guys have a real problem here. You have got to work it out." Even though I was the one saying that we have a real problem here. (chuckles) And even though Chris and I had said multiple times in the past that before we have kids we are going to go see someone, because we feel like in order to have a health marriage and start our family together, we want to really be able to communicate. We've heard the first year of having kids is really tough, and so even though we've always said that, hearing you say it — like this is my thing — authority. It freaked me out. It just should happen. Anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it freak you out because I was taking your concern seriously?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop. I got your check for your co-payments in April, so thank you for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so I will see you on Wednesday, a week from today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be great. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I look forward to seeing you then. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You, too.</p>

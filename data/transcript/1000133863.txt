<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the 12th interview, it's the 12th interview.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once in a while they get it all cleaned off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually no sooner do I get it clean than it gets messy again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I usually have a couple of kids do it. Of course then I can never find anything when they do it. Just kind of the, oh God, I am so tired. I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's only Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I think I'm dying of leukemia or something. (chuckles) I don't know why. I have a headache too. And yesterday it was the same story. I don't know what the problem is. Probably going back to work. With the end of the year and all, stuff is piling up. Tomorrow we're supposed to have, the kids you know are tested for sixth grade for you know like they take good old IQ tests and things like that. So we have a day and explain the scores to the parents and stuff like that. I'm really not looking forward to it. 0:01:36.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll bet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And next week they're supposed to be putting on My Fair Lady. I'm not ready and neither are they. Let's just call the whole thing off. It was a good weekend. Figure that's why I hate just going back to work. Finally have experienced intercourse. It's terrific. Really. I'm sorry that I hadn't tried it sooner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After all these years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: After all these years, really. 0:02:25.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not disappointed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nuh uh. Not in the least. Not in the least. Tanya came by Friday. And then a few friends came by and we went out and then we came back. She stayed overnight. It was nice. It was really nice. I wasn't disappointed at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you find yourself worrying about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was funny. Friday when, you know like we had been out and it was like I was in a very relaxed mood. And like you know, we had been drinking but I hadn't been drinking that much. I was just kind of relaxed which was kind of nice. Kind of a nice mood. So there really, there wasn't, I didn't worry about anything, you know. It was really nice. It was nice. 0:03:25.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't worry about having an erection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. Not at that point anyways. She is something. Unbelievable. It was great. It really was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by she was something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She just really turned me on. And then she came by Sunday and we laid out on the beach for a while. Then we went to bed for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It happened and you really like it. 0:04:19.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah, right it was really nice. It was really nice. It was kind of awkward at first, but you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of awkward because you weren't sure what to do, or how to get in or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Right, right. But between the two of us we worked it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:04:48.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It was nice. But yesterday she had called. I was really beat yesterday. We went out, we were on a picnic all day Sunday, you know. And I came home from work yesterday really feeling bad. And she called and she said oh she really had a bad day. Someone had stolen some money in her room. And she had to keep the kids after until they found the money. And this girl's parents came up and she was all pissed off. And the administration wasn't doing anything. Kids going to heck and all this stuff. And I knew that she really wanted to come by, you know.0:05:39.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanted you to say why don't you come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, why don't you come up. But I was just so tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just didn't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't want to. You know I was just beat. In fact I was in bed when she called. And I was really beat. And I just said, "Why don't you go home and take a couple of aspirins and go to bed." And this is really, just really threw her off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disappointing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Or why don't you want me to come by or something. I said, "I'm really tired." And she says, "Well I guess I will." So but I knew that she was really pissed off but I'm sorry. I just, you know like I just didn't want to see anybody. Which is really strange, I guess. 0:06:24.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like that you really enjoy sleeping once in a while.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:33.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm too tired to see you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it bother you that you felt that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't. Well yeah. At first I thought no, it really didn't bother me. And then after I thought about her it kind of bothered me. As if I was being very rotten, you know. After all she did sleep with me. And I should be more kind and considerate. As if she were doing me a favor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Her sleeping with you was doing you a favor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. And then I thought about it and she enjoyed it just as much as I did, so. You know it just didn't. But you know, she was really like I threw out in left field or something. 0:07:24.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. (inaudible at 0:07:26.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. But I don't know, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's more her reaction that disturbs you and bothers you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I don't know if she really can understand that. You know, that I didn't want to see her. I don't know if she can or not. This morning I would have loved to saw her. But last night I couldn't, I didn't want to see her. I don't know what's wrong with these past two days. God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe it's the reality. You look like you've had, sitting back in your chair.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Awful. And I woke up feeling so good this morning. I really did. I really did. I don't know. It must, it has to be the job. That's all I can think of. If I can wake up feeling good and then walk out of there feeling like a dog, it has to be the job. It must be getting to me. 0:08:24.35</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It takes something out of you. A whole lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh Christ, oh. In fact I felt tremendous until about 1:00. I'll call her up tonight and make amends or something. Last night she, after I went home and she called and she wanted to come by again tonight. I just, just don't answer the phone. I don't know. Which is really kind of rotten too. 0:09:58.1</p>

<p>I think it hit me today when we were drawing the scenery with the kids. You know, painting it? I mean it's all over this one room. I mean it's really huge. And this one part of it, we were going to paste play dough, some old play dough. And the art consultant came by today and he said oh, you know he had looked, he went to the Studebaker and he went to the D.R. Toy and all over. And he said he couldn't get any. And I thought oh, shit. Here I go again. And then it just hit me. I just felt so rotten. 0:11:02.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you'd laid it all out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Like I had it all finished and I was all ready to get it all done and finish it up. And then he comes up with this. And I just, you know, in fact he suggested, he said, "Why don't you just make like a brick wall and then just plaster some play dough around?" So I got the brick wall half finished. And I thought, "Well, if it's just a brick wall, I don't care." If it's just a brick wall.</p>

<p>I thought about after, after Sunday had gone by, and it come to me you know, I thought to myself I wonder if she's practicing birth control. 0:12:45.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't ask her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did she say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She was just, oh yeah. And I said, swell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you kind of wondered if she was lying or something? 0:12:57.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. I just took her for granted, she says oh yeah. She says you know. She says when you went to see your doctor, I went to see mine. I says, well he's not a doctor yet. And she says, well, she had faith. And I said well, I'm happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lo and behold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that she had, you know so. And she was, well what if I would have said no. I said I don't think it really would have bothered me that much. You just, you know, chances you take. After that I don't think it really would have bothered me that much. And then she threw out, well what if I would have gotten pregnant. I said that wouldn't have really bothered me that much either. You know there would have been a few adjustments to make but it would have been no big deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did she ask you what you meant by adjustments? 0:13:52.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: No she didn't. That struck me too. She probably presumed, and I just presumed she meant, you know I just meant I would marry her. And I would. Her. Maybe not somebody else. But her I would, you know. But she said no way. She isn't ready to become a mother at all.</p>

<p>It was kind of weird. You know like after she has reached a climax and she's all ready to go again after I have, you know. It's like, you know, let's wait awhile. And she's all ready to go again. 0:14:48.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She reached a climax before you did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And I did you know. And then she's all ready to go again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the thing about women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a biological difference. They can be ready to go again while men have to regenerate themselves.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. Which is kind of disappointing but that's part.</p>

<p>I saw, I watched a little bit of Dick Cabot last night and Omar Sharif was on. And he was talking about his son who was 14. And he said that, you know like when his son was about 11 he asked him, he said, "Do you like girls?" And his son said no, he didn't like girls. And he says oh. I guess not many boys at 11 like girls. But he said he was kind of apprehensive about the whole thing. He just wanted to make sure his son was on the right track and all this stuff. 0:16:15.0</p>

<p>But then he said he took him on a vacation with him and they had adjoining rooms. And he asked him if he wanted to go out to dinner. And his son said no. That he was expecting a guest. He says, ok. So he was going out to dinner and the waiter was rolling in the cart and the waiter was going out the door and the son puts the do not disturb sign on the door. And he said he came back from dinner and he said well, he said, having adjoining rooms he said he did hear, and he didn't have anything to worry about as far as his son was concerned. And I thought, my God. And he said it made him really happy, you know. And I thought, at 14. Christ. It took me 10 years more than his own kid. And then that. I said 14, wow. 0:17:06.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of made you feel like you were slow in coming around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Really, really slow. 14. Then we were, we separated the boys from the girls today to give them sex. And before they left last Friday we had them write out questions, you know, if they had any questions. And the boys' questions went in one pile and the girls in the other. So we separated them up. A couple of the boys asked about having sex with their brother and sister. And I was talking to Sara, the other teacher, and she says, well obviously, she says I'm sure some of them do. And I thought, you're kidding. And she says no. 0:17:53.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All these things you didn't know about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. I just you know, I you know I didn't really, you know why or how? Who would even think of it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You never thought of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be so out of the question that you wouldn't even think about such things. And she says she was sure of it. And I thought wow. But I just told them it was called incest and it was frowned upon because you know. Because of the different recessive genes can become prominent and all this stuff. They accepted it. They are, you know they get to the point where they're trying to shock you. 0:18:33.3</p>

<p>One of the kids, one kid was telling another kid to ask this question. He wouldn't ask it himself but he gets another kid to ask it. They were asking like, what is a rubber? And like what is Kotex? And all this stuff. But you know like I just told them. And then, you know after that it wasn't really a big deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, after they knew about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why had it been a big deal for so long?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really can't tell you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you said it, it was like knowing anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They were kind of getting to, one kid said you know, they really are very aware. One kid said can a woman still become pregnant while if you are using a rubber. And I said there is a possibility that it can occur. Another kid was talking about transvestites. And another kid mentioned artificial vaginas. And you know just all this stuff. And I thought, wow 11 years old. 0:19:40.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They really are wise in the ways of the world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I thought, Christ. They do know. I don't think all of them knew. Because some of them were sitting there really in awe. There was quite a few that really knew what was happening. It was really interesting. It was really, it was kind of like it was, it was even kind of sacred to think that you know like, the women teachers were with the girls and I was with the boys. And you know like we didn't even, usually we compare things about what the girls are up to. And we didn't even mention it to one another. It was like, wow, it was separate and that was it. It was really kind of nice that they didn't feel the need to say anything. 0:21:09.1</p>

<p>But I don't know, I don't see why they should be separated. I feel that they're going to perform the act together, they might as well know together. But they kind of wanted it. You know the girls and the boys really kind of wanted to be separated. I guess, I don't know why, maybe it makes a little more of a big deal about it. Maybe they feel a little more free saying things to someone of their own sex. I thought most of the questions could have been, any question could have been discussed in mixed company. 0:21:49.8</p>

<p>One question was, do you have to be in love to have sex, you know. I just said no. You know, just said no. It's nice, but no. I mean I'm sure that they knew it anyway. Things sure have changed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like when you were a kid you just didn't know. And it took such a long time to know about things. Now these kids, they seem to really know a lot. 0:23:05.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh, they just you know. I don't think like, the boys I don't think are ready yet. They don't seem to be as interested in girls. Some of them, there's a few of them who are. But most of them, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are these 10?</p>

<p>PATIENT: 11, 12. But the girls are just unbelievable, you know they're just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well they're coming of age.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah really. They're just, oh Christ. It's unreal, just unreal. And the thing is, you know like the girls go up and bother them and carry on. And they don't want to be bothered. You know just leave me alone. They really don't want to be bothered. They're busy with doing their thing and they just can't be bothered, you know. 0:23:50.8</p>

<p>It's how it can be. I don't know if it would really be worse if you separated them you know like if they were in separate classrooms, or better at that age. I don't know. Of course they did it, well in high school they always did it. Then I think it should be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking now that I've experienced intercourse if all my problems are solved. 0:24:58.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds kind of cynical or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know like it was such an easy thing, you know. And to make such a big deal out of it. You know like that this was going to make the difference. I don't know if it did or not. I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:25:21.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. So you know. It was nice. I enjoyed it. It was really great. But so, you know. But the fabulous thing about it was like there wasn't any guilt feelings about it. You know like there really wasn't like I could smile afterwards. And I just, you know I just didn't, but it really wasn't that big of a thing, you know. Why do they have to make such a, I don't know why they have to make such a big deal out of it. Or they make such a big deal out of it. You know it really, it floors me, it really does. That they make such a big deal about it. And God forbid if you have experienced it before marriage. That's really strange. It is really strange. Because it's really no big deal, you know. 0:26:20.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think back a while it would be a big deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was. Because it was made a big deal out of, but you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why make a big deal about it when it's likely not to become a big deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Right. That's the truth. It really isn't. You know just think about it. It's only a human function like anything else. Maybe it's they make a big deal about marriage is the whole thing. Within the church anyway. And I thought to myself, well how can a person go without it. And I think about, well of course I can never be certain, but you know like the nuns that brought up me. And I think, Christ how could they survive? It's only something that's natural. It comes natural. It's really strange, really strange. 0:27:18.6</p>

<p>You know I am thinking about the fact of why I didn't invite Tanya over. I'm probably being frustrated. But you know I, she says she gets to the point where you know she, we were on the beach you know. We were just lying on the beach and taking in the sun. And she says to me, she gets to the point she says I can't even sit next to you or lie next to you without getting excited and wanting to go to bed. And I thought well, I could, you know. It really you know, it just, it really didn't bother me. In fact it was kind of nice just lying there on the beach. But I don't know. 0:29:00.5</p>

<p>I thought maybe some people, some people must become sexually aroused easier than others. So well, I guess I'm one of those who don't become sexually aroused easily. I really, you know. But I guess you know like, the thing was I was thinking about going back to the thing that I, if I don't want to sleep with her then do I really like it? You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, yeah. You're kind of getting worried again. 0:29:57.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I don't want it so much. What does it mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe something's wrong with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, you know. Even you seem kind of out of it today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm tired too. Same thing. The last couple of days have just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is. Unbelievable. I thought it was kind of a busy weekend. Friday we were, I went over to Tanya's, her mother was giving this dinner party thing. And then her and I and her brother and her sister and her brother in law and this other friend of ours, we went downstairs. And we were playing monopoly which we hadn't played in years. You know just really a long time. And you know like none of us were even drinking. Just sitting around playing Monopoly. And her mother and her friends were all upstairs. And we just ended up really getting violent. Fucking capitalistic bitch, and just carrying on. And how the door, the door would be open and we'd slam the door. It was just like it's just the game and the words and like to be so offended and so uptight about the whole thing. 0:31:50.6</p>

<p>And we had, then the next day we, or was it Sunday? Yeah, my parents had a picnic at my cousin's. And we went over there. And we got to talking about it also. And like we said you know like we wouldn't use it in front of you because you would be very offended. But it just, they couldn't understand it. They were just, you know they would never use the word. Never. And I could, you know like I said, depending upon who you're with. That's the only way you would use the word fuck. And they just, you could see them cringe, you know. Really unbelievable. 0:32:40.0</p>

<p>Then my bother came home for a couple of hours. Came and then went. He had his, it was unusual. He had his girlfriend with him you know. They came in together. I guess it was his girlfriend. We had never met her before. And she was going to stay at the house. And I just you know I thought I wonder what my parents are thinking, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What they think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Between the three of us they must have really had a time. I'm already you know. It just dawned on me when my, I remember when my sister, she had gone out with my brother in law for years. She never really went out with anybody else. And I remember one time that she was sneaking out the back door and my brother in law was waiting in the ally. It was the middle of the night. I remember bringing it up to her and saying something to her. And I think she made me believe that I was dreaming. I think, maybe I was, I don't know. But I really sincerely think she had gotten to the point where she assured me you're seeing things. You were dreaming. 0:34:24.2</p>

<p>But I remember thinking about it and thinking that well she's sleeping with him. I was in high school at the time. She must have been out of high school. And I was thinking oh she's sleeping with him. How terrible and how awful it was that she was carrying on with him. But like now, it's something. It really is. I thought well how come it took me so much longer seeing that we were brought up in the same household, brought up the same way. How come it took me so much longer to rationalize the fact that it isn't bad. That there really isn't anything wrong with it. And it can be done and is done very often before anyone is married. 0:35:16.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's a hell of long time to believe something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah really, you know. She was always such a religious person. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh well. Since we're both out of it, let's say we call it quits.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Call it a night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. 0:36:02.2</p>

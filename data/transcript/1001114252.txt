<center><P><B>WUBBOLDING PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION TRANSCRIPT</B></P></center>

<center><P><B>Introduction</B></P></center>

<P><B>Robert Wubbolding, EdD</B> is Professor of Counseling at Xavier University, Director of the Center for Reality Therapy in Cincinnati and Senior Faculty at the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles. He has published 125 articles and book chapters, ten books and seven videos on reality therapy, and has taught reality therapy and choice theory all over the world.</P>

<P>In this session, Dr. Wubbolding demonstrates how his sensible, straightforward approach is equally effective with children as it is with adults. Through the use of a series of strategic questions, Dr. Wubbolding guides his young clients through a process of self-evaluation and priority clarification. In this session, note how he helps a typical teenage boy develop motivation and a plan of action to improve his grades at school, and increase the boy’s commitment to his algebra homework</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Hello, Greg. How are you doing?</P>

<P>Greg: Hello. I’m fine.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. My name is Bob, and what do you think about shaking hands?</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t have any problem with it.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. Good. Thanks for coming in today. How was it coming over here?</P>

<P>Greg: It was snowy.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Snowy?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I live a further south and we don’t get quite so much snow, but it’s quite a challenge. So how are you doing, just in general.</P>

<P>Greg: I’m doing pretty okay.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Are you?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: When you came here today, what…what idea did you have about what might happen here?</P>

<P>Greg: I really didn’t know. I didn’t know that we was going to be like taping or anything like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. You say you didn’t know?</P>

<P>Greg: No, I didn’t know.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, okay. Well, we explained it a little bit earlier, so you got the general idea.</P>

<P>What I practice is a kind of counseling where we try to help people figure out some things about their lives…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …and make decisions and move closer to people if they want to do that. And…and just kind of get along better. And it’s, not everybody has to have a big problem who receives counseling. So let’s just, let’s just talk a little about what you might want in your life that you don’t have. I mean, it’s kind of a general question.</P>

<P>Greg: Well, I was trying to work. I worked at Wendy’s. I was trying to buy a go-cart for in the summertime just so me and my and friends would have something to play with instead of just sitting in the house all day.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, okay. That’s for next summer?</P>

<P>Greg: No, for this coming summer up—coming up.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, this coming summer. So you’re working?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And are you happy with your job?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, it’s pretty fun.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Get to meet the public a little bit?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh, I work the front cash register so….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Do you?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. A lot of people come in.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. What do you like about it? I mean, what does it do for you inside…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …that you, you know, get out of it besides the salary, which is kind of out there. But what do you get, you know, satisfaction?</P>

<P>Greg: To get to like help people, like serve people food and stuff like that and really like interact with other people while I’m doing my job.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. And that’s enjoyable? Any particular kind of customers give you a particularly good experience?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, the people that just come in and laugh with me and stuff like that. Not like, "I want this right now," and who understand like what you’re doing.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah.Yeah. And that gives you a good sense of satisfaction? Is that what you’re saying?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Do you like working around the people or is that….</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. I like it okay.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. I mean some people like to work alone, you know.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And some people like to work…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …around people. When I was in college, I worked in a welding shop and I had to wear that mask, you know, that the welders weld with a little window and I had to work totally isolated all day and it was really hard, so. Made a lot of money but I quit.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I [INAUDIBLE]</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Because I, I didn’t like to work by myself. So some people like to work around other people.</P>

<P>So you’re going to save, you’re saving some money for…what did you call it?</P>

<P>Greg: A go-cart.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: A go-cart for the summer. Yeah. So you have a goal, I mean, you have a long range goal from now until next summer. You happy about that?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, it’s helped me keep my mind on like stuff that I need to do.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Like what? What would be an example?</P>

<P>Greg: Like I got to get my grades good to keep working and I’ve got to have a lot of self control to save the money because sometimes I just spend a lot of money on just….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And then you don’t have it for what you want.</P>

<P>Greg: Okay.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You say, you said two things there: self control to have, have what you want and then you said grades. Let’s talk about both of those. Is that okay?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Which one do you want to start with?</P>

<P>Greg: We could start off with grades because my mom don’t want me to work if my grades aren’t good.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see.</P>

<P>Greg: So if I get like going down, my grades start to fall, then I can’t work and then I won’t be able to get the go-cart that I want. And that’s pretty much all about the grades. My grades are pretty good right now.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Are they?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, and self control, like, if I, I see something that I want like cost a lot of money and sometimes I might buy it but when I think about the go-cart that I want to buy I won’t buy some stuff…</P>

<P>Greg: …like stuff in that category.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What’s a go-cart cost?</P>

<P>Greg: $849.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Does it? Yeah. What’s it look like?</P>

<P>Greg: It’s blue. It’s got like, it’s real long. It’s got a cage on the top. It’s like, it got like dog prints on it, like dog paw prints and it’s blue and it’s outlined in white.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And where would you ride that?</P>

<P>Greg: I could ride it around my house because I live in East Gate and I live like right by, right in front of a big field. So I talked to the police officers and they said I could ride it back there. I just can’t ride it on like the main streets with cars on it.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. How many wheels does it have?</P>

<P>Greg: Four.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I think I have a nephew that has something like that. His is red. He just showed it to me last night, and he rides it around in a field. It’s about this big?</P>

<P>Greg: Oh, no. It’s real, real big.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Really? Because his is a one-seater.</P>

<P>Greg: No, it’s two-seater. It’s like, don’t you know what a back seat of a car, like that? It’s like one of those up front. And then it, it’s like, I think it’s a cage on top so somebody can sit on top.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh. Yeah, that’s different than his. Is that a kind of an exciting ride?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: That sounds like…. Yeah. How does it run? I mean, what makes it go?</P>

<P>Greg: It got an engine in back. I think it’s a 9 horsepower or something like that. It’s one of those just like a lawn mower that you pull start. One of those.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So that is a nice goal to have. And your mother is okay with that?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: She says it’s okay. Great, go for it.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, she says she’ll help me. If I get like $500, she said she’ll get the rest so all I really do is got to save $500.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, that’s nice. Yeah, it’s great.</P>

<P>Greg: I think the only reason why she said it because she don’t think I can save the money.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, that’s a kind of a challenge then, isn’t it? That you….</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. How are you getting along with your mother? Since you mentioned it.</P>

<P>Greg: We get along okay. Sometimes we like argue over some stuff, over little stuff but most of the time we doing fine.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. And do you ever kind of volunteer to do things for her or does she have to ask you?</P>

<P>Greg: Sometimes she has to ask me. Sometimes she doesn’t. Because sometimes like, I got two other sisters that live with me, and they don’t really like do stuff that you like know, like they know that she should, they should do. But I just do it so she ain’t got to come home and fuss when she get off work.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, I see. So she works all day and….</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, she gets off at 5:00. She’ll get home about 5:30. And we get home at like 2:00, so I’ll just make sure like the house is straight so she don’t come home and have to argue and yell.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, that’s, that’s one thing…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …that’s pretty true everywhere: that if you do something for your mother you’re going to get along with her better. I never, I never had a, I never knew anybody who when they did things for their mother they got along worse with them.</P>

<P>Greg: Me, either.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: It always works the other way. Yeah.</P>

<P>So you mentioned grades. What do you think about them?</P>

<P>Greg: You know, it’s okay. They, it’s like you’ve got to get good grades. Like I never really got bad grades like I never really got F’s. I got like maybe a couple D’s in some classes.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What about right now?</P>

<P>Greg: I’m doing pretty good. I got like all A’s, B’s and C’s.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Really? So you’re doing well.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Now if your mother were sitting here, what would she say? How would she describe Greg?</P>

<P>Greg: Like always joking around about something. Sometimes I get a attitude with people when, you know, like the way they talk and stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You don’t?</P>

<P>Greg: No, I don’t.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see.</P>

<P>Greg: Like when somebody start talking crazy, stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Crazy. Like what’s crazy to you?</P>

<P>Greg: Like start talking a whole bunch of garbage like running their mouth about stuff that they don’t know what they’re talking about. Something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Does this happen, I mean, has it happened, say, in the last couple of days?</P>

<P>Greg: You know, people talking crazy stuff?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: This kind of stuff, yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: No, not really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, when was the last time?</P>

<P>Greg: The last time I got into a fight, like, a couple days ago. No, not a couple days ago. Like maybe last month.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, okay. And what was that all about? I mean, what were they talking about that’s crazy?</P>

<P>Greg: Man, we fight over some stupid stuff. We fight over like we was talking about something…</P>

<P>Greg: …and then he started talking about like I’m stupid and stuff like that, and then after school, we fought. He started cussing and talking crazy.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So you met him somewhere?</P>

<P>Greg: No, it was my friend that I used to know.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, it was your friend.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, we friends now, but we, I was, we fought and then like two months later we was friends again.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. The same guy you just fought with again a month ago?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see. How often would you say you get into these fights?</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t get in a fight that often. I just get into fights maybe like once every two months.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Once a month or so?</P>

<P>Greg: No, every, about….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Once every two months.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. Maybe like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, you don’t look like you lost any. But the question is, is this, are you happy with this? Like every two months would be like six fights a year. That’s pretty many.</P>

<P>Greg: Well, I don’t really say I’m happy with it, but some, some situations…</P>

<P>Greg: …you just can’t get out of without, like talking out of it.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see. Would you like to figure that out?</P>

<P>Greg: Figure how to talk….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How to talk instead of….</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I know how to like, if I can just say, "Man, whatever. We can forget about it." That’s what I say sometimes if I don’t feel like fighting or whatever.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I have a hunch you know how to not fight. Would I be right? Yeah, sounds like maybe this is just a choice you make.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, sometimes. I don’t know.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, the guy doesn’t force you to fight, does he?</P>

<P>Greg: No.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You know, he doesn’t kind of take his head and bash it into your fist.</P>

<P>Greg: No.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Usually doesn’t work that way.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-uh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So how are those fights working for you? Are they getting you where you want to go?</P>

<P>Greg: Not really because I get suspended from school or something like that if we fight in school.</P>

<P>Greg: And now they say if we fight out of school we can get suspended from school when we come back.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, but I really, what I meant, Greg, is, is this the way you want to continue the rest of your high school, you know? And not that it’s a terrible, big, horrible thing but I’m just saying it’s a little thing.</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t really want to go through like fights all the time. Because like once I get like a junior or something people will stop like worrying about what everybody else think and stuff like that. So less fights happen.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What about between now and then?</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t really know.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, you want to make, you want to increase the number?</P>

<P>Greg: Oh, no. I want to….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Or do you want to decrease, make it less? Or do you want to….</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I want to decrease the number of fights I get into. But I don’t know what’s going to happen.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: It’s hard to predict, isn’t it?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>


<P>Wubbolding: But I think maybe you could figure it out, though, I mean, you know. What’s likely that, what might happen in the next month or so that would kind of be maybe a reason to fight?</P>

<P>Greg: If somebody start talking about my mom or something like that then that’s a reason to fight.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: That’s a reason to fight. Sure.</P>

<P>Greg: That’s probably the only reason I would fight, like something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Is that usually when you get into it?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. So nobody, nobody likes that, do they?</P>

<P>You interested in trying to figure out some way or some, some way where you can feel good but still not get in the fight?</P>

<P>Greg: Not that I’ve seen, really. Well, getting into a fight don’t make me feel good, but it don’t really…</P>

<P>Greg: …hurt my feelings when I get into a fight with somebody.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I don’t want to make a real big deal out of this because I think you can, you can figure out a way and probably you don’t always fight in those circumstances, do you?</P>

<P>Greg: Not really. If it’s like one of my real, real good long time friends and they just probably be joking around like, "Your moms…." Or something like that, and I just like joke around with them but if somebody I don’t know come up and start talking about my mom then that’s a reason.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. So it’s usually somebody you don’t know…</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …that you get into a fight with except this one time you got into it with your friend.</P>

<P>If you don’t know them—I’m just, I’m just wondering about this, okay, you know—if you don’t know them too well, what’s the difference? Is it still a big deal what they say?</P>

<P>Greg: It’s not really a big deal, but it’s about like respect.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Sure. Sure.</P>

<P>Greg: If you don’t give nobody respect then you shouldn’t get none yourself.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So that’s a big deal, I think, isn’t it? Getting that respect and keeping it.</P>


<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, this might be a good question to think about: how can I keep respect and still not fight? I wonder if that’s, if that’s possible.</P>

<P>Greg: I think it’s probably like all the way that you carry yourself, like if you always going around picking a fight, then you’ll get respect from people. If you always like beat up somebody who you know you could beat up, then what’s the point of fighting if you already know you’re going to win?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, so you’d rather pick on a pretty tough guy?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. Somebody that wouldn’t like wuss out a fight. Because most people who talk a lot of stuff can’t really fight.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, maybe that would be something to think about: keeping respect by doing something other than fighting. What do you think?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah that’s a big decision to make and think about.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, it’s just something to think about.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You know, when you fight, you probably in your own mind at that time think you’ve got a good reason for it like you said.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I’m just curious: would your mother want you to defend her that way by fighting? What would she say if she were sitting in a chair over there? Would she say, "Now, Greg, I want you to go out and, when somebody says that about me, I want you to clobber them?" What would she say?</P>

<P>Greg: She wouldn’t say that. She would just probably say, "I don’t want you fighting over no petty stuff." But, it ain’t really nothing she could really do.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. I can’t help thinking that maybe when somebody says that about your mother, you kind of think they’re disrespecting you, too.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. That’s really the whole point about respect and giving respect and taking respect.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Sure. Sure. Sure. What about, what about this: now, these, the guys around you, is there anybody that you’d kind of like to, you know, move towards, have a little better relationship with, any of these guys around you, your classmates or friends? Is there any way that you’d like to improve any of that?</P>

<P>Greg: Improve my relationship with them?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: I probably—</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I don’t mean the guy, the guys that you really don’t know or, you know, I don’t mean them. I mean the guys you know.</P>

<P>Greg: Probably my brother, well, my brother-in-law. I don’t really see him that much now because he got a job in the city.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see.</P>

<P>Greg: But he used to come over every day and we’d go, like, play basketball or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You kind of liked him, huh?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You get along with him?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: But you don’t see him. Are you saying you’d like to see him more?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, but my sister, she about to have a baby and they, they got a hospital in the city so they really do everything out there, and she’s doing, trying to become a doctor and she’s doing residency in the city. So she don’t really got a lot of time to be coming out to our house and then driving all the way back out there every day.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. How far is that from here? Pretty far, isn’t it?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How, how long would it take when you don’t have snow?</P>

<P>Greg: About 45 minutes.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Would it?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Does he know that you want to spend more time with him?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I talk to him on the phone every now and then, but it’s not like the, seeing him and, it’s different between talk to him on the home and seeing him face to face.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Sure. Yeah. How often do you talk to him?</P>

<P>Greg: I talk to him at least once a week.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh. And he knows that you would like him to come out and talk to you, yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So that’s going, that’s tough, isn’t it. How old is he?</P>

<P>Greg: 24.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So he’s pretty much older than you. Is he, you say, he’s doing the residency or she’s doing the…</P>

<P>Greg: No, my sister’s doing the residency.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Your sister’s doing it, yeah.</P>

<P>So, who else is there?</P>

<P>Greg: Besides my brother, probably my friend at….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What about your brother?</P>

<P>Greg: Besides him?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: Probably my friend, Don.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Don. He’s not your brother.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-uh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. What about him?</P>

<P>Greg: We’ve been friends since like fourth or fifth grade or something like that, but I don’t really go over to his house that much now.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see. What do you do? When you do see him, what do you do?</P>

<P>Greg: We, he got his own basketball court so we probably just play basketball for awhile and then sit down, watch TV, something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: When was the last time you did that?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably…</P>

<P>Greg: …two months ago.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: It’s been awhile.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So, and he’s a pretty good guy, is he?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: He gets good grades, at least…. Is that right?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: He does alright?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. What does he want to do when he gets out of school?</P>

<P>Greg: Play baseball.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How about you?</P>

<P>Greg: Play baseball.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You’re good at it, are you?</P>

<P>Greg: I got MVP two years in a row, and I went to the All-Star game two years in a row.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Really?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What position do you play?</P>

<P>Greg: Pitching and centerfield.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So you work hard at that, it sounds like.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You don’t get to where you are without hard work.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, my brother used to be the coach of the team that we had.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, the Park Forest League. He used to be the coach for our team, and he really pushed me so I can be a better athlete.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So it sounds like you got some good relationships with people. Would you like to maybe make them better?</P>

<P>Greg: I like really everything like it is right now.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You do like it.</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t really want to change anything.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Anything?</P>

<P>Greg: Well, maybe that I don’t fight that much but….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Now if your mother was sitting here, what would she say? Everything’s wonderful.</P>

<P>Greg: No, she wouldn’t say that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, okay. What would she say?</P>

<P>Greg: She’d probably say it’s, everything is okay.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it’s not like things are terrible. It’s just, what would she think would be better? Not, not…not necessarily about you but maybe about your relationship with people?</P>

<P>Greg: She’d probably think I should stop playing around so much.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh. What does she think you do?</P>

<P>Greg: She think I play around too much and….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, like what?</P>

<P>Greg: Like goofing around sometimes in school. I do—We do that sometimes. Probably goof around at home too much, too.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. "Goof around" mean you get in trouble?</P>

<P>Greg: No, it mean like…. I….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You know, I mean, "goof around" could be just a little bit or it could be a lot.</P>

<P>Greg: We do it a lot at school.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Greg: And I don’t really do it that much at home. I put…. It’s like different between school and home because I’m around all my friends at school and at home I’m only around like three of my friends because they live around there.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, yeah. So I mean, you know, it’s part of being 15 is goofing around a little bit, right?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, having fun. But is there any kind of goofing around that you’d be interested in changing?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably at school. Not….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Sometimes it can bring you more hassles than you want. Suppose a teacher were to say, you know, "Greg, here’s what I’d like you to do…." What would they say?</P>

<P>Greg: "I want you to pay attention more in class."</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see.</P>

<P>Greg: My algebra teacher would say that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: algebra?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Are you going to have a test…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …before the holiday in algebra?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, we got…. No. Yeah, yeah, we do got to take finals in algebra.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see. So what’s that going to be like?</P>

<P>Greg: I think it’s going to be probably easy because we all, we don’t never have homework in that class. She’ll get up on the board and write down a problem—I mean, not write down a problem but write down what she want us to do and do an example, and we’ll be done within 15 minutes. Me, my cousin and my friend that’s next to me. We’ll be done in 15 minutes. And then she kind of get mad because we talk once we get done.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, teachers get aggravated kind of don’t they when that happens. So what kind of grades have you gotten in algebra up till now?</P>

<P>Greg: First quarter I got a C+, and right now I’ve got a C.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Uh-huh, so you’re passing and that’s a good grade. What would it take for that to be higher for you?</P>


<P>Greg: I’d probably have to do better on my tests.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: The last test.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh. If I get a, probably a B, I’ll probably have a B in the class or a B- on the final.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Let me ask you this. A thought just occurred to me. As you can tell by now I ask a lot of strange questions. What’s the difference between a C baseball player and a B baseball player?</P>

<P>Greg: The B player is better than the C player.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, but what, how do you know that?</P>

<P>Greg: Because they got a B.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, but how do you know that they’re a B? What do they do differently than a C?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably more aggressive, better at hitting the ball and catching and fielding and stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. Better batting average or if they’re, you know, pitcher would be, you know, winning more games, striking more people out?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What’s the difference between a, a B algebra player and a C algebra player?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably a B player like got…</P>

<P>Greg: …better grades on their tests and did all they homework and stuff.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How’d they get there? How would a person get there?</P>

<P>Greg: To be a B algebra?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Greg: Probably studying and doing, paying more attention in class and not talking so much.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: That’s a lot, isn’t it? That sounds like an A algebra player. Interested in being an A or B, let’s say a B player?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Striking out a few of those problems?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. My mom probably want me to do that more than I do but….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, yeah. And your mother works hard for you, doesn’t she?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Like you say, she works all day. And you do a lot of things for her, according to what you said.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You know, you do things. She wants you to get a, she wants you to get a B, maybe?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What kind of expression would she have on her face…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …if you came home with a B in algebra at the end of this, at the end of this term?</P>

<P>Greg: She would probably, she would probably smile and give me a hug and stuff and be like, "You did so good." Stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah? What would that do for you?</P>

<P>Greg: I’d probably laugh and smile with her and stuff.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Would you be happy?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Feel a sense of…what? Inside?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably good.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Pride?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, joyful and stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Joyful. You think that’s possible?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Hmm. It’s possible, so what would it take?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably just a good grade on the final.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah, but that’s like the baseball player striking out the guys. How did he get there?</P>

<P>Greg: By studying and working hard.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Practice?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So if—I’m not saying "do this" or, I’m not trying to…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …you know, push you to do things. I’m just saying if you were to, to be a B algebra player on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> or whenever your last class is, last test, what would you have to do before that, between now and then?</P>

<P>Greg: To get a B?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: Probably do all my homework assignments and be in class everyday and get a good grade, get good grades.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Are you able to do the homework assignments?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Is it…. It’s not hard. I mean….</P>

<P>Greg: No, not, not really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, that’s what I’m asking. You don’t seem like you can’t do it. You know how to do it? I mean, if you sat and studied?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What are you going to do tonight?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably do my algebra homework and do my business concepts.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Hmm. So you would do, you’d work on that algebra? I mean if you…</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …decided to do that?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: If you were to do that, how long would you spend on algebra tonight?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably about 20 minutes.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Really? Is that enough to get you from a C to a B player? Would you be striking out some of those problems?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, because the final is really easy. She’s just hyping it up to probably make us study a lot more and do stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Are you going to gamble on that?</P>

<P>Greg: No, I’m going to do most of it. I’m just going to do like more than half of the work. Probably do like 75, 75 percent of the work so I can make sure I can at least pass it.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: That’s a C, right?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So what’s a B?</P>

<P>Greg: 80.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: 80 percent of the work?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Now what if she throws you a curve?</P>

<P>Greg: Then….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Like the baseball player’s expecting a fast ball and he gets a curve.</P>

<P>Greg: Then I might be messed up.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So how are you going to prepare for that curve?</P>

<P>Greg: Do more work and study and fall back on the skills that I already have.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Let me just…. Well, yeah. Well, I’m just asking you to think about this: would 20 minutes do it? I’m not trying to say "do it." I’m just saying if you were to do it and would you be willing to consider the possibility?</P>

<P>Greg: Of doing more than 20 minutes?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, because once I sit down and start doing work, I’ll do it longer than I, just like, I’m going to sit down and do work for 10 minutes. But if I try to do that, I’ll be there for like 30 minutes and it will feel like 10 minutes.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Let’s put it this way, Greg: is, is 30 minutes going to help you or prevent you from getting a B?</P>

<P>Greg: Thirty minutes will definitely help me get a B on it.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And what will, what will 10 minutes—I mean, what will 20 minutes do?</P>

<P>Greg: It’ll probably make me get maybe a C+ or a C….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, it might help and it’s good you’re doing 20 minutes. I’m just saying, you know, it’s like baseball: do you want to be a B player or a C player?</P>

<P>Greg: I would definitely want to be a B player.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like it’s possible.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: What would you do the rest of the nights, the rest of the week between now and then?</P>

<P>Greg: I’d probably just lay down in my room, watch TV, probably study some algebra and do stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And what time would you do the algebra? I’m just curious about that.</P>

<P>Greg: Most of the time I do my homework at 6:30 because I watch <I>The Simpsons</I>—I watch both <I>Simpsons</I>—then I do my homework.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: But you do it pretty early in the evening. You don’t wait until 9:00.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, because at 9:00 I’ll probably be trying to go somewhere, probably go to the movies or go bowling or something.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, I see. So how badly do you want this B? I’m just curious about that.</P>

<P>Greg: I want it pretty badly because she like, the more, the better grades I get, the more stuff my mom will do for me. If I get like straight Cs, she’ll probably do some stuff with me. If I get straight As, then she’ll really like jump over hurdles to do stuff for me.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, yeah. Straight As? Did I, I heard you say?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Okay. So how hard do you want to work at this B? I mean, how hard, how much energy do you want to put into this?</P>

<P>Greg: Well, the days that I don’t have any other homework besides algebra, I’ll do 100 percent. Like put all my energy into doing that, and then I’ll probably just sleep until 8:00 or 9:00 and then wake up and try to go do something. But the days that I got like five homework assignments or something like that, it’s not going to be as much energy into all of them but instead of just….</P>


<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. But I mean, you know, it sounds to me like it’s up to you how much you, how hard you want to work at this… to be a B player as opposed to a C player. I mean, a C’s good. I don’t want to, I don’t want to put that down. I’m just saying a B is something you said you could do. It’s not like you don’t know this stuff.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I pretty much know all the stuff that’s, we got to do. It’s not really like it’s hard to do or something like that. We just sit there and do our work and then she don’t really mind but once we start getting loud and disrupting the class and disrupting everybody else learning, then she say, "Okay, somebody go in the hallway for awhile," or "somebody go get a drink of water and calm down" or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Sure. Sure.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: If you did all this partly, maybe not all of it but, you know, you did, you pushed yourself for the algebra and you pushed yourself…. Between now and, just between now and the test, what would that accomplish for you inside? Not just the grades and not just all that other stuff, but for you, for Greg.</P>

<P>Greg: It would definitely help me to do better on my other classes because I, I’m like, "Yeah, if I can do this, then I can do all the other classes this much better." That would help me like get in the right path to do B work in all the other classes or A work or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So it would kind of spill over into the other subjects, huh?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, my question still is, do you want that?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. I definitely want to get better grades than what I’m getting.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How hard is it to work hard…</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …between now and a week and a half. You know, how hard is that?</P>

<P>Greg: No, that’s not really that hard.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: That’s not that hard. It’s not that hard. Yeah. I mean, it takes…. Like you know, you know the difference between a baseball player that bats 250 and one that bats 333?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: It’s one hit out of ten times up. That’s all it is. Two out of ten hits or three out of ten hits. It doesn’t seem like it’s that much, does it?</P>

<P>Greg: Not really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Maybe that’s the difference between a B and an A, I mean, a B and a C in school. If you bat 333, you’re a superstar. Right?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I think it’s just a matter of do you want to bat 333 in your, in your schoolwork.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I want to—</P>

<P>Wubbolding: It’s up, it’s up to you.</P>

<P>Greg: I want to have better grades, better test scores than what I’m having. I could do better than that. It’s just like sometimes I put all my A energy into work and my B energy into doing that, and it’s just not like really enough energy to do both like 100 percent.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah, yeah. But what do you want to be able to say about yourself? We’ll get off this subject in just a minute, but what do you want to be able to say about yourself on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> of December? As far as the energy and the effort you made, no matter what grade you get.</P>

<P>Greg: I want to be, I want to say, "I tried my best and this was the grade that I got."</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Without even knowing what the grade is, because you won’t know what the grade is on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> probably, will you?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-uh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: So when you walk out of that classroom and you go home and you look in the mirror and there’s Greg looking back at you.</P>

<P>Greg: I want to say, "I tried my best and I hope I got a good grade."</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And I was aiming at what?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably I, I’m aiming at an A, but I’m probably going to get like maybe a B or a B- or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. I was just wondering. Let me ask you another, about another subject here. We’ve got just a couple minutes. At home with your sister and your brother…. There’s three of you, right?</P>

<P>Greg: No, it’s just….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I mean, at home.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, it’s three of us.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah.</P>

<P>Greg: No, it’s me and my two sisters and my mom.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, your two sisters. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s right. Okay, how are things going with your sisters?</P>

<P>Greg: Well, me and my sister Toya get along perfect. We don’t really ever argue except over maybe little stuff, then we’ll be right back to talking to each other. But sometimes me and Cynthia don’t get along…</P>

<P>Greg: …and Toya and Cynthia don’t get along that much.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And what do you do with the sister that you get along with? What do you do there that’s different than the one you don’t get along with so well?</P>

<P>Greg: We, me and my older sister, we talk a lot, but sometimes when you try to talk to Cynthia then she just totally ignore you. Like when you sitting there asking her a question, she’ll just sit there like she don’t hear you.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I see.</P>

<P>Greg: Stuff, little stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Do you want to get along with her better?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. Sometimes we’ll be working, working together fine like if we both don’t want to do something, we’ll connect and then we’ll be working together. But sometimes if she want to do something and I don’t, then she try to get me to do it and if I say no, then she’ll not talk to me for a day or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, I see. Yeah. Now that’s what she does to kind of put a barrier between you. What do you do that helps to make it a little higher?</P>

<P>Greg: I really just go in my room…</P>

<P>Greg: …whenever she gets her attitude or we get attitudes with each other. I just go in my room and listen to my CDs and stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Does that help you get close together?</P>

<P>Greg: Not really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No, I wouldn’t think so. So would you be interested in doing something different?</P>

<P>Greg: Not really, because she don’t, when she gets, when she gets mad, you can’t say nothing to make her not be mad. So, it ain’t really nothing you can do, not make her get mad or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You interested in a suggestion?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You could try it. When she’s upset with you, you could just say, "Cynthia, when you feel better, I’d like to talk to you." That’s all. Don’t say anything else. Say it sincerely, in a calm tone of voice.</P>

<P>Greg: No, I probably couldn’t say that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Couldn’t say that?</P>

<P>Greg: No.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: How hard is that to say?</P>

<P>Greg: Because then I’ll be mad, too. When she gets mad then that makes me get mad—</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, sure. You’re mad.</P>

<P>Greg: —and then….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Could you say it anyway when you’re mad?</P>

<P>Greg: No, I’ll probably be saying something else.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I know you would. I know you would. I’m…I’m just wondering if you could…. I mean, you’re 15, you know. It’s not like your 13 years old here, and I’m wondering if you couldn’t do that. If you were 13, I wouldn’t even be talking to you this way.</P>

<P>Greg: Well, yeah, I probably could say that because if I don’t get really, really, really mad then I could say probably much anything but once I get so mad….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, yeah. When you get real mad, then the…. I, you know, that’s probably better. You’re doing the right thing, I would think, by not doing anything—I mean, by not saying anything. This is just if you’re a little bit mad.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I could probably say some stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. I mean, you’re getting to the point where you could do that.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. I could probably picture myself saying something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You want to try it on me?</P>

<P>Greg: No. Not really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Suppose I’m Cynthia and I get mad at you. Just try it. Hear yourself say it.</P>

<P>Greg: When you’re not mad, you could come talk to me.</P>

<P>That’s probably something I would say.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. Can I add on something to that?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Maybe you could say, "When you’re not so upset, I’d like to talk to you." It’s a little different than what you said, but it’s just a slight improvement. Instead of saying, "you talk to me…"</P>

<P>Wubbolding: "I would like to talk to you."</P>

<P>Greg: That would probably make her even madder.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No, it almost never makes anybody mad.</P>

<P>Greg: I don’t think you’ve never seen an attitude like her.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, yes I have. What have you got to lose?</P>

<P>Greg: Looking like a goof saying something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: You said it to me. You said pretty much that, didn’t you?</P>

<P>Greg: No, but this is different. We just sitting here. I’m not mad or you’re not mad.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No, no, it’s not going to be as easy as it is here. It will be harder, but I bet you could handle it. I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it’s not possible. Maybe it will take awhile.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, I’m not saying like the first time I get mad I’m just going bust out and say something like that. I’m probably going to just leave or something like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. I mean, maybe later you could say it.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. I can probably say it later but not like really….</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Not right away.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I think maybe you’re right. I like your idea better. I think when you’re both upset, it’s probably not a good thing to say. Maybe when you both calm down. Think you could handle it then?</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. What have you got to lose?</P>

<P>Greg: Nothing really.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No, you don’t have anything to lose. I mean, when you’re calmed down a little bit. So maybe you just won’t talk for a half a day instead of a full day.</P>

<P>Greg: No, that probably won’t change what she going to do.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No, but it’s changing what you’re going to do.</P>

<P>Greg: No, because like if we get into a argument, I be trying to talk to her like 20 minutes later but she’ll still be all…</P>

<P>Greg: …wound up and mad about it. She’ll be like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Oh, sure. Talking isn’t going to work. This is just a one-liner. It’s something to think about, Greg. If you don’t want to do it, it’s okay.</P>

<P>Greg: Man, I can’t picture myself saying something like that, though, when I’m mad.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Not when you’re mad. When you’re calm. When you’re calm. Can you picture yourself saying something like that when you’re calm?</P>

<P>Greg: Sometimes I probably would.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Think about it. You know, I mean, it’s no, it’s no absolute. You know, something to think about.</P>

<P>Okay, of all the things we’ve talked about here today, what sticks in your mind right now?</P>

<P>Greg: Probably my goals…</P>

<P>Greg: …that I’ve set in the future to get the go-cart and get good grades and stuff like that.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: And studying.</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: We really talked about those three things, didn’t we?</P>

<P>Greg: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Getting what you want: the work, the go-cart; the grades, which we talked a lot about; and finally getting along with your sister and then your mother was in there, too, and what she would say and what she thinks.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah. You have any kids?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: No.</P>

<P>Greg: Oh. When you get mad, do you say that?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Yeah. I actually do. Sometimes I say, "I’m a little bit upset right now. I’d like to put this on hold until I can calm down." That’s why I suggested it; it works for me.</P>

<P>Greg: You say it all the time when you get mad?</P>

<P>Wubbolding: I’d say I say it more than half the time, but I don’t say it 100 percent because I’m not perfect.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah, it’d probably take me about a good month and a half or something like that, though.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Well, it takes time to build up. Don’t rush into it. Want to shake hands? It means you’re going to think about these things.</P>

<P>Greg: Yeah.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay. Thanks…</P>

<P>Greg: You’re welcome.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: …for stopping in today.</P>

<P>Greg: Okay.</P>

<P>Wubbolding: Okay, great.</P>

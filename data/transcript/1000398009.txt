<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I don't know, what uhm, (Sniff) I think the thing that I have right now, is feeling very discouraged and uhm, one thing I'm thinking of that I, I, because it just happened before I came here, I don't know whether this is really just simply another, I mean a way for me to express something else, or, or if this is why I'm feeling discouraged right now, or what. </p>

<p>But uhm, (Sigh) I had, uhm, well, when I got home FSO was still sleeping, and then it turned out, the washing machine had, something's happened to it, so the laundry in it had to go downstairs.  And uh, I've tried to keep the time that FDO has off, her time, although she's been very nice about offering to help do things.  But I don't want to encroach on her a lot, because I just don't feel we're paying her enough to start asking her all sorts of other time that should be hers. </p>

<p>And uhm, so anyway, ins—, I could have asked her to take the laundry down, but I didn't.  And, then that sort of threw me off as far as uhm, well, as also FSO was sleeping late, or i, in a way didn't affect things too much, until we got back.  But uhm, I did that and then I, I just, the only other thing I had time for, was to go do the grocery shopping.  And it was late when we got back, and I had made the mistake of bringing things, I had meant to bring some things back with me, but I took too many.  It didn't look like I had that much, so I decided well, why do I bother having it delivered? </p>

<p>And uhm, but by the time the person had packed it — and she didn't pack it very well, either — uhm, so it was hard getting it home.  There was a lot more than I had anticipated, and then it took longer for us to get home, because FSO was helping me with the cart.  And uhm, so then I had to rush so I'd be in time here.  And FSO immediately started uhm, getting u—, we came in, and she'd already been upset on the street.  Because when she was helping me with the cart, she had to let go so I could turn it around to pull it up on the curb.  And when she holds onto the cart or the stroller, she doesn't hold onto my hand, when we cross the street.  And she doesn't like to have to switch to hold onto hand, she'll hold on right until she's back on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>But because she had to let go, while I turned the cart around, I made the mistake of being lenient, and letting her uhm, stand right at the curb, but in the street, until I got the cart up.  And then she'd hold on and come up.  And uhm, she's v—, gets very rigid on having it that way, so then, there was just 1 curb right near us and, where cars turn, and I just felt it was too dangerous for her to be standing there without holding onto me while I got the cart up.  Because if she suddenly did something, it could be very dangerous. </p>

<p>And so I insisted on her holding my hand there.  And, and she had a w—, I don't know, I mean, it's not exactly a tantrum, but sh, she just gets so she can hardly contain her anger.  And uhm, sort of kicking and stamping and screaming.  And she did this for a minute or 2.  And then she settled down and we came in.  Then when we got upstairs, her zipper was caught on her jacket and she had wanted to unzip it herself, because she's been going through this little routine lately, where she takes her jacket off.  And she couldn't get the zipper down, so I told her that I could help her.  But meanwhile, I'm beginning to feel kind of rushed, because of being late.</p>

<p>And I don't whether I commu—, oh, and then the telephone was ringing and I knew it was for me, because it was FNI calling, returning my call, which I, I had called to find out about tonight.  And uhm, so I, I, I don't know whether I communicated something to her or not, but she was already mad because of the zipper.  And so, in the end it was quite a scene to finally h, have her let go of the zipper so I could uhm, get it uncaught, and then she could take her jacket off herself. </p>

<p>And then she just began getting upset at everything, and I became very impatient.  Meanwhile, FDO is there, uhm, trying to help FSO.  But mea—, but if I'm there, then FSO gets mad at FDO trying to help and she just wants me.  And the whole thing gets kind of awkward, because I guess it would be better if FDO just stood back for a few minutes while I'm there, and then took over when I left.</p>

<p>But anyway, FSO got worse in sort of trying to reject FDO, and then whatever was causing her to be upset.  It might have been anticipating my leaving, as well as these other things.  And uhm, and so then I, I felt very impatient with her, and uhm, I mean, I didn't exactly shout at her, but I feel as if that's what I did.  Uhm, for her to stop what she was doing, because she was just getting herself all worked up.  I think she had to stop, and uh, I was a little bit concerned, too, because FDO's tendency is to, "What do you want?", and FSO could name anything.  And uhm, I don't want FSO to feel that that's how she gets what she wants. </p>

<p>Uhm, but then I was in s—, I was hurrying so, which I d—, I guess I just shouldn't have done, but I didn't uhm, explain that to FDO well.  And so I feel as if, well, I just said I didn't want her to eat anything until her supper time, which is practically now.  Because FDO was sort of ready to give her any food that she wanted, and almost naming it.  Not letting FSO even say whether she wanted something or not.  And uhm, so I just said, what I feel came out shortly, but maybe not, I just assumed she didn't eat until supper time, so she has an appetite. </p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, I just feel as if, I came away feeling as if I'd shouted at the two of them.  I didn't shout at FDO, but I feel as if I had, and uhm, what I did to FSO wasn't exactly shouting, but I feel as if it was.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so what you're, what you're saying, is that you felt like having a tantrum, but you restrained yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So the real question is what do you feel really, like having a tantrum about?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh,) Mm, I don't know, I, I find it hard to think what I feel like having a tantrum about.  The first thing I started thinking was, of talking to FDO when I get back home, because it is something that I think I have to talk to her about, since FSO does this so much.  And so then, I think of FSO and her controlling it, learning to control it. </p>

<p>And, and then the other thing I thought of was, this morning, uhm, a friend of FBB's, uh, who's older, and here with her husband on business, came to see the school, uhm.  Which I was happy for her to do, except that it turned out when she was there, she didn't really just observe, she wanted to talk the whole time.  And it was very difficult to try to be a teacher in the classroom, and talk to her, and I think FLMZ was feeling resentful, or just assumed I was doing things that I couldn't do, if I were talking to her. </p>

<p>So I felt pulled in all sorts of directions, because of the children's needs, FLMZ's needs, and this visitor's needs.  And, I don't know, maybe mainly my needs, or I don't know exactly what ones at that time.  Except I wanted to be pleasant to her, and helpful.  And yet, be there for the children, and support FLMZ, and things that we share, w, what we do.  And uh, I had the same kind of feeling, even though it was an entirely different situation, of uh, that I had just now, when I got home.</p>

<p>And uhm, so it's almost as if in both cases, it's kind of a feeling of, well at school, it seemed more clearly that I was feeling of all these people, don't ask more of me, right now, because I am extending myself as much as I can.  At home, I think that was the feeling too, except uhm, that was an unfair feeling to have.  Because uhm, FSO has not set things up in the way that I have.  And so it's not, in a way, her asking more of me, it's, I, I don't know, I had to do the shopping now, because it's the only time I could do it for several days.  But somet—, maybe I could have done something differently, so that I wasn't asking so much of myself within the time I had.  </p>

<p>Or, uh, I could have, perhaps, just, FDO would have been willing to put the food away, so I could have asked her to do more.  So I don't know, I, seems like, my feeling was, don't ask so much of me toward FDO and FSO, except they really weren't.  And uhm, so it doesn't seem like that really, I mean i, it's easy when you think, well, that's what I want to have a tantrum about.  But I don't think it really is.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Sigh, Well) I suppose I kind of didn't want to think about this, but the thought did occur to me that uhm, well maybe I'm feeling that you're asking too much of me, but then, I can't think of in what way.  So I sort of leave that.  I mean, the only way I could think of, because of this incident that just happened at home, would be uhm, that you're asking too much of me because of the time now, and that uh, I mean that, that whole feeling of pressure just a few minutes ago, came because I was trying to make it in time here, so that, but, I don't know, I felt this way, and then I think back to this morning, and how I was feeling this way, this morning, too.  Uh — (Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, what I was thinking of in particular, too, is another aspect of this morning.  Uhm, because at one point, when it was time for the children to be cleaning up, to get ready for the roof.  Uh, I had told several groups of children that it was time.  And then I was over trying to help one group who had been doing different things.  They were making a playground for the gerbils.  And they had a lot of paper scattered around, that they had used parts of.  And so they had quite a bit of cleaning up to do, and I knew that they'd probably need help, especially given some of the ones there, who usually have a lot of trouble cleaning up. </p>

<p>And at that point, this woman again, had to talk to me.  And so I was trying to help the children, and yet, answer her questions.  And uh, so it meant that being distracted, I wasn't really able to give the attention that I needed to, to the children, to help them have a good cleanup.  And so it wasn't going that well.  Meanwhile, uhm, I, I had announced it to a lot of children, but I hadn't announced it generally, and, and so I guess FLMZ hadn't heard.  And, then when she noticed the time, she came over and said well, "Aren't you going to get them up onto the roof?"  And she was quite aggressive about, I mean, we've got to give them as much time as we can. </p>

<p>And I think she's, she is right, that we have to protect their time outdoors, uhm, because it's easy to keep sliding into it.  But uh, I was, I felt annoyed, because I felt, well, I'm doing what I can.  And I'd already told them to clean up, and uhm, I had not told her directly, but I was hoping that she heard or saw, there were some children who were making efforts to, and who were putting their coats on.  And uh, and just the way she said that to me, it was, it was done in quite an aggressive way, and so I felt very annoyed at her. </p>

<p>And so I, I just answered, "Well, I guess you didn't hear me, but I've already been asking them to start cleaning up."  And she said, "Well, I guess they didn't hear, either."  And I said, "Well, I think they did, but they need help.  They need direction from us."  And uh, I don't know, I felt, I just felt very annoyed at her, because of, I suppose, the fact that, the way she said something to me, that in many ways she was right. </p>

<p>But uh, sh—, this has happened before sometimes, when she just sort of sometimes disappears at cleanup time.  And uhm, h, her concept of cleanup, and the children's responsibility, is different.  And I've tried to redirect her thinking, somewhat.  Because I think I'm right, (Laughs) and I don't agree.  I mean, sometimes it seems like the attitude is, the teachers do more.  And I don't th—, feel that's right.  But I think the children need help, in order for them to do it. </p>

<p>And uhm, so anyway, there were other things, sort of involved in this, that kind of came out in my feeling annoyed, I guess.  But then when we got upstairs, I felt, I began to feel well, I was annoyed at her the way she said it, no matter what else was there.  Uhm, but the whole thing had been kind of unfair, because this woman was taking so much of my time this morning.  And uhm, so I just said something to FLMZ at some point, of, I know it's hard on you in the room, when we have a visitor who is asking so many questions of me.  And, uh, then FLMZ immediately denied it, and things were alright after that. </p>

<p>But uhm, well I just think of that, and I don't know, quite in — except that I guess in part, it was that I had this feeling of wanting to explode at FLMZ.  And then I felt, well, it wasn't totally fair.  Something had annoyed me, but it wasn't something worth exploding over.  And uhm, (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, you felt like exploding at MW, FNI, FSO, FLMZ, but none of those seem like the real thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I'm feeling very nervous, because I, I can't put it together, and then I just think, well, I'm just going to go out and explode tonight.  Or uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, because I was thinking, when I was thinking of feeling upset about what happened, just when I left home, and then I was thinking well, after I leave here, I have to run home again, and quickly change, because we're due at the BFMs.  And I also want to have a talk with FDO, briefly, just because I don't what her to feel that what, the way I treated FSO, is what I approve of.  Uhm, and I felt she was disapproving, as I think she should have been, if she wasn't (Laughs). </p>

<p>And, I don't know, I, I'm upset at that, and I want to talk to her a bit about it, and, and say I don't really like treating her that way.  That's not the way I'm approving (Laughs) of, either.  So that uhm, well, I don't know that it would be in FDO's nature to ever do it, but it upsets me for some reason, I'm not sure exactly why, that I did it in front of FDO.  And, so for some reason, I want to talk to her, so she won't think that I feel fine about it.  And I don't know whether its because I'm afraid she'll treat FSO differently, or because of her disapproval of me, or what. </p>

<p>And, uhm, so then, anyway, thinking about that, and then of changing and getting to the BFMs on time.  (Speaking quietly) And then I just felt, well I'm just going to be rushing, rushing some more and I'm, just going to build  up another feeling of needing to explode.  And then, here I'll be with the BFMs again, and uhm, (Sigh) I still don't understand why I did, in effect, explode, or at least, did something that was unusual for me, because of my fear of exploding.  Uhm, so I might do it again, I guess is, I don't know, I just started thinking, well, maybe I'd better not go tonight.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, it seems like there might be an element of self-pity, or something here, because uhm, (Sigh) because when I think of not going, and in a way it comes from this fear of, of if I keep whatever it is that maybe makes me feel like I have to feel like I'm running, because that's the only way I can, m, maybe that's the outlet that I'm seeking for right now, I don't know. </p>

<p>But uhm, whatever it is, this feeling that I'm afraid might, if I don't relax enough, come out tonight, which I don't want it to do.  Uhm, somehow it, I don't know, it seems like on the other hand, it's kind of like, well, I just have too many pressures, so I can't go.  And then everybody should feel sorry for me, because I can't go.  Or uhm, I don't know, or, or, even thinking, I suppose, I imagine going, and then in order to relax I have to make a big thing about how much rushing I've done, so then, that I must relax, or something, I don't know.  Which, again, would be a play for sympathy, I suppose.  (Pause),</p>

<p>Well, then, then I just think of this, because yesterday, 2 things that were disturbing me were the music teacher and uh, the girl FYSI.  And both those things, not exactly resolved themselves, but uhm, I felt better about both today, because I was able, I felt, to do something.  And in one case with the music teacher, I asked Mrs BBF again, if she'd had a chance to speak to her.  And she hadn't, which I had anticipated she probably hadn't.  But then, i, it sort of turned out into an informal faculty meeting, because most of the members of the faculty happened to be, either in the room or coming into the room, because a lot eat lunch in my room, uhm, right around the time I asked. </p>

<p>So then we just had a uh, short period of discussing the problem.  And I felt I was able to say a few things that I thought should be stressed, because I have a better relationship with the music teacher than anybody else.  And I think it's because I've tried to do things like tell her when she's done something good, because she gets the feeling, everybody's just disapproving, and uhm, I don't know, just, she's much more uhm, she'll work more with me, over ways that I think children have to be approached.  And apparently, she resists discussing certain children who have had problems in other rooms, with her type of music.  Uh, and just won't listen to the things that the teachers who have those children all day, know about them, that she doesn't know. </p>

<p>And, so I don't know, I just thought well, maybe some of the things I'm trying to do, because I felt it must be tough on her to feel everything's, everybody's so negative, would help everybody work with her.  And, and I don't kn—, I, I felt as if, you know, it kind of helped the whole attitude, a bit, of the faculty.  And, so that made me feel better.  And then, uh, although her future is not at all certain. </p>

<p>Uhm, and then, u—, I, several people had tried to get FYSI this morning, and had been unable to.  So, I said, well, I could stop by.  I think they were really afraid she might have done something to herself, although I don't think, it hadn't sounded to me like she was that far into some problem.  And, but anyway, I said I could stop by, because it wasn't far from me.  And then I ha—, I called before I went out, in case she was there, and then it would look too dramatic to come rushing over. </p>

<p>And she was in, and I just said that I'd asked what was wrong when I knew she was out, as you would about anybody.  And somebody had said that she was feeling a bit unhappy about some things, and uhm, so that I hoped if she felt a need to talk to anybody, and since we lived close, she'd come over.  And she was appreciative, I think, of just feeling support, although I might have felt good, I might have felt I wanted her to be more appreciative (Laughs) than, she was.  I don't know. </p>

<p>But uh, she said she might drop by on Sunday, when we'll be home.  And, so anyway, I felt better about her.  Also she sounded better than what I had heard her sounding like on, I mean, what I'd been told she sounded like on uh, whenever it was, Wednesday.  And, I don't know, anyway, it just sounded like she's, she's not going to be well, but she's okay right now.  And uh, and so those 2 things come in the middle of this feeling that, yesterday I, somehow, I was feeling, some feeling of exploding, in connection with them, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or I don't know, maybe I was hoping to do something positive for both of them that would help my feeling of exploding, and it didn't.  I feel better about each of them individually, but I still (Laughs) feel this feeling of exploding.  (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>And then the other thought that comes to me, well, uhm, is that I must feel like exploding because something's not the way I want it to be.  And, uhm, I think immediately of FSO, in part today, when she was up—, so upset because she couldn't unzip her jacket, and wouldn't let me help her just loosen it.  And she wouldn't listen, because she can understand now, if I say, you can do your jacket yourself, but I have to just fix it, first. </p>

<p>And uhm, then last night — I think of this, too — she was doing, blowing bubbles with MSCZ, at one point.  But MSCZ didn't want her to hold the can of uhm, liquid, because she wanted to keep it very close to the table, and he was afraid it would knock over.  And once he had said he wanted it kept on the table, he had to maintain that.  And then she began to test him out, and uhm, well to bring it way to the edge.  And he would say, "No FSO, it has to be back a bit, because it can get knocked over, here."  He'd put it back, and she'd bring it back to the very edge. </p>

<p>So finally, he said, "Well, we'll have to just put it away.  And she just uhm, went wild, because she was so mad.  She could hardly, I mean, it was, well, I, I think of the word, contain herself, and I don't know exactly what I mean, except it does seem like that's it.  I mean, she was, in effect, exploding, and yet, even in exploding, she was uhm, there was a certain s—, type of control.  I don't know exactly how to describe it, but uhm, because probably, what she wanted to do right then, was to I don't know, exactly, kill MSCZ.  But anyway, to really attack him, and she was just so mad.  And (Sniff) so she was containing herself. </p>

<p>So then I, I suppose if I think of her, after thinking about, well what would I be trying not to explode over?  Something I am mad about, because it's not the way I want it.  Then I don't know, uhm, I mean, I, I mean, well it has to be, if, certainly if I think of her feeling toward MSCZ, then.  Which I'm interpreting, because she went away from him, almost as if she couldn't be near him, because she might do something.  And uhm, so then I think well that, am I thinking of that because of my feeling of wanting to do something to somebody.  And then I think, well, it has to be you or MSCZ.  And uhm, but then, I can't think of anything that would make me so mad. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So maybe eh, you're really talking about another kind of explosion.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, my changing?  (Pause) But I don't know why I think of that as an explosion, but — (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I think you view having an orgasm as an aggressive hostile exploding.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, 2-minute silence) Yeah, I'm just thinking, yes, I do, and uhm, in remembering the feelings I've had.  And, and I don't know, again I seem to be feeling very mixed.  On the one hand, I what to feel that way and uhm, on the other hand, it's very, disturbs me very much to.  Because well, I don't know whether it's because it's being aggressive, in, in an open way, which I don't like to be.  Or if it's uhm, because I just feel, well that's making something that should be bringing MSCZ and me closer, into something which is really not.  And which is just making it more awful, in a way.  Or uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>I, eh, the other thing I'm wondering, but in a way I know, well, I don't know if I do kno—, but I, I, I just keep wondering, well, I do have that feeling.  But uhm, I don't quite see how that feeling's connected with the things that have been on my mind this week.  Because, I guess, it's almost like I believe I shut out thinking about that feeling, or having it, or anything to do with it, when I'm not actually having intercourse.  And uhm — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, well, then the next thing I thought of again, was that uhm, I'm still not understanding Saturday night.  And uhm, I'm not sure if right now I'm afraid I might repeat it, but somehow it makes me nervous to think of seeing them again, the BFMs again, without understanding it.  And uhm, and then I thought again of that CHN woman who visited today, and uhm, how aggressive I felt toward her, too, in that uhm, she kept saying, well, we do this in PCHN, and we do that in PCHN.  And very often I felt she was being quite critical. </p>

<p>And so then I would try to explain some of the, my philosophy, or, or sometimes it's general philosophy in, in PNCN, on uhm, how we approach teaching at this level.  And mainly things on letting the children, sort of create their own problems, and then solve them, by having their own projects.  And it just came up that when the children were making things for playground, for the gerbils, they were using paper.  And I know that gerbils chew paper, but uhm, it was one of those things that, if the gerbils did chew it up, then the children could solve the problem, well, what should we use instead, so that they can't chew it up. </p>

<p>And so when she pointed that out, I said well, then they can, that would be a good problem for them to have to solve, on what they could do next.  And u—, she didn't seem to really understand, so I was just feeling — and this came up a lot over various things — that uh, e, eventually, if talked to her long enough in some cases, she said, "Oh yes, I really think that's good." </p>

<p>But sometimes it's, I don't know, I mean, I didn't, well it isn't that I'm not curious about what they do in PCHN, but the point of her coming wasn't so I'd learn what they did in PCHN.  And uh, so I think I was feeling sort of annoyed, because of this stress on my time.  And then, that she was almost aggressive too, in that way, and so I just thought of her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I guess, I mean, when I say I don't see how my feeling about intercourse as affecting these other things.  I mean, I can see, well, if I'm feeling that I really want to be aggressive and hostile there, and then I'm not letting myself, that I have to find other ways to be aggressive.  And uhm, so I can see that.  But then I, then I think well, but I, I don't want to accept that, basically what I want is to be aggressive in that way.  So that then, all these other things fall into place, because I'm finding outlets for that feeling. </p>

<p>Uhm, and I, I, I, I don't know, I try to think back to Saturday night, because I just don't see why it would particularly come out in that way, Saturday night.  Uhm, with the BFMs, when the same situation had occurred before with them, and i—, and I hadn't every exploded, or felt that I was in danger of doing that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, then I think of the other thing, is that it's true I've wanted to.  And then, this time, my wanting to, I seem to have a different attitude about my wanting to.  Maybe I've, something's changed there, and so if I feel I want to, then I do.  Or uhm, I don't know.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, at first I was thinking about just maybe having this feeling now, of (Sniff) that, I'm, uhm, being irresponsible, it really seems to me, because of what I, well certainly if I think of it with the BFMs, and then I can sometimes retract, like with FLMZ this morning.  Uhm, because even if there was something to be annoyed at, I wasn't really getting at, I mean, something else was really what was behind my expressing any annoyance.  And, and I realized it, or at least I knew things were inappropriate.  And uh, I was able to do something about that. </p>

<p>But, I don't know, it seems like I'm almost thinking to myself, well, it's good I'm now feeling I can express my feelings.  And then I, then I get so I, what I think of right now, as being irresponsible.  And uhm, well I don't know exactly where that thinking of it took me.  Except then I know I started eventually, right before I started talking, I was thinking about changing the schedule at school, which continues to be on my mind, because it just is not really working the way I want it to.

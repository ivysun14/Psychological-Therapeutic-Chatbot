<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry about Friday. Maybe I didn't mention it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure you didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can never be one hundred percent sure but... Yeah, yeah thanks. Thanks for rescheduling. Yeah I still... (PAUSE) [00:01:00]</p>

<p>I mean, I guess, I'm, I'm kind of struggling for, struggling for where to go (inaudible at 00:01:15) several different levels. I don't... I'm not sure where, where our conversations go and I'm not... I kind of don't see it at the moment which is not precedented but that's where I am this morning.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what comes to mind? [00:02:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) I don't know. I mean, what comes to mind? (PAUSE) [00:03:00]</p>

<p>Jennie (ph) was pressing a little bit the other day. She says, she said (PAUSE) she was skeptical about whether we're, you know, this is productive, I think, at this stage. I suppose I am too. I guess I'm reluctant to go there a little bit. I mean, we both have kind of an investment at this point. (PAUSE) [00:04:00]</p>

<p>On the other side of it though is that, you know, I have no idea, I have no idea what would be good so... I just don't have a model for productivity (inaudible at 00:04:21) feasible. I guess if it's not, it should save us some time. (PAUSE) So I don't, I don't feel hopeless necessarily but I just, I don't see, I don't see a, I don't see a way forward. I can see that you have, I don't know. And, and, on the other hand, this kind of skepticism is not completely unfamiliar so... I don't know. [00:04:55]</p>

<p>It was interesting. Interesting. It was little sobering to get her, to get her take. We talked about it for a long time. (PAUSE) I guess the other thing that comes to mind is tangential (ph). We were talking about her ex husband.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I didn't know she had one. (PAUSE) [00:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He came here with her. She moved in 2000. And they split, I think four years later I guess it was. They never formally got divorced. So she needs to divorce him now. She's reluctant to do so. So we were talking a little bit about about (inaudible at 00:06:41) marriage and she said something about (PAUSE) being a weak person with a weak personality. [00:07:03]</p>

<p>Apparently, you know, he wouldn't go out, he wouldn't see her friends, wouldn't interact with people. This went on for about two or three years and finally, she said, said that it wasn't working and he threatened to commit suicide. Anyway. She said she was a weak person and I was just, I was thinking about strength and personality, I guess.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. He said she was a weak person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. She said, she said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was describing him. She was describing him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) Yeah. [00:08:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he didn't really have things he wanted to do, I guess. So I was thinking about this. I was thinking about this, I mean, you know, in one sense, her guilt, I guess, over this is a problem from our point of view because, until she gets divorced, we couldn't get married (inaudible at 00:08:27) so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In theory, you know, she has to, she has to do this before we can. But I guess the other piece of it is that I, you know, I get, I, I fear to see myself in her descriptions of him. (PAUSE) [00:09:00]</p>

<p>I think about this evaluation of strong and weak (PAUSE) and it's troubling to me, I guess. (PAUSE) I see a lot of weakness in myself right now. And, on the other hand, I see this, you know, this, this layer of personality that's not at all this way. Maybe, maybe too much the opposite, I don't know. So it's a conflict, conflict between these two different (inaudible) [00:10:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. What are you referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (PAUSE) you know, what is it that makes it difficult to do things, makes it difficult to (PAUSE) you know, to pay bills, to open mail, to do work, to imagine working at something? I'm not quite sure if I think about it, I guess. I know we'd come up with something. (PAUSE) [00:10:57]</p>

<p>You know, when the rubber hits the road, when, you know, there's an interaction, an issue, When, you know, the bill needs to get paid, when, you know, I need to ask somebody for something, when I need to deliver something to somebody, when somebody needs to ask something of me... You know, how to do, how do I think about... I don't know. I don't know. I'm not... I'm meandering a little bit. Just in an effort to describe something coming to mind, I guess but... (PAUSE) Strength and weakness. It's a funny way of thinking about it, I guess. More and less definition. (PAUSE) [00:12:05]</p>

<p>You know, what, what really is it that's, you know, that's been so troublesome that I'll come in here and blab for 45 minutes, twice, three times a week. You know, what's, what's the problem? I didn't think I had quite a handle on that. I'm not sure if strength or weakness is a good way of describing it but I worry. (PAUSE) [00:13:00]</p>

<p>Because, because of this weakness Jennie (ph) decided that she didn't want to be married to Alp (ph) anymore. So how do I describe what, what's been troublesome? How do I describe what the issue at hand really is, let alone, to me? (PAUSE) [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're pensive about it but I imagine also you're really worried that this isn't going to work and give you a way to overcome the things you're struggling with. [00:14:55]</p>

<p>And that Jennie's (ph) going to decide you're weak and leave and I, I, I think you're worried about those prospects. Though, I think, perhaps distancing yourself a little from that at the moment (PAUSE) from being kind of, sort of thoughtful and (inaudible at 00:15:37).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) I mean there's right paradox right there, I guess. You're asking me what comes to mind and I'm telling you and you're telling me I'm distancing myself from.(PAUSE) [00:16:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what's the paradox there?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You say it like distancing is a bad thing and yet I wouldn't be able to respond to you if I didn't engage in whatever conjugations (ph) you're describing as distancing. (PAUSE) I mean, in our nomenclature, I think, distancing is associated with some kind of dissociative impulse. [00:17:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I, I think you're... (PAUSE) I think you're distancing yourself from this stuff because it's scary. I think it's a way of dealing with it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying there are these different currents and it seems to me what you're saying and the way you're talking, each of which in my view is important. [00:17:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (inaudible) Sure they're important. I agree. Maybe I'm distancing myself a little bit. Whether it's for the purposes that you described now or just simply because, you know, it's how one talks about something. I mean, what would be alternative then? You asked me what comes to mind and how could I have responded that wouldn't have sounded distant?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:18:29) say it in another way. Like, and I'm going to be a little dramatic here but I'm sure it's exaggerating a little to make a point. You know, it's kind of like saying, "You know, I'm diagnosed with cancer. I don't know if the chemo is going to work. Maybe it will. Maybe it won't."</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And, you know, it could metastasize. Maybe it already has." (PAUSE) [00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I see what you mean. (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. Sure. (PAUSE) [00:20:01]</p>

<p>So, so I have some uncertainty about the chemotherapy.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also I think of, and this is not really an analog of the cancer example but like of with, you know, a fear about Jennie (ph) leaving. I don't mean eminently. It just, it sounds like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually don't. And, I mean, it was, it was... The conversation was not like that. I, I, I actually don't have fear of Jennie (ph) leaving. I actually have a fear of is becoming this person who is kind of helpless. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's more of becoming like her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...husband than...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my, that's my really immediate fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're actually, we're actually pretty good and yet... I don't know. You know. I want my own life. I don't really have it right now. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>I don't really see, I don't really see what it would look like and it's been like this, frankly, ever since I can remember at some level. (PAUSE) I don't see what it would look like, my own life. And at one time or another, I would have, you know, have taken on something that seemed like it could work. (PAUSE) Described it, described it to you sometimes, I think, or at least parts of it but... (PAUSE) [00:23:01]</p>

<p>At this moment, at least, I don't see it. And, you know, I'm aware this is, this kind of future orientation, this, you know, is a future of various psychological states so it's not... I guess I'm not, I'm not insisting that this is necessarily a permanent feature of my reality but it's very strong right now and I think that just sort of surveying the landscape, it's a, you know, very distinct recurring feature of the way I'm relating to the world. I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of part of it, whatever it is, you know, whatever I've come to you for help with, lack of constancy in that future orientation is, is important.(PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:26:00]                                                                                      </p>

<p>Am I supposed to come up with a thought or are you working on one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it could go either way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it certainly could.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:26:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that we (PAUSE) both feel a bit stuck or trapped. (PAUSE) I guess me because... (PAUSE) I... (PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p>

<p>I guess I'm, I'm sort of (PAUSE) trying to find a way to comment on what I think you're doing that will be useful.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rather than (PAUSE) useless, destructive, pointed?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not really worried about being destructive, more useless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And you can't find it. [00:29:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's difficult about what I said (inaudible at 00:29:15).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think you're sort of doing the same thing as, as a couple of minutes ago that I commented on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Distancing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you know, referring in fairly abstract terms to a lack of constancy in your future orientation to things. Which, at the same time, I know points towards a very real and very frightening and very difficult problem. Something that has caused you a lot of grief. [00:29:57]</p>

<p>And (PAUSE) you know, there's the side of you that brings it up like that that poses questions as though sort of conceptual answers will provide traction. And then there's the part of you that, I think underneath that though is sort of trying to speak to a little bit before that's really worried and, about the situation and feels a kind of helplessness or, yeah, just fear. But which (PAUSE) it's sort of, I think, that part is sort of hard for both of us to be in touch with. (PAUSE) [00:31:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, sure, you know, sure I'm afraid. But I'm afraid that we're not, we're not going to deal with it. You know, I mean, the overriding feeling at this moment is not, you know, the fear itself. It's, you know, the fear of the fear or the fear of the, you know... What am I trying to say? I mean, the issue for me right now is kind of practical. Sure. I mean, you know, the fear, the fear is important. The fear is, you know... Maybe the fear is primary. I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'm reflecting...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What fear are you referring to? (PAUSE) [00:31:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fear of not being able to, you know, do, act, be, produce, you know, be a, be a good partner to Jennie (ph) be a, you know, reliable colleague and insightful person and someone who produces work in the world. You know, that's, that... Whether that fear is a reflection of, you know, some other capacity or whether it is the capacity itself, I'm not even sure we're clear at this point but immediately what I'm concerned about, I guess, or what the concern that's bubbling up when you ask me what comes to mind is whether we can deal with it. You know? I mean... And, and I guess where I started our conversation today was just not really seeing the way ahead. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't see... It's not just that I don't see progress, you know. [00:33:01]</p>

<p>I don't see how progress might be made. I mean, I... You have a conception that we've talked about, you know, fairly recently and I, I kind of get it at an abstract level. I can see the, you know, I see the principle at work here. But I don't see it working. And I feel some concern about that, anxiety about that. You know, I could put it more or less abstractly. But it, it bothers me. (PAUSE) I mean, let me put it to you this way, at what point do you decide, do you decide, or do you have a suspicion or do you have concern or anxiety that it's just not working? (PAUSE) [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fine. That's one way of answering my question, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) I mean like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what would that mean? You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:34:29)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's purely an informational question. I'm not, you know, trying to be provocative. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, what would that mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, there might get to the point where things are just dulled out and get, you know, repetitive and there's a kind of deadness to it or, you know, or somebody (inaudible) often or more, you know, so there's a kind of rigor mortis in one direction and in the other direction is, you know, kind of flaming out. [00:34:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like not showing up? That kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be any number of things. It could be like, you know decompensating (ph) in one way, that kind of thing or it could just be not showing up. But that's... Yeah, at that point there's not much for me to decide, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, this is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...failing either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) So it's not dead or decompensated (ph). It's stalled. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or shall I say I'm not dead or decompensated (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:36:09) But... (PAUSE) I guess I'm not sure what to make of it. I mean, there are times, believe even in recent weeks where you will sort of express more or less directly that like you've gotten something new or are feeling better about the way we've addressed something or understanding things sort of differently, maybe the last couple of months anyway. [00:37:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. No question about that but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm aware that the sort of behavior out in the world...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...is not changing and that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...what the issue is. But and so, I guess, there's a sort of disconnect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or what we're doing here doesn't seem to be getting any traction on what's going on (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Traction. Traction is the issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you said that I'm afraid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:37:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, the more time goes by, the more troublesome, you know, that behavior out in the world becomes. And so the question is really, you know, all of this is good and I, I, our interaction is, you know, feels good. I'm glad to come in and talk to you in this, stereotyped way. It's a funny ritual but it feels like, you know, our conversations are often good and interesting and useful but, you know, the therapeutic aspect is about behavior out in the world and, and that's no better. It's just no better and that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. No this is very helpful for me...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that's just the reality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...because there are other times you've said things like that where it emerges later that you sort of forgotten things that have happened here but I'm only understanding just as you say that that that's not what you're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, absolutely not. Absolutely not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well that's a helpful distinction (inaudible at 00:38:27).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know that totalizing, you know, kind of sense of whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But also forgetting (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't... I mean, maybe some of the specifics (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well... (PAUSE) [00:39:00]</p>

<p>I mean, I have a couple of thoughts. One is... (PAUSE) One is, it can take a while for... (PAUSE) It feels like things are happening in here. I guess I'm not that concerned that over time they will happen out there, as well. Sometimes it sort of takes longer to get there. [00:40:00]</p>

<p>You know, to sort of continue to sort of take things or consolidate things in a way in here that then reaches things out there or to get to a level of things in here that the kind of really affects them out there. I'm not saying that because I don't care what happens out there. I agree. Like, you don't come in here so things can be nice in here, as nice as that can be. But to have a (inaudible) life outside of here. You know, in the time frame for such things, we aren't, haven't been at this long, at this that long although I could imagine in might feel otherwise to you. We really haven't, and so, we're not a timetable that sort of concerns me about things. [00:41:01]</p>

<p>I'm not saying I can't understand why you would be frustrated or worried or really wanting things to happen out there. I'm just saying that like, you know, the way this kind of healing process works. You know, sometimes it works one way, sometimes it works the other. Some things change out there but feel like they're very stuck in here. Sometimes it's the other. But, you know, they generally sort of converge or start to correlate more over time. And I guess I'm not concerned about even how much time it's been so far. Again, that's not to say I couldn't understand why you'd be worried or frustrated or anything like that. It's just, you know, in my experience that the time frame for this process, we're not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're on the curve. [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, thank you. That's a good way to put it. So, I guess there's that. And (PAUSE) and there seems to be something quite important about this is... Even though I kind of, as I just said, newly understand what you said today in a way I didn't understand ten minutes ago. Even though that's true, I think there's something very important about, and kind of in parallel with what I thought you were saying now. Where like, what I mean is, it's important for you to be able to come and tell me the ways that you're worried and frustrated about these things and have me kind of get where you're coming from and sort of, you know, give you some straight answers about your concerns. [00:43:21]</p>

<p>Like, I guess what I had in mind is that it's kind of the opposite of abandonment. Like, the experience of my being there for you has something with your being able to say, "Look Ethan. Here's how I'm feeling. This isn't working now or what's not working about this for me or the ways I'm concerned this isn't working or going to help me." [00:44:03]</p>

<p>Like, that seems to me to kind of be a persistent occurrence. And I mean, this conversation happens, in one form or another, fairly often, I think. And... (PAUSE) And I'm not saying that the content of what you're saying is unimportant in it's own right. Clearly it's important, you know. You're saying, "Look Ethan. I don't know if this is helping in my life outside." You know, that matters in it's own right but there's also something sort of... Stuff like this comes up a fair amount, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, so, so there are two, there are two phenomena you were pointing to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:45:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: One is we're and I think we're probably, probably coming close to the end here but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah we've got to stop in a second (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) distinguishing. One of them is the content...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, I don't feel like this is working. Can we...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...discuss it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other is a kind of relational question, you know, these moments where I ask for some reassurance and, you know, hopefully the person that I ask it from gives it to me as a way of, you know, reaching for some kind of constancy in our relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well we'll think about it tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two shirts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just rode my bike, and I'm drinking hot coffee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can turn the heat down a little bit, too. I mean, I aim to please.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've noticed. So I'm in a good mood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. That's terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, it's a miracle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had a game last night against our old rivals. And at one point during—I had made a couple of nice plays early in the game, and at one point, the general manager, she came over to me and—she organizes everything—and she just said how well I'm playing this year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How nice!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's been quite a few years since anyone's said that to me. And then after the game, several people complimented me on how well I played, and how fast I seemed, and I was like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rock on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) And to me, I don't feel like I'm playing any different. The team we played plays zone, every point. And so (pause) I was just open a lot where discs weren't thrown to me. So I'm getting open a lot. I don't know. So that kind of boosted my spirits a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a closing on Wednesday. I've got two next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though this realtor, she's pushed my limit. First, it's out of state, first of all. Out of fucking state. God knows where. And you can't close at the registry there, so you've got to do it at one of the brokers' office. And she wants one, for the sellers and the buyers to sign at different times, and then she wants me to just hand the check over to the sellers and provide what we call gap insurance before we get on record. Normally you get on record, make sure there's no problems, then give them the money. And gap insurances was used back in certain counties that were backed up during the heyday, there wasn't time to get on record so you used gap insurance on almost every transaction. Basically, the seller signs an indemnity agreement saying, "Oh, I haven't done anything, there's no problem," which, the reality is, they're still responsible for it anyway, but... So I kind of was, "All right, I'll ask the title insurance company if they were willing to do it," and they were like, "You know, there doesn't seem like any red flags." I'm like, "Not really, it just seems like an old couple moving." Because they just want to get on the road and go. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there's no mortgage on it, so I'm giving them the entire seller's proceeds. It's not like they're—I mean, the whole transaction is going in this check. So I'm like, "All right, I'll go along with it," plus I've got a cash sale, which I'm going to have to do first thing in the morning. It'll take five minutes but still, you've got to put this in and it's a 575,000, three-family, 168,000 condo out of state. Which one's more important, you know? And I make money based on the sale price, and title insurance in this state is more than title insurance there. So she asks now, and she put it in all caps—she wants the sellers to have certified funds at the closing. Which means that I would have to go to the bank and get a check for them. And the wires come in the day of closing more often than not. So really, what she's asking me to do is give someone else's money to these sellers, at the table, without getting on record, in certified funds where they can walk into any bank where... I mean, you can't cash a 168,000 dollar check, banks don't have that much money in their vault, but... I did the wise thing and not respond yesterday, because I really wanted to tell her where to fucking go. And then she kind of throws this, "Oh, I haven't been in touch with..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I take it you're going to tell her to go to the one out of state?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) She throws out the information for the buyer's broker like I haven't been in touch with the buyer's broker. Like, "What am I supposed to..." The brokers are the one that, why do I need to talk to two of them when I'm clearly talking to one? You know, she can tell. So I'm going to send a nice e-mail back today telling her, first of all, I can't do certified funds. I'd be more than happy to do a wire, which I can do after I get on record. Which is better than—most banks would still put a hold on a 168,000 dollar check even though...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even though it's certified.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a lot of forged, fake certified bank checks. Not that mine would be, but banks are still—like Bank of America would put it on hold for ten days. A check that size. Literally, that's how long it takes to get back to the original bank. It may be quicker now that they use the pictures and everything. So I was kind of ticked off about that, but my mind really changed when I went and played ball. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. And you also held off on writing her back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which was easy to do, because I read it on my phone. Had I been in the office I would have—of course I'm going to let her know, eleven o'clock is fine, I might be a little late. (chuckling) The sellers can be there at eleven, not sure if I'm going to be because I'm coming from out of state. I know they want to get on the road, more power to them, but there's more than just them in the transaction. </p>

<p>These people suck, they really do. The stuff this woman is asking for is really just out of bounds. It's not like she tells me up front she wants certified funds. I'd say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Backing your way into the process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, we're closing next Wednesday. I mean, next Friday. I just can't believe, she's just pushing everything. And then there's a discharge problem, and she's like, "What do we do about that?" I said, "Well, the buyer and the seller can call the bank and have them do a confirmatory discharge, or I can do it and charge them 175 dollars." So they're having the local title company take care of doing all the seller's paperwork, because they're probably cheaper than I am. So I'm dealing with people who, for probably 50 bucks... so, it'll be a fun closing. And you know, the thing is, the buyers are from, the guy from E&G, his boss. It's their client. So I can't just totally piss all over the transaction. I've kind of got to act professional. And he's a real nice guy, he stopped by my office yesterday on the way to the bank, and just chit-chatted, and there's some architects down the hall, he says, "Oh, we should just all go out to lunch." He's really been, he's a good guy. Harry is the guy that's in E&G that I'm like, I've got to sit down with Harry and figure out what professions you guys need and invite some people. They already brought an electrician into the group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they've been sending me, it's starting to be a steady flow of deals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got another one coming from them. And I've got the deal, the cellar rep at the end of July. So at least I've got a couple things coming up in July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, we'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:09:04] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I decided to go to a tournament. I've never been asked to go to this tournament, and it's on the beach. It's a beach tournament.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a tournament?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, tournament. And I kind of just wanted to go down and drink, but apparently they want me to play. (chuckling) You know, I'm not a real big fan of sand. By the way, check out my new Vans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not one person has said, "Oh, my God. They're already dirty." Not one person has called them Keds yet. Don't they kind of look like them a little bit? Yeah. They'll wear out in time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not a big fan of sand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not a beach person. (chuckling) I literally was just going to go down there to, they have a beer truck on the beach. (phone beeps) Oh. Thank you, Siri. My son asked me if Siri's a real person. Yeah. He always wants to talk to Siri.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know this because I just got the thing from Blue Cross, and maybe—I don't listen to Jess, she just fucking rambles off at the mouth. He was in therapy, and I thought it was for just acting out and misbehaving, but speech therapy. He has kind of a stutter. It's not really a stutter, he just can't get on to the next word. He loses his train of thought, and he's like, "Ahhh." It's not like a speech impediment as much as it's his brains working much faster than his mouth. But I get this thing from Blue Cross Blue Shield, how they've allowed twelve more sessions of speech therapy. I'm like, "I didn't even fucking know my kid was in speech therapy." Because I'm always like, "Dude, slow down. Take a breath. Think about what you want to say." And apparently I asked my dad about it a year or so ago, and he's like, "Your brother did that until he was seven." So with managed care, might as well. Now it's 25 bucks a pop. My copay's gone up. Have you dealt with Blue Cross since I've switched over? [00:11:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope. Your switch date was June first?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember what we were talking about, but we came to some sort of conclusion right at the end last time about me, that—I can't remember what it is. Do you remember what it was? (pause)</p>

<p>This is why you should take notes. (pause) I think it had to do with something about not taking risks (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: The only reason I'm interested in it is because at the after last night I sat next to Barbara. And I'm a little bit smitten, would be a good word to use. So I don't know. But I've no ability to pursue it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I sort of think that's what we were talking about, what I remember you talking about, is the ways you tend to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've convinced myself that I'm too old and that there's no reason—I've just convinced myself it's a bad idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think what I ended up saying was that (pause) you can tend to run yourself down, or to just goof around as ways of backing off things that make you anxious. (pause) In other words, well, obviously I don't know how she'd react if you asked her out, that I know—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? Really? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) that you'll sort of preemptively run down the litany of things that—reasons it could never possibly work out, and it's seriously not worth considering. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I talk myself out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But in this particular way of, like, "I suck."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which certainly feels crummy, but it's also like a strategy for avoiding anxiety that goes along with thinking about actually doing something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. (pause) What do I do about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I know there's no pill for it. (chuckles) [00:15:07]</p>

<p>I don't know. I feel like there's just going to be an opportunity that pops up. The thing is, I don't know how to read these kind of situations. I don't know if she's interested in me, or... it's hard to tell. If you're playing the game, everybody's goofing on everybody, and you're teammates, and big group hug at the end, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't know. (pause) It's like I'm not sure, sometimes I think I look over at her and she kind of looks away, but I'm not sure what's happening. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. I would imagine it's like vague and ambiguous and hard to tell. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I mean, it's... (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be doing this as a way to run myself down, and avoid an anxiety situation, but looking at things from her perspective, here's a guy who's married with two children. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she know you're separated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I believe so. (chuckles) I refer to Jess as "my babies mama."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never knew what that meant, and I had to ask Jess. She was always my—because all her clients are (pause) drug dealing gang bangers, so I always have to get the cool hip words, lingo, yeah. [00:17:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I know what it means, but... </p>

<p>CLIENT: It means the mother of my child, who I'm not married to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my baby mama. But there's two of them, so I say "my babies mama."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not as possessive, but as in plural. I'm pretty sure she knows I'm separated, so... I don't know. (pause) So I don't know what to do. (pause) [00:18:08]</p>

<p>I'll just sit and suffer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I do, yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>I've just never been good with these things, you know? Which makes me—when I watch these TV shows, like George Costanza hooking up with all these hot women, it's like, are you kidding me? First of all, on these shows, they're constantly finding women, like "Two and a Half Men." Do you watch that? Well, there's—Charlie Sheen is the playboy, and Jon Cryer is the creepy, screws-everything-up brother. And who never had success with women, but he still gets dates all the time. I know it's TV, but... I'm not really part of any other social circle that exposes me to... My friend said to do Match.com, and I'm like, "I can't do that." You've got to fill out this profile and say all these things about yourself and (pause) I have trouble coming up with good things to say. (pause) It's hard to... "I like long walks on the beach and pina coladas... getting caught in the rain." (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) [00:20:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like sports, Guinness, whiskey, Guinness, whiskey, sports...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Guinness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Guinness. (pause) </p>

<p>Jess has a client she's meeting at the new office, which she's never been to, and it's in the back of the building. What I mean by the back of the building is it's a big fucking building. Long building. And she just told her client to go to the leasing office and ask for directions, which, the guy's going to be totally lost. I told her, "Be prepared for me to be a half-hour late." And I left the AC on, so I want her to turn the AC off, and I left my earbuds there. So I tried to get out of there quickly yesterday, I'm not sure why. But I just closed and sort of rushed out. </p>

<p>Oh, I won my summary judgment motion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All counts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rock on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's even two counterclaims that in my motion, I wrote asking for summary judgment, but in my memorandum, I didn't bring them up at all. But they still gave me summary judgment. They didn't even argue. And said that everything the trustees did was reasonable. I don't know if it says in there that I got attorney's fees, which I have to—I don't know what to do at this point. And Jess didn't leave the paperwork in the office, she's probably taking it out to the other office or kept it with her, or I don't know. So my clients, who have been fucking bitching at me for a fucking year and a half... (pause) "This has happened, and it's all happened because of you!" Eh, you fucking suck. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every time I go up there I drive by this condo, too. The building could use a paint job, but it's not in horrible shape. So now I'm kind of in unchartered territory about what to do about collecting money and getting an execution and all that. So you'll find out what happens, I guess. You've got to pay attention. Because some of this stuff is time-sensitive. And if they didn't grant the attorney's fees, I've got to do some sort of request to the court. </p>

<p>That was good news, that's probably why I'm in a good mood as well. I had a feeling. I was cautiously optimistic, just based on the questions he was asking, that things were going to go our way. And they should. Once again, I knew everything was in our favor, but I was worried there was something. And then my other condo, the lender's going to give us six months' condo fees and attorney fees, and start paying the condo fees until they foreclose. So those guys are happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My closing, they're an Asian couple, so they asked me to take my shoes off. Non-Asians don't like me wearing shoes in their house too, it's not... [00:25:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So as I'm taking my shoes off, I'm joking about the time I went to the department—the prison with Jess. She was interviewing a witness, and needed me there to—basically, if the witness didn't want to testify, I could provide—say what the witness said. There's an exception to the hearsay rule for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So having never been to a prison before, even the attorneys, they make them take off their shoes. And I had holes in my socks. So I'm relaying this story about how funny it is that I had holes in my socks, and sure enough, I take off my shoes, and there's holes in my socks. I'm just hoping my feet didn't smell. Two med school student researchers, just really disgusting people. High achieving, successful. But it's funny—they got these beautiful conch toes. And right across the street, they've got the view of their neighbors, who hang their laundry out to dry. They've got two pit bulls, which are very nice dogs, but as I'm leaving, the husband's pulling in, and he's listening to some, cranking the country music. So they totally live right across the street from some old white trash. (chuckling) I thought it was funny.</p>

<p>We're trying to get all our IRS shit in, there's been some miscommunications and I haven't had a chance to review everything but today they're sending my 82 bucks off to the IRS. At some point in a couple weeks, the DOR is going to suspend our licenses, which just doesn't fucking make sense. First I'm sending them money, and then because I owe them—I didn't pay my most recent taxes, they stop the collection, the automatic payment. So they stop taking money from me. You're on an installment plan, which you couldn't keep up with, so we're going to stop taking money from you. But we're going to aggressively go after you for the money we've stopped taking from you. So now they want to take out the only means I have of making money, and that's driving my car. How am I supposed to pay you back by you suspending my license? What good? I don't have the money. I need to work. It's just... I guess the government's just fucking idiots. I can't really impress upon my lawyer the timeliness of—because I don't want them taking money out of my bank account again. I've got to be able to use it. </p>

<p>I just fired off 1400 dollars to my landlord for February. My tenant gave me two checks, one of them is still holding because he hasn't told me it will clear yet. And I figured I'm not even going to ask him until Monday, but I'd like with these two closings to take out another—I've got to pay my June fifteenth quarterlies, and then I've also got to be able to pay rent, another month's rent. I don't think I'm going to be able to pay the month of rent, but we'll see. I've got to also keep my account low as possible. I'm tempted to pay my landlord with an office check just so I don't have to worry about the money being in my account, but he doesn't cash the fucking checks. If I send an online payment, it takes the money out when it sends the check. At first I didn't like that because it holds all of the check, I'm losing interest. But now that's attractive because they can't take it. Because that's what happened the last time, he was holding a 2800 dollar check, two months rent, and then they took it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's when they took it out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They took the 2400 dollars out. (pause) [00:30:11]</p>

<p>The lawyer sent over a bunch of shit last night. And I just don't even fucking care if it's right or wrong. Just, let's fucking get in the negotiations and... I just don't fucking care. I'm just so...(pause) It's like I told Jess about breaking up the firm, it's like, "Let's fucking get rid of the mortgage problems and the IRS problems before we start spending all this money on new letterhead and business cards," and I'm sure they're going to charge me to change the name on my door. Because I finally get my name on the door and I've got to change it. </p>

<p>I used to take Ian, I'm going to have him sleep over tonight. He asked me to. (pause) My day to take him to school was Thursday mornings. And the last time I did it, Jess was like, "Lucille's day care is over near there." She's like, "Oh, what I really need you to do is pick up, it doesn't help me to take them." And It's like, I'm not doing this to help you. I'm doing this to spend time with my child. But you complain I never do. So yesterday I just didn't even bring it up, slept late, because she even goes and takes, drops Lucille off at eight, and drops Ian off afterward. She's going to be bitching about the new office today as well, about the location of it, getting lost and just... bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch. Tired of it. </p>

<p>Looking for a new pair of wheels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I meant woman. (chuckling)</p>

<p>I'm not a big person with cologne and stuff like that, just because I have been to Target and Tom's was expensive, I bought Axe deodorant. I don't use anti-perspirant, I don't like that stuff. And I usually get like Trader Joe's or Tom's when I'm at Trader Joe's because it's cheap, and Axe has the body spray. And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I'm too old to be wearing Axe. So there's a Mary Kay woman in my group, and I use—it's MK for men, I call it "Man Kay." And I use it as an aftershave. And it's nice, but the smell doesn't really—it's just an aftershave. So I asked her for some body spray. Because I'm back on the market.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so. [00:33:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know what to say, what I would tell Jess. It would probably—it would have to be upsetting to her. I'm sure I would be upset if she started dating some guy. I don't know what... she's let herself go pretty good, I don't know how she would find someone. She'd definitely have to find someone well beneath me, but I'm sure I would just feel something. (pause)</p>

<p>I'm going to a surprise birthday party on Saturday. I'm very social with the handball people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Barbara will be there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's too bad. (pause) An original guy that used to be on our team is turning 40, his wife's having a surprise birthday party. They now play on our sister team, we share fields with them. So they're going golfing, and then he's thinking that the people he's going golfing with are going back to clean up, and then go out to dinner. But when they get to their house, there's going to be all these people there. </p>

<p>So there was fake e-mails about what the plans were. I thought about playing golf. But I don't know. I just decided not to do it. And some people actually carry a bag. They're not like normal clubs, they're designed for professional golf. And there's a show on access, community access for it. And some of the fucking swings these people make are unbelievable. Big winding, through the trees, dink right into the hole. Just unbelievable.</p>

<p>How are we doing on time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little more than five minutes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. We'll see how long this lasts. I do get sad when I think about my dog. I woke up this morning and just kind of remembered sedating him and putting him to sleep. Someone on the other team last night came over and said something about it. And the field we played on is the baseball field, and I used to take Buddy there all the time and we played. He loved that field. Because it was big open space and he could really hug them, and we brought his toy. (pause)</p>

<p>So is there a solution to my problem?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The inhibition problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Is there a magic elixir? Whiskey?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Guinness, I think. Do you like Guinness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's low alcohol. It's like four percent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's workable. I guess the thing of it is... (pause) I have an impression that you'd like me to really tell you what to do about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, actually, I'd prefer you to call up Barbara.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Right, see, but I don't think that would actually help you with the problem. That would</p>

<p>CLIENT: This sounds kind of high-schoolish, but what if I mentioned to someone else on the team that I liked her? And have them casually find out if she was interested? That way... (pause) Would that be workable? Is that... [00:39:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I threw you a curveball? (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —making... see, I'm... you're working to put me in the position of the one who's like, sort of responsible for what you do, or who is telling you what the right thing to do is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you lecturing me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But to me, that would not aid in your becoming more confident in these sort of things, but would</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you're saying I just have to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm saying I think you're looking to me for the answer to what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. That's why I'm here. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're here not so that I can give you the fish, so that I can help you learn how to fish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Teach me to fish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're asking me for the fish. (pause) Look, I understand. You're anxious, you've been off the market for a while. You have a lot of things that happened that have taken a whack at your confidence, this isn't something that's ever been easy for you. I'm not (pause) trying to blame or criticize you for wanting to lean on me about this. But I am saying I think it's, in part, a way of sort of avoiding looking at the ways it's difficult for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's like... you know, I've been with Jess for fourteen years. Going back fourteen years. I didn't date anyone in law school. Even—there was opportunities. I didn't know why, I just didn't. Women who—they didn't rip their clothes off in front of me, but they made it clear that they were interested. And I just couldn't pull the trigger. So it's been since college that I actually asked a woman out on a date. That's been a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, it's very difficult. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that if this was just a friend of a friend that I met at a party... but it's a little more—I don't think I'm making it up, the complication of it. I think she's a big part of why we're playing better. One of the things that we've lacked is consistently good female handling, and she's got good hands. But she's been very good in that regard. We lost a woman who—she was a good player, but really wasn't a handler. They both just happen to be named Barbara. Old Barbara was really good, but she really was more of a cutter than a handler.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Handler is the people who, they start out with it and throw it to people cutting in, and work—you throw it to the cutters, and then the cutters throw it to the longs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. People who spend more time holding on to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where the cutters get open, but get rid of it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And if the cutter doesn't have a throw, they turn around and dump it to the handler.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And in a zone defense, you have three handlers who are literally just throwing it back and forth trying to wait for an opening. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope you continue to feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I hope so too. It's also the end of soccer last week, so that makes me excited. If you want a dollar off an iced drink at the coffee bean it's right there. I'll work on what I need to do. </p>

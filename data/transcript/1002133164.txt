<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy. The following transcript features Drs. Carl Whitaker and Richard Felder together, treating a couple.</p>

<p>Richard Felder, MD (1919-2008) graduated from Emory University School of Medicine in 1944, served as a US Army physician in Germany and practiced internal medicine before going into psychiatry. With this medical background, Dr. Felder viewed clients' mental health along with their physical well-being and by linking the two, advanced a more holistic approach to healing.</p>

<p>Dr. Felder was president of the American Academy of Psychotherapists and a founder of the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic.</p>

<p>Carl Whitaker, MD (1912-1995) was a pioneer in the field of family therapy. He viewed the family as an integrated whole and not simply a group of separate individuals. He believed family togetherness could bring personal growth and stressed the importance of including extended family members, especially children, in treatment. He also was an early champion of the concept of "co-therapy," where therapists work together in pairs, and of live supervision, in which a master therapist watches a student at work with a family and teaches by intervening in the session. Dr. Whitaker's innovations have become standard procedures among family therapists.</p>

<p>In the late 1940's, Dr. Whitaker was Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University, where he primarily worked with schizophrenics and their families.  In 1955, Dr. Whitaker went into private practice as co-founder of the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic.  He became a professor of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in 1965 and remained there until his retirement in 1982. He continued to teach and lecture frequently after his retirement.</p>

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I had a strange experience in contrast between the tremendous restraint you brought to our meeting when we said hello, and your statement now that you want very much to have a therapeutic -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: It's as though you talked in two voices, and I wasn't sure which one -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [Well, I talk in two] (ph) voices. I seem to have two selves. I don't know. I don't seem to always be genuine or really very real.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: My way of putting it together was that you wanted to be therapeutic, but you wanted to be therapeutic because we made it that way without your having to get your feet wet anywhere.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I guess do like - I wouldn't mind it to be easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I was also intrigued by your husband's idea that it was an affair.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Affair?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Yeah, he said he wanted the whole affair to (inaudible at 0:00:54.8).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Laughs). (Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Well, he was using it in a broad sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Well, so was I, you know, having a specific broad in mind. [0:01:05.1]</p>

<p>(Laughter of many people).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: And I guess I really thought you did too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I didn't at the time, but I do now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Do you have times when you want to give her away?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Laughs).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I wish to be as honest as possible, I'll say yes, but they usually don't last very long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: And it can be quite a gift.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I hope so, but I - she's not up for grabs. She's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: She's what?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's spoken for though, she's - I don't think the occasion for making (inaudible at 0:01:57.8) will come up. I think she's already -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Strange feeling you are avoiding saying, "She's mine." [0:02:04.6]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not consciously, but perhaps subconsciously (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Do you feel sometimes that she's really not yours? That you really haven't made it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I suppose it means maybe I do, but it doesn't last long.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I was wondering (inaudible) it's not lasting longer and [you don't think as long] (ph).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that's what I mean now, I mean the feeling that (inaudible at 0:02:41.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: How do you feel about him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm good (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You get no credit for that. [0:03:00.1]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, like I say - I'd like to say that I love him very much and (inaudible at 0:03:04.4) I can't seem to live without him, but I don't know. I don't know what to tell you about how I feel about him. I suppose I do feel.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (Inaudible) - can I ask for elaboration on that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, you can't because I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: No, you're just the other patient; you don't get any chance to be a therapist here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: It's really okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Because I had sort of a feeling that you were going to have to be a therapist or you'd be crushed.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Why is that funny? You understand what I'm talking about here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. How did you know? [0:04:00.0]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's crazy.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't get the same response though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You don't seem crazy do you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, what I mean to say, he wouldn't even smile and puff his pipe, instead he'd say something else maybe, and it really isn't so. And I was not because I said it, but this is a - because of the situation we're in right now [in the moral structure] (ph), he won't do that. It's polite not to.</p>

<p>(Long pause in conversation).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: What happened out there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I suddenly noticed that I am sitting here grinning and laughing, and looking at the three of you, and then he's like, "Well, maybe we should stop that." [0:05:05.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible) was unpleasant for the two of you.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:05:13.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible) - I was waiting for your words to sink in with him, that's what I was waiting for, but I guess they didn't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it's polite not to let them sink in, or not to let them (inaudible at 0:05:29.0) response right now for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You mean he has the same kind of bland - blankness that you do?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Perhaps, I don't know, (inaudible) psychiatrist. I don't know - I kind of feel that, but I don't know. I don't know that that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Do you think of this as your way of protecting yourself against you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Protecting myself against him or myself?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Both maybe.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. [0:06:00.0]</p>

<p>(Long pause in conversation).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I wish you could get over that "I don't know." It makes me back away from you, and I don't like that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'll take off my shoes (inaudible at 0:06:23.2). I just don't - don't know what to say. Maybe it's my inability to express myself or to really let you know how I feel, but at the moment -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Maybe it's your fear; I see your heart is beating very fast.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it beats fast all the time. I'm quite tense all the time usually. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Does it beat faster with us?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: With you? I don't know, I guess it beats probably just as fast as it has all the other times that I've been (inaudible at 0:06:57.9) psychiatrist or social worker, or psychologist. [0:07:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: It sounds like you're you've been with thousands of them.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I feel like it. That's why I kind of wanted this to be therapeutic, but I didn't think it's possible with just one session, but I don't know, I'm kind of hoping, I kind of want to be optimistic.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:07:17.2 to 0:07:37.6).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: To improve perhaps our relationship with each other rather than (inaudible at 0:07:40.3) because our problems seem very much bound up with each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Is she a therapist to you too?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, in some ways at times when I'm - when I come in the door all tired and worn out after a rough day (inaudible at 0:08:06.4) or something and she (inaudible) therapeutic at times. (Inaudible). If I'm home first, I hope to have such an effect on her when she comes home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Are there times when you get past this role playing business with each other?</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:08:31.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Or be helpful.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Be helpful, needing each other (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: At the time it doesn't seem more efficient, it just seems (inaudible at 0:08:53.7) deal with it, I didn't mean to say it that way or consciously set out to be therapeutic or that she consciously sets out to be therapeutic. [0:09:04.6]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it's important to me when I'm therapeutic to him or that I cause some great response in him that's very positive and that he got - (inaudible at 0:09:13.7) or needs this very much. I think it's very important to me. I - somehow [I see] (ph) he needs that kind of thing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I suppose I need also to feel that way about myself, but at the time that I'm (inaudible) - it depends on the circumstances, but much of the time it isn't something that I'm consciously thinking about at the time, I just sort of naturally perceive (inaudible at 0:09:50.0) and I sort of have enough faith in myself to feel that (inaudible at 0:10:02.5) I will be pleasant to Dora also. It isn't - it hasn't always been the case. Actually I've been taking dexamil (sp?) lately, and I've noticed that now that I'm taking them, I have a much - I have much more faith in my ability to cope with the situation (inaudible) much less inclined to be consciously thinking about the effect of my words upon Dora and such, and yet still they seem to work out better I should say than before because I (inaudible at 0:11:00.6) take things in stride in a normal fashion. My natural [and studied] (ph) response is in fact a more positive response, it's more conducive to our getting along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: It scares the hell out of you, huh?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: It must have scared the hell out of you.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:11:29.6).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible) at other times though. This is something [he does] (ph) for someone who doesn't know him maybe it would appear that way at first, but after living with him and knowing him for some time, it's something that you've mostly adjusted to (inaudible at 0:11:44.8). He doesn't have any idea (inaudible) it is a mouthful or an awful lot, you know, and he really wanted (inaudible) for instance we'll go to a picnic - we went to a picnic a couple of weeks ago, and [this lady] (ph) was there and he's very much interested in linguistics, and here was this cream of the crop linguistics - linguistist -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Linguist.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Linguist, right, and he really (inaudible at 0:12:11.7) at the picnic.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, the thing that Dora is trying to say is that it often seems to her that I talk too much.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:12:26.7) unfair because that's what (inaudible) before she said it. She was just agreeing with you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's saying that - however, there's a distinction here. You're speaking of a particular instance and she was referring to my general behavior on many occasions. She was - her comment on your remark was that my behavior a moment ago was quite typical of my behavior in general, that I usually talk too much. [0:13:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: There was two things she said that I paid any attention to - that seemed to make any sense to me - you said her name, and that's when I began to relax and I thought of her tension, and maybe her tension is like mine with you, that when you get personal for a moment then the tension begins to be gone, but when you [say something] (ph) far away, the tension increases. The other thing you mentioned was coping with the situation, and I wanted to ask you what situation you mean.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, the context in which I said that was - I was referring to being on (inaudible at 0:13:52.2), and when I said that I feel like more able to cope with the situation, I meant that really in two different ways. One very broad and the other very specific. The broad sense in which I meant it, I meant that really in almost every respect I'm able to cope with (inaudible at 0:14:13.6) with life better on (inaudible) than without it, but I'm - the specific sense is just that (inaudible) we frequently get on each other's nerves and I felt that I was able to - and of course it - proceeding naturally to not get on your nerves in the way that I originally had in the past, and that this came in the natural course of things without any special conscious effort in that direction, but just proceeding naturally I didn't get on her nerves really as much as I did before. [0:15:14.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Did you ask (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Put me to sleep.</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles). I usually do (inaudible at 0:15:29.2) and interested in every word he's saying, but on the contrary I'm not, and that's unfortunate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why? Don't you think he says it so you'll be disinterested?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: If that's true (inaudible at 0:15:44.5) disinterested, but his argument in defense of that is that intelligent people, people with very high IQs don't lose interest, they have a very long attention span.</p>

<p>(Laughter and crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible 0:15:57.4) at that I get very bored very quickly. Do you understand? [0:16:05.7]</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I'm not defending. I'm just simply relating to you what I've been told. But I -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I confess that (inaudible at 0:16:26.8).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, and I feel quite inferior at times because I don't know what my IQ is and couldn't give a damn less actually, but to him it's very important this (inaudible) I have a very little attention span etcetera.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think she is quite bright (inaudible).</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I don't seem to have a very long attention span.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Are these the two minds you have?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Are these the two minds you spoke of? [0:17:00.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible) the one you try to have like he wants you to have.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. Well, I don't worry about that so much - I worry about it, it is a problem with me, I won't deny that. On the other hand, that isn't it. I seem to be somewhat aloof and - on one hand, and then the other - it's very seldomly that I'm able to really sense very much about what's going on around me and to really care and to really be involved in it totally. Usually it's between an aloof feeling and then being there, you know, actually being on the scene and sensing and knowing what's going on. And somehow I'm not really caring about it, and it's very unusual where I - that I really am able to sense it totally and to be completely involved. This is indicated in many ways. I've been able to see this in myself in many ways. [0:18:02.2]</p>

<p>For instance, in sex I don't - I can't really relax enough or really - to get this - to be totally involved (inaudible) totally involved (inaudible). I don't know, I think of ourselves and other things, or it's completely hazy in a way. I don't know that I can really express this feeling or this difference (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You mean you're afraid to disregard the other person?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm not afraid of disregarding the other person, I actually do at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why do you (inaudible at 0:18:48.8)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I don't find - I don't get anything out of it, period. I don't reach an orgasm, I don't - nothing. (Stutters inaudibly) - I know the difference. I - at one time I was able to be this complete self and to really be involved in it and so on, and to really reach an orgasm. I know the difference, but I haven't been able to for (inaudible) time. [0:19:24.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She hasn't (inaudible) in the specific context of sex, but I think I (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Here we go again. Are you her father or her husband?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Husband.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:19:36.9)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I know, I worry about that very much, and that actually - well, actually the truth is, when I first started seeking - desperately - psychotherapy, or any kind of help for this problem, it was because I was very dissatisfied and quite promiscuous, and I enjoyed sex very much. [0:20:03.8]</p>

<p>And when it got to the point where I wasn't having an orgasm, I kind of wanted to know what was going on, and that was the real reason that I actually started to look around for psychotherapy and so on. But there have been other reasons that I've learned about, or that I've come to the conclusion as being why I was looking for a psychotherapist or someone who could help me, or to help myself or whatever you say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: What else?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:20:31.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: What other reasons?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, well, (inaudible) business of not really feeling and being able to (inaudible) - I mean I can remember before I was married and my father was quite ill, and my mother was crying because he was (Inaudible at 0:20:51.6) and she thought he was going to die, it was a heart attack. And everybody in the house was quite upset, but I just couldn't give a damn. I didn't even care. And I really felt that way, and I - it didn't matter to me at all, and everyone else was very concerned and crying, and they thought something terrible because I wasn't (inaudible at 0:21:11.2) to do so. And I seem to have no feeling, or a very negative distant (ph) feeling about everything that most people are very concerned about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why should they be concerned about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why should they be concerned about it?       </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because it's very important to them with whatever it is goes the way they want it to go. Sometimes I feel as if my - my marriage, I don't see anything [to doing anything is supreme] (ph) or anything is very important, or anything is important at all. The only thing that's important is what I want and (inaudible at 0:22:05.5), and what I want for that moment. If I want to eat watermelon, then that's fine, that's the (inaudible) thing at the time, or if I want to be (inaudible), then that's important, but everything else is behind me and the only thing that's important is what I'm thinking about, what I'm about to do at the time, and then I'm not altogether involved in it - at the time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Let me (inaudible at 0:22:29.5) - let me give an example of the situation that she had mentioned (inaudible) on because that's an example that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Well, why don't you talk about you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Okay, we'll let her speak for herself.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: At the same time I will talk about me. Well, the - not all of her problems, but many of them begins with one or the other of us becoming annoyed or (inaudible at 0:23:01.9). I'm reminded the example of the two - the husband and wife who (inaudible for several seconds) but not because of that but because one became very annoyed at the way the other (inaudible at 0:23:40.5) toothpaste (ph), and in numerous respects, our problems tend to be like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (Inaudible) we do our share of (inaudible at 0:24:02.5) things to annoy the other, and if I make -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You sure sound like (inaudible).</p>

<p>(Chuckling).</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:24:14.2 to 0:25:12.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Or maybe of being detached (ph).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:25:17.4) is detaching (ph) yourself.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it isn't just - you know, (inaudible at 0:25:22.9) [I am and she isn't. She has in fact continued being there] (ph).</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:25:41.3 to 0:29:34.5).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is very small thing (inaudible) but it is something that annoyed me at the time, and it's in a way typical of the kinds of little things that (inaudible at 0:29:48.5 to 0:30:00.7). I don't know exactly (inaudible), they were small I suppose (inaudible). I suppose I was patterned after my sister (inaudible) three years older than she is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:30:26.6)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But - but light, lighter than Dora.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:30:36.4).</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I certainly think (inaudible) eating watermelon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I think you've done all you need to do Dora. (Inaudible at 0:30:49.3) by marrying her, I don't think you need any watermelon.</p>

<p>(Chuckling).</p>

<p>[0:31:00.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible) dreams. I only have one dream. I always had one dream usually. I very seldom dream about anything else. I dreamed about an apartment one night. I'm sick of the apartment. We have a really very small apartment, the rent is very high, and I've been wanting (inaudible at 0:31:25.3) apartment, but I know I can't have it for another couple of months, and I dreamed once that I had a very spacious apartment. But (inaudible) I very seldom deviate from this one dream I have, and have been having since I was about maybe 7 or 8, and it's always been that of my mother dying, and that dream has always bothered me. (Inaudible at 0:31:47.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: How about last night?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, [I haven't had dreams] (ph). I usually - unless I forget the dreams - I usually don't recall any other dreams, and this dream usually wakes me up. And - on the other hand, I can remember her having a heart attack and not wanting to go, or having some difficulty with her heart - she has a very bad heart - and I was quite aloof, I didn't really care if she died or lived. And on the other hand, (inaudible at 0:32:21.2) dream this dream, and get very worried and stuff. You have the ability to sit there and just look at me, and I hate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Afraid you might (inaudible at 0:32:21.2).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I just wonder what he's thinking about.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:32:47.4).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I'm not so sure my sleep is healthy. I think - like I have difficulty getting to sleep and (inaudible) take some (inaudible), and I seem to have to take a drug to stay asleep - to go to sleep and then have a drug to wake up, and that's unfortunate. [0:33:14.8]</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Which one would you use (inaudible) for, the one to put you to sleep or the one to wake you up?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. I hadn't really come to a conclusion as to (inaudible at 0:33:35.6). I don't know. Probably I need something to stimulate me because I think he would depress me if he stared at me much longer. That is - you (inaudible) Dr. Felder (sp?), right]? Right. Well, I'd have to have something to stimulate me because I think that for someone to stare at me, it makes me very mad and I don't like being stared at, and I don't like the idea of not knowing what other people think, and somehow usually I can pretty much speak for - take for granted what one's thinking, but somehow for him - I haven't known him long enough or else I'm just not so sure about him. I'm very insecure about him and therefore he bothers me. [0:34:14.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Maybe you're afraid if he stares at you long enough it would be stimulating.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hm, perhaps. [I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: He might even get in your dreams.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Get in my dreams, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I might even like watermelon, then what would you do?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, I'd probably go out [and buy all I could] (ph). I wouldn't want him to eat them all in front of me. I love watermelon.</p>

<p>(Long pause in conversation). [0:35:00.0]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Actually if I felt that I could see him twice a week or once every week, it wouldn't matter so much. I'd figure, "Well, I'll go watch this man stare at me for a half hour, an hour twice a week an that'll stimulate me and provoke me, and so on, and maybe I'll get better," and I might think it's worth it in the long run.</p>

<p>(Pause in conversation).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I had a strange feeling a few minutes ago when you were talking. I felt you getting more and more involved, and then all of a sudden you turned yourself off.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, (inaudible at 0:35:40.6) been told I do. One of the students I saw told me that when things got to painful for me - and I didn't feel any pain physically - but that I would turn myself off, and that this is what I was doing and this is why he couldn't manage the psychotherapy on me (inaudible). [0:36:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: do you think it's possible that you could keep from turning yourself off, just like you do it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Possibly, but I think it's very important for me to be able to feel some hope or to have some hope that I am okay and somehow looking at myself I get more and more convinced that I'm not, and so I think it's very painful for me and that I couldn't go on doing it - not for any great length of time. Perhaps I shouldn't seek psychotherapy because of that, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: You seem pretty real to me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. Somehow, I didn't realize sometimes I think it's a matter of just wanting to talk to somebody for an hour or two about my situation, but more like wanting to ask questions and to get answers, so to soothe me and make me feel better, and someone to say, "You're okay," and then that would make me feel very good and then I would go out with a very positive feeling about myself. Somehow I feel very negative about myself. [0:37:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: That's what I told you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What did you tell me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: That you're okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh. But somehow you didn't say it right. You said it as if you had to say it, or as if, "Well, I don't think [you do anything you have to do] (ph) because if there's anything you have to do �-</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: So if you could be healthy in your dreams you can be healthy awake.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, but then you haven't said what would make me happy - healthy in my dreams.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: You are healthy in your dreams.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I don't dream very much? Because I have just that one dream?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Crosstalk) just a minute (inaudible) because you have feelings in your dream [that you won't have].</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Crosstalk). Well, if we may talk about it, I don't know. There's something that bothers me very much and that is just I worry about this sexual thing, you know. About not being able to reach orgasm and - because I once did - perhaps I never did I wouldn't know I'm missing. You can't miss that which you have never had. But I wonder, I'm looking at myself, is that me, or is this me? Am I a lesbian or am I what? I have all these things that bother me constantly. They're constantly annoying me and I - (inaudible at 0:38:17.6) because somehow I just don't want to be anything like that and I feel very insecure because I'm worried that I may be, and there's no way I can possibly think myself into thinking that I'm not any of those things, and it's very important that I'm not any of those things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: You didn't go through this in your adolescence wondering about whether you were a lesbian or not?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible at 0:38:41.3).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible) encouraging you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, no, just - I don't know, I seem to - usually I would think - I don't know, but I would kind of think that - somehow I feel as if one can't deviate just so much before there's no end to the deviation and I'm quite deviant in my sexual behavior, and therefore I feel as if there's no end to what I might do, and I'm fearful. There have been things that I've done that surprise my - I surprise my own self, and I (inaudible at 0:39:24.8) feel what next?</p>

<p>(Pause in conversation).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Can I express a concern perhaps, or worrying about -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles). This is fun.</p>

<p>(Laughter of several people).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:39:53.6) do it yourself.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You read the book (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Crosstalk) get too involved, you know? If you started chatting him up every time he began to sound like that. [0:40:02.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It just wouldn't work. You see, he has on his - (inaudible) behavior today. Mr. Hyde (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Not Dr. Jekyll?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's Dr. Jekyll isn't (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Mr. Hyde is (inaudible) Dr. Jekyll (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Right, right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible at 0:40:19.9)</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You see, I do need a translator.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: You could not get a pipe out of his mouth (crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I might get my hair pulled and there's not much left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Couldn't you pull his as hard as he pulls yours?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I just don't have the strength and (inaudible at 0:40:38.8) within the act I just (inaudible) more or less become aloof and just don't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Well maybe you don't pull hard enough.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hm, maybe not, but you say I can't concentrate (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You mean you won't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I (inaudible at 0:40:51.2).</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Laughs). You going to ring the bell? [0:41:00.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: It's just the first bell.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, I see. But when my husband speaks about not getting on my nerves prior to his taking dexamil - he could get on my nerves quite a bit prior to taking dexamil - he still does at times, but somehow it's not as bad as it used to be and that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why is it good?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because it was hell prior to his taking dexamil at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You want to have a marriage without hell?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, without so much hell.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't understand (inaudible at 0:41:47.9).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, he - the way he stated, "Do you want to �- asked, "Do you want to have a marriage without hell?" He more or less - well, I more or less gathered that he meant that there was some hell in marriage, and since there has to be some hell in marriage according to the way he asked the question, I more or less wanted to say, "Well, not so much hell, or not as much hell." [0:42:09.5]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Now I understand it even less.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I have nothing to say to help you understand it any further.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You (inaudible) complaining ten minutes ago that you didn't have any heaven, and now you're complaining you don't have any hell (crosstalk) both come together.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:42:26.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: You can't have one without the other.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You can't? Are you saying that's a fact?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: No, just suggesting the possibility.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't believe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible at 0:42:43.2).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles). I don't believe it. I believe that married life can be very wonderful and ours has at times been quite wonderful and quite pleasant, and I've enjoyed it very much. And then there have been times when there's been quite a bit of hell, and I've hated it very much, but I feel that there should be a period of time [with either] (ph) - are not the two extremes. [0:43:09.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Why?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Or one of the two extremes. Because I feel that I'm not a person alone as an individual who has to go through life in one of the two extremes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Maybe our marriage just doesn't work right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: [Maybe not] (ph). You've been complaining that you don't have enough feelings.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I keep thinking about this instance (inaudible) go on, and I keep thinking about this business of not really caring about a whole lot of things, things just not mattering to me and so on, and it bothers me because I don't care, that I just don't - it doesn't matter to me because I can't seem to get anything that involves me completely that I feel from head to toe, or - [0:44:03.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible). (Inaudible) - the only thing I seem to be able to feel completely is I can get involved in worry. I can worry better than anyone else I know, and I can -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Did you get involved when he pulled your hair?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It hurt, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: But you don't want him to get involved so you don't pull his.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, somehow I just don't feel it's important to pull his, or if I do it's only - it's very seldomly that I'm very, very, very - (inaudible at 0:44:33.3) pull his or hit him or anything like that, and it's very seldom. And somehow life in my - what did you say a few minutes ago? Giving up or going off? I go off there too. I stop it. [0:45:00.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Well, I think this is your right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My right? I'm sure it's my right. I do it, but the point is, why do I do it? And it bothers me that I don't care enough to go on or to be persistent in that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Maybe you'd just rather have it that way than have heaven and hell.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But perhaps there is a need for me to do that. I don't know.</p>

<p>(Break in audio).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Has it ever occurred to you that maybe this is all the things the two of you (inaudible at 0:45:33.7)?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, it hasn't. (Inaudible at 0:45:41.7) he's really interested in - in something that he - that indicates that he wants to have a - or that he wants peace. It's like he's a conscientious objector, he believes in disarmament (inaudible), and if I - (inaudible at 0:46:07.5) restaurant together (inaudible) across from my work and (inaudible), and this stupid waitress came over and she took a wet rag and (inaudible) table and she went across the table and the table was still wet and she was going to serve me on it. I said, "Well, why don't you wipe that table up?"</p>

<p>And so he's, "No, well, don't do that to her," you know, "It's okay, it's okay." And this p-ed the hell out of me because I think - I thought that she should have wiped that table up, and (inaudible at 0:46:38.4) wipe that table up so I (inaudible) eaten there. But he on the other hand wanted to just keep things as they were and (inaudible) making a big point, that I was (inaudible) very stupid. (Inaudible at 0:46:51.8) a tip, and I didn't think she deserved a tip. I think you get tips when you work, or you do something right, or for the services you perform, and this (inaudible). [0:47:04.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why didn't you walk out?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, if I'd walked out, he'd have just made a bigger scene than the one he didn't want me to make.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Then you want peace too.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I want peace with him, but with that stupid waitress I didn't particularly care about (inaudible at 0:47:19.2) peace.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And there's just so much hell with him and his (inaudible) things that he thought were just terrible, but I (inaudible at 0:47:30.2) or something you know? As if I was a (inaudible) woman that I just got (inaudible) tired and said, "Okay, if you want to eat here, we will."</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Did you ever think [he used a prostitute] (ph)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:47:49.8).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, I knew that. (Inaudible) take him for granted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Is this the way he gets his peace and you get yours by [looking at his face] (ph). [0:48:03.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: By what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: [Looking in his face] (ph) or getting mad (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, not necessarily. (Inaudible at 0:48:11.4). As far as peace is concerned, I think I've bargained and compromised on peace more since I've known him than ever before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Think he'll (ph) ever get tired and give it up?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I would hope not because I'm - I wouldn't (inaudible at 0:48:29.0) be able to live without him and kind of nuts about him actually despite all his certain faults and mine too, and maybe I will, I don't have any insurance that I won't, but it's a possibility. I think that most anything's a possibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Except (inaudible at 0:48:46.5).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, (inaudible) to have a terrible scar on my face or something like that, and I wouldn't (inaudible) in any way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:49:02.3) guess (ph)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: That you're really afraid (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, that's a possibility too because I (inaudible) - when I am angry - I do get pretty angry. I was afraid once I was going to kill him because he - well, one morning I just had enough, and I went at him with everything, just every part of me. (Inaudible at 0:49:27.9) I was completely involved, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, and I just went at him with everything, and somehow I just got tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: [And he gave up that time] (ph)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, he didn't give up. He was still going.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:49:42.8).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm trying to think which (inaudible) that was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible) scared to death too.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:49:59.0 to 0:50:13.6).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So he didn't have any choice.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: On that occasion I hadn't - I hadn't - this was one of the few occasions where she was (inaudible at 0:50:24.1) and I wasn't. I hadn't really - I hadn't really gotten even greatly perturbed and I did [walk over to the door] (ph) to try to get us back together to try to -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Kiss and make up.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Kiss and make up, and she wasn't in the mood for kissing and making up (crosstalk).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:50:49.3).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This was (inaudible) the reason that I had to go in the hospital actually was that I was worried myself because I (inaudible at 0:51:06.4) several times - especially (inaudible) marriage, and even (inaudible 0:51:15.0). I lost my temper several times (inaudible) and pulled her hair (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That could be a possibility too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:51:31.5) we're both wrong (inaudible). You see most of the time we get along pretty well together and we prize (ph) our marriage pretty highly, and I think when the slightest thing happens we feel greatly threatened that we'll break up, so we feel greatly (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: It doesn't sound like you're going to break up. [0:52:00.0]</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I felt horribly desperate. I felt desperate fear that I was (inaudible at 0:52:12.2) we need to make up, we need to save our marriage, and immediately after I do that, I try to kiss and make up, and she wouldn't have any part of it, and I (inaudible). And I tried very hard, and I tried as hard as I could to kiss and make up at that time, and her not having part of it caused me extreme frustration, and even though it wasn't surprising (inaudible). [0:53:00.1]</p>

<p>I'd become (stutters) compulsive in my desire to make up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: But this compulsion (inaudible at 0:53:25.4)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it wasn't that she (crosstalk). She wasn't - it wasn't that she hit me, it was that she -</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:53:35.0 to 0:54:00.0) she'd try to keep her distance, and she wouldn't let me - she'd - she would be annoyed if I'd get close to her. And I'd tell her that I wanted to make up, that I was sorry, that I apologize.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:54:13.5) apologize.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Don't tell him that.</p>

<p>(Laughter of many people).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The thing was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:54:29.4).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The things was (inaudible). I felt a real compulsion to make up so that our marriage would hold together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible at 0:54:42.5).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. But her behavior in rejecting my apologies and so on, would (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Why would she (inaudible at 0:55:05.4)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, she was rejecting (inaudible) I would try to compulsively force these apologies on her practically, and at these times I was really at my weakest (crosstalk). And then she would likely say something - at that time it would just infuriate me and I would -</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Just be mad again.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:55:39.6 to 0:58:13.4).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Aren't you going to stand up and say goodbye? I have a staff meeting to go to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I - is it really that late? What time - (inaudible at 0:58:22.0).</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I'm taller.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 0:58:31.7 to 0:59:35.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I was hopeless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Boy, her (inaudible) something.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Louder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Her (inaudible at 0:59:42.0) was at the gate and we started to greet each other, and she just completely blanked as much as she did when she left. [1:00:00.1]</p>

<p>(Pause in conversation).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Do you think she'd murder us?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I was a little scared of her, but I wasn't scared of him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Where he flips into this little boy thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I went - took the precaution of deciding what I would do (inaudible at 1:00:13.2).</p>

<p>(Chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I thought this symbol (inaudible) her taking her shoes off because she got afraid of herself and disarmed herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: It's no wonder he's interested in disarming her.</p>

<p>(Laughter of many people).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Disarm everybody himself.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Conscientious objector.</p>

<p>(Chuckling).</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: He pulls her hair. He pulls her hair.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: With her permission. With her permission.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Speaking of her being a queer, like two women fighting. [1:01:05.2]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I thought you were holding back and Dick was coming more in there. I thought this back talking was kind of mutual between you and the husband, and I felt Dick was getting more in there with (inaudible at 1:01:27.7) with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I felt just the opposite, that I was pretty hopeless about ever reaching them at all, but supporting what he was doing.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 1:01:34.9 to 1:06:05.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Inaudible) the big struggle that we were in, and that I guess is the beginning of any therapy, the question of who is going to be in control. And (inaudible at 1:06:16.4) not being in control of what goes on in therapy, but being in control of who is responsible for whom, which means this battle of whether we were going to take responsibility for him in the sense of listening, in the sense of letting him drone on, in the sense of letting him alienate us, or the battle that we were in; the initial structuring battle of who was going to be the strongest, and who is going to decide whether their life is going to be their responsibility or our responsibility. [1:07:00.3]</p>

<p>And I (inaudible) him talk.</p>

<p>(Inaudible from 1:07:05.4 to 1:07:26.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: To me the implication in letting him know how we felt about his jabbering on and on, it - that there is something more to him than these long drawn out boring formulations.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible at 1:07:47.1) that in our having some respect for ourselves and our feelings, we gave him the right to move toward having more respect for his own feelings. [1:08:00.0]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: When you started (inaudible) him at the end, he told you directly (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Shit, no. I was through.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I was trying to make him get out of it.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I felt he played several (inaudible at 1:08:16.5).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I think that's true. I thought of myself as giving both of them ammunition for some more battles.</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: But you cut him down so much.</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: They need to learn how to fight (inaudible at 1:08:39.5).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I thought about this too. Shouldn't we do something before this interview is over to restore his position as head of the family?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible at 1:08:51.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: And yet I didn't feel it was he whom we had cut down so much as his jabbering. [1:09:02.4]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: And he isn't the head of the family. She said, "I'm taller than you," and he went out furious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Then he helped me -</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: He may take it out on her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: When he said, "I'm confused," I felt (inaudible at 1:09:17.4).</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: It was all right to leave them.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) his confusion (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I think it proved who had the bigger (inaudible at 1:09:41.3).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) sexual problem (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: He sounded awful worried to me. [1:10:00.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I sure wasn't inspired to get into it.</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Her sexual problems.</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Maybe she scared us off by saying that some therapist had been not objective enough.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Dick, you said you had a feeling she would attack you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: (Inaudible at 1:10:24.5).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Do you mean physically or mentally because there were a number of non-verbal cues which we could see here. All the males kept their legs crossed up to about 2:30 (inaudible). She never crossed her legs at the knees once and there's an obvious (inaudible at 1:10:43.3) on the part of the males (inaudible) crossed legs - unusually so, and I wondered also if her confusion, (inaudible) her separation between mind and body, she seduces with her body and (inaudible) her mind doesn't allow that. [1:11:00.7]</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: She has a very long neck.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: It crossed my mind that he might too, but I was comfortable with that. I would just enjoy fighting with him, but with her I thought I'd have to do (inaudible) pretty carefully.</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 1:11:27.9).</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) he was terribly afraid of her on an unconscious level that she ate the whole watermelon (inaudible) nightmare he said (crosstalk).</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: I felt that she was [eating the air] (ph) (inaudible at 1:12:00.3) concentration of feeling in her mouth every time she opened it (inaudible) her tongue (inaudible). It was as if she was developing (inaudible) everything (inaudible) and tasting it (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I loved her mouth, very sensuous and hungry, and feeling, and it was definitely -</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible at 1:12:21.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I liked it.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Carl, I would say in the beginning that I - you're shutting him out was a very important thing for him, but at the end, I experienced (inaudible) a confirmation for him of his own (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: It wasn't that deliberate.</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: I think (inaudible at 1:12:55.1) much more realistic level, man wrestles with the problem that they did marry (inaudible), and how about the children (inaudible) discuss here. [1:13:11.5]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Do they have children?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: My impression -</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: He said, "To be."</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: My impression is they don't.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I was very much impressed with how well you two worked together.</p>

<p>(Chuckling and crosstalk).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Did you guys practice together?</p>

<p>(Laughter and crosstalk).</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: I wonder what the value is of what you did to him, making him so confused and angry. Do you feel that this will help him, and how?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I think of him as coming in limping, and going out with his muscles at least tight in anger. [1:14:08.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I thought of the Chinese proverb, which I believe in that, "Confusion is the beginning of wisdom."</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: Always?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: But I also had this feeling of (inaudible at 1:14:24.0) at least he's mad about his (inaudible) and - or his not using what he's got.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: And I think we may (inaudible) have given her the first hope that this sexual problem is bilateral, not just that she doesn't get an orgasm, I didn't say it, but he doesn't get an orgasm either. He has an ejaculation and doesn't know what an orgasm is. I hope that's what she was saying, I didn't bother to get into it. [1:15:00.0]</p>

<p>(Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Mechanical talker - mechanical verbalizer.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: But you seemed to be saying to him that what he was saying was (inaudible) worthless (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I felt that.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: And you'd be saying to her that what she was saying was by contrast very much worth while, that what she was saying was valid and so on, and I had the feeling that (inaudible at 1:15:27.7) that she was saying that (inaudible) and I couldn't help wondering what (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I told him that a couple of things that he said seemed worth while to me.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Well, but the other problem you (inaudible at 1:15:53.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: Well, most of the time he just talked to be careful not to say anything really. [1:16:01.3]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) I noticed was that when he talked, he talked about her, when she talked, she just talked more about herself than him.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: She wasn't speaking for him as much as he was speaking for her.</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: The point that he had the dream (inaudible at 1:16:26.4) listen to him.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Well, I got the impression that (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: In answer to (inaudible), you're problem, I don't think of it as anything that I tried to deliberately change. If I'm on one side I'm on one side. I don't think that means I'm not available to him the fact that he hasn't gotten me.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: But he has to perform the way you want him to, right? [1:17:00.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: You're damn right. Sure.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I think too that when she said that they had met this linguist at the picnic, he seemed to accept this without question, and I had the impression that he accepted the idea that he talks and philosophizes without too much meaning behind his talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: I had no real feeling that he had never been broken - if that makes any sense - (inaudible at 1:17:29.8) his defensive pattern, had always somehow gotten through. If he couldn't get it through by words and his intellection, then he would get it through by this little boy dependency that he'd (inaudible) within the last minute, and that basically the biggest contribution could make to him was to not let him get through, to really defeat him.</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: I felt that was extraordinarily insightful shedding (ph) once again, and to have not been (inaudible at 1:18:02.8).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I would have been just like his wife -</p>

<p>(General consensus).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) to be a good little boy, then I'll love you again. Make believe you're grown up.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: To me if you're telling him (inaudible at 1:18:17.6) that he should talk about his problem (inaudible) listen (inaudible) something that was important to him about himself, and then he didn't do it, and if you had listened to that, you're not standing behind what you said. So the way to stand up for what you said (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: My only feeling (inaudible at 1:18:43.8) Carl, was that (inaudible) under ordinary circumstances. What I'm afraid of in this particular circumstance however, is that when the two of them walked out of the room, he might have fallen to a panicked terror that she actually (inaudible) him up. By breaking down his defenses in his particular circumstance with being with her, I'm a little bit frightened for him right now, though apart from that (crosstalk). [1:19:16.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Well, let me say this differently. I don't have any plan and I didn't have any plan. To me this is how I responded to them. Post hoc I can see I assume that if I hadn't become convinced that each of them was pretty deeply in love with the other, we probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Building on Harry's comment, I have to (inaudible at 1:19:41.5) that the two of you related to her in the same as that her husband relates to her, as her good little boy, and (inaudible).</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: I had the feeling more that (crosstalk). [1:20:00.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: (Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: Developed further, particularly with her mother (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: She wouldn't look at me very long.</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: There was no question who was going to win the (inaudible at 1:20:14.1).</p>

<p>FOREIGN FEMALE SPEAKER: [Then why did you] (ph) stimulate her? (Inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (Inaudible) surprised she didn't want you to look at her (inaudible) that she didn't really want to (inaudible at 1:20:14.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: She said she hates people who stare at her.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: And I wonder about the making of their failure to have orgasm. When she spoke of this (inaudible at 1:20:58.7) she used one finger emphatically, and I wondered - (inaudible) is she collecting father's penis, is this the guilt that prevents orgasm despite her denial of too much feeling about the father and so forth, and I just wondered what feeling you had about her sexual difficulties. (Inaudible) entirely the husband or do you think there's [something else] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST 2: I thought she meant she used to have orgasms with him and that she's gotten to the place where he's just boring to (inaudible at 1:21:27.7).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: What she said was, she use to have them when she was a prostitute, right?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>FOREIGN MALE SPEAKER: (Crosstalk) that she would trade in her orgasms for his (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST 1: Repressed aggression. If he didn't hit her, she (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Right. [1:22:00.0]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) I think when I first came in there, I had something I mind I wanted to talk about.  Because things occurred to me yesterday after I left.  But just almost immediately I began to think of things today that either I became very defensive about, that happened to me or I somehow have the feeling I'm overreacting to and, and it's disturbing me.  And I just didn't want to think about them, I suppose, because I have such an emotional reaction and sort of feel I am overreacting.  (Pause) And it's funny too because on the whole, the day went better today.  I didn't, I don't know how I felt about going to school in the morning, I felt about the same as I always had.  But I think I'd somewhat come to the conclusion that I, I was going to go back to the way I used to be with the boys.  And I think what's happening is I'm being more clear in what I expect so they're able to respond better.  And sometimes I do feel like a dictator but right, I think what was bothering me so much last week was a fear of what they thought.  And I just don't, I just don't believe you really can always be worrying about that if you're going to be able to teach.  I think that was one of the things that was holding me up.</p>

<p>But then, as the day, as I finished teaching and, and was just thinking about the day, and my overall feeling is that it was better, even if I did get angry at them or not — well, not angry exactly but have to be very strict with them sometimes.  Uhm, I immediately started to go over the things that hadn't been good and just like now, I kept building them up or thinking them over and over in my mind till they became almost the total effect of the day. (Pause)</p>

<p>And one of the things involves a person that, uhm, I don't work with very much except for the part of the year when we're putting on our class play.  And each year, I think I've spoken of this before, but each year I felt a little more uncomfortable in my relationship with her, and unhappy about handling of the play, and so forth.  And it's gotten now so I just am so self-conscious when I'm with her, I just never seem to say the right thing or I always get very defensive immediately and react in a way I don't want to react, which is kind of a stupid way to react.  And this happened today when, after our, we had seen a play which was a very, it was a good play but it was a little difficult for the age of my kids.  And they were restless but I thought they were behaving well on the whole.  And I was about to say something to this woman on how nice the play was and another person was speaking to her about the noise that some of the audience had made with their feet during it, they were just sort of kicking chairs.  And that person kept saying, well, it was all the beginners, which is what our class is called.  And so when she left I said to this woman that I feel so uncomfortable with, that it wasn't all the beginners.  Only I said it in sort of a joking way but still, sort of like, they get blamed for so much when it isn't their fault and, which is true (laughs).  Uhm, and she just kind of snapped back at me, "Well, I didn't say that."  And I just felt so uncomfortable and I can't seem to stop thinking about it.</p>

<p>And then I felt I had, I started to say something else and then I just stopped myself because I knew I was just going to get more and more defensive and feel I had to justify why I'd even said it at all.  (Clears throat) And I suppose the reason I felt I had to say anything at all, anyway, was that even though I was defending how my boys could act, I felt that it was my teaching of them that was being attacked, not how they'd reacted or what they could do.  And then I had, later on today, the feeling that I had to go and see this person and talk to her, pretending it was about the play we have to do in the spring and what we could do to be getting ready for it but really, it would be to sort of make up for this mistake that I feel is so horrible that I made. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's funny how I reacted to a comment she made later to my assistant.  Because my assistant saw this woman and said that our class had liked the play.  We'd talked about it and they had indicated there were lots of parts they really liked about it.  And she said, "Well, I'm glad to hear it.  I wish you'd tell it to the right people."  And when I first heard that, I didn't take it at all personally.  But then I, it just something that kee—, kept coming back in my mind and I became sure that it was me she meant in telling it to the right person.  And somehow I've built up this feeling that she disapproves of me and sort of is out to get me.  (Silence) And I think there's something else, too, that, uhm, before this happened I had already decided I wanted to see, uhm, the person who's head of dramatics at LKC, uhm, about our play, the same woman.  And, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, the same woman you've just been referring to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, yeah.  She's sort of the dramatics teacher.  I don't, she works with all the people putting on plays and does some classes.  And, ah, and I think the reason I had, aside from honestly wanting to do something a little bit differently than I've ever done and wanting to work with her, I think that I was wanting to talk to her because somehow I want to let her know I haven't liked what I've done before, which she hasn't approved of.  And that if we are able to work out a change, just between my assistant and I, uhm, I want her to know that I'm the one to get the credit.  And in fact, I'm afraid to even let my assistant do much with it because then, I'm afraid, I won't get the credit or I won't feel I deserve it.  And it struck me it's sort of the way I've been with my assistant all along, that I could work well with her because I do like some of her ideas and there are times when I do work well with her.  But, yet, over all this is this feeling that I have to curtail what she does give to the program because I've got to feel that anything good that comes out of it is my doing so that other people will think it and I can then think it.  And, I'm not expressing this very well, but I don't know, it's just a fear of letting her contribute anything to it, that then they'll think it's all her and not me.  Just, I think this came from what happened yesterday when my supervisor was complimenting the way she handled the painting class and I had the feeling she was implying that, in contrast to the way I did, this was the way to do it and the only way.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about, well, after I said that about being afraid of not getting credit for what I am doing right or what I think is good or what other people might think is good or just jealous of any credit she would get, uhm, that I know, both from the few times when I had just gone along and done things without thinking and worked well with my assistant, that if I can just not care and be confident about what I am doing and, or just be confident that I should care more about pleasing myself, uhm, in, in assessing what I think is right and all, that, that when I feel that way, I can work better and that, then she, she would feed my ideas and I would feed hers.  And, I mean it just doesn't break down the way I'm afraid it will.  But yet, what I feel is something else.  And most of the times what I'm fear—, feeling is this fear and insecurity.  And no matter how much I know that it doesn't have to be that way, I still can't help but be this way.  And somehow, I'm, I don't know whether I'm trying to connect it or if it is connected.</p>

<p>Because this is another thought I had after yesterday and I had it in my mind as something I wanted to say.  But, uhm, yesterday, the way I reacted once you started asking questions, just seemed to be, the whole way I changed, when I'll start something enthusiastically if it, even if it's just a school year and feel full of ideas and confidence.  And then I'll gradually just lose my confidence and feel I'm not meeting expectations and just have what happened to me yesterday, where I just suddenly felt as if, I don't know, there's a, I just get sort of a noise in my ear and a pressure on my head, inside my head.  And it just feels like a vacuum, as if I'm too busy fighting things.  And, and I was aware even yesterday thinking, when I was thinking, well, you must want something because of your questions, then I would think in return to that, well, even if you did, it doesn't matter if I'm not seeing into those things right now.  And yet I couldn't really feel it didn't matter. (Pause)</p>

<p>Actually, it was almost the way my conference went with my supervisor yesterday when it started with the possibility for it to go any way.  And I began very soon, because of things she was saying and the situation, to say things I didn't want to say.  And then, again my mind, I just felt I couldn't even think because I was struggling so against things within myself.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And it, when I realized more clearly, both this weekend and then yesterday, when I was talking about how I get angry when I don't get what I want in the reactions of people and how I seem to need constant approval or reassurance, it, I think when I got home yesterday the thought occurred to me that — or maybe it has all along — that whoever is dealing with me can see right through me and see all these fears and anxieties and everything.  And then that made me feel worse than ever.  And I think that when I'm having to deal with these people, sometimes that's another part of what makes me just feel I can't even think to handle the situation because I'm worried that while it's happening, that they're being able to see right into my mind and know, or see through my reactions just as much as I do and, I don't know, just see how weak I am and incompetent or silly or whatever, childish.  It's — (pause) I think that was another aspect of how, what makes me feel so uncomfortable in thinking about what I did today with the dramatics teacher and feeling that she could tell immediately exactly why I reacted the way I did and that that made her, well, I was going to say feel a disgust for me.  I don't know if it would be quite, well, maybe that strong but anyway, not respect me at all.  Because that was the way I was reacting. (Pause) And so in trying, thinking about meeting her later to talk about our class play, and I consciously think, how can I do this so it'll appear very mature?  Because I feel I have to make up for this very immature impression I've given.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, I think this morning one of the things that got me started alright or feeling a little more confident in what I was doing, no matter how the children were reacting, was that on the way to school I had a, 1 or 2 ideas of ways I could, in teaching them to read, use some of the approaches I discussed with my supervisor.  Only these were ideas of games on, that I had thought up myself.  And I thought they were good.  And when I got to school I could remember them.  Sometimes I forget things on the way and then I get so frustrated that I can't remember them.  I don't know, just somehow the feeling that, alright, I had an idea and it was alright and probably thinking too, she'll, maybe she'll find out I did it and then think, well, I'm not such a bad teacher, just somehow got me started better.</p>

<p>But I do remember, even then, when I was thinking of those things, thinking that in the fall I'd done some of these types of activities too.  And when she was saying, well, these are the things we could do to work within the program and still use ideas we thought would be good, that somehow she didn't know I'd done these things and I had better let her know that I had done them.  And I felt it was lucky I wasn't near her because I would have been under a compulsion to tell her, well, I did do those things once, as if that would really matter. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I'm not sure how this might have affected it too.  But, uhm, I felt in the last few days that the best thing would be for me to just somehow stop thinking about school and all these problems because I'm not getting anywhere by thinking about them so much, it's just getting me more and more upset.  And I haven't been able to.  And then last night, uhm, a friend of mine who doesn't live in the city called to say she was visiting and would like to meet me for lunch today.  And, although, I like her very much and wanted very much to see her, my first reaction was almost, oh, how can I do this because this will mean I'll have to think about somebody else and right now I just have to have time just to think about myself.  But then once I knew I was going to meet her for lunch and had to start thinking about arranging things so I could meet her and about the girl herself and so forth, it, almost as if, as if it got me out of myself too.  And, and I, just thinking, I really underplayed this but I think I was very pleased that she even bothered to call to ask if she could see me, take the time to.  But then I, I don't know, I just kind of wouldn't let myself think about that and I don't know why. (Pause)</p>

<p>Except that I almost seem to have to view everything negatively and I can't think about that unless I can think of reasons why she would have done it that would be negative to my feelings.  Just like when I think about the fact that I am asked back at school, I, instead of thinking, well, it shows they approve of me, I think of it more as being, they don't really know what I'm like yet and I've somehow fooled them up to this point, on what I'm like.  So I have to keep a guard on myself and keep fooling them.  And I was sort of nervous with her.  I wonder if that's what I was doing there too, sort of being afraid if I didn't keep a guard on myself she'd know how boring it was to be with me or how, just how much she might not really want it if I didn't watch out. (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny.  As I'm talking today, I'm more aware of a feeling of, that I, there's something I'm not getting at or a disquiet inside and frustration than I am sometimes.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What comes to your mind, I mean, when you think maybe there's something you're not get at, getting at?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't, in everything I've talked about, I've just been thinking, it's a thing I know again, against the thing I feel, that if I were more confident of myself I wouldn't have these problems.  But I guess I can't, what I can't get at is the feeling of confidence.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.  That'd be one way to put it.  Another way to put it might be that, ah, it seems hard for you to ask the question of yourself, how does it happen that you feel such lack of confidence in yourself in so many different instances as you have described, with many different people and how does it come about?  That, I think, is another way to, eh, it's another kind of question that might be asked.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I have asked it of myself.  I was asking it today when I was talking about the fact that I had been thinking lately on needing so much assurance and everything.  I just began to ask why do I need so much assurance.  So I suppose it's the same question.  Or (pause) but then I would, I was even talking to MSCZ about it the other night, but even then I'll stop thinking about it because, I don't know, I just feel sort of discouraged that even if I knew why, it still doesn't, it, it's like knowing about some of my reactions now, I still react in those ways.  And I would still feel it even if I knew why.  (Pause) But I was thinking this weekend that, well, in terms of being angry when I didn't have the reactions that I wanted, I think it's somehow connected with that because I now will become angry very quickly and I have since I can remember, since I assume that I won't get the responses that I want and, unless I fish for them, which I do do.  And then naturally I get, what happens is just what I know would happen.  But uhm, somehow I don't expect to get the responses that I want.  And I just won't even give them a chance, give anybody a chance to. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was thinking about the anger that I feel and how separate it feels from the fear I feel.  And yet somehow they come from the same thing.  I, so far anyway, I can't really understand it enough to even think about it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

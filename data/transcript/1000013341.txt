<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I had really thought (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay. What it was you just were going to find out (inaudible) No? (Inaudible). That's good. You're appointment was for 2:45. You came at 2:15.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On Wednesday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I thought I had the wrong week. Oh. I'm sorry. I thought I had the wrong week so I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long did you wait?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I waited a long time. I must have you know I waited. It's funny. I waited. I seemed to wait at least ... I know I waited for about a half hour or something like that. So maybe I had the time wrong too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) for an hour or two. Because I should - I would have waited - I would have thought I would have waited for a half hour. But I guess what happened to us was I had to call you. And then I went to here. And they called over there. And nobody had seen you. So they wanted to - so I'm sorry (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I got - when I'm in session I generally do not pick up the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew that and I wasn't. Oh, I can't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I - I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What happened was I was over here. And then I didn't feel like (inaudible). And then I came (inaudible). (Inaudible) separate. One for - until a week and not Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's funny. I thought - I was looking at the slip too. I was. Because I was looking. Because I went back to check it out. And I thought it said the 14th. Would the 14th be a Wednesday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So I'll check it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something about your message said was on the (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But you still said 2:15.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I'll look then. If I still have the thing. I'll look and see if it was that. If it was that. But I'm - it seemed like I would - I would have thought I would have waited more than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you fell about this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just not as bas as I usually would. I felt good about not feeling as crazy about it as I would. You know I would have. Yeah. I mean I think it would have set me off into more of a depression - more (inaudible) than it did. And I thought it felt good that I had been able to deal with it in what I thought was a rational way without getting all wrapped up by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When did you feel good about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: After I had called and done the things that I thought I should do to see where you were.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel when you weren't sure what was going on? You were waiting for half an hour. How did it start to feel? [2:53]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it didn't feel bad. It felt - I mean it - it really - you know it's the kind of situation that I usually could get very uptight about. But I didn't. I thought you know (inaudible) vacation. You know something's wrong here. And I waited. And I had her call a couple of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How were you feeling when you were going through these?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not bad. You know I'm not nearly. I mean it was like okay to solve this problem. I'll do after 1 o'clock called a couple of times. And I thought well maybe I'll go down to the office where the (inaudible) therapy use to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And see if there's somebody else there. And she called them for and nobody had seen you. And then I thought oh gee maybe I have the - really messed up. And then I went. And so I thought - I guess I came to the idea like it must have been the wrong (inaudible) or the wrong week. It's (inaudible). And then I came back and so on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if we were not feeling bad, how were you feeling? It wasn't as bas as you think in the past it has been but what was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was a real kind of problem solving I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not much. I mean I - no it was - it was even when I was doing it, I think I was feeling good about not feeling crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what it is. I was - it's like I knew I was feeling good about it. But not I mean I didn't feel good about not having an appointment. I felt good about the way I was dealing with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that felt decent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you - so you said (inaudible) in a helpful way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not blaming. Just being able to say okay you screwed up. The appointments are next week. And I remember when we were making the appointment that we had more trouble coming up with the time than usual. And I was (inaudible). And I - so that was the way. And that - so I until now I don't - didn't realize that you were here on Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was in my office with another patient.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry. I knew how that is. But it was - I mean from my point of view it just - there are a lot of - and that's another thing that I felt good about - that I didn't. Usually if I did something stupid or something I would feel like I couldn't admit it to Susan or deal with it straight forwardly. That she might throw it in my face as soon as I get back. And I - you know that wasn't there either. That was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why was there instead?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just said you know I missed the appointment. Like darn. Yeah. (Inaudible) not there. I just got - had the wrong week or something like that. And her you know it was - that was that. So it wasn't (inaudible). [5:52]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm curious. What and this just go through my mind could some part of you have perhaps been angry at me because yeah, we did have trouble setting up the appointment. And it was kind of like well something went array.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well it wasn't conscious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (inaudible) might have been at another time. This time it just wasn't. It was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had you been handling things (inaudible)? Had you been happy there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Had I been?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you not been happy with the way you were channeling things? Then would some of them (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not this time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not this time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not this time. I mean I felt more upset now finding out that you were there Wednesday than I did you not showing up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me how are you feeling right now with this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well a minute ago I was feeling that - confused about trying to read how you were feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether you were mad or trying to figure things out - all of those things. And then the more we talked and then you said something else. I don't know what it was. And then ... I guess the way I'm judging it is ... the punishment should fit the crime. The degree of upsetness should fit the situation. And - and also my feeling about like I'm sorry that I'd stay longer but it - I can't remember exactly what was going on. So you know I feel bad at least that I'd have stayed longer than you wouldn't have had to lose an hour.</p>

<p>At first I thought you were irritated with people like having you irritated. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did it feel to think that I could be irritated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's terrible because I think that gee her being irritated maybe that's (inaudible). That's taking too much cycle into the (inaudible) (laughs) Maybe I'm transferring something to her. And am I dealing with you as another person who's irritated. Are you a therapist that's very irritated? And that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Repeat that for me again. I'm not quite catching it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not - I wasn't sure what I was doing even to you. My feelings were a reaction to you as a sole use of being upset on my reactions to you doctor psychiatrist. [Use of] (ph) - I already like you know therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you explain to me why the difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What the difference is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking that there isn't a difference in reality but that there's a difference in the way I react. And ... not now. I lost it. I mean I really had a feeling but now that it's - it's not terribly verbal. It's ... there's a difference in my treating you like a symbol of some sort ... or as a person with however you were feeling about the situation. [9:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. What would make the difference in your reaction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking - just something I had thought that it might be that for instance that I would (inaudible). So I asked them about my wife's children. My wife and if I treat her in these two different ways. And it's not as easy because you've got a title I can sort of push you into authority doctor or something like that. But with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But let's take with me though. If I'm the charity (ph) doctor how would you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: More ... more ... I can't - what do you call the person that is something to authority?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Subordinate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's when you say. It's a specific. It's the ... if it's a (inaudible) it's a subject. I don't know but you know that kind of thing. I think it's more that subject situation. If I was reacting to you. And it's not something - it doesn't divide so easily. It just divided in my mind now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But let's explore that. Okay. You defined the authority - the doctor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be the subject of the person that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would that modify or opt or color how you feel? What would you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'd feel that I could be - do something wrong. I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you did something wrong how am I supposed to respond?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I was saying that I don't know (ph). (Inaudible). It's just that (inaudible) happened similar to that today - probably more so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But let's stick to this because this is happening now. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other one it fits in with the same way only if you turned up the (inaudible). You know because I think that with Ashley this accident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want us to stick with this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To - there isn't that much there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I would doctor it up so that you (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like a child to a father. That type of thing. You know you have your disapproval. It's ... more effective. In other words like ... it's in us. It isn't - because I can see you as both parts now. And I suffer. But I think it would be like a father who has a threat. That's it. Authority has its wrath. I'm not sure what threat you have. I - if anything it would be I told you a lot of things about myself that I might not want everybody to know about. [12:29]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. So if we do something wrong - if you make a mistake or whatever, how am I suppose to behave - respond if I'm that (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. In an ideal situation I mean ... how would I like you to respond or how do I think you would respond?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In your (inaudible). In your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. How ... I think by employing a threat or indicating a threat or all of those things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that would be like a punishment kind of thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The threat of punishment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think in terms of the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how does that affect you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes me feel powerless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Powerless. What else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you feel powerless there's no ... maybe fear an apprehension in the face of being powerless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Where if I'm just (inaudible) I hear you - you know this kind of thing (inaudible) make a mistake, then how is it that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel more - I feel like more I think more of the hurt like feeling bad or what you feel - sympathy - empathy - whatever. And I think maybe I feel that I have some ability to (inaudible) this situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there you are the one that's feeling powerful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say I'm sorry. I would put it in - I'd - I think if you say you're sorry to somebody it doesn't mean you're more powerful saying you're sorry. It's unfortunate. I sympathize with you know you're reaction to that would be - the reason I brought the other thing is the same thing happened with a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I want us to stay right here because this is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. That's interesting because I'm putting this back in the past week thing. (laughs) It feels.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel when I keep on frankly - keep - stay here with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I sort of think that ... you think it's a good idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure but you're the doctor. So we'll - I'll come back to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But not if I'm the doctor - you're the person that I'm coming to see who knows what is worthwhile investigating at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I know. You don't? [15:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean I go to the doctor for a headache. I don't know the kind of medicines that are available. I go to a therapist for help for the way I feel. She will know that the direction that the session should go and be most helpful. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So one thing is like a child and a parent? The parent knows which direction to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think a doctor who prescribes Cartizone (ph) is being a parent to the patient. And I don't think you bringing me back to the subject is being a parent to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think there's a difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like yes I'm the doctor and you're kind of like giving me the benefit of the doubt here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean (laughs) not at all. I think you're - I'm trusting your intuition or intelligence or your background. It's more important that we talk about my relationship with you because it's going on now than another one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling as we talk about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a little bit - pushed a little bit on ... not sure what you're trying to ask (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's why you're thinking. You're not sure what I'm driving at. What about emotion? How are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling - it's changing very quickly. I'm feeling as I talk to you that - I don't know just maybe that there is some uncomfortableness that. But also on the other hand this optimism or a chance of things happening that are - would be beneficial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So in a way you're putting a nice label on the discomfort? But.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what you said. I don't think I - I mean I don't feel like I'm putting a nice label. I think that if ... to do ... what goes in my mind any ... I think the people that do the best art are the ones that enjoy some of the struggle. So when I - and this is what we're going through now is not - it may be discomfort the way like somebody in art has discomfort trying to do something. But it's not discomfort in the same. So the way I am willing to call it which as I've said is like sympathy or maybe even for instance this afternoon or maybe the way I related to you for five minutes now. Do you understand what I'm saying? It. [18:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I think you thought] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like we're working - you're working with me. And you may be pushing me some place that I don't understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Am I supposed to stop you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... at the same time it seems worthwhile or it seems. It's like right now I'm - my relationship with Susan in the last couple of days is very matter of ... well uncomfortable would be a good word for it. I don't really - other than that not very pleasant. And I don't think either when I'm trying to do her thing about her particularly I'm getting anywhere or even have the potential to go (inaudible) - other than that. That's discomfort in the sense that I think of it.</p>

<p> This current thing with you working on this is - it's not the same thing. I don't feel as vulnerable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With you. I don't feel protected. I just don't feel ... like an open sore. It's nothing like that. It's I'd say - the discomfort comes from being a whole person dealing with something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd say with Susan it feels like I'm not all there. I'm turning into something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It goes back and forth. It's alright you know when we're having a conversation. But it's not ... it doesn't feel hopeless or insurmountable whatever discomfort there is. And as we're working on it, it feels like working on it seems to be a good thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though it's uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uncomfortable is uncomfortable. It's worthwhile ... to subject yourself to a certain amount of discomfort because you feel that the - what you're working on is worthwhile. It's worth it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As we're talking my mind is going back to our last session when you did have some concerns that you know that our relationship the way we direct is different from the way it is with Rob. And you were questioning whether I could really help you - remember that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you're misunderstanding what I said. It was just the opposite. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's - let's fresh. That's what's in my mind right now. [21:14]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I just felt that Rob helped me on a certain level. But I couldn't think that my relationship with you is more give and take. He almost - I - looking back it was like in the sessions I thought - I felt it but I didn't know whether I - my feelings were right. He seemed to be more detached. And so that he could - like this question you got going back to how you feel right now. He would have been more - I would have felt more detached. I would have felt if I brought back to what's happening now it's because of his authority or his pressure or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where as here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel that you - you know this is the best way to deal with the situation. And you're willing to. It's hard because he doesn't - the words can almost the same and the feelings quite different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) understanding for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. His seems like a - an authoritative in a sense. In other words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He would never.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I have an idea more or less.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He wouldn't explain or talk to me about why he kept wanting to come back to this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. What exactly (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You - I don't feel like that there are things that you don't want to talk about or you know what I mean? Or that's - certain things that are off limits in terms of therapeutic politity (sp?) or you know the situation. And I guess that's. When I look back on it I felt like he did a lot but I think that he could have done ... he would have worked - been more lasting and worked or if had I felt then more than I needed to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let - let me just try to clarify something because I have a little trouble (inaudible) how you think which you think you're fairly clear about how you're thinking about what's going on. I'm unclear about how you're feeling. I know we - in every day language we use oh I feel this way when we say I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. No. I know. I mean I think this is how with the occurrence of all my relationships with you know in a way it's how you're feeling. But it was more like I was feeling like ... he would say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's try to stick here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's see if we can make that difference here. [24:05]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reflexes going on gradually (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's ... it feels like a ... it's a worthwhile thing to work on. It feels good in a sense like I said that it's good to work with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And find out how I feel. I think that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're thinking it worked good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think one thing is that my feelings are not - both of you and I think with myself there's something ill defined about my feelings. In other words Rob kept pressing to say well you know if you're mad you don't look mad. If you're you know like this type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do I do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You ask me how I feel. And I don't think you have a preconceived idea of how I should feel in this situation. Or if you do you're willing to see what's going on. Still I felt a little bit with Rob but it was much the - more lucrative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I tend to dwell on things too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So when you think okay maybe I don't have an (inaudible) about how you choose but you're thinking that of you're going to discuss how are you feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm feeling good. I mean if you wanted it simple I'm feeling good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Describe that angle a little bit for me. Because you've done a pretty good job of offending (ph) how you think you (inaudible) idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. Well this is what went on when a lot with Rob and my other reasons. I mean I think this is one of Rob's things that I don't ... well I guess what you're saying and he's saying is that I don't register the way I'm feeling at least in a clear enough way to express it to you. [26:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I meant it to sound you saying that. You saying I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I really - I'm - I feel - I can't find the words for the way I'm feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's like I feel good. I feel metaphorically as if somebody working - doing something that feels good doing it. It reminds you about falling down on the stairs and actually get to the (inaudible). I think it is that's - I feel good about the way we're working. And I think of what's working. And although it's difficult to me to feel that how to try and find the definition for the way that I'm feeling. I don't. And I did with him. I think it's worth or I should or I can't. It really is weird.</p>

<p>It's like ... it's like you're asking somebody about colors who's blind. You know describe what red is like if you're blind. That's a little the way I feel about talking about my feelings. Not so much that I don't have them but I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's odd because I am good with vocabulary. I mean I you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And as you attempted to find a vocabulary, how are you feeling then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's as if you have little blind spots in the air.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I mean. It's like there's nothing there. It's like a void.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A void.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A void.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When I'm trying to bring you back and you're trying to start to talk about Rob or about this or that and I bring you back. Then what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling so detached that it feels like I'm watching somebody else react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is so detached?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My feelings. I feel I'm a little bit irritated. I'm a little bit off - not wanting to deal with this. And those are the kind of things but it's - it's almost like detached like I can't quite make either of these things feel like what's really going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me understand this. Right now you're telling me as we're talking that there's part of you irritated, part of you detached, part of you like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feeling (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanting to avoid?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Having a void not avoid. It's an emptiness. Not avoid a void.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) A blank space. [29:28]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So one is a void. Blank space.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because we don't have kind the vocabulary at this point to point it down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part is irritation. Part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know with working on something that's you know I think the veracity of you working on it. And you feel good about doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you're putting detached. Are you feeling detached from me at this point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling detached as I try and - see that's the thing. It's that I - it feels like I'm trying to ... to find something or see something. That maybe the only way to do it is to look at it from the outside. And that's you know the - that's - maybe if somebody else is feeling the way I do now what would I call it? And the - the irritation of the difficulty in trying to call it something is the - what's going on really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now a few minutes earlier you kind of like was trying to thinking of how sometimes there's this (inaudible) when you know. Like right here as you tell me parts of you there's some hesitation right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you seeing ... I'm pushing you? And this is something you (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it feels like you're doing something that is irritating to me. The way I'm working with a difficult material would be irritating to me. You know it's like that's what I feel like. I because I don't feel like you're doing it to be irritating. You know I mean it's - it is difficult. And it's irritating say for me to figure out what I'm feeling and having to define it.</p>

<p>But if ... in similar things say Susan was acting like this or something that I would feel. I think if she was doing this she's wouldn't - I would feel that she was (inaudible) less than interest. You know that she was ... trying to prove a point. Yeah or sort of like that.</p>

<p>And I don't I think our thing about this is more of a equal kind of relation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's still maybe just safer to say to you what I'm trying to do here. Still part of you is feeling (inaudible) because okay maybe I am like the doctor. And maybe I have a good idea that I just might make us all aware. So in that sense I'm the doctor but the other part thinks like you perceive like this (inaudible) variation between us. Like we're equal here in this expiration. [32:39]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can do that and be the doctor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that part is integrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was. With Rob it was (inaudible) because that's the way we were talking about it. I never really (laughs) got the other side of Rob for the last two appointments but that was fine. That was just (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that make you angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (laughs) It felt very good that he finally started talking about himself. And I was like. I think I was angry during the time. But I thought it was part of the therapeutic process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you gave him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I guess working through the same thing in sort of a similar way with you I'm more critical of the way it's working with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there times when you're pretty critical?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there times when you're pretty critical of me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I think I'm always critical of you in the sense of ... in the sense of sort of why are you doing this? Occasionally say maybe it is the best idea to do things like maybe going off on this might have been helpful. That might have been a criticism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you think that - what you wanted to say was more helpful than the way I pushed you to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you know ... that's part of the ongoing thing. And I think as we talk more it seems sensible. You know I think it's like one of the problems I realized recently that I do have is feeling that I have to (inaudible). It's almost like pleasing and crowning yourself than it is to ... in expressing my feelings. Because they are important in a situation. I have to express them.</p>

<p>And I realize that sometimes in a discussion even though in your mind or I might say this has been the most important thing you could come up with at this moment, it would be more important to listen to somebody else. Just what they're saying. [35:12]</p>

<p>I don't know how I got off on this track but that's - it's something I think I've discovered fairly recently. That what I want to say although relevant it may be the most relevant thing in some ways at the time, it's not always necessary that I say it. I mean I think that was a little bit that time of me going back to this thing or this other thing and this thing.</p>

<p>And somewhere it's different way of thinking. It's happening in this discussion that you want to know if I can see it.</p>

<p>And it's - it's - and I'm thinking it has a sort of reaction. It's sort of where this was coming from with my parents on the vacation and stuff like that. It's funny. You feel something your whole life. And then you learn that it's not so - necessarily so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Now part of what we mentioned is that first you have feeling of you having to be difficult - you're careful when thinking about this person who's really as you share with also pleasing a crowd. How do you think any of those two elements color what was - it seems like now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's the thing of trying to make you happy. I guess that's. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about trying to make me happy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think try - I think it's such a thing I do. I mean it's like that I think it's a good thing to do. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think it's a good thing to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like it's a good thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also a protective thing to do too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Protective. How's (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Starting to think that you'd be mad at me or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you please me I won't get mad at you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if I get mad at you then I (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not difficult. It is the thing that keeps coming up and. I get the fact that I can't think about what might happen off of this incident. It's like being scared of everything or everything that happened or a major disaster. In to the sense that I think I can - I feel that with Susan. And I believe it's - I say to myself you know how bad can it really be?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay but at that intellectual level we can - (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not really that intellectual. (laughs) I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it just starting to like make it more emotional.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You starting to bring it down from here to here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I really am. I think maybe I should but I don't think I am. I don't ... I think life would be better if I brought it down to here the way you put it. I'm not sure that I - that some part of me really want to. It seems that it would be much scarier to do that. And - and part of me says like you know why do you want to feel more pain? [38:44]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bringing it down here to - will bring you more pain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know. Well it's from an intellectual position to do it. I feel like it's a position and it's not a feeling. You know it's not that kind of thing (inaudible) You don't feel good unless you're mad. That's why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you can go super detached from it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess you get detached at a point. You know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like this is a constant struggle for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know you're probably right. It feels like a way of doing things. Because you know I don't think of it as a constant struggle. Because (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you've been there for so long.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But also a constant struggle would mean something like ... I am afraid of being down here. You know the rational part of this is well it's painful why do you want to feel it? But there's another part that ... probably the way we're talking says you're feeling it anyway. You might as well learn how to deal with it. I think that's the bringing it down ... is really.</p>

<p>It sounds as much like what I think you're trying to do is to make me realize that it's there anyway. It's in here. And it's bothering me. But it's not bothering me enough. But intellectual stuff is keeping it - trying to control it.</p>

<p>And when you're talking about how I felt ... when I thought you were angry ... it's that - then it's like a spin out. It's like - it's done to the point fairly reasonably. I'll say you know you're feeling this way. You're not going to feel this way in five minutes. So don't worry about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My anger is going to pass. Don't worry about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean maybe that but also that I'm able to - will be able to deal with that. I won't be as confused in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you see like ... if at that moment what you're feeling is? Here you're sensing that I might be angry. How would it be like to say this is what I'm thinking - I'm feeling right now? To say that to me. [41:27]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know what you're talking about. That's hard to - that's (inaudible). It doesn't seem like the thing I should say or would be use to saying. I mean you're upset. And I say ... you're anger is upsetting me is - would be what I'm feeling. It don't - I don't like ... I know what you're saying in some sense. Because I think maybe with you - with that situation not say the situation with Susan is angering me. I think it's more important than I feel I feel sorry for you in the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Where as here if there's such things that I might be angry but I'm going on that other intuition and that's to bring it out. You know bringing it out sort of thinking about it. What percent of you that it would be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the kind of relationship that we have it can be dealt with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But would you wait for me to be the one to bring it here rather than you say I think it's there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't even think about it. I - it would - it sounds - I would never think of ... saying that. I might think of being angry back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or - yeah. I mean I might like to be able to say well you know as far as I'm concerned you know you weren't here. And I did what I did to kind of figure out where you were. And if you're mad about it I'm sorry but that's - it's nothing that I did. (Inaudible) or something like that. And that would be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that would kind of relieve some feeling of anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At my being angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But and you know. And that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you would also bring it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not what I. No, it seems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would allow me to continue being angry without saying anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you allow yourself to continue to thinking that I'm angry without quite being sure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you would still feel some anger at least possibly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I may be angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think angry is too clear of a word but yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that there's any benefit to another option? [44:12]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it in this situation that it's not as important. I think in other situations similar where it escalates into me getting hopeless or helpless by not dealing with the way you feel, that's when it's important. Then I think rather you are bringing it up or I am bringing it up or we're talking more about the situation and at least I talk more about it. And you might have a little more you know feeling about the situation. But it's leading to the stuff that really bothers me which is ... (inaudible) Susan. But it's not just her though that. This afternoon that one of my students was irritated about something. And [dean master] (ph) doesn't have to submit to being helpless or ... victimized or whatever. It's like all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Evan, I'm sorry I have interrupt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But we have to end. But we.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? This has been this long? (laughs) I thought we just walked in the door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry to interrupt you but what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) forget this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think about this session though? I mean we spent the whole session talking about it. How do you feel or how - what do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't seem like that long. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean in my mind it really seems like - that 10 or 15 minutes into it. But this session I think went very fast. I almost feel uncomfortable being hopeful. Because we haven't gotten far enough in some senses I think it's - we're getting to an area that has to do with problems that I'm having and has to do with the problems I'm having right now. So I'm disappointed but (laughs) (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) the way you feel now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's tough because at the beginning it doesn't seem to be serious until we get into it more. Is that making sense to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worthwhile then. You know it doesn't seem like we're doing - dealing with the most important things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you have something you might think is really important. And in the duration I'm trying to lead you (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little of that. But it's changed because I - you know like you said in the middle of the session what I have in mind isn't always as important as maybe what I was saying with all that's going on. And I think you saying that. There's a mix thing here too. I think too. I mean I in some sense there is a tendency for me to avoid the subject because it's painful. I don't want to deal with it. And there's another more ABD part of it that keeps throwing in these things. So it's a combination. [47:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We definitely (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So when are we doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is the next?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're starting to teach now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm in the office until February.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. February. So you still pretty much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And Wednesday afternoon is the time that I teach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So do you think that for next week 2:45 would work for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll make the time. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll write it down for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like. Not that I know whether that note if I don't throwing it away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would like to have you know that the week of (inaudible) I'm going to be away. So that will be the following week. Now I want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you want to do an early appointment next week and then a later one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was wondering maybe two sessions made just so I could keep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because we're going to be away on Monday too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. You are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So maybe we could meet on this Monday at 12:15?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think on Wednesday at 2:45?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Unless you wanted to push it to Thursday to separate. I don't care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This would work for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. That's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then (inaudible). So I will (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know what (inaudible) for me. Yeah. That I'll tell you but it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't you put that in your calendar?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh Jesus. I have three calendars I think. But then I never come (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not one of my major accomplishments at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right but you were going to try to keep like a schedule or some form.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do try to keep a schedule of some form. That is written on and a matter of fact it's on my wall for the 14th. I'm going to back and - because I did write it on the - I wrote it on my calendar but I wrote it for the 14th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's - I can't wait to see that slip. (laughs) I can't believe I was a day off. It's - I'm curious about the fact that it seems so (inaudible). You know it's the doctor part. It's like the session went so fast. Is that - mean anything in particular to you or are you just? [49:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it would be worthwhile for you to bring it up.</p>

<p>(Inaudible - overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Think about it. If you want to jot anything down maybe that you think. I think it would be worthwhile for you to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To come back to that idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Oh. Okay. I don't think I have any receipts in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Let me get (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are we doing? Every session now but this one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sent you - I sent two of them. I kept two of them. I did the - it was a white one that they sent me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I did the last one of those. But we can talk about it today. I hope soon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no I mean I don't have anything to do with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean I just can't see why - I mean I know I shouldn't got to do the ones that. I have no idea what happened here. You know the four sessions or something like that. That's pathetic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't - I don't mind sitting down and doing them but it wouldn't be filling out the same thing. You know maybe I was - I'll look.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have a Dr. Cabbott available.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't - do you have any questions that you feel with rather than the rest of the project?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're just not that important (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would certainly - wouldn't object to being you know if they thought I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. That I should fill in the ones that you do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. What (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should have had to last one together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could. It could.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have any (inaudible) with me either. It could.</p>

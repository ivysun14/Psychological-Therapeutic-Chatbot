<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like it's been a million years not a week since I saw you for some reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like so much stuff happened this week that I wanted to talk about, but it's like too much to even remember. I feel like right now I'm literally just trying to hold it together because I feel like I'm bipolar about the whole situation, like the whole week has been like being annoyed at things and angry and resolute in one direction and feeling better about things and hopeful, and then in the other direction like in this won't work direction. So we went out on Friday night to dinner, which I thought could be nice maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me plug this in because the battery is going to die.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. [00:00:57] (Pause, static) And I talked before about how he will blame me for stuff or like he's very quick to be snappy about the way that I'm doing things or whatever. So we ran across the street just as the light changed and some guy beeped at us and yelled 'Get out of the street assholes' or whatever, you know. And I was like 'hey, you know, take it easy! Just turn!', you know whatever. And Franklin (sp?) gave him the finger. And then I was like, and then it startled me so I was like, 'sheesh', you know like God I'm with a crazy person, like whatever. He was like, 'Yeah but babe you don't react like that, don't yell after them like I gave him the finger that's what you do, you just show them whatever. You don't show them it affected you'. And I was kind of like, 'well all I said was the light just changed', and he's like, 'yeah but that's not how you do it', or whatever he said. Maybe I'm like, I don't know whatever. [00:01:59] And then I was like, 'okay, sorry', and he was like '(huffs) You don't have to act like everything I say I'm like, like you're a child that I'm scolding'. And I was like, 'well it kind of felt like that'. And he's like, '(inaudible at 00:02:12) well that's your problem. Well that's your fault.' And I was like, 'Okay.' And it like, in the context of that like isolated, maybe it wouldn't feel that bad, but it just was like I literally it made me feel like he was saying it's your fault and I was like yes this entire relationship is my fault, everything that ever has happened is my fault. Like I get it, that's how you feel about it. And then the next day or something (sighs) he was like, said something about 'Oh you should have, you just missed your chance' like to turn or something. And I was like 'Oh sorry'. Because I literally, it's like this response that I have because I don't know how else to respond, like sorry. When I really feel like like being like shut the fuck up! Like just let me fucking drive just because I don't want to fucking race out in the middle of a fucking conversation with you I was looking over this way, mind you own fucking business while you're the passenger and get the fuck out of my way, like shit! And so, but my automatic response instead is just, sorry I just didn't go. [00:03:27] And he's like, 'I'm not trying to tell you how to drive', and I again said, 'Well it feels that way'. 'Well that's your problem', like again the same exact, literally the same exact conversation. I was like what is with you and these 'your faults'? You know?</p>

<p>And then we got into this conversation during the week about stuff and I was basically like, and it's just like every conversation where we try to talk about stuff turns into him talking forever and me like sinking into myself and crying and literally losing the ability to say stuff that I really want to say because I'm nervous about how he'll react or how he'll interpret it or what his response will be. And so then I just clam up and let him say all this shit to me then I end up feeling that everything's my fault. I told him how I felt upset that he wasn't seeming to feel as like 'I'll do anything for you' or whatever anymore, and he got really short about (inaudible at 00:04:24) and he basically said it was because of the conversation that we had a few weeks ago that I kind of touched on with you I think about how I was feeling down on myself and was like 'Oh I understand why you were talking to other women and I'm just so horrible to stand' and whatever. I was like (inaudible at 00:04:41) repeating stuff and he was like, 'Well that—' and I don't know, whatever, I was like, I don't even remember at this point. [00:04:46] </p>

<p>Everything is so emotionally charged and he takes it so literal that it's really difficult to explain to him that sometimes we say things we don't necessarily mean when we're upset, or like we don't know how to say the things that we mean so they come out wrong, or whatever. I don't know how to explain that to him because he literally is like, 'Do I show you the messages? Do you want to see?' I'm like, 'Not really'. And he was basically like, 'Because you said all that stuff', I kind of feel like, I don't even know Ethan. He just, like he basically was talking about all this stuff like, 'Oh and my dentist, how am I going to get to my dentist? I don't have a car'. And, you know, all these things that are drastically affecting my life. But like he's talking about being able to do laundry, and where he's going to work out, and where he's going to stretch, and how he's going to get to places that are far on his bike, like where he's going to store his bike. And all this stuff that he's talking about I'm like this sounds an awful lot like you're more concerned about what this is changing in your life as opposed to what this is, what effect this whole thing has had on our relationship. [00:05:51] And then I brought up (sighs), like a fool, don't forget the reason why this is— Oh no because he had said, 'You could have chose to work it out. You could have chose for us to go to therapy and stayed together. You could have chose for us to, there are a million options you could have chose other than what you did, but this is what you chose so this is what's happening and I'm not promising how I'm going to feel once we're not living together.' And I was like, 'Are you forgetting why I made this decision and why this is happening?' And then he gets on, 'That has nothing to do with it'! He was like, 'That has nothing to do with the situation now.' And I was like, 'It has everything to do with the situation now you fucking moron.' And then he keeps saying that he doesn't want to keep talking about the past, he doesn't want me to keep reliving it. </p>

<p>Okay so you're not going to talk about this in therapy whenever you go in to therapy? I'm sure, like I'm sure he's not even going to fucking touch on this. Like, 'So the reason I'm here is because this happened and I did something foolish.' No, it's going to be like, 'Oh well—' Like he creates these, like he's created this alternate scenario in his head I think. Like even in a message I saw between him and this girl that he's been friends with for awhile, which I wasn't even sure if I should feel uncomfortable with the fact that she said hey baby, and he was like, hey love. [00:06:59] Like they've known each other forever, their parents were friends, but they're not that good friends anymore, and maybe that's just the way they talk. But I was like, uhh, like I don't really know if I should feel uncomfortable with this or not. I kind of do, I don't, even if I were friends with guys for a long time I, and I think, whatever. So there's that even and it's just like another added component of this, like what fuck. I don't know if I want to be with somebody who's done this or whatever. He was saying to her something about 'Oh no, I wouldn't have been very good company, like I'm not talking to Tim anymore and me and Trina are separating for a while because we have some things to work out'. And she said, 'Oh no, what's going on with you and Trina?' I read these without him knowing. And he said, 'We're having communication issues'. And I was like, are we? But okay, obviously you're embarrassed to say the real reason, but that was like, there's evasive in terms of not saying the real reason and then there's just plain I'm going to make up a reason. Like yeah we don't have communication issues, but we've had those for three years, that's not the reason why we're separating. [00:08:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he's communicating with other women.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So if you want to say that Franklin (sp?) then okay, you're just kind of leaving a couple words out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah normally in that case like, (pause, static) yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's been all that. Then we went on Wednesday because he was going to— And also just like feeling overwhelmed with everything and suffocated and sad but angry. The way he's handling this is just really fucking retarded. He's literally turned it into what he needs to do for him and how, again I got so mad at him. Like he's talking about how this is going to affect him. I'm like, 'I'm really glad to know that your major concerns about us not living together involve the access to my car, the access to the washer/dryer I bought and the fact that I do your laundry, among other things that have to do with conveniences that are by my grace that he has in his life. So that didn't feel really good, you know. [00:09:14] (Pause, sigh) So on Wednesday night we were supposed to move some stuff into the room. The guy hadn't moved out of the room to the other room yet so instead we just went over there, measured the space, turned out he guy's going to see him his bed frame which is good, and his drawers, and whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we went, and we went to a carpet warehouse store whatever, it's like a building (inaudible at 00:09:38) kind of place and I got a carpet remnant for my room because I've never had a carpet in there and I wanted one, and we got some other stuff that he wanted and whatever. And after that honestly both of us started to feel a little bit better about the whole move thing just because we were able to go and talk about the space and I helped him with that, whatever. And things are feeling like, we're feeling a little bit like better, we're going to try to move some stuff tonight and then do the rest tomorrow morning. [00:10:05] Then I started to again feel panicked because I just, I don't know— Well and he's talking about how he just wants to work everything out and yeah I want to try (inaudible at 00:10:14) and I was feeling positive about it. But then I'm just feeling worried about, he's talking about he's scared about how he's going to feel and feeling lonely and I was like, 'Yeah me too', but I don't really know what to say to him, like suck it up is kind of how I feel about it. And no I'm not going to forget about the fucking reason why this happened, and no I can't stop the images of and questions that are around you and no longer having spoken, like no I can't just turn that off. Maybe you can because you're in denial about your own fucked up life, but I can't. So sorry, no. And how inconvenient can it be to schedule a therapist? He can only do it on weekends because he's so fucking busy. If you want to go to therapy you make fucking time for it, I'm sorry. [00:10:55] If it's something that matters and it's important to you then you just fucking make time because it's helpful.</p>

<p>And so whatever, we're going to be doing the moving, but I already feel panicky because he was like, 'Oh I wish the whole world didn't know about this'. You know because I told him my mom was going to come over on Sunday to spend time with me and help me organize and stuff, and he's like, 'I wanted to do that with you'. That's not the point, you're missing the fucking point then. I'm going to reorganize the house because I'm going to be living there now and I don't have to deal with you saying, 'no that can't go there. That shouldn't go there. Let's put that there. Why are you doing that?' And then he's talking about wanting to do a photo shoot of me this weekend and wanting to do all this stuff are we going to— And it, and I'm already panicking about how I'm not even going to feel like I have time and I'm still going to be worried about fucking taking care of all his shit all the time and worrying about if he has plans or if he wants to hang out or hurting his feelings if I can't hang out. (Sighs) So I just literally feel like I'm just trying to hold myself together, like in one piece and not be, go absolutely mad. Because I (pause) I just don't know how to explain to him that like yeah it's sad, but I want you to stay there tomorrow night in your new apartment and Sunday night and Monday night. And maybe we can hang out, but I don't want to stay with you in the same room for the next few days, or week or two. [00:12:18] And I don't know how to get that through to his head. And I think honestly, honestly at this point I almost feel like the reason he's clinging to it like this and being all like this is because he really does not want to lose probably the best thing that's ever going to happen to him. In terms of relationship-wise, I'm sorry to say. But for me that obviously feels extremely selfish and frustrating and like give me my fucking space. You fucked up not me, so give me my space. </p>

<p>And he blames me about everything and last night we got in an argument because he got annoyed that I wanted to make sure the cat who's the stray that the neighbor lets inside sometimes and takes care of, like he either got outside or inside because he was in the hallway and I didn't want him to pee in the hallway because that happened a couple weeks ago. And he's literally like, 'Who cares? What are you adding another thing to stress about?' And I'm like, 'I actually wasn't' stressing about it, I was just going to take care of it', like get the fuck off my back. And it just felt, again, like blaming me for everything, I overdo everything, everything is my fault, and shut the fuck up and leave me alone. [00:13:20] Sorry, I just really had to get all of that out. It's been like a whole week of this piling up in my brain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Why are you apologizing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because I just went on a rampage (chuckles). (Pause) And because I've been apologizing all week. Probably? I mean (pause) that's what it feels like almost, like I've been (inaudible at 00:14:19), oh okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just because I don't know how else to, like I don't want to argue against it. I don't want to say he's right so I've just been like, 'Oh yeah, okay sorry'. Well then also I've been like, 'Oh yeah you're right (inaudible at 00:14:13). Because I just don't feel like dealing with it anymore. [00:14:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, client sighs) Umm (pause) what I'm trying to think through is how on one hand (pause). [00:16:25] Well it sounds like (pause) you're mad at him because you're really having to take responsibility for everything in the relationship and not just, you know, financial things or logistical things or, very acute about it and say like you're having to take responsibility for all the dirty laundry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, whether it's (pause) things that make his mood happen, or with like to get the emotional air time, or (pause) with the one who sort of (pause) has to keep the whole picture in her head? It sounds like there are times he feels that, other times where he's kind of acting like this isn't a big deal emotionally? [00:17:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And even worse, not just that it's not a big deal emotionally but that whatever emotional side there is to it is essentially my fault because I made the decision to have him move out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And you're the one who has to sort of, kind of keep in mind the whole picture of how you're both angry and feel wronged. But it's also really sad and it's really unfortunate. And whereas he gets to kind of react to whatever one of those things he might be feeling at the moment</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: whatever way. And (pause) you seem to be working pretty hard to take care of him and at the same time getting pretty mad about it. [00:18:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like the saddest part is like I'm working hard at taking care of him so that I won't like, I almost feel like it's like I want to take care of the stuff that has to do with him moving out because I want him to move out so badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you're taking care of him in a lot of other ways than that. I mean</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: you're not arguing, it doesn't occur to you to push back in the moment, you're the only one feeling bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well and he's feeling bad too, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling bad when it comes to telling him, you know, to sleep there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. You know, it sucks. Like and I'm not really, and it's not only that I'm not pushing back, because I just don't want to deal with the issues that result from that in terms of how he reacts, but it's also almost like when he gets to ranting about whatever he wants to talk about I literally lose the ability to think coherently because I'm so floored by him being so ridiculously self-involved. [00:20:05] And even last night about, like he makes it all about him, like I'm just trying to help you and not stress more and you're yelling at me about the fucking cat! I was like, 'I wasn't stressing about it', he's like, 'We were carrying stuff up, it was one more thing you were adding.' Like I wasn't worried I just wanted to take care of it, like why do you care? And he gets all excited and talks with his hands—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not really the issue. I mean, (pause) I think something closer to what you're thinking in that moment is like shut the fuck up, stop being a douchebag.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! That is exactly what it is!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you kind of play along and defend yourself about the cat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But what's the alternative? Saying shut the fuck up douchebag? (Laughs) I mean I don't want to go there. I mean yeah I'm feeling angry right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? [00:21:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's mean! Like I wouldn't want him to say shut up bitch. Evil I guess, you know? Or maybe it's not, maybe I could have said you're being a douchebag. I feel like that would feel better, like saying you're being a bitch than like you're a bitch, I guess and so I don't. And it doesn't occur to me because it's fighting words and he gets really worked up and he wouldn't be able to say let's just drop it. Like he even said let's drop this and I was like okay let's drop this, and then he's like no. It just really bothers me that that's the way you react when I'm just trying to help you. Like you just said to drop it, but okay like let's continue. And then he gets again all excitable and talking with his hands. And I'll literally get turned, like this week I've been getting turned around in my head and I've had moments of like maybe this is all my fault, maybe I am a bitch, maybe I do just act like a bad girlfriend and not like. Literally I went there this week! [00:22:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! But then I literally have to shake myself and I'm like, 'No you're ridiculous Trina, you've done nothing wrong besides react how you needed to react to him being a fucking ridiculous crazy person'. And I think the biggest thing about all of this is like, is like all these things that I kind of push down in terms of like things to compromise on and what not to compromise that I talked to you about before but kind of was like well we can work it out, have now become like I don't want to fucking deal with this. Like this is not what I want in a relationship and I don't think this is ever going to change. So like I just need you to leave, have a little space, and see what happens. Yeah I'd like to hope that this can work out, but there have been so many things that have happened the last month of dealing with this that it's really just made me feel like even if I could trust him again maybe it's not even worth it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, again, I just, he literally can't help being himself, like turning everything around on me, like not taking the, you know, emotional responsibility that he should be, not even allowing me to be sad about what happened. To him it's just like you're dwelling on the past. And I'm like, I literally I was like, 'It happened a month ago. (Pause) Like it happened a month', he's like, 'Yeah. That's the past. We're moving past that now'. It's like, okay maybe you are because you're the one that's moved past it a thousand other times with the other fucking girls that you've talked to. That's how he makes me feel, like that I have to move past it and I don't need somebody telling me I can't. And literally it's led me to believe he's not, like there's nothing in therapy that he's going to talk about that has anything to do with why he did it, what led him to do it, how he's not going to do it again. He's not even going to probably mention it. [00:24:13] They're like, 'So why is this happening?' 'Well me and my girlfriend just, we had some issues, I wasn't feeling attractive.' </p>

<p>He even checked my phone and questioned a message that I had with this guy that I know that I've talked to before and he's had an issue with me talking to him before and I explained that he's met him before, we've known through a friend. Where I was like offering to set him up with, he does also we had talked about (inaudible at 00:24:39) before. My friend Amanda does dance, she's really cute, she recently broke up with her boyfriend but they're back together, which I didn't know at the time. And I sent him a message saying, 'Oh that girl Amanda I had mentioned, you know, that if you wanted to meet or whatever, like you're already Facebook friends with her, haha just (inaudible at 00:24:58) whatever.' And Franklin (sp?) was like, 'Well I checked your messages', and I was like, 'Okay did you find anything?' And he says, 'Well no. Well one thing.' And I was like, 'Okay?' And he's like, 'What makes you think this guy needs help finding a girlfriend?' And I was like, 'Eh nothing, I just figured they're both single, like whatever, I don't know. Like we talked about dancing, I don't know, I was bored, whatever.' [00:25:23] He's like, 'I just think it's weird. It's just weird. You don't send that kind of message it's just weird.' And then I literally had to be like, 'Yeah it was so weird every time I found messages with random girls on your phone. That was also weird.' And of course he's like, 'That has nothing, it's not the same at all.' I was like, 'Okay. Sure it's not.' Just everything has turned into like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe some of what, like you're so overflowing with being annoyed at him, which it sounds like you're pretty annoyed</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: with him, it's really bugging you, the way you feel with him (chuckles). I wonder if it's actually because (pause) you don't actually say, I think you usually don't even actually think a lot of what you're really feeling in response to what he says? I mean the thing about the past, you sort of did it again there where he says, 'we're moving past that' and you said, 'well it's a month ago. You know that's not that long ago'. 'Well yeah I know, that was a while ago and we've moved past it.' [00:26:37] And yeah yeah, it's sort of him evading responsibility for what he did, but (pause) I would imagine you think he's just being entirely ridiculous. Like this is complete bullshit and that, in a way, he's being a jerk to try to make it like he didn't do something terrible (inaudible at 00:27:04) you, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's either completely bonkers, like disillusioned human, or he is just doing this because, because he's a jerk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think it feels like, yeah sort of like you're being attacked or set up in a moment like that. And I think you feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it makes you mad. But I think one of the reasons why the anger really stays with you or you feel kind of really stuck with it is because you don't respond that way or see it happening that way. I mean, the way you describe it is like you see him as being really annoying or saying something like that that seems just kind of like a ridiculous thing to say, but there's something about the way that it is kind of his disavowing how badly you felt treated</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:28:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: which is really sort of, that's much more direct and mean to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which (pause) I think is what's got you so angry, but then it doesn't seem to me like you tend to see that way? I might be missing something. But it's sort of like he's kind of, in this sense, insulting you all the time, you're not quite seeing it that way, but you're feeling really mad because you're feeling really insulted all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well here's the thing, I do see it that way. I literally take everything of what he's doing as a personal offense. Like I'm personally offended by the fact that you've turned this entire situation into how much it's going to inconvenience you, and how sad you're going to be not to have your home, and how the reason doesn't matter, it's just what's going to happen now. I take that as a personal offense because it's literally like it doesn't matter that I was talking to this girl and it really hurt you because I said I'm sorry and I'm never going to do it again. And now I just have to, we just have to move forward. So I absolutely do. [00:29:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The issue that I think that you're picking up on is that I don't say this to him at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because literally I know him way too well to that it will not go anywhere besides into another conversation that ends with him blaming me in some way for feeling that way, or for telling him that, or for hurting his feelings for telling him that when it's not really true, and this is why it's not true and why I shouldn't feel like this. And (pause)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is going to sound more directed than I mean it to be, and why are you spending so much time with him even when you don't have to? When this is, I think, so much of what's going on? Like I'm not telling you not to spend time with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes me wonder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's because, I think it's because I feel trapped, like I feel suffocated by him, I feel smothered, I feel like he takes everything so personally in terms of like me going out and stuff, like when we were going through this. I don't even know Ethan, I don't even know. But I guess I felt like, just like don't rock the boat, like rock the boat as little as possible for this next week because he's moving out and then you're going to have more freedom and space and whatever. [00:30:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he wants to stay over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he wants to spend all this time together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And so now I'm like, okay am I digging my own grave? Where do, how do I draw the line? I think what's going to end up having to happen is I'm just going to have to, if I'm like, if I, like we're usually, he'll like if I say something like, 'Oh but I'm going to go do this instead' or whatever, he'll go, 'Okay but I wanted to spend time'. And then I'm like, "Oh. Oh well I'll figure something out', you know? And like instead of going there I just have to drop that whole thing and just not respond to his like, 'Oh, okay'.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, like you wind up feeling bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not wanting to deal with the guilt later, not wanting him, because he will. And I think a lot of how he responds to my being less like, 'Oh but how does it make you feel?', less care taking, less motherlike, less all of this stuff that I always do for him, that maybe that will be telling also in and of itself in terms of how he reacts to that. If he hold on to it and holds a grudge, or if he realizes this isn't how normal relationships are and people do other stuff. [00:31:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, say that one more time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if he'll hold a grudge if, instead of usually when he's telling me, 'Oh but I wanted to do this' and I change my plans for him, that I don't do that anymore. And it's like, not like I'm being a bitch, but just sticking to my word like if I tell him I'm doing this even if he's upset about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me get this straight, (pause) you're saying first with (pause), you know, (pause), you seem still pretty concerned about what he thinks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And worried about hurting him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause), yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I think what I'm trying to do is move to a place where I'm more worried about myself and not as much him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just said, well you know I'm going to stop saying this kind of stuff and then see if he holds a grudge or not. [00:32:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think that if he does it's like that tells me something though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else do you need to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. Yeah yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess right there you're saying, 'Well I'm going to sort of put my foot down, but then I'm going to see if he's okay with it.' Or, 'Then I'm going to see if he reacts badly because then I'll really know'.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I know. Yeah. I think it's a lot of not knowing what to expect, but really wanting to like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you don't know about what to expect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. How I'm going to feel, I think. I don't know how I'm going to feel about stuff, I think that's the general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You worried about being sad and lonely?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. But like, still I was saying last week and I still feel that I'm not as worried about being sad and lonely as I am excited about—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah, I wonder why you're so concerned then about how he's going to react or feeling as thought there are things you need to know when— [00:33:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Because I feel like he'll use it as a tool. I could envision him, me doing whatever I'm doing,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: him having to deal with the consequences of whatever's going on and make his own life outside of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could envision him taking that and saying, 'Well this is the reason why I didn't want to do this and why I'm not feeling like this is not going to work out, because I haven't really gotten to see you now I'm lonely and I've been having other thoughts while I'm alone', and so I can see that happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're worried he's going to leave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I'm not worried, well no because I'm already like leaving him, like kind of. But I guess I'm worried about him turning this around on me. 'You're the reason why we broke up Trina, not me, in the end.'</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. What difference does that make?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess no difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well apparently some difference. I mean I guess now badgering you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know I know. But, well it does because it's not my, it's his fault and, I mean it's not my fault, it is his fault. [00:34:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah if he wants to make this your fault, good luck. I mean—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he can do it in his head, but I'm always in another truth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but apparently I guess what's in his head matters to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause), maybe that's part of what you've been telling me the whole session so far is you're incredible frustrated at not being able (laughs), not being in control over how he sees things or (both laugh) to keep him from really, or at least from your point of view, really twisting things around and making you the bad guy. And you're continuing to work really hard to try to have some control over his doing that in the future, although you're telling me that's what he's doing all over the place now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:36:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess maybe that's what's really bothering you is that (pause) it's like a, you know, a regime where the government's in control of the newspapers</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and they just print whatever the fuck they want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're, that's really bothering you that he can say whatever story he wants and make you out to be as bad or as responsible for things as he wants and you don't have any control over that's really frustrating you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, and in addition to that, and a part of that, he sometimes makes me even feel confused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like maybe it is my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and it's unclear why that happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's probably quite important, not (pause), I don't mean necessarily in this relationship but in general that somehow he can cause you to change your viewpoint so much like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Yeah, yeah thank you. Interesting. So alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care Trina.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk to you next week, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome.</p>

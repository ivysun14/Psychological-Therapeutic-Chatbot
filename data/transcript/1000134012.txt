<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 15, client (unintelligible) December 7.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you realize that 30 years ago today...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were born?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah. yes, yes, yes. I thought of that. As a matter of fact I didn't (unintelligible). I had a boyfriend born on December 7 (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of 1941?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it was a couple years later.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm younger than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My husband...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have such emotional maturity, that's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. My husband is 29. But I'm a mere 25 on him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're 25?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be 26 in (unintelligible). There was this big debate about whether or not I'm three or four years younger than he is. I keep saying four and he keeps saying, oh you are (0:01:01.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well here we are. And where did we leave off last time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh gosh, (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Of course I do. I was railing about - oh I was saying how much I enjoyed my, you know, whether I was being green or whether I was being - the reading of America or whether I was going to be encased in my gray flannel suit (chuckling). For every gray flannel suit there's a person seeking to get out. Yeah, well, I didn't - I had come to the conclusion that I probably do enjoy (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Enjoy your confusion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a big step.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If there was any identity that I have I think that's probably the one that I've seized a plan is that I am he who is confused (chuckling). And I am he who is a - he would be, not hippie exactly. Who would be Renaissance, well, I don't know. Something other than what I am apparently, whatever that might be (0:02:15.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try a little bit more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I am he who is - I guess in those terms just more fully human. Reaching for the - no. Something on the other arena.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A man who is caught between wanting that and not knowing how or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like - something along those lines, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Liking his gray flannel suit but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really dislike it this evening though. Much travail. We're being - you probably - did you read The Times today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I never read The Times (0:03:05.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) You ought to see how (unintelligible) you know we're being sued and there's much...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your business?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not me personally but the company is about to be sued and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know that 63rd Street project that (unintelligible)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The TWL project at 63rd, between 60th and 63rd?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know what it looks like, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we financed that and it's - shoooo. About a year after it was completed, taken a big dive. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's taking a big dive...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Financially it's going broke. They can't meet their debt (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And a lot of other things too. So that - well that business, and the guy, the head of FHA is sicking the FBI into the thing and it's going to be a little dandy. And (0:04:00.0)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do they think there's (unintelligible) of some kind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I hope so - they're convinced there is. And there - really we're not centrally involved because it's a (unintelligible). Our involvement was peripheral. They're talking about the people who manage it being probably at least incompetent conceivably. So incompetent as to be, you know, somewhat criminally involved. And that's been something to talk about. But anyway I've just been so happy with my gray flannels (unintelligible). But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like your gray flannel is getting a little spattered with blood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, little spattered with blood. And the normal frustrations of trying to build something up with, you know, other clients and things that don't pan out exactly the way I thought they would. I'm really in a little bit of a crisis in that regard. So I've decided I'm going to maybe (unintelligible). But, you know, I'm taking steps to see if there - if I can get a job somewhere else and some of those things. So I just, a little bit of turmoil overall. You know, you really go through these agonies of judgment, I coached a guy about this job and I'm really wondering whether I did it the right way or not. And you can agonize and agonize over it but finally you just have to convince yourself, well that's the way you did it. You know, if that's going to be what you display there with bad judgment then that's it. Because there was no other way to, you know, really that I could have done it. Maybe with a little bit more finesse than I did. But what I'm speaking of specifically is that I asked a guy who works in a clothing store whom I know, kind of a fancy men's clothing store off the north side who's following the mortgage business to contact one of his old associates which has left a major firm and started a firm of his own. And the guy has got a good - very good reputation and I think he left his other firm because he wasn't getting enough money. And he thinks that ownership is better than wage slavery (0:05:59.2).</p>

<p>So I just, and I know this fellow at the store who's a (unintelligible) fairly well and - because he's going out with my sister. In fact he broke - he separated from his wife because he's going out with my sister.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who is also married.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who is divorced but with four children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear - oh, that's a different one. That's a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a different one. (unintelligible) But yeah, no, that's an older sister. So anyway this was back when I did my calls for everyone. I walked into his office and we chatted for a moment and I said - he said, how's business? And I said, I was just walking away, I had it in my mind the first time I walked in to talk to him. But I was just walking away and I said, great, great. And I said by the way, about this guy so and so, you know, if you need anything else (unintelligible). And so he got a little flustered, you know, and said well, you know, he said well I can call him right now, let you talk to him right now. I said, that's not what I want to do. I'd rather have you mention to him that you know a fellow who will remain nameless perhaps at first instant who is looking around for him today (0:06:58.5).</p>

<p>And he was, as I said he was off balance, very much off balance. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I can understand why. You - he said how's business and you said oh, fine, fine. And then oh by the way I'm...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's exactly what I did. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean you're speaking out both sides of your mouth. You're saying it's great and gee, I want to get another job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, no, no, I'm not speaking out of both sides of my mouth because business is good. But I - what I was saying to him was that I'm number two where business is good and I'd rather be number one when the business is good because then you'd pay me more money. So I wasn't speaking out of both sides of my mouth but what he was off balance about was that I, you know, a casual remark that was supposed to be lightly taken and then I mentioned to him in the quintessence of casual manner, you know, by the by I'm looking for a new job. And I said that I preferred he didn't mention my name initially. So I said oh, I see, I understand. Well, I said okay and we'll talk about it for a few minutes. Then he said, okay, I'll talk to the guy. He's supposed to come into the store this week. And - the next day or something (0:08:06.4).</p>

<p>And so then I left it at that pretty much. (unintelligible) But what I was thinking of when I initially thought about it, I was thinking what I really should do is chat with the guy and say listen, what are you doing for lunch? Let's go over here and go to Howard Johnson and get a hamburger and then talk to him. You know, give him a little more prep. And as I walked out that day I thought, I blew it. I didn't do what I was really thinking I was going to do. But those are, you know, those are the kinds of things that you go through. And you go through that on almost every...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I go...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Deal you're in. That you're dealing - that you're working in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're thinking...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. (unintelligible) you know, then I blow the pitch there. Because as I say, the politics of these things are pretty important and how you present yourself. So (0:08:57.2)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that it's pretty important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. At least - at the very least it's important to me and probably it's important to other people. But that's perhaps - I went through more of a - I agonize a little bit more than other people would. But so, you know, you're chewing on your fingernail wondering if you did the right thing on that. And I don't know. But I don't really need to feel too upset about that one way or another because it really is just a flier. And I'm not that wildly unhappy where I'm at. And this is a new firm, brand new firm, and it may be that I don't even want to go with it because in an established one (unintelligible) business it would justify it. In other words they might be a firm that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're not sure...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Flow along for a year and then go right down the tube. So there's no reason for me to get real upset. My attitude will be if the guy wants to contact me, you know, let's talk. So I'm interested and I'd like to be number one and run my own show. And then I'd investigate him, I suppose as he'd investigate me (unintelligible). So we'll see how that turns out. But those are the kinds of, you know, emotional dipsy doodles you go through when you're - at least when I'm in this business and talking to people. You don't always - or I always feel like (0:10:19.6)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) new job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that and just talking to people about particular business deal, you know, worrying about, do I have to call him or is he going to call me. You really get - you go to (unintelligible) on there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You go to - I go to (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I go to (unintelligible). And it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it seems like you've mentioned that before, that probably call and got you back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it is, it is. I don't know whether it should be or not. But I guess I'm so aware of my secondary status there as a partner that every little evidence of it that other people understand from the outside too disturbs me and galls me. It makes me angry. I don't like people to - when I call them to call me - not call me back at all. Sometimes I have to call them again. Or to, you know, the goofy things is all I want. I'd rather have them take me more seriously than that. Because that's important in the business. And it's important really for this reason because when you are talking about, you know, there are a lot of people that can run around and say a lot of things, you know. But when you're talking to a person, a developer and you're saying I can get you X dollars and you're telling them these things, I mean you've got to be thinking a major project by what you say. If he doesn't take up pretty seriously and give you evidence of his respect in front of the work, that makes it very much difficult. That means that you, your function isn't credible, you know, in a literal way. Literal meaning of the word. To him it means he doesn't really believe what you're telling him. And he always wants to talk to somebody above you because he just doesn't think of you, that you can deliver what you say (0:12:15.0).</p>

<p>And then to try and buttress that deal and then you deal with a fellow and (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say I deal with that fellow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: General, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was dealing with a fellow the other day and talking to him, and then he ended up having his secretary call up and say, well so-and-so asked me to call and ask you the following little vague [ph] question, you know. And I don't know, that just really had - that bothers me. It's as though, well let's have Doris call this guy over here, his number is so and so and find out about this thing. And then - because I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) (0:12:52.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I either don't have the time or I'm not inclined to give - the fellow's not important enough to me to afford the courtesy of my telephoning myself. And that's the kind of thoughts that go through my head. And evidence of that, you know, really bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another possible way that you could take that though is that - and I, because, you know, that would be an easy thing to think, I'm not (unintelligible) something. So but another way is that he didn't want to bother you with those little questions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that may be. (chuckling) You're really adroit at that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Adroit at what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At turning around a bit. Yeah, that might be. Maybe, I don't know, maybe that's it, maybe just enjoy the going through these kind of things so much that I can't consider the alternative as (unintelligible) question, if he himself doesn't care to stay active. So that might be. I hope that's so. By and large I don't think it - I'm not sure that it is. I don't want to say it's not but I'm not sure that that's it (0:14:04.7).</p>

<p>And one of the motivations for wanting to get my own little pod is the opportunity to, you know, increase your personal - my personal authority in the business. Where I'm not dealing with oh, there's somebody over my head and they - everyone else thinks really they've got the answer. You know?</p>

<p>So that's a chief - that's one of the motivations in terms of personal satisfaction. The other is that you can make a lot more money on that end of it. So I'm going to start (unintelligible). So that - I guess those are - that's a kind of thing I'm thinking about right now. You know, it's funny how strongly those things affect me too in some of these - not just those but, you know, any emotionally unpleasant situation. I'll find sometimes, and I've done this really unconsciously at the office or walking down the street, all of a sudden I'll be walking along and I'll think of some unpleasant situation or some situation where I think I made a fool of myself or something was bad, and I absolutely recoil. You know, I grimace, or whatever that word is and sort of start and I'll go like that. And it's a little alarming because it's unconscious and all of a sudden, you know, you don't realize you're going to do it (0:15:38.0)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until after you've done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if anybody ever sees me doing it it must be sort of, you know, funny, my appearance. But that's not, I'm sure that's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it would be alarming to the extent that somebody's even aware of it. And to have it be so visible (0:16:02.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah, very definitely, yeah. It - I think of something that my boss did once though in a similar line who was - my boss is absolutely Mr. Cool, you know, in terms of, not a neat guy but in terms of the way he deals with his customers. He's very, very smooth with them in many respects. And great, very kind of a sleek sales pitch he does with them. Plus, obviously being very confident and that's part of his confidence is the way he handles them. But I - in any event I saw him once doing the very same thing. Someone put a phone call on his desk and just, it pleased me because it shows that he has some anxieties too because he reached for the little phone message and went, like that like he was really afraid he forgot to do something (unintelligible) (0:17:00.7).</p>

<p>What amused me about it is that he's such a, kind of a, you know, type of guy...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very, very contained in many respects.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's reassuring to see that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, that even Mr. Cool was - is worried about is he doing right all the time, you know. And the other thing of why I'm sort of all at sea [ph] about, you know, how I'm doing and what I'm doing is a number of things have come to, you know, crisis or fallen apart since things had started in the early autumn. There's a large property in Scriptsville that looks like it's going to blow up. And there are two (unintelligible) that look like they're blowing up and that's one of the guys that won't even do me the courtesy of returning a phone call.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean blow up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it looks like they're going to fall through. They're not going to go, they're not going to work. And I've staked a lot, you know, emotionally and calculating how I was doing on the possibility and the probability of one, some or all of those working out (0:18:10.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it looks like there's going to be some trouble (unintelligible). Because they may not work out at all. So those things have gotten me a little discouraged at this point. So, but I don't know. There's not much that you and I can talk about in that connection here. Except I suppose the fact that - the continually taking a negative view of it rather than trying to turn it around into something more positive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you saying? Just that we could note that that's what you're doing with it, that you're...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jumping to negative conclusions? Sounds like you've already made that jump.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, yeah I really have. In that respect it was - (unintelligible) just from a utilitarian standpoint it'd be a lot better to have a more positive view of those things to figure out some way that I can always come out on top. We've talked to this before, it's a little bit of a broken record but it never ceases to amaze me the way at least their little conversations other people that I am in contact with are able to do precisely that. Turn a situation that would in my mind if it happened to me (unintelligible) seriously to (unintelligible) you know, in order to present it in some light that shows them to be favorably viewed in some aspect. I have a habitual tendency I think too even when I'm telling stories (unintelligible) thinking about them, conversing with them with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aren't you afraid of that Kleenex going to some...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you don't have a wastebasket (0:19:54.0)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you just lay it alongside of this wastebasket (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of, you know, even telling stories about myself that come out somehow in a negative aspect, inviting people to laugh at me or my plight or, oh well look what a goof I made of myself and that. I mean they're funny, of course I do laugh because (unintelligible) but it really isn't that funny at all considering...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part was you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the sum total of that for this is really to make a mockery of my own efforts as much as possible. In a way that can be an endearing quality in some people because you sort of like them because they're so non-competitive and you might say (unintelligible) sense of humor and they laugh at themselves with someone. But when it's carried to the extreme and I carry it I think that something more than that, you know, (unintelligible). So - and I think we talked about that last week, the way, you know, the way that I seem to insist upon or other people do at least (unintelligible) in a way what you talked about with the self image, the negative self image, you know, just being something that can play off of and rebound their own shots (0:21:14.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure it's getting incredibly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know, again we're at the point where I'm at - I'm not sure what I feel about that. Probably not very much. I seem to have, at least for my own satisfaction, zeroed in on the problem to a good extent. And one of the things is that I might be able to do just in my - am I rambling on (0:21:55.4)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to stop you a minute here and say okay, is there - could you just say I (unintelligible) of what you've zeroed in on, what you now see as the problem?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I said it explicitly. It's shorter...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you said a lot of things...</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said a lot of things and I'm curious well, what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in shorter terms the problem is that I have a, you know, negative idea of myself. And one that I am playing out and insisting on - I can see my role (unintelligible) insisting on playing that out with predictable results. So that being the problem the question is how do you come either to an understanding with that which is probably the way to really do it is just to understand it and try and work with it and consider this a part of you and won't be annihilated by any act of will necessarily. Either how do you understand it or overcome it (0:23:02.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How about a third possibility which is understand it, accept it, but also work on changing it. Because I really think it is possible to change it. But I don't think - but I think the way to change it best is to say okay, this is the way I'm being and that's okay too. Because you're not such an awful person given this. And work with that as a given now and have that be okay and it'll be easier to change it, or somewhat will be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that's right and I understand this. Just to elaborate it even further...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe this is again, is not (unintelligible) meet what we want to do here. But, you know, in many ways you were talking - we talked last week about the business of a particular lifestyle, you know, for lack of a better word we called it the gray flannel Notre Dame syndrome and how that in many respects (unintelligible). I don't know that I was able last time to - and maybe I did, to say why it's attractive to me too at the same time (0:24:25.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to comment on one other thing. I think part of the reason I moved over to you is because you're not looking at me hardly at all and I'm wondering what that's about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're talking about yourself. Do you want me to hear this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible) go out the door. Feels very foolish if I was sitting in the room...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd feel very foolish indeed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes (0:24:55.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do that when I'm drunk but I'd much - when I'm sober I'd feel like a fool I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But what I'm saying is you can (unintelligible) just whenever you talk to me. And so it's to the clock.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's going to change what I'm going to say though I'm afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't - I - for the better or worse?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I'm afraid if I talk to you I might censor it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh. That surprises me. Okay. Well I'd like to hear the uncensored version but I'd also like to be a part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, a little (unintelligible) the Boston version. (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You hadn't told me. Let's - can I open this just for a minute? It's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go two hours with cigarette smoke in here (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why don't we open this one? There's a little (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, let's do that. I have a little bit of a problem with (unintelligible) (0:26:06.6)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now if you open the door it'll really carry it (unintelligible). I'm going to breathe the ozone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Breathe the ozone I said. It's slightly contaminated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's - are you responding to my book last week or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, I said ozone not ordone [ph].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yes, okay. I just didn't hear it right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I talk to myself a lot I guess. I stand around and make quips that don't (chuckling) (unintelligible). I wanted to play (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feels better to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to leave that one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay if you hear anybody coming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Close the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Close the door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mind your business. Get out of here (0:27:02.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) therapy and I do have a client after you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You do have a client?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Well I think what I was saying was one of the problems with, you know, with this conflict that I have with the two say, you know, different lifestyles is that the one in many respects, the Notre Dame gray flannel syndrome, number it represents, you know, success somehow in conventional terms. Just - which is easiest to understand. The other part of it is that it represents in a certain way a normal lifestyle, you know, that is something to be achieved. And that's connected I think in my own mind with the sexual aspect of my difficulty (0:28:06.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So in a certain way that kind of lifestyle is a kind of a virility, a totem of normal, you know, virile sexuality. You know, as well as the other thing. And that's pretty well firmly implanted. You know, the one definitely in some way equals the other. That is to say the one being the rah-rah, the gray flannel aspect of it equaling, you know, sexual success.</p>

<p>And the other conversely I think in my own mind represents giving up, that - well certainly it represents giving up that idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Giving up (0:28:55.9)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That - yeah, the normal...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, number the normal, conventional success aspect of life. And the other - it also represents to me I think giving up hope of a normal sexual development too. So those are - might be things that are irrationally connected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm glad you're noticing that because that makes you understand why it is that's a weight [ph].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That may be the reason for it. The one, again the one may be connected with a fear of homosexuality for example, and the other is connected in my own mind with, you know, normal heterosexuality. Those may be the kinds of symbolic connotations (unintelligible). So that might be part of it. I don't know how you can disassociate those two. I really doubt you can disassociate them in conversation, you know, here with you and I. It just seems we have something we have to work out on your own account (0:30:10.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you saying that seems so formally ingrained to you that you don't see how the things that we do in this therapy can change...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The conceptual block that you have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That may be. I don't know. I mean that would just be my first reaction to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to close the door? (unintelligible) Yeah. Well it sounds like they're very firm. And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: As I say I'm not convinced that those - obviously there's something very firm about them. I just sort of stabbing in the dark and saying that this might be the reason for it. I'd rather suspected this. I mean I don't know how you went - find out whether it's true or not (0:31:00.2)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah well it sounds - well if it's true to you, that's true enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It seems to be to be the likely explanation of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Quick - would you mind telling me some more about that? I'd like - can - I'd like to tell you, what I'd like to hear is - is this (unintelligible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say the gray flannel Notre Dame syndrome versus - and that's tied up with normal lifestyle heterosexual success. I'd like to hear you delineate a little bit more what the other one is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other one represents giving into a part of my nature, or what may be in fact my nature of the passive side of things. The more sensitive as it were, at least what I associate that sensitivity with, as a passivity and lack of aggressive behavior (0:31:54.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, gee I had almost wish we had a chart. Sensitivity leads to passivity, and the...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sexual...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my terminology that (unintelligible). I'm not saying it's true for everyone...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not saying that everybody that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't believe you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't believe you for a minute.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that - the sensitivity gets hooked into a passive sexual role which leads to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Homosexual behavior.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Which is peculiar because I'm sure that there are aggressive...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being a homosexual behavior.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure that there are - yeah. I'm sure that there are aggressive sexual roles in homosexuality as well too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So anyway that's the kind of thing that I associate it with. And that is too bad because it's such a crude - you know, I can understand from an intellectual standpoint or just even an aesthetic standpoint this is a very crude formulation. But - and I would, you know, reject it, you know, on one level (0:33:04.3).</p>

<p>But on the other level I think that that's the kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what that looks [ph].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. That's the word that really works in my (unintelligible). Or somewhere. (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's - suddenly I've got a popular song from I don't know when coming up in my head. And I'm not sure these are the words but this is what the flash is, all clear in my head is "Big Boys Don't" - I won't bother to sing it for you the way it sounds in my head...</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Big Boys Don't Cry?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Big Boys Don't Cry."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I remember that song. It always - Shirley and the Shirelles or something. Big - no, it was "Big Girls Don't..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Big Boys Don't Cry." Well, they cry, yeah, right. I admit that that's a very crude kind of a (0:33:59.4)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not asking you to not admit that. But that's something...</p>

<p>((Crosstalk))</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I'm sorry, no, no. That sounds like another aspect of it. That successful, aggressive men...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't let in their emotions. They don't cry. They don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it isn't that. It isn't that. It isn't that they let in their own emotions. It's that in my mind they successful so on and so forth kind of men maybe don't have the emotional reaction that I have to things. Because they're really - they're not emotionally hung up, you know. They're simply expressing themselves in many ways. And I wouldn't be - it wouldn't not jive with my (unintelligible) seeing my boss get so uptight about a deal or something that he would cry or something, you know, or dance a jig when he tucked [ph] a deal or something like that. That non-expression is not my idea of (0:35:02.3)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would...</p>

<p>PATIENT: My idea is that my emotional life is not that kind of response. That I am not an aggressive person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd better not show your emotions because your emotions don't fit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My emotions were never - kind of, yeah, and also they...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That don't fit what's expected of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And they - my emotional life is much more passive or something. Not to say that those emotions aren't strong but they're not the emotions normally associated with a particular - with the role of the American man...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today. So that - well so anyway that would be the, you know, the two extremes of it. The one would be in my - although I can make a plausible fantasy about how nice it would be to in some way marry those two lifestyles with a distinct, you know, leaning towards a what I'd call a, you know, sort of cultivated lifestyle where you don't have to be ashamed because you read certain books and you have certain kinds of concerns and that kind of thing. That seems to be to be just a daydream that I've concocted. Because I haven't seen it to my own satisfaction where it works especially well. It seems to be a distinct - it's like the old crude distinction between the kid that was good at mathematics and English. They're either good at one or the other and there are no (unintelligible) 1950s. But sometimes I see that (0:36:38.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So that there is that kind of, you know, one or the other. And that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I - okay, I - maybe I'm getting off subject but - which I think our society breeds. Breeds the fact that you're good at one or you're good at the other and the two don't mix (0:36:55.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they breed that in terms of lifestyles, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they - yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That may have exploded the myth of this mathematics and English, and I'm just using it as an analogy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're trying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some people are trying to right now. Working really hard on early education in terms of getting people to integrate their emotions and their excitement about ideas and about feelings and integrate the whole thing. So that nothing's wrong, but you just explore, discover and enjoy...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, any number of things there. And that to me is - that's the kind of education or business management kind of stuff that I would want to be involved in, in making that kind of thing possible. But what do we do for people who have been victimized by the dichotomy for years and years like you and I and a lot of people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well anyway that's the - that expresses a concern I have. And it also sort of expresses a continuation of where we left off, you know, last week just to take another step further, is that that - that I had that (unintelligible) conception in mind (unintelligible). You know, the trouble is that though, you know, talking about these things and identifying them, you sometimes wonder how close you're really getting to things because you (0:38:28.8)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you (unintelligible) about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I sometimes wonder how close it's really getting at things. Because at the same time I say that I sort of am now at least emotionally recoiling from it and seizing upon the word you used, victimized, you know, holding that as a hope that what I say about myself, you know, may not be true. And I am victimized by a (unintelligible) way of thinking about things. Because if, you know, if that's true, if what I say is true between the two extremes and I put my - then where do I fit in? Well clearly I'm not with the - I don't feel at home with the aggressive personality pattern so I'm already on the other side of what I'm trying to achieve with the other thing. And I'm sort of finding the other aspect of things where I'm at as being sort of a passive, quasi-queer lifestyle. And at the very least I'm not doing myself a favor (0:39:43.1)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It may be true, though, that's the thing that comes to mind. I may be saying this well, right, I'm not doing myself a favor. But whether you're helping yourself or hindering yourself is it finally a much deeper level, you know, immaterial, you know, you're identifying yourself and those kinds of things. So ultimately can you do anything - if I perceive my own personality to be this way and I'm 28 now, it's unlikely that it's going to - it seems unlikely that I'm going to be able to reform the way I feel. Confronted with a situation I'm going to feel that way, the way I was brought up to be when I was 28, not some other way. It just seems likely that, you know, identify it and (0:40:37.9)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like we're identifying and that's about all. Big deal. Right? Yeah, I feel that a little bit too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What I want to try and avoid when I talk about it is defining myself into a corner. But still, you know, have some - see I just don't know if those things about me are true or not. Because really - I really totally abdicated exploration of the way I really do feel about things in favor of sealing the door. Which is probably (0:41:12.2)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In favor sealing the door, you know, hermetically sealing myself inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Inside of which one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, inside of sort of avoid because I don't really want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Inside of a battle between the two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fairly close to the successful business image, but that's your goal. But at the same time I'm - a lot (unintelligible) turns you off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember saying to you once that, you know, laughing and one time we went through those exercises in the other room there, it occurred to me all of a sudden how little my things I did at the office and do at work meant to me in terms of my, you know, where the dynamics is - were of my emotional life is really going on. At this point in time I wish it were other. I wish I felt more vitally engaged and - I don't know. I don't know what I wish I feel at this point. But (0:42:20.7)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can I guess what that is? That you wish that you were more involved in your business as...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it was fulfilling and that it was filling up that emotional void somehow, that it was contributing to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's as though that were, you know, what they call a sacramental sign or something going on even beneath that. And that would be reassuring, you know, if I was getting some sense of fulfillment out of doing battle or something. But given the state of my reactions about things and just seizing upon the negative, I might be a personality creating - I think I can explain it pretty well, you know, I really do. I'm stumbling about now. It's just that I don't know what good it is to explain it. I think I recognize what it is pretty well. But, you know, I don't have to convince that it does - to serve much purpose to (0:43:38.5)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'd like to hear it. I'd like you to share a little bit of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just a continuation of what we just spoke of. And in the same way, and that might just be an elaboration or spinning out of a plausible fantasy about what would explain the kinds of things I do. It'd be sort of I suppose Psychology 101 (0:44:01.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't feel that way at all. You should see yourself right now. You sound more deeply involved, you know, you're talking about what you did 15 minutes ago a lot more. And like something is getting processed. And that's what I'm listening to. And that's (unintelligible) process, that you are looking truthfully (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I think you already know of those things. And I'm not convinced I want to run through them (0:45:00.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's - you don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I said - it sounds like a big mystification there. But, you know, again as I say what exact purpose does it serve to identify all those issues, you know. (unintelligible) at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sense you're drawing...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely clarify things for you I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will it definitely clarify things for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah but I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things like that (unintelligible) end up for you not for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, right (0:45:59.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - you know, the only thing I'm saying is that I just don't know whether or not. And I could go on but it'd take like another half hour to be full of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well we don't have...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Byways and highways and low ways and so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't have half an hour but I'd sure like to begin there the next hour if we could, begin - and we'd have half an hour to work after that. That sounds potentially quite profitable to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we'll give it a try.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. We've got five minutes. I wanted to make one response to this dichotomy, and that is it's not only a dichotomy of A and B, it's a dichotomy of white and black of these are the good guys and these are the bad guys. So they're not even two valid choices. This is the thing that you have to strive for. And it's not okay to be out, it's not okay to be anywhere closer to here than over there (0:47:16.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not when you're - not - right, I agree with that, that what you're saying is true that the halfway mark and all the rest of it. But when you're apparently, and I'm just saying this like as though I were a scientist observing some unexplainable byline [ph], apparently when you feel yourself in such, you know, in such peril as I do you have such an insecurity about you that you throw yourself with great force, either...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you turn yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Throw yourself with great force at your definition of success and normalcy and all the rest of it. If I were a more secure person, if I had - if I were not for example, you know - if I weren't such an emotional and actual virgin as I am I probably wouldn't feel it this strongly. But I'd have much more, you know, well look, easygoing about it. You know, but that not being the case it causes, you know, that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (0:48:29.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sense of peril.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'd like you to try something in the last two minutes that you're here. And that is, okay, you've talked about one idea of success. Could you paint another idea of success that somebody might have? You might not have that idea but what's another idea of success that a person might have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you're just talking about fantasies. I have a very active fantasy life. I don't have a lot of difficulty with that. But it means nothing to me. In fact it just makes me bitter (0:49:00.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why does that make you bitter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I can conceive of 1,000 or any number of variations of kind of something that would please me. But I don't have the power to achieve it. So, you know, I have a good imagination.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay well what's the power to achieve it? You're saying you don't have the power to achieve it. That sounds like a crucial issue here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, certainly it's a crucial issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well what does that mean, you don't have the power to achieve it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It means exactly what I said. I can draw on a chalkboard or verbally any number of pictures of a satisfying life. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've only heard you draw one. I've only heard you draw one in the whole time that you've come here. Basically one. And that is the upper middle class businessman, suave, financially successful, debonair, controlling things out there and not letting people inside, what's going on in his head or what are his ups and downs or whatever. And you say, and now you say there are all kinds of ideas of success. Well to me you say that that's success. That's success for you. I don't think that's an invalid thing at all to ask of you (unintelligible) different ideas of success (0:50:41.2).</p>

<p>What I was trying to do, one of the things behind what I was trying to do is to get you to move off that kind of grip on it and to get some kind of a greater ease with possible other ideas of success, that might even be possible for you. Not that, one that comes to mind, a jockey, a successful jockey. Okay. Maybe that's not, you know, okay. But that's - he might be happy here in the world (unintelligible) horse and what have you. Okay. You may not like that, but what's halfway between here and there? What's the, you know, something that you (0:51:19.3)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well we talked about one of them previously in one of the earlier sessions of about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was the political.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About politics some way. And I have to say if you talk about, you know, the idea of - my idea of success revolving around money, most of them do have something to do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but there's other ways - there's more descriptive ways of talking about that than what we did. You could put in some content to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's what I mean, that that's the kind of thing I don't - well certainly I will do it. But I don't know what the potential, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay (0:52.01.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're the boss. Okay?</p>

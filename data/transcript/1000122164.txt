<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 18.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tapes. I sort of developed a "what the heck" attitude about the whole thing. It just seems like we're not going to get anywhere in the next three session. And I would...I would sit around and I'd think, well, what can I decide? What can I settle out in my mind? And then I'd work on it a while and I'd say, "Why? What's the point?" Any significant work that you've done is done and there doesn't seem to be any real, you know, motivation to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like nothing else can happen in two more sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you don't feel much like trying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or three sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) and you've said that I can come back, so maybe that will change a little bit of my thinking, but it could be...it could be that. It could be also kind of a relief. And I think it is kind of a relief.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have it over, you mean? What's a relief?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes, it well...I mean, it's not easy. At times it's exciting, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you figure something out and you decide that's really right. But other times it's really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hard work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Not necessarily hard work but hard to make yourself realize something. You're going to beat it into yourself and you don't like realizing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Unpleasant?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so not only is it hard work, it also can be unpleasant. So, realizing that, you know, there...well, in this particular work, there's a 20 session limit, has been, well, just lately, just this last one, I just sort of realized that all the thinking need not continue, but that's kind of a sad appraisal, you know, a situation, when really it shouldn't. This should be a...I think, anyhow, work that should help a person solve his own problems and then maybe help him learn how to solve his own problems, so in the future if anything comes out, he'll be able to sit down, and instead of talking to someone else, can just talk to himself and figure things out. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But you realized you could easily stop it after 20 sessions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so that's sad. Well, it's not good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sad in that, in that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might do that?</p>

<p>[0:02:46.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you see, I didn't like... (inaudible) my conscious of saying, "Well, I'm going to stop working hard at it. I'm going to stop thinking about it and that's it." I didn't do that. I just sort of during the week, well, it's a...you know, we met last on Monday and maybe by Tuesday or Wednesday, I'd be home in the evening, reading or watching television or something and start thinking about it and then go to bed and think. That was a standard procedure. But now, I...this last week, and maybe just lately it's been increasing, I would say, "Well, let's see, how are your feelings changed? Have you sorted anything out?" And I'd start thinking and I'd think, "Ah, what the heck." So, then about over the weekend I got to thinking about saying, "What the heck?" And I really didn't like it because the first part of the work that we did is based on a solution that is not final right now. But a solution that is dynamic and changing. And based on the fact that I will continue to think. And here I was, not even finished, and I was stopping my thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, where does that leave me? That's a good...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you didn't like...did it seem like the wrong procedure kind of thing you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't like it that you were going to stop thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, it's sort of like, it would be equivalent to this exam that I've just passed and then once you've passed it, just not even thinking about physics anymore, but being a professional physicist. And once I get through the sessions and have done the work and have straightened myself out somewhat to stop...stop being, well, introspective at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just to let it ride, (inaudible) well, until you get to the point where something bothers you and then go in for 20 more sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But just to forget the whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As soon as you walk out the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, that's a bad trend, I think. But nevertheless, it's happening, and...I think one of the reasons that I feel that way is because of the satisfaction of the first part of our work and the futility of the second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like at first it seemed like we were really getting somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it not only felt like, I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It did. And then it was pretty disappointing and discouraging not to get anywhere or frustrating to have (inaudible).</p>

<p>[0:05:42.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it's only logical that I would feel that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. It makes sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It makes sense, but it doesn't sit well. And because of that, well, I thought more about that than I thought about any problem per se.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's interesting that the whole...well, I think it's a good thing to probe because it's important. The whole concept of, you know, well, we talked once earlier about how, you know, outside the room it's a clearly different sort of thing. And I come in here and I sort of talk about what goes on outside the room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not really, at least not that (inaudible) a different person. But I consider my actions, and well, my words in here to be somewhat in a different spirit, okay? Well, now there seems to be a third spirit in which I go home and I think about what we've done. Just going back another step and looking at what transpired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And looking that over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so now...I think that's a good thing to analyze to see what happened in the first step. What was the relationship in the first step? What happened in the first step? That is, our working with what happens beyond the door rather...and then, if I can take what happens here and remove it from me by one step, I'm considering it objectively.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then what does that say about what we've done?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can remove it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does it seem to say to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it says two things. It says, number one, and I'm just on the same thing again, and sort of lied, effectively, haven't been completely open and been completely true, because if it were it would be pouring out here. Then I couldn't separate myself from it. Says that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't follow that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't follow that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, are you saying that if it's really you, you wouldn't be able to analyze it afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not necessarily the analyzing it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes, it is. Yeah. That's sort of the feeling I get. But it's not an intricate deep part of me, the fact that I can sit back and look at it objectively. The other...the other thing is, although different, it has the opposite final result.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that is the fact that, well, if I could sit back and look at that, I must have really done a good job of sitting back and looking at my life because I can separate very intimate parts of myself, of my soul.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>[0:08:46.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I can think...if I can take what is, as far as the deepest meaning, in my head, if I can take what has happened to me that has most affected the deep thought in me, that is our relationship, and remove myself from it, then certainly, I must have really been able to remove my life from that relationship and look at it objectively, which is good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, if I'm able to separate then I must have really done a good job of separating and been able to treat it as a third person, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So, in some ways, that separation seems like it means that you've done something very well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some ways, the separation means that you haven't tapped some deep part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, that really makes, it really makes a difficult problem if you're doing an experiment on yourself, because you...any decision you make as regards to experimental procedure, will affect yourself. It's sort of like, oh, I (inaudible)...yeah, it's all interlocking, and any decision you make, that must be analyzed. But if you analyze a decision, that must be analyzed. Things like that. Sort of like a...one time I saw a most hilarious instrument. It was like a violin. It was an African musical instrument, except instead of having a straight neck, it had a bent one, that bent up. And as you tightened the strings it pulled the neck closer and closer to the end of the thing. And so you'd tighten it and it would move...it would loosen all the other strings. And that's the same sort of thing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. I see what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very confusing. But it's...it should be, now that I think now that we're here and...for your sake, I can decide maybe on Tuesday or so what's a good thing to work on all week and then I work on it and then we come talk about it. Right. But this week, as I've been going along, I just try to think about things and nothing happens, and then because I just don't have the desire to. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You haven't felt like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking about things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't think any significant work can be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The whole...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's useless, you mean, the thing is, like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: This whole thing, by the way, is based on a 20 session thing, and now I know maybe it can go beyond 20 so, it's all (inaudible), but still we can draw conclusions from what's going through my head. So, anyhow, where was I? Yeah, but this week, it didn't get...I didn't get to the very end when I thought, oh my gosh, everything you brought up, you threw out. So, or you just didn't think deeply about it, because you haven't gotten anywhere. So, that's the thing to think about and that's the thing to try and figure out if it means anything.</p>

<p>[0:12:04.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that mean, that you've (inaudible) back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so...I don't know, it's...it's interesting what we've done. It's...I've never...looking back on it, I've never felt any, well, yeah, it's hard to talk about any sexual problems I have, but other problems I haven't had any trouble with. Matter of fact, it's been interesting at times, exciting, to figure out things that I never really figured out before but have always been there, you know, just thrown up in the little corners of my mind, the memory banks and crooks and DNA molecules or whatever it is. And then I put them together and say, "Wow, look at that. This happened when I was four. This happened when I was 17. This happened when I was 23." And it's all the same. "Wow, that was kind of cool."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of neat to do all that? Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But...well, so I can look back on it and find those interesting things, but it's really, I think that this type of work, the non-Rod Steiger work, if you know him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is quite unique, I think. Quite unique, in that the person who does the research, the experiment is doing it upon himself. And that makes it, that just opens all sorts of manifestations of how you do an experiment, how you try and figure things out. And I haven't figured out completely what it did to me. That never seemed to bother you at all with this type of work?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bother me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, have you really...with the type of work where the client does almost all the talking, has it ever crossed your mind that that is quite unique, not necessarily in your field but in all of any investigative endeavor, that that's got to be really unique?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Yeah, it's unique, yeah, I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's unique, like it's different from a physicist doing experiments on metabols or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which are not himself. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, not only not so much that he's doing an experiment on himself, because a physician could do an experiment on himself. He could listen to see if he had a heart murmur. But he couldn't do anything about the heart murmur, but by virtue of the fact that the person is looking into his head, well, that has something to say about his head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so he's got to look into that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's just no way to get to the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next time, I can come in and say, "Well, let's analyze what I said last time," and you know, you could do that forever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do it through 20 analyzations?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like very complex. It opens up a whole lot of new questions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so all the guy has to do is come here once and tell you when he was little he played baseball and once he cheated. And he was safe and he was out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the next time he could come and he could talk about the first time and the second time, and the third time he could talk about the second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's true. It's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would really be a cool way to...I wonder if you could actually get anything done by not talking about yourself at all? Sort of a (inaudible) operation. Like, you could talk about yourself, but nothing external to what happens here. That's like you hear about the here and now discussions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, we could talk about just what's going on this minute.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's impossible to do, I think, I don't know, I've never been in one while I was (inaudible). It's here and now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know what you're saying. You're saying it's never-ending in a sense, like what you were saying a minute ago. It's like when you start thinking about yourself you can really go on and ask question after question, level after level and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's really true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you can come to a nice conclusion and the fact that you came to that conclusion can be analyzed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Like, you know, what you're saying is I think, is like, you can never reach the end of conclusions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. By definition, you can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: By definition.</p>

<p>[0:16:37.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because as I said, the fact that you have come to a conclusion opens up a new problem which must be concluded.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like why did you come to that conclusion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, that's it. I (inaudible), I'll see you sometime. No, I'll stay, just because it's futile, I won't leave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels pretty futile, pretty...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I could not see now, a person coming in and working on something and figuring something out and then, well, after 19 sessions, says, "Well, we got that taken care. We'll see you next time." Next time he goes through and concludes it all, gets it all nice and tightened package, wraps it all up, walks out the door, and then all is concluded. That ain't going to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you were hoping for, right? When you came in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's interesting, however, that before...I mean, if you ever got the tapes mixed up, in order. By the way, do you listen to them once, and then erase them and then print over them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm keeping them because they're for the research.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see. So, where was I? I'll figure it out. Lost my train of thought. Well, at any rate, I've found your work is...well, I know what I was going to say. I know what I was going to say. I was going to say it's interesting that now I'm come to this conclusion, now I've come to realize about what's been happening, and yet, if you look at one of the first...the first conclusion points that I came to, it was a dynamic one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was one that I realized the change, which is comforting. That makes me happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you happy that the first one was by (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I didn't say, "All right, oh, well, that's it. This is what is wrong, that's what I'll do and everything will be fine." I didn't say that. I said, "Well, this is how I'm going to have to approach things and wait and see as things change."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: These are the decisions I'll have to make. So, that's kind of nice. And I realize that on the basis of my own, the old personal problems to which we came to the conclusion for...excuse all those prepositions, I'm not having analyzed the entire counseling situation and then realized that no problems can be definitely solved, and you know, N sessions, much less 20. So, that's kind of nice, too. So, there are bad things and there are good things about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's mixed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm. And that brings us back to, there, I guess, it's hard to say, my sexual problems. You know, that's really strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard just to bring it up and out loud.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see, the thing is, in different times and different places it wouldn't necessarily be a problem. If I were, you know, the certain taboos we have in our society it is a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other centuries or other societies.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, or other, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but the problem is that I am a product of this century and this society, so therefore, it's a problem to me, and I find that really disturbing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it? I don't get that point. What's disturbing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there...well, let's go back and (inaudible) times, (inaudible) there are certain things, I feel, anyhow, that are in you when you're born. For instance, an infant has a definite personality and he hasn't developed that. And a person has a...I think a person has, well, it's...well, that's enough right there. A person is born with certain things, that I think a person may be born with certain sexual inclinations. I really do. I don't think that necessarily, a homosexual is...becomes a homosexual because of things in his memory. I think it is very possible that a person is born that way. That Christian Jorgensen happened to be born...and the most important factor in determining a person's sexual behavior, I think. Well, then you realize that once a person is born he's born into a society with very, very strong sexual morays.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether they be loose or weak, well, not strong, well-defined. There are some societies where they've been completely free, I assume, and anthropologist, believe (inaudible). You know? So, there are societies where you can do it quite healthfully, I feel, in a different way. However, I was brought up in this society with different, with certain beliefs, and now these are the things that are in my head, and the interesting thing is all of these are talked about, you know, and really developed in the mind, and completely (inaudible) it in you before puberty, so you have no real good way to look at them, you have no personal contact with them. It's sort of like you bring up a kid, the worst thing in the world is for a person to enjoy group sex, you know, and then one of the most...when he does reach puberty, one of his greatest fantasies, one of the things he would enjoy most would be group sex. Wow, that kid's going to be messed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So, you're saying what's clearly disturbing is that you're in a society that is sort of set to mess you up?</p>

<p>[0:23:10.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, not necessarily. That's not necessarily the case. It's not necessarily set to mess me up. Because I'm not sure where I'm at. Still, it's sort of a vague. Well, first of all, I definitely have enjoyed my heterosexual life until now. It's a question of whether bisexuality is open to me and it isn't because of the fact that I've been brought up in 20th century (inaudible), there's no question. It isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. It isn't a possibility for you to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like you're saying your attitudes towards it have been very much shaped by the way you've been brought up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that even if you had...even if you had those bisexual tendencies, you would have trouble, like, feeling them through or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just by the way you've been brought up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, no pun intended?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah, well, so I've got to work with everything my parents did to me before I was...I reached puberty late, at 24. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels constricting, you mean, to have to work with all that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if constricting is the right word. Yeah, somewhat constricting. And you know what's really sad, too, and I realize this, 100 percent, and then I think, well, if I ever had kids I would try like hell not to mess them up, and leave all sexual possibilities open until they do mature and then decide where their head is at. And then I think, wow, would that...would that disturb me? To have what I consider now an abnormal child? That would really bother me. And I realize it would be next to impossible or it would take a very concerted effort to raise a child with no sexual...strong sexual cultural bias.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be very hard for you to do that because it would be very (inaudible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I have such strong sexual bias culture...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it would be upsetting for you if a kid turned out to really want to go that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yeah, he should decide for himself what is healthy for him, after he gets to the point where he can realize what it is, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Like you have that value, too, that he should really decide?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That conflicts with your other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean...overtly, I would...or, anything I would say to him if we sat down and had any discussion about sex would involve the honest approach, "Wait and see where you're at and experiment freely, and don't explore..." you know, all the standard shit that I figured out I'm going to tell my kids. Fine. But then, I think in any other conversation, my bias would show. And I think that would affect him at least as much if not more so than any discussion I would have, you know, probably, "man to man" discussion with a boy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, when you talked directly about sex, you would have open whatever you want...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's quite easy to sit down and say...no, well, talk to the kid about sex, so, "This is what we're going to say because this is what's right." Fine. But children can be very perceptive and read biases very easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're afraid, pretty sure it would come out indirectly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, yeah, the more I think about what's going on here, and how goofed up I am, there's just no way in the world I'm going to have kids. It's just like hopeless, it really is.</p>

<p>[0:27:25.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hopeless to feel like you could raise them, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you just got to make mistakes. There's just no way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How could you not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, everyone is just so full of biases that no matter how hard they try to bring someone up with none, and they could sit down and analyze why they don't have any bias in this area, but because they do, and they have to, by virtue of the fact that they're human beings, I think, then this will show through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More than, like I say. Well, it happened with my...well, wait a minute now. The opposite sort of happened with my parents and I, as far as political, well, not necessarily political...Yeah, the popular political issues, let's say, as far as they're concerned. They would say, "You got to be completely honest about (inaudible). It's all right to have a black family next door," and things like that. And then you find out that, "Well, the church is trying to move some blacks next door, we can't let that happen." Or, "Your father cheats on his income tax a little here and there, a little point." But, I, you know, I would say, I listened in many instances to what they said rather than what they did. So, maybe it is possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it is possible to have some effect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it all depends on how good a teacher you are. I think, too, ah, this is it. I think, too, it's quite important that you don't realize your biases, that is to say, the mother who effectively did all the teaching, did not realize that she was a bigot. She thought she wasn't and when we talked, we sat down and we were quite straightforward, and we had the little discussion about whether she...about being honest and not being biased and things like that. She really thought she wasn't, and therefore I thought that was the way to be. But then I realized that...when I realized she was, I realized that, well, you know, the old standard clich� about your...your actions speak so loudly I can't hear what you're saying, or something like that. But I think I realized...I got to the point where I realized I was better to listen to what she had said than what she had done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, what I'm saying is maybe it is possible to bring someone up, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one thing it sounds like you're maybe saying, or maybe I'm saying, I don't know, is like, if you have biases, at least if you're aware of them, you can say to the kids, "I have biases."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Wait a minute, though. Okay, that I haven't grown up with. I've grown up with someone who thought they didn't have biases, and therefore, taught me the best...the best of all possible ways to live, that is, with no biases at all about anything. Taught me that in any little session, you know, dinner table talk or something, you know, this is the way to behave. You should behave this way. Well, a person taught me that way but really wasn't that way. And the other way, then, is to teach someone that way and say, "Well, look, you're going to have to live with what I have..." well, that I haven't grown up with, so I don't know how that would work. .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's interesting. Like, for instance, I've often thought about the...how would you bring someone up religiously?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think the fair way is when he gets anywhere near an age where he can start to think about things like that, maybe 13, 14, something like that, you should...for your own purposes, too, in case you've forgotten, go through as many different types of, from Buddhist to Catholic, Jewish, just shop around. Say, "This is what these people believe," and show them not only what the beliefs are but what the ritual is. And then a kid can say, "Wow, that's all that we should tommy rap," or, "That's all that...makes a lot of sense," or, "I like this one." And if he turns out to be Zen Buddhist, that's fine. He can figure it out himself. But, yeah, let's say, "Well, this is..." Ultimately, the kid's going to grow up pretty close...well, that's not true, either, I was going to say pretty close to his parents...I don't know, the mold that his parents are. But that doesn't seem to be the case. I mean, nowadays, kids are really, I guess, the word is rebelling. So they don't grow up that way. But, there are a awful lot of kids out in the suburbs, who look an awful lot like their parents, I think.</p>

<p>[0:32:32.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think everything's a way, too, to, I'm asking you this, too. Just say to a kid, "I do have biases, but this is the way I feel." But one of my beliefs is also that I don't want my kids to grow up with all the biases I have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's a good point. That's a good point. Uh-huh. I think...right, I think that...you see, a person can't grow up without bias, I think. A person can't be everywhere at once. He can't be in (inaudible) with every type of person it was. And not be in contact with some people. He will have biases.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that's different than saying, "I want you to grow up with my same bias."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, develop your own bias. It might be worse than yours. Well, that's your bias, though, isn't it? All right. That's important. Plus, you could have a wife, that would argue a hundred...that were completely different on several issues, important issues.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To give the kid a broad spectrum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that probably could (inaudible). Yeah, that's right, that's probably a good way to approach it. I wonder if a kid can handle that. I don't know if I could or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean it might be too confusing or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...no, it's...might not be secure enough. A kid...well, see for instance, the first time I remember getting into a political (inaudible) in first grade, that I was right just because my parents were. And I'm sure that I realized I had no reason to be for it. None at all. And yet, I think I was intelligent enough to know that that was...the reason I formed it was because my parents formed it, and I didn't know. There was just ignorance there, complete ignorance. And I was intelligent enough to know that that was based on ignorance. And yet I wanted to be for someone, because everyone else in the class either had Stevenson or Eichmann.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted to be for someone because everyone else in the class had (inaudible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, whenever everyone takes up sides, you got to take up sides, too. It's a big controversy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You hate to say, "Well, I don't have any opinion on this controversy."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted to belong to one group or the other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, it's not necessarily belonging to a group as it is in taking part in something exciting that was going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I needed any group identification. Because I don't have...looking back on that, I don't know which kid was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Certainly something about being in the swing of the argument.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then there was the exciting thing that was going on for a couple weeks there, and I remember watching the television. And so, Mommy and Daddy, who are you for? I saw that. If I didn't question it at all, then I could see bringing up a kid and saying, "Well, these are my biases and these are what other people think, and I would like you to drop and perhaps not, have as few biases as possible, because (inaudible) if you develop, you know, your own pre-conceived notions, then realize that you are developing them, because it's just boggling his mind, the insecurity of having to figure it out for himself, and so in that security, assuming his parents' bias.</p>

<p>[0:36:18.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what would be wrong with sometimes doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If he hasn't thought it out, then it becomes a bias and you cannot think it out, if it's really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, but I mean, all, let's think about this, right? When you're six years old or however old you were, what did it hurt, really, for you to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it didn't hurt when I was six. Okay, fine? When I'm six that's all right, no problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when I'm six and a day, so it's a difference, okay, and I'll just keep going. We'll do that 365 times and we'll be at seven, and we'll do that again and we'll be at eight, and I still haven't' changed, you know, and pretty soon I'll be at 14.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I've got a bias that I haven't thought about too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just assume, and because of the fact that I went through day after day after day with this assumed bias just because my parents had it, well, you know, unless, at any given point, your parents are marking down all biases that the computer picked up. And then every, you know, July 14th, it says, "These are what you've got. We should re-analyze these."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you can't stop your kid from growing up with biases, either. You can't be his bias recorder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think what you're saying is (inaudible), like it is confusing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's always confusing when there are no clear answers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think the only solution to this it didn't</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think the only solution is a Skinner box. You program in every possible, you know, every time, you decide, right now we're going to (inaudible), you just program in every kind of people into this, and a Skinner box until you're about 43.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you come out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then you load the (inaudible), make some new boxes. I think that's...ah, yes, whatever happened to the Skinner babies? They're all right, aren't they? I mean, they're perfectly reasonable kids?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know they're about my age. Because I remember when I was about 12 I saw a picture like in Time or something, "Skinner Babies Are Normal at 12 Now." Well, that's interesting. After having realized that all my problems revert to how I was brought up, I could take this a step further, it's a given, (inaudible) with myself, as I mentioned earlier, I remove myself from this conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think this is really a frightening experience brining up a kid. I talked to a girl who just had a baby, well, it's about six months old now, and she said, "It's really amazing, because Charlie (the baby's name) is here now. I mean, he's here. And there's no denying it, for the rest of our lives, he's here, barring a catastrophe." And that's just unfathomable. It's really...you can live with tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But forever?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Yeah, he's feeling well. We'll give him beets for lunch. You know, that's fine. Tomorrow is quite easy to live with, but wow, the rest of your life is just (inaudible) right now. And so I think what have we done? We've created a life. Not only for the rest of our lives, but for the rest of his life, he's here."</p>

<p>[0:39:57.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like, too, that there's something out of our hands, what happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And there's no question at all that kids have definite personalities right away. I've seen several of them, a lot of my peers are that age or that ilk. And things are pretty much, well, at least, initial demeanor is pretty much determined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We were talking, a friend and I, about lying, which is basically what I think the whole first problem was about, the fact that I was really good at lying, and I didn't...not when I say lying, I know it's just got to be absolute falsehood in lying about intentions and how I feel, so that I would be accepted by people. Well, we talked about lying, and, boy, I was really great when I was a kid. Or at least I thought I was great. I...you know, there was no question about a lie. I'd tell a lie as soon as that, if it would get a certain in. And I got to the point where I realized which ones I would get caught at, which ones would get back, and which ones wouldn't and which ones were important, things like that. Well, we were talking about lying, and I asked the kids if they lied when they were young, and some said, "Yeah, a little." And a couple of them said, "No, not at all. I didn't even think of it." And I thought, wow, why a kid wouldn't think of lying when it's the easiest thing in the world to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like how could anyone grow up in that thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, unless that kid is just so dumb that he doesn't know, you know, and he gets caught at it so often. You got to be pretty stupid to do that. But I asked and I said, "Why didn't you lie?" And the guy said, well, on one of the reasons, and he thought the main one, was the fact that he was brought up, and he was always such a good little boy. Everything he did was, you know, "Oh, that's s just wonderful, great, you're a good little boy." But he just had to fit into that mold, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. He had to be a good boy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He had to reinforce that good little boy, and there was just no way he was going to lie. And I certainly was a prima donna baby. I was told that I was great all the time and everything, but boy...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't affect you that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, didn't affect me that way at all. So that started it all, of course. I read once that the best way to keep a kid from lying is initially not give him the opportunity. If he leaves, or he's playing with something and he leaves it out in the yard and it rains and gets rusted. You don't say, "Did you leave that out in the yard?" With that tone of voice, it's, no. You'd say, "Well, look it, you left it out in the yard. Why don't you go dig it up?" And if he didn't then he'll say, "No, I didn't." Then. But if he did, it won't be hard for him to accept that. But somewhere my parents got all screwed up and I just turned the lying around into something, into sort of a life principle, rather than an open lie about something, this is an open lie about intentions and motivations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rather than an open lie, what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, rather than an open lie, like, that can be pinned down, lying about the past or something...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something specific?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something specific. You're lying, rather, about your feelings, and in doing so, you can achieve ends that you couldn't if your true feelings showed...showed through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So you generalize it, you learn to lie about your emotions as well as...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Acts and behavior?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it was just sort of a transference, in the formative layer. The layer of form which I've already mentioned that...and I finally got to the point where I...I think the reason why I stopped, "Hey, that's a good point. Wow, we finally came up with a good point."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's cool. See, look it, look it. Oh, I hope I don't blow this now. See if I got it all straight. So you lie about...I got to the point where I was throwing out this specific lie, and was left with a general lie, because of the fact that my parents brought me up thinking that they didn't have biases and said, truth is important, and they were lying all the time by virtue of the fact that they had biases.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they were lying by virtue of the fact they said they didn't have biases when they knew they did. All right, so now I get to this age, and I've thrown out all these lies, specific lies, because I really, sincerely, believe that one should not lie specifically, and then I realize that I have these deeper lies, much more important, and then it starts to bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because as I've grown up, you know, I started out with this tremendous lying complex, tremendously dishonest kid. And then, but also, listen, I was listening to my parents. Everything they said was gospel and I hung on their every word, and they said, "One shouldn't lie," so I began to throw these out, and because of...but it was still left as a residual part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I got to the point where they'd all been thrown out, except for this residual part, you know, the deeper thing. The lying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The surface ones got thrown out.</p>

<p>[0:45:47.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the down below part was still there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I'm just at the point where I'm throwing a little...well, trying to throw less of them out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's cool, because you see, I don't know if I told you I exaggerated a lot when I came in here, that was one of my things that we had to write 15 things about ourselves, and I exaggerated, and that took like a nice block, you know, sort of like saying, instead of you got...well, if you got an A minus, you take the minus off. If you got the A, things like that. Or adding 10 percent onto something or taking 10 percent off (inaudible), okay, fine. Well, I'm really getting away from that now. I'd sort of get to the specific and I'd really, a conscious effort of saying the right number, saying the right thing. I slip up every now and then but less and less. So, what was the point I was going to make? Dammit! I get so involved here. Oh, all right, so now the solution I have come up with about, (inaudible) number one, okay, is the fact that I'm going to have to live with certain things, achievement and motivation that are other people's achievements. Trying to please people, I'm going to have to live with that, see how I can arrange things. Whereas, now I realize maybe I'm not. Maybe I can be honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe...maybe I've just now realized that I can really revamp my whole life, it just takes that decade, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. You can do it? Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, when I was in high school, the first couple of years of college, I was still basically a liar. And now I think I'm reasonably an honest person, so I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So, you've changed. Look how much you've changed, you've...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, so now I got to the point where I couldn't handle this last one. I couldn't throw it out. I came here, right? And now I've come to the conclusion that I can't throw it out. When today I realized that maybe I can, just by virtue of the extrapolation of what I've done so far.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I can change in the future the way I've changed in the past?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Okay. Back to the...it started when I was a little boy. Oh, that means that...that just means...what does that mean? Mmm. That means that the dynamic solution was wrong, simply wrong, but it's all right for the time being to...to simply to not have to live with that. My sister, in all her, well, I just saw my sister and her baby, and I...this is a good point. It's going to take me 10 minutes to develop, but I'm kind of like enjoying what I'm doing in physics. And it's really exciting because I'm learning about all sorts of techniques. I(inaudible) techniques, then b(inaudible) techniques, it's great stuff. But I still have a little bit of problem realizing that's what I'm going to do my entire life. I'm sort of a neophyle and now I can like it because it's something new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you're afraid that you'll tire of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe not, maybe not. We'll see. But anyhow, so I still have this gnawing thing that the honest thing for me to do is not physics. As again, I mean, you know that my conclusion here is I've gone this far, I might as well finish the degree off. Okay, so, I saw my sister for the first time in a couple years. And let me describe a political situation down in Elgin, down in...Elgin is one of the oldest town in Illinois. I think, one of the oldest, anyhow, and it's voted Republican since 1821, it's kind of a pre-Congressman this century and the last one's been in it for 15 years, Charlotte Reed, and she has no political presence of mind whatsoever and they just elect her because of inertia. Well, she's getting kicked upstairs to the FCC. My sister said, "Why don't you run?" And I said, "That's ridiculous." And I said, "Well, it is..." It's slightly less than ridiculous. Lately, I've been hot shit back in Elgin because I've been speaking to groups about the channel thing, okay? Because I went to...the high school I went to was a brand new high school in town, and anything that I did at college, because I was the first one to do it. You know, the first (inaudible), the first one to graduate from college, get a masters, all this kind of stuff, there was always an article in the paper. So, all I have to do is win as a minor Republican, lie through my teeth about my intentions. I could get in, and that would be...</p>

<p>[0:50:33.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Easy and you could just do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I could do it, and I really think there's a possibility, but I wouldn't because now I'm in physics, you know. However, I thought about it. I really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really considered it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and now looking back on that, that is really honest, I think. I mean, sure I'd have to lie to get in, but that's really something that I should do. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is run?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, definitely. I...I...when I...I'm thinking, basically, I'm running away from the country. I'm going to France in August of �72, probably going to emigrate. So, that's sort of leaving a problem that's really a part of me. I mean, it's going to be hard, it's going to be a cultural shock, when I begin to realize that I'm emigrating, that I'm not really going to come back here permanently. May not even come back for visits, but I'm going to have to give up, you know, the apple pie and the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot (inaudible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Chicago Cubs and things like that that are really a big part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I realize that I can replace them with liverwurst and soccer, but nevertheless, it's going to be a shock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...but now, here's an alternative that was much more honest. Rather than running away from the things that I just hate, you know, the political situation today, I could do something to change it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Get into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I really contemplated it. I really did. But I didn't, you know, carry it to the step of saying, "Well, I'm not going to go into the..." so maybe there is a small room for hope.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's hope.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We'll see what happens, I don't know. I might...and then to be honest, it might be physics for me, if this interest, if this present interest really keeps up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So, that might turn out to be the right course?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, this session started out as a real bust and now I've got some groovy things. That's cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Going somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's strange. Because I thought this one, boy, when I walked out on the street, I thought, well, all I'm going to tell her is the fact that I've sort of got a "what the heck" attitude. Yeah, that's really cool. I'm...that's a good conclusion. Well, if it turns out that they're going to have a special election, and it only takes a week to campaign, I might still do it. Keep up my work here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just go in for votes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's...hmm. Weird. Yeah, I think that would be the honest thing. I don't know that I get the feeling that I'm running way. I think I'm running to more than I'm running away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In? In?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like...I think, well, when I lived in France in �67. While I lived in Europe, I was a bum, different places, and I worked in England, France, (inaudible)o. and I really enjoyed it after that initial shock. It took about two months and then I got past it. No...noticed I'm talking to myself in French so that was a really great sign. And then noticed myself in talking to other people in America, really talking about the bad things.</p>

<p>[0:53:59.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not defending them at all. So, there was a time when, you know, I really had developed a more, a broader outlook, and I think that it's only fair in a human's life, not to spend an appreciable portion of it in any one culture. I just don't think it's fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you don't think it's broad enough? Is that what you mean by fair?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, fair to the human race.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If everyone, if there's no mobility of population, there's just no hope.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, look at...the yellow versus the white sphere now, I mean, that's going to be, I feel, the ultimate destruction of the earth as we know it, is the fact that there is no interchange. I mean, a ping pong match, big deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, what you're saying is it's like something you want to do to promote that interchange?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By being in different cultures?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and besides that, it's just it's really exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's fun?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just to realize it's a completely different way of life. When I consider, my father has lived in four houses, and there's a big oak tree. Once you get way to the top, you can spit on them all, depending on the direction of the wind. You know, they're all in a five-block radius. Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so little to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow! And the thing is he's quite well-traveled, I mean, there's no place. Red China is the only place he hasn't been. And yet he still comes back, because he can do it comfortably, because he didn't start traveling until he was about 50. So, everything is just so deeply ingrained in him, you can't even conceive of living somewhere else. Which, you know, is pretty sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the only way to bring up a kid is probably to be a diplomat that gets transferred every two years or something like that, or something that gets transferred every two years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, they can see a lot of places?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we're going to have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that was...that was two interesting sessions in a row. I really enjoyed that.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: This, is client number 0735-103. Client 0735-103. This, is interview number five. This, is 1970. Interview number five.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thank you both. What you said last week about your wife coming in for a couple sessions ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [If you're saying] (ph) to get across her point of view too. I don't think it's necessary for her to come in to give me her point of view for me to do therapy with you, because ... would I be a therapist, like, I'm concerned with how you feel about things, not the "facts." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's something maybe you and your wife might want to consider is, sometimes we do therapy with couples.

</p><p>PATIENT: That would be independent of what we're doing here, though.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. In fact, if you wanted it, I would think it would be better for the two of you to see somebody else as a couple than to see me, because ... Well, it would be a little funny because you've been my client, like it would ... it might set it up like I was on your side more than I really should be, or something. [0:02:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can understand that. Okay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That wouldn't mean that you would have to stop seeing me individually. I think this, is something you might want to consider.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right at the moment, it would be financially impossible. Maybe after I finish this, then we can consider taking up something like that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well that's not ... we don't feel that ... people shouldn't ... I mean, maybe it would be fine after you finish this, to do it. But if you felt that it would be a really good idea for you to do it now, we don't feel that people should decide how often they're going to come in and stuff just on the basis of money, and a few reductions could probably be arranged. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okee dokee. Something that's come into my mind, I just wanted to point out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: The last few days here, I've come up with this old idea that I've had for ... I think I've had it for years, long before I ever got married. It's something that seemed like to me that when I got married, should have disintegrated, disappeared, whatever you want to call it. It's this idea of somewhere, someone is waiting for me, you know? And you know, you think, "Well, when you get married, that was the end of it. That idea should go out the window," or something like that. And I know that I've had that feeling several times since I got married, you know. And it's something I ought to think about and pass off. Sometimes I'll think about it for months at a time. [0:04:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: In the last few days, it's been something that's come up again, you know, "Maybe there's someone in the world, there's someone for me," you know? I don't know. The more I think about this idea of calling it quits and starting all over again, the more it appeals to me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Sort of like getting a fresh start, and maybe it will be better.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But more than that, I guess maybe somebody really RIGHT for you ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, instead of just everything being circumstantial. Maybe it would be a choice matter next time. I feel like the circumstances entered in to this marriage too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. A chance to try again, this time making a choice, not sort of falling into it by circumstances.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not only from my standpoint, from the female standpoint, maybe she would choose me under non-stressing conditions. It feels like ... sometimes I get the feeling that this marriage was just sort of a happenstance. Things just happened that way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess there's something important about that too, like it would be very nice if you could feel that she freely CHOSE to marry you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like I pointed out, I think it was more [or less] (ph) ... I talked to her the other day, and she said no, that she didn't really feel that she had to get married. She says this, I don't know how truthful it is. I didn't have a lie detector at the time. But she felt that she [could have gone ahead] (ph) and had the baby and put it up for adoption or something and started out from there. Whereas I've always felt that she married me strictly from the standpoint of giving the baby a name. Well in fact, she put it that way. She could have gone ahead and got married and then after the baby was born, we could have gotten divorced and that would have been it for this go-round. [0:06:29]

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't think she'd really have done that because she'd have had the stigmatism of being a divorcï¿½e and to me, that would have been something that she wouldn't have wanted to bear, to have to carry.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So in spite of what she says, it doesn't really wash with you, that she didn't, wasn't forced by circumstances to marry you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if you read the daily news or not, but there are certain articles in the paper that I always read. And one of them is this female psychologist, I believe it is, that people write in to. And she analyzes their problems and gives them a three-column answer, or three-column session, I guess you would call it. And this woman had written in about ... in last night's paper, and of course, I was quick to point it out to my wife that I want her to read it. And this woman wrote in that she felt her marriage was going down the drain and it all had to do with the fact that they'd been married seven or eight years and the first three or four years, according to her, the husband had been out running around and when she had finally gotten wind of it, why, then they had ... he had decided to stop and she had accepted it at the time and things were seemingly back to what they should have been. And then in the last year or so, she has found a guy that she has been dating and she hasn't told her husband yet, see. So she goes and sees this guy, and every time she does, she feels like she hates her husband more. [0:08:29]

</p><p>PATIENT: So I pointed this out to my wife and had her read it, and it didn't dawn on me that she wouldn't see it the same way I did at first. But then after we got ... after she read it, we got to talking about it. She immediately ... I saw immediately that she didn't see it the way I did. I placed myself in the position of the wife, see? And my wife's in the position of this husband in this little story. And she of course read it in the fact that she was the wife in the story and I was the husband in the story. And so after I explained how I read the thing, she just looked at me and she didn't [have much] (ph) to say. And I said, "Well, I just thought maybe it ... from the way I read it, it could be us." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You surprised her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think we both surprised each other. Immediately, whenever I read something like that, I put myself in the role that I thought I fit best, and she merely put me in the role that was there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oops, I didn't follow that.

</p><p>PATIENT: The husband's role, see? I was the husband, so I was put in the husband's role, of course. Which I didn't really feel that that one fit me as much as the other role. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like the husband's role, where the husband was the one who was being rejected and the wife's role was the one who was doing the rejecting? [0:10:14]

</p><p>PATIENT: At the moment, but see, he had caused all the problem, more or less, from his previous experiences during their marriage. And since this, at least from where I sat, didn't fit me, I immediately accepted the one that I thought I fit into best - the woman who was finding out that this illicit partner was exciting, or something. You know, she decided SHE was going to get into this, or just fell into the circumstances or whatever brought it on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like YOU'RE the one who's sort of looking out and thinking, "Oh, it could be exciting out there."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've felt that. In fact when all this came to light some time ago, I immediately said, "Okay, you go ahead and see your boyfriends, I'm going to go out and see if I can't find me a girlfriend." And several things ... I don't feel that I really tried that hard. Certainly if I did try that hard, I didn't succeed. Thirdly, if I succeeded, I wouldn't know what to do, I think sometimes. So after a while, I decided that it wasn't the best thing for her to go ahead and see her boyfriends and that we'd work out some other set of rules. She brought this up last night after reading that article. She said that, well, she felt that every time she saw this one guy, she came back with more love for ME, because theirs was a ... well, he's a college graduate and everything, and she just has a high school education and she looks to him for intellectual leadership, I guess, in a limited sense. And according to her, they had a very compatible intellectual situation where she could pull out her problems and he could pull out his problems and they could help each other solve the problems of the other. And that she came back, she said, with more love for ME, and it just didn't, I didn't accept it, let's put it that way. [0:12:37]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It didn't sound right to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It to me, looks more like a ... "Well, I've been out and had my fun, now I've got to go home and butter up to my husband to make him feel better about it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. That is how you saw it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I was under the impression that her so-called love for me after him was just sort of evening the score, "Well I'll do this for him and that for him to make him even with my so-called boyfriend," I guess you might say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: This, is going back to something you said before, but I got the impression that you sort of liked telling your wife that you put yourself in the position of the wife in that story and you kind of liked the idea that YOU were looking outward.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I ... I made one statement after it, we talked about it just a little bit and then I just kind of stopped and the last statement that was made was me saying, "Well, that could be us, you know?" And she just looked at me as if to say, "Well, you trying to tell me something?" That type of a look. But I wasn't really, darn it. (slight chuckle) [0:14:09]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand you there. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I say, we talked about it a little bit and she told me how she read it and what she got from this little story and I told her that I read it different and how I felt that it, from where I sat, it was me playing this part and her playing that part and I said, "Well, maybe that's us in a year or two," or something like that. So she just kind of looked at me, it was at the end of the discussion.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You thought her look meant ... the way she looked at you meant something. And you were sort of disappointed that it didn't mean that. But I don't know what you thought it meant. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well ... you know what I said last time when I was here that I was going to go home and approach her about having a hysterectomy. I did. I didn't get the reaction that I expected, of course. Like you say, it was cruel. But ... she didn't give me the exact reaction that I expected to get, this furious "You're some kind of a nut! Get out of here!" type of thing. She merely pointed out, like I said, this couple that we swing with, this girl has a hysterectomy, I guess, or something like this, and of course, she picked it up from, "You wish I was like she is, huh?" And she said, "Do you know all the problems that she has?" And I said, "No, really, I don't ..." And she said she has to go to the hospital twice a year and she has to go to the doctor once a month or something like that for shots and she has to ... this hospital twice a year is rest and relaxation therapy and stuff like that, as I understand. She brought up something else, though, that I didn't really expect to get. She says, "Well, just suppose that something should happen to all three of our kids and we want to have some more kids. What would we do then?" And this was totally unexpected by me, because I keep thinking that she's still thinking of the idea of divorce. In two months, you know, it's going to be divorce time. And I didn't expect her to come up with something like that because, like I say, I've gotten the impression that two months from now if things don't work out just right, it's going to be divorce time. [0:16:48]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And here she is talking like she ASSUMES you're going to stay together.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like "What are we going to do this time next year?" And to me, it just isn't certain that there's going to BE this time next year, at least from the standpoint of our marriage. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Were you sort of pleased by her reaction? 

</p><p>PATIENT: To ... oh, a little bit. I've still got my ... in the back of my mind, this idea that she'll never be 100 percent what I want her to be. And it kind of disappoints me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's really sorry to be thinking "I never get all of what I want from her." 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess that's one way of putting it. I would have worded it a little different, but that's one way of saying it, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is there a way you said it that fits how you feel better than the way I said it? [0:18:06]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's not that I want so much from her, it's just that I want her to BE something that I suppose she'll never be able to be because ... the picture just doesn't fit her at all. Like I say, I prefer them short, she's tall.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's just the way it is. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. She just can't get shorter. There are several things she could do that seemingly she doesn't have that much interest in doing. And I think I've actually gone back and pointed out some of the things that, again, I suppose really I think I pointed it out several times since we've been married, things I'd kind of like for her to do that she doesn't seem to do. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I don't approach her in the right attitude, atmosphere, whatever. But there's a definite changing of attitude on my part since the therapy started. Before this therapy started, I felt a complete sense of dependency on her. To the extent that if I was going to sleep in the basement where it was cool because the weather was hot, I wanted her to. And if she wouldn't, which she doesn't .. you know, she has ... I don't know, she wants to sleep upstairs in the hot bedroom. And up until about a couple of weeks ago, I think I'd ... you know, "Well, all right, I'll have to sleep upstairs in the hot bedroom too," just to be there with her. Now I say "dependency," maybe it's a lack of trust too, I don't know. But now, the last few nights, of course, I've been sleeping in the basement where it's cool, and I noticed last night that I don't really feel this urge to jump up and run upstairs because, I don't know, like I said, maybe I'm not quite so dependent, maybe I trust her more, maybe it's something else that I haven't realized yet. [0:20:40]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it's all right for you not to be with her, and also you don't have to run up and check to make sure everything's okay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: This carries over into such things as going to the store. She'll go to the store and a 30-minute trip and it'll take her two hours. And couple of weeks ago, it bugged the heck out of me. "Where is she? What's she doing? That's a 30 minute trip to the store, she should have been back by now." Well the other night she went to the store and she was just going back to change some hose that she had bought that had run the first time she put them on and she wanted her money back on it. And she went to the store and was back in less than the time that I thought it should take, and I don't know, maybe it's reinforcing, maybe it's the fact that I'm giving her more time now in my mind to do things, I don't know. But like I told her the other day ...(phone rings). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hello? Can I call you back in a half an hour? Okay, I'll call you back then." 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, when we decided that she wasn't going to see her boyfriends anymore and I wasn't to see any girlfriends if I had any, which I don't, why, I told her then that I didn't really believe her. And it would take me two weeks to start believing her. And that anything that came up that caused disbelief would tear up the whole thing. Maybe she's trying to, like I say, build up this trust, belief, whatever you want to call it. [0:22:39]

</p><p>PATIENT: So she decided to make it a reasonable length of time that it takes to go to the store and come back. But I've actually made her take the kids with her several times just so that if there was anything planned that they'd have that much of a crimp in their style. I'm that kind of a you-know-what. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like you don't feel it's a very nice thing to do exactly, but you're going to do it, boy!

</p><p>PATIENT: You'd better believe I'm going to do it. If there's any kind of party planned, I want to make sure I throw any kind of sand in the gearbox that I can. I don't know, I was brought up to trust everybody and, like I say, it was soon pointed out to me when I got out in the cold cruel world that you couldn't trust everybody, in fact, you can't trust the majority of people, it seems like. And so now, I just don't seem to trust hardly anybody. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Come over to the other side from trusting everybody. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I used to trust people so much that it was ridiculous.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess you feel like you've been taken advantage of too often.

</p><p>PATIENT: Once too often. So from now on, it's going to be I don't trust until they can prove it. At least I don't say it, but I think it. [0:24:12]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess all in all, you've been finding yourself being a bit more relaxed and sort of feeling more like you're sufficient for yourself. But maybe not totally or anything, but ...

</p><p>PATIENT: I wouldn't want to say that this therapy started at exactly the right time, but it sure seems like it the more I think about it. It seems like I was hitting bottom on self-ambition or ambition, on self-esteem, on a lot of things. And it seems like in the last couple, three weeks, that things have kind of improved.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Things are coming up again. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And even from the standpoint of sex, it seems like there's improvement there. Maybe it's coincidental, maybe it's not. I don't know, but ... like I say, I went into this testing session there, and I made it very clear that I was quite certain that this therapy wouldn't improve things. And it's just like the old adage, "Fifty percent of any medicine is what you think it's going to do for you." If you think the medicine's going to work, it will. At least it will have a chance to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And so far, it looks like really like you thought, like it really is helping.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, thank you. That's what I thought when I answered the phone. I'm getting matches because if I don't, I'll interrupt your train of thought every time I want a cigarette. [0:26:35] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Even some of the things that I do now, I have a different outlook on how I do them then I did a month ago. For instance, last night I called this guy that rides in the carpool with me and one time his wife indicated that she liked to play tennis and I kind of like to play tennis, you know? Of course, he doesn't play tennis, he weighs about 300 pounds. And so I said, "Well, sometime I have the car, maybe we can go out and play some tennis." So last night I called him to ask him if he was going to ride with me today, and he said, "No," and I said, "Well, let me talk to your wife." This may have jarred him, but I didn't really have anything in the back of my mind except just to see if she wanted to play some tennis today when I got home from work. She had ... her little boy's got a birthday today, so she's going to have a birthday party for him. Besides that, they have friends coming in, so ... That was all I had in mind but whereas maybe a month ago, I'd have had something more than that in mind. Tennis would have been just the first step. [0:28:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And there's something ... I guess it seems good to you, about ... sort of nice to want a tennis game and that's all. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I said, my wife seemed to think that I was getting overly friendly with all our friends' wives because this idea that sex was the predominant thing in this world and that I had to get in there and participate in any way possible. And like I say, now I just don't place that much importance on it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That must be such a relief, not to have it sort of weighing on you that it's THE thing in all the world.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's given me time to think more about other things in life. Like how I'm going to finagle a better job out of somebody. One of these days. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm thinking about something. This may not be according to ... I'm going to say it and then I'll forget it. From the standpoint of the first time I came in here, the mini-skirt gave me the idea of rape on my mind, whereas now, I think it wouldn't affect me that much. Or it doesn't affect me that much. Not that at work, whenever a mini-skirt goes past I don't stop and look any less now than I did then, but that ... it seemed like at that time, every time I looked at it, I'd say, "Let's see now, where's there a nice dark corner that I can possibly get her some time?" Now, I don't really think of that. It's just nice, and go on. I keep my mind more on my business. [0:30:21]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Initially, you could hardly keep your mind off my legs and my mini-skirt, and I guess now it seems like it's sort of pleasant if I'm wearing a mini-skirt. Again, it's not such a big deal.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I still have this idea, you know, it seems funny that women wear mini-skirts and I know there are a lot of guys like me who like to kind of touch what they see, you know? Like the flowers are nice to look at and smell and everything, but every once in a while you kind of want to pick one and get real close to it, you know? That's not quite as predominant as it WAS, but it's still there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're implying that there's something about girls in mini-skirts that's a little unfair to be told "Look, but do not touch!"

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The statement was made, I don't know, I might have said this once before, that one day up in the cafeteria, there was a girl wearing a real short mini-skirt, in fact she always wears a real short mini-skirt, and a bunch of the guys sitting around ... and of course all, 99 percent of us in there are married ... sitting there and me and another guy got up and walked out. And we were talking and I said, "You know, I really wonder if she realizes what she does to all these married men around here?" I think I've said this before, that they look at her and they say, "Boy, I'm going home tonight and jump right straight in bed." And then they get home and they get this, "Not tonight because ..." [0:32:11]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's really frustrating for you to be put off like that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, at this stage of the game. I mean, if I'd been married 20, 25 years, it might not be so frustrating. It might just be a secondary thought that I had, but it seems like to me the first 10 or 15 years of marriage ... well I know when we first got married, boy, it was, every time I'd go to class and come home, "Hey, hey, let's go to bed," you know? Of course she was in the opposite frame of mind, "Why don't you jump in the lake" at the time, and to me, this set our marriage off on the wrong foot. Because you kind of expect a young married couple to ... both of them have this idea of "Hey, hey, let's go to bed" every time half an opportunity presents itself. And I guess I'm a little bit [of the sense of the word] (ph), I feel like I was robbed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's the way it should have been, it was natural, and you were cheated.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And now she wonders why we have problems. Seems like to me, it's just like a new car. If you buy a new car and you set it out at the curb and never drive the thing, it's going to deteriorate whether you want it to or not. In ten years, it will be nothing but a pile of rust out there, whereas if you use it and get the benefit out of it while it's there, fine. And then if it rusts, fine, you've got that benefit out of it. But to me, it seems like the first five years or so, the rust just piled up. And now that there's an opportunity once in a while, "Let's jump in the car and go someplace," the car won't go as fast. It won't go as far either. So ... there comes this training that I was brought up in into effect. [0:34:12]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [How do you mean?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I was brought up in a, well I'd say "semi-religious" family. Not what I'd call highly religious, but sort of semi-religious. Every time the doors of the church open, my parents were there, and of course I was drug along. And in the teachings that I've been brought up, everything's put into a little parable, they call it, or a story and you can point out what you're trying to say through this story. So I have a tendency to take everything that I say and say, "Now here's a story that goes along with it." You can pick up the meaning from the story maybe better than you can pick it up from what I'm trying to say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see what you mean, yeah. Like the car is like the parable there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. I put it in the idea of a car sitting on a curb and rusting. So there comes that training into effect. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It kind of makes you a little bit mad. You've been left to sit at the curb and rust and now she wonders why she's got problems. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. She wonders why I've got problems. It's not really that I feel that SHE has problems so much that it is that I have problems that I feel that they were caused by a great extent to her functioning (ph) or how she treated the situation in times past. [0:36:13]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something like, "She'd better not complain too much about what was her own fault."

</p><p>PATIENT: To a great extent, yeah. But like she said, I think we both kind of started out on the wrong foot and we didn't for the first few years try to get in step or anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean it was like more of a mutual thing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I probably said before, but I think that she could make me be just about anything she wanted to if she set her mind to it, but if it was like this movie they had out one time where the gal got married and the mother kind of coached her on how to train her husband by using the little book on how to train the dog, if I ever got the idea that it was along that line, I would rebel.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nobody's going to TRAIN you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't mind changing my ideas to a certain extent if that's what she would desire and it would help the situation. But as far as being a trained puppy to sit and to heel whenever commanded to, why, no. and I think it goes back to the fact that well, she's only got a high school education, I've got a college degree and maybe I should be the one that's doing the bossing and training and calling the shots more or less. That holds over into the fact that I haven't asked what your background is because I don't really want it to enter into this. I want to just assume that you've got a PhD degree and that you are a leader in this situation and that ... if you don't, I don't want to find out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Anything that would call that into question.

</p><p>PATIENT: But nonetheless at home, I keep saying, "Well, we've got to be completely frank with each other." When I know there are some situations like maybe this whole mess that I wouldn't have ... maybe been better off not to ever found out about it. But I told her, I said that if it's to be found out about, I'd rather find out from her than from somebody else. Because I can accept it better coming from her than I could from anybody else. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess the similarity that you're saying is that maybe there are some things that it's best for you not to know and you'd just as soon not know. Like your wife's affair with that guy is one thing like that and my qualifications are another. [0:40:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think that this ... her going out with these guys and everything struck me as being, "Well, all right you're not able to function, that's what your whole problem is." Just completely downgraded me, whether she intended it to be that way or not, it just kind of ... well like getting hit with a Mack truck. You just don't have too much energy to jump up and say, "Well that's all right," brush it off and go on. At least that's the way I look at it. I don't think she's able to grasp how much of a blow it was to me. I guess it was so much of a blow that I think maybe this therapy started just in time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean like it could have been so much of a blow that it could really have put you out of commission for a long time.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like wondering just how much water you can put in the boat before it would sink. I don't know what sinking would be, but nonetheless it just seemed like that there was just about to that point where the boat was ready to sink. Maybe it's all just the way I look at things.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you've really felt on the verge of sinking. Like now, like you've just gotten ... started to get pulled out in time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. At least the pumps are running and maybe some of this water will be out of the boat before we go down. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of reassuring to hear those pumps running. [0:41:53]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (inaudible) all in my mind. But last couple, three weeks, like I say, I came in here thinking, "Well, I don't know whether it's psychological or physical." In the last couple, three weeks I completely placed it in the psychological. "Actually, there's nothing wrong with me physically," I have said to myself. Convinced myself. And if there's anybody that can convince me of anything, it's me. All I have to do is set my mind to it and it's law, whether it is or not. I mean, I could care less whether it is or not, as long as I think it is, it's that way to me. It's like that sign we used to have in the research section (inaudible) "My mind is like concrete, once it's set, it's hard to change." I guess I'm just like everybody else. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're talking about a kind of strength you have. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not so much strength that it maybe ... no, I didn't mean that from the standpoint of that concrete, that was just a statement that we have. It's not that I feel like I'm any stronger than anybody else, it's just that I feel like I'm capable of doing anything anybody else would be able to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's not like an arrogance or looking down on people, but it's like some kind of solidity in yourself. [0:44:07]

</p><p>PATIENT: I told my boss there about back just before the first of the year, whenever they're supposed to be getting ready to put in people for raises, and I said, "Well, the only thing that motivates me on this job is money." And then of course I got the lousy raise that I did and it struck me as being, "Well, we don't really care whether you work here or not." So for a while, there, I just didn't care whether I produced or not. And here lately, like I say, I've been doing a little more work, the other day he said to me that he'd noticed that I was putting out some good work, doing good work, whatever you want to call it, and I passed it off as saying, "Well, maybe there's an improvement, but I really don't think there's been that much improvement." What I was trying to say to him was, "Gee, you put the right amount of money in my paycheck and you just watch how much improvement there'd be." But this goes right over into home life. If my wife was to motivate me more than she does, I think there'd be so much improvement that she wouldn't be able to stand it. It would be a little bit of doing on her part that she'd have to have the ambition to do and then she would see tremendous improvement on my part. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you want something for your efforts.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's not so much that I want something tangible or something that's there now, it's just that I want the idea that it will be there from now on. I still have this uneasy feeling that everything's going to come to a screeching halt one of these days, and this doesn't tend to make me want to pave any roads. Why pave the road when you can get by with a dirt road because there's not going to be any road there one of these days? [0:46:10]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's also the idea that maybe you're going to get divorced makes you not want to put a whole lot into the marriage, make a whole lot of changes for her sake. Maybe it will all be for nothing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: At first, that's the way I looked at it. But now, I say, "Well, do it for yourself." You know, it's not so much for her, because maybe she won't be there one of these days. Do it for yourself, from the standpoint that it will benefit you. So that's how a great deal of my thinking goes right now, because like I say, I don't feel I get the motivation from her to do that much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're running on your own motivation.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's just not that much dependence on her or what she does or what she says now as there has been in the past. And to me, this, is kind of good, because like she said, this may be coming to a screeching halt one of these days, so why build a building when the foundations are going to collapse? So I go out here and I'll make my own foundations, I'll build my building on that. And then if it collapses, then it will be my own doing and not so much anybody else's. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nobody else will be able to pull the foundations out from under you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:48:09] 

</p><p>PATIENT: I look at a lot of marriages that there's such a close knit-ness that if one of the partners I think was ever to say, "Well, let's have a divorce and call it quits," the other person would just go berserk because they wouldn't be able to take it. And I say that they probably would, I don't know, maybe they wouldn't. But nonetheless, from my own standpoint, I'm going to try to work at it from "protect yourself first and look out for the world next." Which is common.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which is ...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Which is common. You know, the saying goes, "Look out for little old number one."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Am I right that it feels good to you to be building your own foundations and looking out for yourself and not being dependent? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, if the idea that this dependency can be shattered and maybe what I would view as no doing of my own, yeah. I don't know, I've always been one that would like to do things for other people. Maybe it sounds selfish, but if it's convenient at all I'll do something for somebody else, maybe even to the point where up until now where I could do something for somebody else before I'd do something for myself. But there again, it's "if properly motivated" type of thing. [0:50:09]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You want to do things for other people, but you don't like to be taken advantage of.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even this church group work that I got into, I found that as I had to take hold of more of the responsibility, I was willing to do anything for the sake of the church group, even if it was pushing my family aside to accomplish this. Like I say, for instance, well, not necessarily the church group, but the members also. I got into the church group program there at this church where we go and I was on the committee and of course I have a station wagon and so quite frequently they call and say, "Hey, we need to take these members out to this overnight meeting," and "Oh yeah," I'd be there, Johnny-on-the-spot. And I think my wife sometimes even to a point of resenting it. It kind of bothered her. For instance, one time, I went out ... we were flat broke, I think we had about $5 'til payday type of situation, and payday wasn't just around the corner, it was a week or so away. And I took this money and took these members off to this meeting and bought some gas for the car to get back home with this last $5 and consequently I think she had to write a rubber check to get some groceries to put on the table. And this, is maybe things like that that bothers her, but that's just the way I am. If it's for the benefit of the church, which I think is something good, why, I'd do it. Maybe she doesn't understand how I think about things like that. [0:52:09]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When other people are treating you right, you're really willing to put yourself out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. This goes back to my job, even. There have been times up until about a year or so ago where I would ... maybe I didn't feel I was getting paid the most, like I should, I felt I wasn't making what I would like to be making, let's put it that way, but nonetheless, I'd go jump on a plane on a Monday morning, go into the lab in Massachusetts, and spend 12 hours a day in the lab and come back. And of course the boss doesn't know how many hours you spent in the lab and you don't really get a chance to make a point of it, you know, "I spent 12 hours in the lab each day out there and that's a 60 hour week and I think you owe me something." Of course, you don't get to say things like that to him, you just kind of say, "Well maybe somebody out there will mention it to my boss and it will be a feather in my cap." But it doesn't seem like it did me any good. So now, I just say, "Well if I go to the lab, it's going to be only on the circumstances that it's convenient to me and come to working 12 hours in the lab only if it HAS to. If there's no other way to get around it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you're not going to keep on extending yourself indefinitely if it's not appreciated.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even to the standpoint of family life enters into this, how much you work. About two months ago, I guess it was, I had to go down to the lab in Missouri, and I got down there and didn't make too much progress the first afternoon that I was there. Called my wife and talked to her and got homesick, I guess you'd say, (phone rings) [0:54:22]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hello? Okay I'll call down (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: So about, well the next morning, I decided that I was going to get in the lab and get all my work done if I had to break my back. I had two projects going at the same time in different parts of the lab. Got the work done, jumped in the car and came back so I could be home that night. And I don't know, maybe it wasn't so much the fact that I really was lonesome, as the fact that was I was afraid she'd been doing something that I didn't want her to do. And if I was home, maybe I could put a crimp in it, you know, like I say, throw a little sand in the gears. Of course at the time, I completely had myself convinced it was the fact that I wanted to be with her. But now I'm beginning to wonder. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, should we schedule an appointment for next week? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is Monday okay? I may be out of town in the last half of next week. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I was thinking there's a possibility we might take off for a week or so. That's also a possibility, but I'll be sure to call in advance. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's fine. I don't think I have your phone number.

</p><p>PATIENT: Home phone number? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: inaudible. [0:56:07]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And at work?

</p><p>PATIENT: inaudible. Now there's two extensions in the room where I work. A lot of the time I don't work in the room. So it would be better to call 412 which is my boss's phone number and leave a word with the secretary.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Once in a while I have to cancel at the last minute. Is 2:00 okay? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Bye.

</p><p>END TRANSCRIPT</p>

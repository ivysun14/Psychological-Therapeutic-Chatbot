<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of cold. (chuckle)</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>I don't know. What should I talk about? (chuckle) (pause) What did we talk about last time (pause) that was significant? [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) I guess I could answer that but I'm kind of curious about where you are right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm okay today. I started work on my novel after so many months, yesterday and today. So I'm feeling a lot better I guess. (chuckle) (pause) And I saw my mom on Wednesday very briefly for lunch. She came over and we were walking out together and she was going to take the bus and I was going to walk ahead and she started crying on the bus (chuckle), on the bus stand. She's like, "(inaudible) I miss you a lot. What can I do?" And then she teared up. I told her to be strong and all that. But it's funny, the way she said it, it was almost as though she was talking to my dad and not me. (chuckle) (pause) The pronoun she used to address me is one she used to use for my dad. She never uses that pronoun for me. (chuckle) [00:02:38]</p>

<p>(pause) In more ways than one I guess I've replaced my dad for her but I can't really fulfill the duties of her spouse. I can barely (chuckle) fulfill the duties of a girlfriend. (pause) I'm severely lacking in that aspect. (pause) So now you can answer my question (chuckle) if what we talked about from last time was anything significant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Significant to you or to me? [00:03:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to this thing we're doing here. (chuckle) (pause) I think there's a lot of babble so sorting through that is probably not an easy task. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Babbling in your mind right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well like, always.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it seems like when you're here and talking there are things that feel very sort of significant and real to you. So that's why I'm wondering like do they go away in between sessions or like...yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? [00:04:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well last time there were a lot of things that came up that seemed like really stuck with you so I'm wondering what happened to them. When you come in and say, "Well, what should we talk about?" or "Is there anything significant?" as if last session didn't happen maybe or where did they go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! No, like I said, when I feel like there's a lot of babble so probably sorting through them helps identify—okay, this is one major issue or here's the root cause of some of the issues. So that's all. I mean, I'm sure like stuff from last time I've been thinking about. It's just there are so many things to think about (chuckle), you know? I just meant like sort of [English chatter] (ph) which I feel... I'm kind of leery of [English chatter] (ph) (chuckle). Because I just think it's good to make (pause) stuff come to where you know...it feels like I'm getting stuff done if I'm given a topic on which to speak (chuckle). So it's like when I'm not, start talking! (chuckle) [00:05:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I would be the one to organize you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! (chuckle) That's a very good way of putting it (chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe then we can sort of identify that as one of the problems is that you're feeling just disorganized and looking to see if someone can help organize you because it doesn't feel like it can come from within.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I felt like for a long time unfortunately and that's probably because (pause)...yeah I guess maybe because [what you're saying] (ph) that I'm in turmoil or like I am going through stuff where I'm unhappy. So probably there are so many things that I feel I cannot get a handle on that it's just like a mess. So I need help (chuckle) sorting through that mess.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:06:57] to [00:07:19)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the mess?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so messy I don't know what it is. (chuckle) I don't know, like (pause) not being happy, not...feeling burdened or feeling trapped or feeling...(pause) Yeah I guess being afraid and then trying to think about why I feel that way and then just thinking there's too many things to get through and then just feeling kind of defeated by all that because one thing leads to another. Like, "Oh my gosh, things with (inaudible) aren't going well," or things with my mom aren't going well. "Oh my gosh, I'm thinking about someone else."</p>

<p>(silence from [00:08:18] to [00:09:08)</p>

<p>I guess if you can address or we can address this whole thing of feeling trapped? (pause) I don't know why I feel that way.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:09:23] to [00:10:27)</p>

<p>I really feel trapped these days so (chuckle) I can't really (pause) speak about that.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:10:34] to [00:10:56)</p>

<p>I don't even feel like I enjoy stuff more if it's not feeling like a burden but then everyone must (chuckle) feel that way. Like last night David (ph) was saying that—just out of the blue—he said something that he doesn't think he wants to get married anymore. So it's like, "Oh! That's a new thought!" (chuckle) He goes, "[Until] (ph). I'll wait for you for another year and then I'm going to leave you because I want to get married and actually..." And now he's like, "Oh, maybe not. I'm happiest when I'm working." So I was like, "That's good!" I suddenly felt really free. I suddenly felt really happy and (pause) that we could know each other just like this for a long time and if I did want to have a child we could get married. (chuckle) I don't know. That made me feel really free.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:11:58] to [00:12:18)</p>

<p>But it's like your life happens only on the weekdays, you know? Like he was saying last weekend (inaudible). (pause) He was like...no, I was asking him, "So, do you have...do you know how to have fun on the weekends?" He's like (pause), "No I don't," and I was like, "Why is that?" and he didn't have an answer but it just made me wonder why—is that me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, maybe it's my cell phone. Sorry. [00:13:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) That worried me a lot. Like this was like...because everything that's happened between us is like the reason why I should break up, you know? Or it's the reason why I cannot break up. So I guess we're thinking about that nowadays this year. But from our last conversation, how can I be expansive (ph) and free and fun? And it's funny because people perceive me as all of those things. They...like his mom, David's (ph) mom is like... (chuckle) I was trying to bait her. I was trying to just like (pause) say, when she's like, "When are you guys getting married?" she just asked me point blank or something maybe more subtle to that, I was just like, "You know, maybe someone else is better for David (ph). Someone who is as hard working as him. Someone who is intellectual like him and ambitious." She's like, "No, you are perfect. He needs balance and you are not any of those things." (chuckle) Maybe she didn't say it that way. You know, like, "So it's good that you guys will be perfect together because he's all work and you're not all work," or not at all work? (chuckle) I don't know what she meant. But people do see me as interesting and fun but I just don't...I fear that I'm not those things. It's like if something goes wrong then I won't be those things and they will just completely hate me, which they sometimes do. (chuckle) [00:15:07]</p>

<p>(pause) I just have this mortal fear of (pause) of being bored or being (pause) alone as David's (ph) in some God-forsaken (chuckle) place. I just have a fear of places like that.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you'll be trapped with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With him, with my thoughts, with a place. And he's interesting too. I mean, he can dig (pause) our way out of that dark tunnel of boredom, of un-interestingness (sp). But he didn't. The last few times he didn't. And one time I was thinking that he didn't and I was miserable (chuckle) and I'm just so afraid of being miserable. I don't know why. (chuckle) [00:16:31]</p>

<p>(pause) I feel like a character in (inaudible) (chuckle). A very atypical (inaudible), like a flapper novel (ph). (sigh) (pause) Do you know people like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People like...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: People who face this issue of just being terrified of being bored or whatever, being in a sad place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you ask that what do you think you're looking for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just some kind of (chuckle) a marker of where I am on the chart. (chuckle) Or just like what normal is and how off I am from that or just like (pause) remedies or just how other people deal with this. It's like when you're sad, or when you're really sad, you're like, "Am I the only one who's feeling this way right now? The sun is up. The birds are chirping. Why am I sad? Is someone else feeling this way? Is it the condition of my age? Is it age as in the time we live in?" [00:17:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so is it that you're hoping that other people do feel the way you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it could go either way. (chuckle) I don't want people to be miserable but if they are then I would like to know how they deal with it.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so how other people might deal with it would be like a guide for how you could?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you have these feelings it sounds like you feel lost and not knowing where to go or what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I suppose. Like when I feel like what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well on one hand, what helps someone not feel sad may have nothing to do with what would help you not feel sad. They might not be correlated or related at all. But in your mind they might be. So I'm wondering why that would be, in terms of wanting to feel less of whatever your feeling or more good, why you would look to how someone else deals with it. I'm wondering what that's about. [00:19:15]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What feeling good is like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, why someone else would be able to tell you anything (ph) differently. Why someone else would be able to model that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know! That's just the way I am. I don't know how to...I can't dig myself out of spaces. I don't have the confidence that I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you feel helpless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:19:46] to [00:20:09)</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn. I don't know...I'm trying to feel more confident about certain things. (pause) Like, when I was back home I made a little plan of what I was going to do in this city that I was born in and that I'm writing about. I felt very afraid. I felt very inadequate navigating the place. I was (inaudible) but even in that list I made I was like, "I hope I'm able to do a good job. I hope I'm able to cover the things that I want to cover. I hope (pause) I'm present (pause) intellectually and emotionally when I visit these places so I can write about them, do justice to them." But I felt this literally palpable sense of inadequacy when I was (pause) travelling and I was seeing those places. [00:21:29]</p>

<p>I always have this constant sense of inadequacy I guess but when I sit down (pause)...like this afternoon I sat down and I wrote about what I saw, I felt pleased that it was...all the elements were there that I know should be there. My observances were interesting and sharp and I'm being objective here. Obviously I will polish...the end product will be good but I just wish I could shake that feeling (chuckle) of feeling inadequate or feeling like my list for navigating the city is somehow lacking or not the kind of list that a real writer or a real grown up or interesting person would make. [00:22:35]</p>

<p>At least that was at home so I felt like I could do some justice to understanding the place. When I'm travelling in America it's completely like that feeling of inadequacy and out of place is off the charts (chuckle). I just feel completely (pause) like curling up into a little ball (chuckle) at times. I mean, it's not constantly there all the time but I'm just saying (pause) yeah, it feels like...well I guess this is what writers have been talking about for so long, you know? The feeling of exile. That's probably (chuckle) not what we should be talking about here (chuckle). [00:23:36]</p>

<p>But going back to feeling helpless, I wish I could rely...dig within myself and find that strength of knowing that I can dig myself out. I create cesspools of (pause) sadness where none exist. (chuckle) I feel I do that too. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you say about writers writing about exile and then you said, "We shouldn't talk about that here. That's not something to talk about here"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just mean like...I didn't want to go off the topic. What I was thinking about I was just telling myself—that's not veering back to the conversation. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe feeling exiled is part of the conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I'm just suggesting that. [00:24:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's probably...I mean we can but I guess my more immediate fear is not being able to deal with it. Writers, they are probably...some of them are depressed and they probably are in therapy (chuckle). But at least their depression or their concern or their meanderings—intellectual meanderings—that produce texts (ph) that a few people can read. So that's good. That's productive. (chuckle) Depression of (inaudible) but in my case it's like, "Maybe it is productive but a lot of it is, I feel, damaging. (pause) So I don't want...(sigh) I don't understand what...what I'm trying to say is that I shouldn't set the tone of my relationship based on those unfulfilled moments, those moments of feeling lost or bored or helpless on a trip we took together, you know? I don't know. Maybe other people went through that. (chuckle) Maybe I shouldn't. [00:26:33]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you wonder what other people do is the feeling one of isolation, that you feel isolated from others?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel isolated. (pause) I don't have friend with whom I've brought this up. I guess I could. But I just feel, again, (pause) we talked about this as well but feeling like I've lost out. I feel very (pause) again inadequate. I just want to imagine about other people's experiences, certain experiences. Like I made a new friend and she is single right now. She's a few years older and she's single and she was talking about all the great sex she had in El Paso (chuckle) and I just felt a little shy or embarrassed because I hadn't had any or because I'm stuck (chuckle) in this place. [00:27:51]</p>

<p>(silence from [00:27:52] to [00:28:10)</p>

<p>Maybe this is one of the reasons why people sense that I'm not quite an adult, this feeling of helplessness. I shouldn't feel helpless. They look for (pause) approval and they look for guides as to what an adult around them might be doing in the same situation.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you have this feeling do you feel like a child?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, maybe I do. The feeling of when I'm asking what other people do or when...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The feeling of helplessness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I just feel like someone should be around to help me out. (chuckle) (pause) Yeah, I feel very small. (pause) I'm leVictorng I guess. (pause) But, I look around my room and I tell myself this was my decision. My room is here and I am in it because of a decision I made. And these books are here because of something I am doing. (chuckle) I try, but (pause) that's the thing, I cannot break up with him and I cannot be on my own because he is such (pause) a boulder, you know? I don't know if that has negative connotations or positive but (pause) I [can really] (ph) stop thinking about him because I was occupied with thinking about someone else but he provides some kind of structure and he provides a lot of (pause) emotional support I guess. [00:30:46]</p>

<p>Like Wednesday (pause)—I think Wednesday—yeah Wednesday I was working in the library and then I went home and it was a miserable night, it was raining and stuff, but I was just feeling very, very low. I don't know why. I was just not even wanting to go down to the kitchen and make anything and we have a beautiful...I live in a beautiful home. It's a big kitchen and three other roommates and all but I just felt like completely unable to move. And then I met David (ph) for dinner. </p>

<p>And then like last night, again I was working and I didn't really know what to do with myself and I decided to go over to David's (ph) place. He was coming back from home and he was cooking and just like the thought of that gave me so much peace. He's taught or you know, worked, at the university and now he's coming back and now he's making dinner. (chuckle) He just makes me feel very, very secured, tethered (ph). Although not having that would have made me feel very untethered (ph). I wonder how one of my single friends would have been in that situation. Probably free to do what they want probably also to their own system, to their own structure. But I feel like I don't have that structure at all. Maybe I can learn to create it but right now it's like (pause) I'm a little (pause) creeper (chuckle) like with the little tendrils and holding on to the structure (chuckle) that David (ph) provides. He's like (inaudible) tendrils.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:33:11] to [00:33:54)</p>

<p>And actually I'm deriving and it's only been a week (chuckle)—maybe a little bit longer—but I'm deriving some little amount of joy in this (chuckle) dependency. Maybe it's bad. Maybe it's not so bad, but... (pause) Like, I feel quite alright that (pause) I'll go to his place and he'll feed me. He comes over and I feed him too so it's not like (pause)... but I don't feel as solidly grounded as (pause) what I'm feeling [as he might] (ph) (chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say pleasure it almost seems like a guilty pleasure. [00:34:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Guilty? (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said it with a little bit of trepidation, hesitation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) I did! (pause) I don't know what was behind that. A sense of (pause) I'd say not guilt but more like (pause)...I don't feel guilt. It's more like kind of funny. It's fun to (pause) (inaudible) on him like that, like it gives me a little bit of a thrill. (chuckle) (pause) And thrill for me is like (pause) it's not something that's right. (chuckle) It's this whole other Pandora's Box. (chuckle) [00:35:53]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>That was the thrill I had going over to Victor's (ph) place. (chuckle) There's a whole other kind of thrill! (laughter) (pause) But should I feel like I have to create my own structure? Is there harm in feeling like a little tingle?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Should I know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know! (chuckle) Do you have such notions about your—I don't want to say patients but I don't know what you call us. Like once you get to know someone do you know that okay, this emotional state is probably (inaudible) for her. That is probably not helpful. What is the goal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do I have those thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you? Yeah. [00:37:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah it sometimes takes me a moment to answer your questions because I'm not...I'm often trying to think through what the question might be about. I'll answer that one. Let me go back to that one. When I think more about the question that you asked at the beginning that...you said babbling, "I have a lot of babble. So basically you tell me what's important." As I'm thinking about it more what stuck out for me is the sense of feeling lost and wanting someone to sort of reach out their hand and sort of guide you in a particular way and help maybe minimize the babble and maximize someway of organizing yourself. And it sounds like that same experience, in terms of your thoughts, happens in physical space too, like in terms of sometimes not knowing what to do with yourself. [00:38:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Do you feel that way, like you don't know what to do with yourself? (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go with that. What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know you at all because you don't say anything and I talk a lot. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? I don't say anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean to say that we'd be in different chairs (laughter) for me to know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's true, I don't talk much about myself personally. Is that...how does that feel for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels odd but that's the nature of the thing we're doing. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels...can you say more about the odd feeling? [00:39:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean, like I'm more used to (pause)... well I hate talking about myself. So with my friends, I want to be a good listener so I want just to absorb their stories and their issues or whatever and listen to them. And again, this might sound too charitable (chuckle), but there's a very uncharitable motivation behind that too because when they talk about themselves I feel more in control of that relationship, of that conversation, that dialogue because I feel like I have an upper hand if I know something about them (pause), more than they might know about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like I have the upper hand? [00:40:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) Because you know a lot more about me and you could judge me and you could (pause), if we were friends, then you would decide not to be my friend anymore based on all the stuff you knew about me. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you worry about what I think about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not so much, but like if we were friends, yeah. (chuckle) By now? Yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so what makes this different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) it's a professional relationship so it's not as...it's different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel like I judge you less? Or do you feel like I just don't take my judgments into account or how does that work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess (pause) I don't think about that. I think about (pause)...I think more about that this is helpful for me and for the first time (chuckle) therapy is actually...getting something out of it. And I want to be in a better place emotionally because of it so I value it a lot, I guess. [00:41:45]</p>

<p>And I guess I should say I feel trust as well. I feel like again, and not like what I said in the beginning (chuckle), can you guide my hand? I feel like (pause)...I feel guided in some ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm glad you feel you can trust me and I hope to live up to your gift of trust in me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you are. (chuckle)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have a lot to learn together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean I do. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I do and we do together. I feel like we have a very interesting journey ahead of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah? (chuckle) I wonder what you mean by that! (laughter) [00:42:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Does it sound cryptic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? (pause) Well there's so much to understand and learn and figure out how I can help you be in a better place in your life and more importantly within yourself. And (pause) I have the tool...together I think we have navigation tools but we don't have the map.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What could be the map?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The map is what unfolds. I don't know. I don't know if we need a map. I think we just need good navigation tools.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Okay. (chuckle)</p>

<p>(silence from [00:43:25] to [00:44:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking about David. (ph) (chuckle)</p>

<p>(Silence from [00:44:10] to [00:44:34)</p>

<p>And of our very weird relationship. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would like to hear more about this weird relationship but we're going to need to stop for today. So I will see you on Monday, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What time on Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 11:00. That's what I have you in for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 11:00? Nothing any earlier?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we had talked about this before. For the time being I don't have anything earlier on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could we do 3:00?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have anything else on Monday right now. 11:00 is the only time I have for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can certainly...I think I mentioned the earlier time might become available. The time right before, it would be like 10:00 or 10:15. Is that something that would work better for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't have that right now. It might come available though. I'll certainly keep you informed, okay? [00:45:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, because I think this worked well. I started work earlier and finished at 2:30 so that's good. That's like five hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I have you right now...I have you at 11:00 on Monday and 9:00 on Wednesday. That's what we have for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, for next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It would be good to find our time that we can meet regularly so that we both know that we have the time available. So is that...because I think that's what I put in my book. Does that not work for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't know about...so Monday at 11:00 and Wednesday at 9:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's what I have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll make a note. This time works well. So like Fridays at 3:00 so if you have, or if you want to make that... [00:46:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no I don't. So what I had told you...let me take a look. Unfortunately Cecelia I don't have that much...I have a few sessions available but not many. I don't have this as an ongoing time available. Like I was thinking the Monday and Wednesdays when we meet, that's what I have. I just want to make sure we weren't misunderstanding each other. I thought that that's what you had said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I thought for some reason you had said Monday and Friday but Monday and Wednesday could work too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay do you have that? The Monday at 11:00 and Wednesday at 9:00?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I will make note.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it must be a misunderstanding. I don't have Friday. I'm actually not usually in my office Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well so I'll see you Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, bye bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good weekend!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, you too. [00:47:08]</p>

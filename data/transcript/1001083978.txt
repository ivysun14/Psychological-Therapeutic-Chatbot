<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, we'll talk about that after.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Want me to explain my side effects?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's total disarray here.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's all right, I live in disarray.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Give me a second, let me just finish this e-mail.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's find your chart.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is there such a thing as array?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ray? What?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Array?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Array, yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I live in a world of array.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, well, usually the bottles were arrayed in -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I spoke with your psychologist, not recently, but maybe within the last two or three weeks.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He filled me in on some of what's going on, but, uh, I always get a better story from you than through him.  I even forgot what he told me except that the marital issues are quite charged.  Is that fair to say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's fair to say, but I think it's, things are intensified because of the increase in acting out of our son over his, um, now going into puberty and really starting to display some of those symptoms of bipolar in a rather dramatic way so the house is constantly tense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's clearly a bipolar to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, to me, I mean he's lovey dovey one minute and he cold-cocked me while I was driving the other day.  I mean literally while we were driving down the street, um, he punched me in the side of the face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, and you know, he's on Depakote and Seroquel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why did he hit you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I wouldn't take him for Burger King.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you take him to Burger King after?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hell, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.  Take Burger King away for a year, something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh and, uh, there's, so he views everything as us being on the same page.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're claiming the tension is around that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, a lot of fuel on the fire.  And she, and she says of course that's true, but we don't seem to have a working plan for how to deal with him in certain situations.  I've been involved with [INAUDIBLE] support this.  I've been saying we don't have support, we should get support.  We can't call up our child's therapist when he's in the middle of punching out his father or his mother or threatening someone with a knife.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The therapist said point blank don't call me about things like this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's been very elusive about it, which leads me to believe he has no idea what [INAUDIBLE]. It's a thing to do and it may be essential to do when he's two years older.  He's still [AGE] and he hurts when he hits and if I had been driving like down the left side of the highway, who knows.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did you respond?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I pulled the car over and I stopped myself from punching him in the jaw, uh</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did you do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I just cooled down.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I imagine you told him it's not acceptable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah. And that's certainly not going to get you what you want.  If I were a different kind of daddy, I'd probably have you outside the car kicking your ass.  I said you're not going to be able to punch me and think that [INAUDIBLE] but let me tell you, you're still too little, I can still kick your ass.  So we got home and he wouldn't get out of the car.  The last time he did that, he threatened to [INAUDIBLE] knobs and radios, stuff like that, and killed the battery, luckily I carry a spare charger in my trunk just for that reason, well, not for that reason, but it's always a good thing, pop open the trunk and [INAUDIBLE] and I said to his mother, I'm getting close to hurting our son, um, can you please deal with him.  Eventually, he came out of the car, so we got him out together and she brought him inside to where she did lose her temper more than I did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She did?  Based on what he had done to you or what [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Based on what he had done to her.  He said [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He was in quite a state, huh? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe the medicine [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We don't know.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right now, he's still getting Depakote, Seroquel, and Prozac.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You might cut back on the Prozac</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, well</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyway, uh, the relationship, yknow, it is what it is.  I mean, it's, um, she's getting to point where I can't change you, you can't change me, yknow, we have a son here to parent.  We have to figure out a way so we can all coexist peacefully in the house and what are we going to do to do that.  We have been doing all we can to try to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's overwhelming.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's every minute of every day you're on edge.  Now there are days when he's absolutely charming and he can go through a whole day and night, um, being so sweet and loving and all that stuff, very sensitive, then he goes through that part and other parts he can be depressed, but when he gets the manic part, then he can be a total [INAUDIBLE], but the aggressive part, I mean it's really -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And impulsive. It's sounds like he's got real impulse issues. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that must be [INAUDIBLE] in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's like this, it's like trying to hold a snake, and it's, uh, it's really hard.  So obviously it drives our, you know, well you should have, you should have, you should have.  In the beginning, which I don't say anymore.  I said [NAME OTHER], [INAUDIBLE], what do I know.  You have your master's degree from [DEIDENTIFIED] in early childhood and parent education.  You tell me, I'll follow you, but it's not that easy, obviously, since [INAUDIBLE].  We went to a guy who worked with a bipolar child, we went to lectures and [INAUDIBLE], we talked to this guy in [DEIDENTIFIED] who's supposed to be an expert, and it's like, uh, hum.  I mean there are books about what do you do.  But, you need an army of like staff.  It's like [INAUDIBLE]. So it's two people basically going out of their mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The main thing to do and we'll leave it here is, uh, what we do here is set firm limits.  Yknow, until things stabilize in whatever way, in your marriage and everything, you've got to set firm limits.  You've got to, yknow, be crystal clear of the things to do that you can't get away with and even then some of it's impulsive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm leaving then, well, then I'm not going to school, but it's a three hour and I'm the type of person who likes to slowly unwind before he goes so I can reach some type of tranquility, but he lectures it up so much that I am like, at the time I should be sleeping, I'm wired so I can't be a [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's not forget, you have a mood disorder, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.  Sometimes I'm going in the opposite direction.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Actually, it's a great stimulus for us to know that your mood disorder is in good control that you can manage this and not really unravel is pretty impressive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, my response is usually to ignore it when I'm so mad rather than to act out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's pretty healthy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's like the drunks say, well at least you didn't go out and get drunk.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You took the day off.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But to [NAME OTHER] it's like, you know, you abandon -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're disengaged, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the best you can do.  But sometimes that okay when she goes out and slams the door and goes for a ride or goes to the [DEIDENTIFIED] or the symphony or the opera or whatever.  [INAUDIBLE]. I watch Time and nature shows and, and sleep and go to work and go to AA meetings.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Listen, you're going through a rough patch.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She didn't say, she has not has a - we've tried to have a conversation and, uh, yknow, I'm not suggesting that we get a divorce or be together or we, you know, in the back of my mind I'm saying I'm going to go look for the, uh, newspaper and find a studio somewhere, a little place like a studio [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, are you really starting to look?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. Not yet. And it wouldn't be [INAUDIBLE] permanent, it would be like one of us gets so nuts and needs to get out for a while.  I've gone to a hotel, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to decompress. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  She thinks I go to a hotel room and, you know, with a bus load of people from [DEIDENTIFIED].  [INAUDIBLE], you know that's not happening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, let's bracket that for a moment.  When I saw you about a month ago, your mood was fine, you were oversleeping, energy was low, your self esteem was low, feeling a little helpless.  Um, we thought you were in the low end on your moods and we made changes to Depakote, Zoloft, Sonata, Xanax, Ativan, Provigil.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, do you have the, um, what level we were on written down for the Depakote?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Depakote, you're on 1500.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Three of the 500.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that what you're taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is there a particular, see here's the problem, um, I think it's the timing of some of the medications and also I think some of the side effects, unless I have problems that I don't want to even think about, but anyway, a lot of the side effects of drugs are urinary, you know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Erections?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, urinary</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Frequency?  Do you urinate too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you can't urinate?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  That's not a problem.  And, uh, you know, I mean I don't want to turn into [NAME OTHER], you know, pissing in a day room.   </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Had you ever had any urinary issues before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have accidents?  Urinate on yourself sometimes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, no.  I started to wear Depends sometimes, not every day, not every </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's mostly at night that you have these problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It could be anytime.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even during the day?  Do you take anything in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well, you know, here's the problem, since the medication, almost all have the dry mouth and mouth infections, I find myself, I'm always drinking tea, I'm always drinking coffee and perhaps that's not a good idea.  I don't want that to be a big topic of the conversation, but it's probably not related to my medicine.  I have other meds that do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The meds you're on don't really do that.  You know, the, some of it, the Depakote, the Ativan, it relaxes things enough, sometimes people can urinate on themselves.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's almost as if anxiety will bring it on, the effect.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I did read about as a condition, that particular condition.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's presented itself. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, have you been to a urologist?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum-um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No?  Why don't you see a urologist?  There are things to do for B P [INAUDIBLE] and you're at the right age to be suffering.  Did your father have it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He was, I mean, I don't think so.  No, I mean he was in, by the time he was [AGE], but, uh, no I don't think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, I see you're bombarded by, the broken-dow-, I mean it's, uh -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean really the guy who gets to see the whole game, yknow.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your mood been in general these past six weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it goes from - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't want to know where it goes from. How's it been? [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lower than that, worse than that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mood is low, does that mean you're sad much of the time?  Or are you just frustrated with your life?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sad and frustrated.  Sometimes I feel dysfunctional because of not being able to get a handle on all this stuff.  You know, you read the books about how to deal with a bipolar child, they tell you forget about it, you know, don't take it personal. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If we put you out on a desert island without your kid and without your wife, what would your mood be like?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Would there be conceptions?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, with a beautiful woman. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It would probably be very, it would probably be good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] three weeks ago.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's like this.  There's no responsibility, there's nobody yelling at me.  I heard a couple speakers, went to a couple meetings, went to the movies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, the question I really have is are you in a depression or are you struggling with real, yknow, stuff, life issues that keep pulling you down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's really hard to draw that line.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you've been through real depressions in your life.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is this what it feels like?  Remember, depression often has sleep, appetite, concentration, self-esteem, energy level, thoughts of death, moving to slow, not getting pleasure from anything.  Are you in that state now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. However, there are, you know, there are things that, you know, isolated incidences when everything clicks right, where I feel just absolutely normal.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long could that last?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Until somebody fucks it up.  [INAUDIBLE].  I'm sorry for the F word, you know, but I figure [INAUDIBLE].  It's a horrible thing to be said, but I think [INAUDIBLE].  Especially after, yknow, I listen to Def Comedy Jam all the time.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're black.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I know. That's the whole thing. I just like it, and Billy Crystal's with 'em.  Anyway, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Howard Stern gets away with it.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I know, he does.  They gotta pay to see him.  We went to see a great movie the other night, and he's [AGE] and there's a lot of kids and there's this great movie theatre in [DEIDENTIFIED] where each seat is like a recliner and they have big cup holders, [INAUDIBLE], big screen, yknow, it was a 3D movie that Disney movie, Meet the Robinsons. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's 3D the way it was probably thought 3D should've been when they first invented it.  These things actually come out of the screen.  It's almost like an interactive.  Like they come and have conversations right in front of you, they go back into the screen, little things, yknow, and we had an awesome time and he kept saying mom, dad, this is so cool.  After that, we went out to eat, we had a great time, we went home, we all stayed, layed on the couch.  He fell asleep [INAUDIBLE].  I went to bed that night on a very, very high note.  So there are times that yknow, [INAUDIBLE], then we do have some times where we've been more concerned.  Close friends of ours would be over at dinner and without the stress.  Work is not bad, I don't love it but, you know what, I'm getting paid a third of what I used to and I came in three times as much.  I'm staying the health benefits for all three of us now.  You can imagine what [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How's your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't feel hungry until six thirty.  Like I try to eat -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you eat during the day?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like once [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't binge at night, right, you eat normal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you don't stop me at [INAUDIBLE] but it's, you know, because I'm working up to taking my evening meds so the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, you sleeping well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Once I get to sleep, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long does it take to get to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two and a half hours.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  Why?   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  That's with Ativan.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is Ativan 2 mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I even did two -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 4 mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And plus two Sonata.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you still couldn't?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I threw a Xanax in now and then.  My wife's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does the 4 mg beat the 2 mg?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or it just rolls off you?  So let's raise the dose to 4, if you need it, you need it.  The good part of Ativan is it's out of your system the next morning.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it is? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's a six to eight hour drop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow.  I don't take it too late, though.  I take it at nine, ten.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, not much later than that.  You take Provigil in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That has been, it helps.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It helps and it gives you that energy boost.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Has that made the insomnia worse?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think so.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You sure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't take it late, I take it very early with my morning coffee.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you really can't get to sleep, you've got to cut back on coffee on any energizer.  Let's stay with the 200 of Provigil.  Your Xanax, obviously, as needed.  The Sonata, so you're up to 20?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you like Sonata?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it works the fastest.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so we'll go for 20 if you need it.  Now, and the Depakote obviously 1500 is fine, stay on that dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you're more depressed than you're even acknowledging.  I think it seems like it's the family situation, but you're pretty depressed, um, and therefore, the next step is just keep pushing antidepressants until you feel better.  Have we ever had you on a higher dose of Zoloft?  Let's trickle up.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I have no problem with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It'll work, right.  And if it doesn't work and so we're going to compare at 150 and even 200 to which you are now, if we don't get anything better, we'll go back to the 100 and just go try another antidepressant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So for now, we're 150 and let's do that for three weeks.  After three weeks, if you've got something, but not enough, push it to 200 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'll write a prescription for 200.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The only side effect, the only real side effect is delayed ejaculation and do you have some of that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ejaculation?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Difficulty ejaculating?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you will now, you may now.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Would you mind writing a prescription for Viagra?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Viagra?  Sure.  I'll write for the 100s because the price is the same, 25, 50, and 100 so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many do you want?  Do you pay out of pocket for that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's well spent money, um, should I give ten of them and refills?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, can give me two refills or something like that? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll give you five. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, but do -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not gonna get laid fifty times a year.  I should be, but if we want to try to get back in the swing, you know, if we could both relax.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need the 400 or do you break them? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What with the increased Zoloft maybe, [INAUDIBLE] we talked to a guy who, yknow, we didn't have sex for years, years.  I feel like Bob Dole. There was a funny, was it on ER, one of those other shows, or House where, uh, I think it was House, where they put, the woman kept complaining that her husband wanted some more sex and he kept complaining that yknow -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] get enough.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].  And what was happening was they weren't married, they were having an affair and they wanted enough because of their husbands and wives, plus being rich.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, do you need other prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let's see, I'll be out of -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ativan pretty soon.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah Ativan and, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Xanax. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I should be out of Xanax, but she wrote three as needed, instead of four which was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, how many do you have?  They, uh, they don't last.  The prescriptions kind of expire to different dates.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I mean, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have enough Xanax for now?  Or do you need some now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, for a few days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so let me write it since it's just a few days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your age again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].  Does this stuff ever go away?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I sometimes see it burn out a little bit, when someone's doing really well for a while, we start tapering down and see what comes back. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But for now, given the life circumstances you have, probably, uh, more is better, you know, more chemistry to get your brain in a better place.   I wrote for three a day of the 2 mg Ativan, so that gets you ninety of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that should last a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and the Xanax, what should I write for that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The halves. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Half a mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Half that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, four, four a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because that's what we were doing -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The last time that she wrote, you weren't here [INAUDIBLE] it was three a day.  [INAUDIBLE], that's not me walking bumping into [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, as long as you're not getting tired with the dose.  Your brain just knows when you're taking too much of that stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you get tired and slurry and, you know, whatever.  If that's not happening it means you have enough anxiety to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B>  If it starts happening, that means I'm getting better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what happens.  As people get better, they find that it's making them tired and they reduce the dose on their own.  All right, so just to organize, no suicidal thinking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I wanna stick around and see how everybody [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember what I said about the Zoloft, should I write it down for you?  I want three weeks at the 150. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And at that point, you know, if you still want more to go, go to 200.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  What's on the prescription?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It says two a day of the 100s. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.  So, that's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The prescription is for the dose [INAUDIBLE]. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's fine. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Feel free to call any time, all right?  If things go in the wrong direction, you know, I wish I could be helpful for your son in some way, but, uh, it's hard work.  I can see the psychiatrist yknow, being a little scared off. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, [NAME OTHER] seeing a psychiatrist is [INAUDIBLE].  Um, it's the psychologist who really is starting to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you get the phone call, you know, I've had these phone calls.  When you get the phone call that, you're very powerless as the shrink on the other, you know, what do you do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you call the police, send him to the emergency room.  It's very hard to know what to do at that point and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There are so many other implications in the relationship now than there were earlier so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean that's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what I was thinking, [INAUDIBLE]. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE], I don't know how he would react, that's part of the resistance.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, it seems to me, from what you've told me, that the kid needs a little more stability.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He may need to go in to a, yknow a round the clock evaluation place, [INAUDIBLE].  Are there any, uh, would you recommend any place in the city other than [DEIDENTIFIED]? I don't know of any.  Probably this place, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, but I mean, definitely watch for drug abuse.  Do you meet with the psychiatrist when he sees him?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The biggest alarm was his dropping off in marks, in his school [INAUDIBLE].  Unless something that really gets him.  Like he went to the science museum, the [DEIDENTIFIED] and he saw them dissecting a cow's eye, so that night he was up all night [INAUDIBLE] cow's eyes, printing things off the computer. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Online?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B>  Oh, he was up for hours doing it.  With a [INAUDIBLE], you know, presentation and all he was supposed to do was write a paragraph like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At least he's got a passion. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Take care of yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two months?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two months, yeah.  Oh, let me -</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[some] (ph) 0:00:01.1 </p>

<p> PATIENT: I had said no and you know, the feeling of not you know being comfortable [with] (ph) my friends hadn't happened for a while back I guess maybe even before I [had them] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:00:11.2 </p>

<p>But I've always said to myself that I know that you know gladness and good times and bad times sorrow and joy (inaudible at) 0:00:20.5 [are intermixed] (ph) and I always know that things will get better or it will change again but I guess maybe during the times that they're not so hot I just (chuckles) [you know] (ph) 0:00:34.8 I reflect [ (inaudible) and you know think about things] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:00:36.7 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could I go back to something you just said, you said something about once you had [Adrian] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:00:43.9 and you had been feeling kind of alone is that like you're afraid that </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess 0:00:49.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you, since you had the child now you wouldn't, you wouldn't ever really [plug] (ph) 0:00:53.0 into anything (inaudible at) 0:00:55.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at) 0:00:54.7 be with my old friends again because they were doing something completely different from what I was doing and I just didn't think that we had anything in common.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: mm really? So in a way the best thing about these last two months is finding out that you can be doing your own thing no matter how different it is and still [be able] (inaudible at) 0:01:16.4 to have people around you that you can feel warm about, feel good with even if you're all doing very different kinds of things. 0:01:23.8</p>

<p> </p>

<p> I guess [now] (ph) the reason I mention it is that in a way it sounds like the box, the boxes again, you don't have to get boxed in to have a good time. You don't have to [deal with everybody else's wife's, that's not like the real (inaudible) you have a good time is it?] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:01:41.4 </p>

<p>PATIENT: But yeah but you don't think about that really when you're having a good time it's just like I said when you, when you- something's bothering you. I guess - see I don't know how I would feel now if Robert were here and you know [the] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:01:56.8 this was happening you know maybe my mind would be off him and there would be a lot of kids coming and going.</p>

<p> I don't know how that would relate to him but - I kind of feel a little differently about him.</p>

<p>His Aunt came over - Sunday for dinner. It's his Dad's younger sister and she told me a whole bunch of things about him that I never knew and I don't think he even knows (inaudible at) 0:02:24.5 because they happened to him when he was really young and from what she said, she made it sound like I should be real understanding and not let anything he does bother me because everything that he does stems from things that happened to him you know [understand?] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:02:42.1</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he's not responsible for anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right-right, or he- you know- something kind of just snapped and after that he was different but I still find it hard you know I think about it to accept her statements and you know just do that and react that way towards him I don't know.</p>

<p> It sounded - it sounded [logical] (chuckles) 0:03:11.4 and that it all fit perfectly but- </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like hearing that he doesn't mean it when he's angry and horrible but - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: but that doesn't keep [overlapping speech] (inaudible at) 0:03:22.1 him from actually being angry and horrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [yeah true.] (ph) 0:03:24.9 He wrote me a letter [ I guess it was] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:03:26.6 the end of last week and there was this one line in there and he said I [drove him to death] (chuckles) (ph) (inaudible at) 0:03:31.6 and I hadn't - (chuckles) - I hadn't written to him you know because we had come back from our trip and I hadn't written to him and he said I [drove to them] (ph) 0:03:39.7 and I didn't even know what I did or said to them (ph) but I think it's [the whole situation with Adrian that he meant] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:03:44.0</p>

<p> But it was kind of- and I told his Aunt and she said "well that's good he needs (chuckles) he needs (inaudible at) 0:03:52.6 He needs someone to really get to him - into his mind and I guess [it] (ph) really upset him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess she really wants you to stick with him and try to (inaudible at) 0:04:04.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she said that the nicest thing we could do for her was to get married and take care of  Adrian but she still doesn't really know what's going on you know and I don't really know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She has good intentions but in a lot of ways you know better with what's (ph) really happening or what you have to do for your self.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although like I said things she-she did say about Robert were very logical and could be real (inaudible at) 0:04:35.2 reason that he does some things. Mm I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that could change your feelings about him when he does them like you wouldn't be so hurt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now I could understand it but when he's actually doing it I guess it would kind of be hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah] (ph) it's still like he's still hurting he's still being angry or something, you still have to live with that even if [something bad happened to] (overlapping speech) (ph) (inaudible at) 0:05:01.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (overlapping) 0:05:02.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [when he was three years old] (ph) (overlapping) 0:05:02.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I- I don't know I still - I still think when I see the person's actual facial expressions and movements and what they say you know it's there and at that time you don't - you don't put all that stuff together that Oh you know that this happened to him when he was little and that's the reason he's acting that way now, you just don't unless you're some kind of a psychiatrist or a saint I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's really hard even if you know someone doesn't mean it if they're being really awful to you to have to live with that, you just take it.</p>

<p> And I guess especially if you feel like you're supposed to just take it because [something bad happened to him and they have problems] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:05:43.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was a line on 'TV' last night it really got me they um- this- this man had said to this woman when she was dead he said - he said "you gave a lot and took nothing, you're a very stupid (laughs) woman. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at) 0:06:02.3</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it really got me. [It really did] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:06:05.5 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [how do you think?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I just thought (chuckles) I don't want anyone to say that about me after I go or I don't even think I want anyone to say about me now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of feel like that with Robert?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah sometimes I do. But I have asked things of him and that's-that's when he can't you know he can't put up with it or it really bothers him and you think he is- he is so self centered you know not, I'm not - I am maybe I am putting it in a bad way but he - he even admits it in his letter he-talked about and he says it that all I can write is me, me me you know you go [tripping] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:06:58.8me and I guess he knows it, [so] (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't change anything. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Maybe he needs to talk to a therapist (chuckles) or </p>

<p> something, he won't though.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You asked him about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess maybe I mentioned I said - why not (ph) - you know because he-he said he had all these things he was thinking about and all his problems and I said why don't you go talk to someone, he said no because like he always - he likes to tell everyone he's insane and he knows he is (laughs) so nothing's going to help. 0:07:32.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he doesn't [really want to] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:07:36.3 do anything to make things any different he just sort of likes [things the way they are?] (ph)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I-I think he, really likes to be, I think he likes to put people on and really act crazy and stuff like that, not that he does every day but you know, [I think he likes to] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:07:51.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like that's his way of dealing with hard things sounds like he just acts freaky and then he can't (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:08:01.4 </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (overlapping speech) we went- (chuckles) we went right before [Seth was born] (ph) we went to see this social worker and usually when Robert meets people [he's you know] [(inaudible at) 0:08:10.4 real quiet and very polite and everything and [this] (ph) one time he just did this - I don't know [this old hack] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:08:18.3 she just [kind of] (ph) freaked out in her office and was really making a mess of things, he was putting on a big show for her and [everything] (ph) and I - I nearly said "you just blew it".(laughs) I and then I sit back and I let him do it you know (laughs) and everything and she called me a couple of days later and we talked about him but I knew he'd do something like that (laughs) he does it every once in awhile you know. 0:08:46.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he do it (overlapping speech)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he do it to you too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm, no not - well in the beginning he did but yeah now [and] (ph) hardly because I know how when he's going to act or something like that. But he'll do it to people that he-he's just met if he gets- [I mean] (ph) if he's scared [I mean] (ph) if he's afraid of meeting them, [like you know] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:09:06.6 (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:09:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:09:10.6 [gets something] (ph) (inaudible) gets that scared?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah [you know, insecure and stuff] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:09:12.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of a way to keep them [locked sort of?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess maybe. (chuckles) Or I just let him go ahead and do it (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel when he's doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel sorry (chuckle) for him and I like kind of feel pity and I wish he wouldn't do it but he does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of-sort of like he's showing how that he can't deal with something? (inaudible at) 0:09:43.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe-Yeah maybe it's his way of dealing with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like such a good way [for you inside] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:09:51.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like such a good way to deal with things do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think he's making a fool out of himself. I guess maybe he knows it too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you'd like it better if you could show people a side of himself that you [admire?] (ph) [things like that?] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:10:11.0</p>

<p> (Back ground noise - Plane flying overhead) 0:10:13.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah with some people he does I guess, but I [ask then] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:10:16.8 with people that are more like that for themselves, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that- that's a problem?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a lot of different people you know I guess we all, but um,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard for you I guess when- when you admire him to feel like he's going to blow it with everybody that he gets with and not let anybody else see what the good things are [in him] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I don't know maybe he wants to belong so badly or something maybe he wants to be-friend them (inaudible at) 0:10:54.6 [he tries real hard] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So hard for him?] (ph) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he has a lot of friends he makes friends [it's like] (ph) on the spot but you know (inaudible at) 0:11:07.5 they stay his friend for a long time or not, I don't know.</p>

<p> But he does make friends- a lot of people he had [phones] (ph) when he-he first meets them because he does come on so strong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seems to me like it would really be hard to feel like somebody was really neat in some ways, somebody you could look up to in some ways and then when you took them places if they never showed that to other people and you'd always have to sit there and think how freaky they were acting (inaudible at) 0:11:42.3 and how you really knew they were pretty good but they never show anyone else almost embarrassing (inaudible at) 0:11:48.2 [feeling] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know sometimes- but I guess it's [foresight] (ph) I'm embarrassed for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess when you have doubts about him to you know, if he acts weird with everyone else it makes it harder for you to even know if he really </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he doesn't act weird (overlapping speech) with everyone else I mean and I guess maybe where he is -the group of people he's with or something. I think with somebody who's, not a hippy or freak or something maybe more establishment type [people] (ph) he'll like to do something to you know kind of [astound] (ph)them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you it's sort of like you can live with either world in a way</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [Out of all] Yeah I can live with either world but I don't think that I fit in fully with either one you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where as I think he- he fully fits in with one world and he kind of refuses to fit into another one all the way. I mean he might even go out of his way to do something that would show them that he's not [from] (ph) their world. 0:13:25.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's like you have a little more freedom to move around when you're alone than when you're with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah yeah I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of boxes you into that (inaudible) away from the suburbs or something to be with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's true and also because I guess he makes me feel uncomfortable too if I don't act exactly how he is or he'll always comment on it if I'm not. (chuckles) That may be the reason he always (inaudible at) 0:14:02.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he really (inaudible) lets you have it if you start moving around too much (overlapping speech) 0:14:07.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not so much lets me have it (inaudible) 0:14:09.2[say something] (ph) but I (inaudible at) 0:14:11.2 think in a way he kind of admires certain things that I have hung on to from the suburbs.</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: So if when you're left alone in a way you kind of slide through these categories you just have your own (inaudible at) 0:14:28.3 and every day [I'm sort of yanking] (ph) him to the suburbs and (inaudible at) 0:14:31.8 [yanking] (ph) it away and when they all leave you alone you just [sort of] (ph) float, it's kind of alright [you know when] (ph) either of them pulls to hard they start wondering who the hell you are and what you're doing anyway. And whether you ought to give up something I guess and start feeling like you don't know for sure just what it is, [you ought to know better or something] (ph) (overlapping speech) (inaudible at)0:14:52.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Or] (ph) (overlapping speech) Yeah specifically what I'm - [my- like with my- I'm in shock] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:14:57.2 he'll um, I don't mind doing all these things which I do much of the time anyway but when it starts-you know like you have to [live with something or (inaudible)] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:15:08.6</p>

<p>Like drugs for example and I don't use drugs and I don't like anybody else to- you know like- I- [my dad, you know is a doctor] (ph) and I just [you don't know a lot of drugs and stuff and] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:15:20.3 when-when people start - when they say [you-well you have] (ph) to take a little of this you know like [some grass] (ph) or something and stuff [like that] (ph) </p>

<p>I don't know a lot of people, I guess they don't really say anything if you don't do it, take drugs like our friends or [anything] (ph) but sometimes I feel like he thinks oh you should do this because it's the way I am and you [you're with] (ph) (inaudible at) and this is the way we should be doing things and living. </p>

<p> COUNSELOR: It's-In a way you see yourself as being sort of like your mother (overlapping speech) (inaudible at)0:16:12.0 with Robert, your dad's always pulling your mom into the straight world and Robert's always </p>

<p> </p>

<p> PATIENT: Well</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you're both [you and your mom] (ph) the way you see it are really neither place kind of just in your own place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my mom, I'm like [no more] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:16:30.5 stronger than my mom is because my dad, he's my father and we had the other kids in the family and I just- I think I got some traits from my dad like that and [I am] (ph) stronger than my mom. And with Robert I mean he's never really forced me to do anything that I didn't want to and I just I think since I've known that I've gotten stronger and I well actually I think my opinion carries a little weight with him but he doesn't like to tell me (chuckles) or let me know about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of like you're getting more and more sure all the time about how you want to live and stuff and [when] (ph) these people pull on you it's kind of a less strong pull in a way because you know more and more what you want. </p>

<p>But I imagine it would still be hard to have even if nobody is really [yelling] (ph) to just have them saying all that time what you're doing is wrong. 0:17:38.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's- [It] (ph) stems back from you know [excuse me] (ph) when I was younger and you know I and then I guess I am feeling bad about it because I don't want to hurt my parents, maybe even feeling a little guilty about it.</p>

<p>I say in my mind what's-the way that things are and that's the way and you known </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like whatever you do you have to start in your own mind by seeing where you are really and doing what you can with that, you can't make things go away, make your past be different from what it was or anything like that, is that what you're saying? 0:18:20.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well see my parents don't really know that I- well they do now-they know but they (inaudible) really feel like they've done that to me you know what I mean? They don't really know that all those things happened, they just don't feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like the stresses you were feeling and things you just have to live with yourself.</p>

<p> PATIENT: Yeah because I- like I- I told them the way I felt at that time and I don't blame them now, I don't -I'm not trying to make them feel bad about it I just told them I said that's the way I feel or felt from those years and that's just the way things are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way there's a sort of edge to what you say that it seems like a lot of times people when they say things to you, you have to keep reminding yourself that in a way you're in charge of your life, that things are the way they are, or something like - that you feel pulled but in such different directions and in a way those directions are people [that] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:19:34.3 are trying to make things different from what they really are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I've always felt that people were always trying to tell me things do things and in college my roommate, well I had this-we were friends in junior college and she was my roommate I guess second year and I always felt like she was trying to control me and it used to bother the heck out of me. And I guess that maybe I would just do things to ah- on purpose to kind of show her that she had control of me but I guess in the act of trying to show her that she didn't have control of her but in a way she did. </p>

<p>You know if I had- a- to do something to- to show her I didn't or she didn't </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you had to keep [playing] (ph) (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:20:25.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that bothered me too (laughing) [the way to do it] (overlapping speech) (ph) (inaudible at) 0:20:26.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just keep [playing] (ph) off her manipulations. In a way, that's that same girl you know who [sort of] (ph) looks up to you</p>

<p>PATIENT: No this is (inaudible at) 0:20:38.7 someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well with Robert's that's changed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it seems sort of like nobody gives you [real] (ph) nobody says out loud that they give you credit for doing your own thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well every once in awhile they do but, I don't know I guess maybe before they didn't. (chuckles) So I don't know I guess I -I don't know I guess I [striked] (sp) (ph) him as, you know when I first I- was kind of flighty and a bubble brain maybe it's an act on my part too but I don't know, but (chuckles) that's what happened. </p>

<p>Or maybe they [j] (ph) - had-I think it's that they have a lot of self esteem and they have a lot of pride in what they are no matter what they are, a lot of ego.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're beginning to get some of that yourself now so it's sort of like (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:21:34.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess so (overlapping speech) yeah I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said a couple of times today things like, that somebody really does listen [you know] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:21:43.8 even if they don't say so when you have an opinion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well- I - they've listened before but I guess they never really said anything afterwards to make me realize that they did listen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You figure everybody else has more self esteem than you do sometimes, is that what you mean? (overlapping speech) 0:22:04.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (overlapping speech) 0:22:05.2 I think-I think a lot of the time [like my] (ph) girlfriend you know Shirley [wasn't antisocial or anything] (ph) 0:22:09.4 I think Robert does you know like my dad does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, you know it doesn't bother me if- they have it - I guess it's just at times when they- when it related to me and they just came on so strong you know me, me me. They had</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like (overlapping speech) (inaudible at) 0:22:42.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: [When I got my fill of it] maybe (overlapping speech) (ph) (inaudible at) 0:22:43.0 [when I got my fill of it] maybe. (chuckles) Or when I or when I felt bad or not neglected but when I just felt like maybe Adrian was neglected same with Robert lately when he's just thinking of himself and not me so much but even Adrian at times. [That maybe then] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:23:10.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way what you're saying is that this not having enough self esteem for you isn't the problem it's that you don't like all these ego trippers all around you'd sort of like them to be a little more (overlapping speech)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (overlapping speech)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: considerate of other people too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I know in my own mind that I- that I have my pride and I know what I can do, my limitations and that type of thing and I usually don't go out and talk about them to everybody but say with these other two people maybe and my dad, he's one person I've never been able to figure out but say with Shirley and Robert they-they come on very strong and very egotistical and everything but I- I think in their- in their minds their hearts they are weaker say than I am, or they have more things that they wonder about. 0:24:08.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a way it's sort of like you're saying there's a difference between how you really feel inside </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and how to act? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe it's - it's maybe it's not [on yourself] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:24:18.3 I don't know. Because they say that if you're self confident you usually don't have to go to extremes to show something or prove something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that feels right for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but if you're - if you're in doubt and [you lacking a lot of self confidence] (ph) (inaudible at) 0:24:39.4 you go overboard I think.</p>

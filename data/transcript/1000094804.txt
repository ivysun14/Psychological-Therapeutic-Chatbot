<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: Hi you guys. It's Josephine.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Hey Josephine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that Sarah and Michelle in here.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi guys.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I was telling Sarah what an inspiration she was to me last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. I could tell from your e-mail that it really made a difference in having her be such a beautiful role model.  I was really pleased with the way that you guys used each other for support, pleased at the way you used the e-mail as a way to stay in touch and really move forward, you guys are just inspirational. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: It's just so fun having this group. Ana wrote me gave me the name of an agent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's so great.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I think I sent out, I don't know how many query letters, and did not know about this agent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fantastic.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I'm hoping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good. I always thought that was really great that it was not only such a good referral for you, but that she thought so highly of him.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. I actually quoted her to him.  Hoping that will help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, good plan.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Anyway I'm just taking the steps.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: There's a whole Christian market and LDS market too that I haven't even thought about yet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For your book?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, I mean it's certainly not a religious book... it's just about a little a young girl who had learned a lot from her grandmother and learns how to forgive somebody because of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think connecting to this agent that Ana recommended to you is a great move.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah;</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'll bet he'll have a good idea about markets.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who else came on? </p>

<p>KARA: It's Kara.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi Kara.  Okay. All right. Michelle was just talking about Ana had sent her the recommendation of a particular agent for Michelle children's book that she's written and it was a glowing recommendation so Michelle has already jumped on it and got him contacted.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: First few chapters already in the mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:. Good, good, good. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Keep on keeping on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, yep.</p>

<p>SARAH: Hey it's Sarah again. Sorry I got cut off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we're still expecting Joan and Chrissie and Ana and Marge and you know what while we're talking here waiting for everybody to get online let me go and look and see if I got any e-mails recently that would tell us different.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I didn't get any e-mail from anybody saying that weren't going to be online. Did anybody else?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I don't think I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I didn't either. Okay. So, I'm just seeing my e-mail. Nobody else. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Oh, I know Chrissie's planning on being online tonight.. I talked to her earlier today.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I'm on. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Hey Chrissie.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Hey Chrissie.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: You went to the dentist today?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah. I just go back. My body's just falling apart woman. I broke three teeth. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: You're kidding me.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, it is. I'm just falling apart. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me ask you about the situation Chrissie. Are you worried about osteoporosis with three teeth broken?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I have osteoporosis or I'm real close to osteoporosis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you take that supplement with all the research out, MCHC, what's it called, MCHC calcium. It's the one.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh, would you Google, let me see if I can find it real quick. MCHC and then put MCH M as in Mom, C as in Cat, H as in home, C as in Cat,  MCHC osteoporosis, Google that and there is actually some information and one of my nutritional newsletters that I get is just raving about it. It's not only supposed to stop bone loss, it builds .</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Now that calcium that you recommended to me years ago, the Rainbow Light calcium, that's not it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not it. No.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: So would you take this in place of that calcium?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would probably take it in addition.. The one that I recommended to Michelle and I don't know if everybody remembers, but I probably recommend it to most people because part of the consequences of the eating addiction is oftentimes a kind of damaged or slow digestive process and anybody leans toward constipation, the Rainbow Light Everyday Calcium helps. If you take it at bedtime it tends to regulate without laxatives.  So if people mention to me about the constipation I'll say give that one a try.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I recommended it to my girlfriend who suffered from constipation for years and years and years.  I recommended that calcium and within a week she was feeling better and she had been to so many doctors. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: By the way, MCHC calcium is called Cal Apatite with Boron and the brand is from Metagenics.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There you go, that's it. It's pretty new so you might have to get it through your chiropractor who usually has real high quality supplements or I don't know if you have a chiropractor, you might see what your health food store carries but I think they are raving about the ones from New Zealand in the article that I read. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Restores bone loss and wow. Encourage healing of fractures. Wow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah if you have three broken teeth like jump on this one girl.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: How did you break your teeth?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Well, through infection. It cost me so much!  You know, it's almost like it dawned on me the other day I had all these responsibilities why not choose a good attitude about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You bet.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Even if it seems like wishful thinking. I don't know, anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been to enough AA meetings, I mean you've been sober long enough to know that miracles happen.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I didn't hear what you said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said you've been sober long enough to know, been to enough AA meetings to know that those kinds of miracles happen as people change and they change the way they talk to themselves, they change the way they look at the world, that people get great changes in their life and so you've already had many great changes, why not more.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Okay. Years ago there was an athlete by the name of Brian Boitano an ice skater and when he won the Olympic gold he said that for the last nine years he had pictured himself up on that platform and what the crowd sounded like and everything. He said when he finally got the Olympic gold there were even people in the audience wearing the same clothes he was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god. That gave me chills.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: He said it took him a long time, like months to realize it hadn't been a dream, that it really had happened to him. Yeah, it's just the power of your mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the power of God. You know, don't forget our higher power.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: No, no, no, not at all. I mean obviously he created the brain so he wants us to have whatever he has. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A few years ago, I heard an author interviewed and he talked about using the mind to be a bridge between our ego and God and I thought that was such a beautiful metaphor...that really the proper use of our mind is to use it to bridge from ego to God and that he feels by doing that, that is what triggers creativity. Anyway, it was very interesting.  Wish I could think of the name of the book right now, but it was a fascinating interview.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: What's that book called The Secret? That's the big thing Oprah is talking about.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah, I saw both her shows. I saw the The Secret DVD last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you guys ever see the movie called What the Bleep do we Know? </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah, I have that DVD.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay well it's the same concept of Quantum Physics.  Do you remember the guy Gary Zukoff who wrote Seat of the Soul? </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it was a big bestseller. Well he wrote in 1979 the Dancing Wu Li Masters that I read that one years ago. It's all on Quantum Physics.  It won some kind of scientific award.  Quantum Physics' help us we remember the mind can be used to connect us to God.</p>

<p>PARTICIPIANT: That's like the radio transmitter or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: When I was doing my doctorate in Hypo-therapy my mentor was really really big into Quantum Physics and he had this program called Creating Your Future where you went, it's a long process but basically you go out to the future, you picture everything that you want, you go out to a certain date into the future and then you let the results go  I pictured living on a cul-de-sac in a three bedroom house.  I pictured Don having a new car and I had a new car and our son had a little truck and I pictured this particular house that we had been looking at and when I got to that visualtiona it was so clear and vibrant to me and then he said okay now let it go and the whole thing shattered like a piece of glass and I could actually hear the glass break all over the place. And now we live in a three bedroom house on a cul-de-sac and at one point before he sold it, our son got a little pickup truck and at the time Don and I both had new cars through honestly I thought about it afterwards I said oh my gosh that's exactly what I pictured except it wasn't the neighborhood and Jay didn't hang onto the. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think most Quantum Physics people say if you can imagine it in your mind, then there's a chance to create it.  So most all of our inventors have been very imaginative. Remember anything you have ever read about Walt Disney, anything you have ever read about Jules Verne, anything you have ever read about DaVinci, they were all real visionaries. They could really really imagine things and certainly they have been kind of creative or guiding forces on society.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Walt Disney coined the term imagineering which is an amalgam of the two words imagine and engineering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought Ana would be here because I know she did some homework.</p>

<p>ANA: I'm here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you there?</p>

<p>ANA: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. Did Marge come on either? No. Did Joan come on? No, not yet. 
Marge is always running a little late. Doesn't she come directly from a class?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: She might, I think I read an e-mail that she did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually did too but I know that they are both the East Coast gals. I know that the East Coast had been taking a beating with storms so that might be what's going on but Ana did you want to talk about doing some of your topic inventories and what went on with that?</p>

<p>ANA: Yeah, thanks. I'd like to ask people if any of you have a hard time eating out at restaurants and not eating densely or higher quantity. I'm just wondering if anyone has figured that out.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I typically just eat half of whatever it is and take the other half home.</p>

<p>ANA: Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Some people will ask for  the to-go box at the beginning of the meal.</p>

<p>ANA: Oh, that's a great idea.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah, and then you just cut it in half and put it away and what you got on your plate is what you eat so your meal is calmer. You're eating moderate.  </p>

<p>MICHELLE:  I do that a lot. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I just can't do that. I mean it seems like I always eat at the high end of moderate when I go out to dinner.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I will often do the eating half of it but the half of what I am eating even if it includes a dessert, it still much more than I would generally have at home. I don't ever have bread with dinner at home but I'll have a roll or two or something eating out.. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think with the bread plate you can put your serving of bread on your bread plate, the rest of it doesn't belong to you. If you're at a Mexican restaurant take your handful of chips, put them on your placemat, when they're gone, they're gone so that the rest of them don't belong to you and that's often helpful as well.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Good idea. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, but yesterday and I ate more than I really wanted to. I kind of knew what I was going to have but then I ate everything on my plate. Should this be an issue or shouldn't it? I wonder because I spent so many years relegated toward trying to have perfect food and ruminating over it that Kara taught me and you did also too Josephine how to just tell the diseased voice to shut up. I can obsess about what I ate and how I ate the whole piece of cheesecake plus my meal yesterday okay and I should have left a bite, I shouldn't have eaten all my sandwich, the salad was too big, I mean I could go on and on. It was kind of what I planned on eating except I didn't think I would eat all of it and then I said oh I can just knock it off and deal with what else is at hand so I knocked it off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Because I spent many many years thinking about perfect food or meal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But again that's a dieting mentality and it isn't that we never get to think about food or making dietary changes in recovery because self care is about making changes in our life. But typically we naturally kind of evolve toward self care.  You know my example is you go to the AA clubhouse and the newcomers are all sitting on what used to be the smoking section and five years later if they stayed around they are in the non-smoking section and they are wearing workout clothes, riding bikes, we just kind of naturally evolve to more self care so I on the one hand I agree with you and support you and on the other hand I want to say just because you did it from a disease standpoint in the past doesn't mean that you never get to make any dietary changes from a recovery standpoint.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: It's about tweaking my choices. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and tweaking them in a way that says how can I be the best mom to my body.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Absolutely. I briefly talked to Michelle last night and told her, I'm not hungry, but I how I should I have dinner. She said absolutely and I said well then I'll just make it very healthy. So I had meal out of love and devotion for my body, so I had some fruit and some yogurt and a whole wheat bagel. You know something simple like breakfast food because it was healthy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very good.  Sounds like it wasn't about the whole dieting mentality, that it  was about doing the best thing for your body in this situation and you did it </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, I said I got to take my "medicine" of abstinence.  Michelle reminded me of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: So, I sometimes wonder if I am in denial.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would you think you would be in denial about again?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Probably my portion size and eating so much junk, but I do have to eat more at the high end to moderate to maintain my weight and to not be starving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't have any trouble with that and I don't think other people do so that issue doesn't have to cloud self care. You know when I had the residential centers and I told them what to fix the meals and stuff I said and serve me one extra carb with the moderate meal and then I would eat what I wanted because I have the same situation that Chrissie is talking about. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Oh, you wanted to get out of the dieting mentality?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I was 5'10" and weighed 120 lbs and had incredible energy and I knew what I needed.  I knew my body and I took care of my body in that way but it didn't mean that I ate crappy or junky ... I was doing it to take care of my body.   But you know I didn't spend a bunch of years doing dieting ... I was an amphetamine starver. So Chrissie don't let stop you from being the best mom you can to your body. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I see, okay, yeah, okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well I like what you said Josephine, that a person has had a lot of years of dieting, dieting mentality it will take a number of years of abstinence before they are ready to make dietary changes and not be triggered by it. Like you said to me that the whole changing my quantity will probably be the last thing that I am able to do without being triggered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but it doesn't mean we don't step up to the plate and make the changes, it just means that we have to deliberately break the pattern.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right, but you told me to do is to start by adding fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: I have been doing that and it's been really helping. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And does everybody know what I recommended to Joan? </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When people are first starting to be at the point where they are a little more able to do self care in their abstinence without it triggering some dieting mentality, I usually suggest starting by just making sure every meal you prepare has one fruit or one vegetable and I think the other thing that I recommended that you do is, whatever protein you bring into the house, make it organic.  But I usually don't suggest these changes too early in abstinence as you guys know.  So I have people start with those kinds of changes and you start to get to experience taking good care of yourself, of good mom behavior as opposed to kicking in the dieting mentality.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: By the way Josephine, I always have a fruit or vegetable with every meal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought you did. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE:  But I usually put a dessert in too... but I always put fruits and vegetables too because it makes it feel like a meal and I actually like fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and that's good that's good because you know some of the other things that you do put in your body you know are pretty scary in some respects as far as I am concerned. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I think that abba zabbas are very good for you because they have peanut butter in them (laughter)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I'm going to tell my daughter that. (laughter)</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: My dentist said to me today, he said don't chew on any taffy because I had to put a crown and I go oh my god that means I can't eat my Baby Ruth and abba zabbas (laughter) </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: What is an abba zabba?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Never mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had a gal friend and in her earlier recovery and she had a lot of dental problems and maybe four or five years into her abstinence she realized all the money she is spending on the dentist was partially do to her diet.  She changed to be less processed and refined sugars and then she didn't go to the dentist as much.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: I know that's what I am thinking. I'm giving myself away. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you know what you've got how many years now, 2 and a half years of abstinence now?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, almost, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After trying recovery 25 years. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah and now I have so much freedom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you do. And I'm going to guess and you may deny it but I'm going to guess that you probably do eat healthier than you did in your first six months?</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Uh, yeah a little bit. Yeah, my first six months. I ate desserts at every single meal.  Yeah, you want to share that peppermint patty story?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISSIE: That was like redemption for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: She's my hero.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CHRISSIE: Yeah, I did and then I started getting sick of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you do. Yeah, Yeah. Sarah are you still there? You've been very quiet.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. I'm still here. You know one thing I want to say about fruits and vegetables is, I have to be really careful that I don't eat too much fruits and vegetables. It does not agree with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had to find out which ones worked the best and which ones didn't and so I found that leafy, you know like spinach salads, seems to use up all my digestive enzymes and the rest of the meal just sits there like a lump and so I really had to kind of take note and be a monitor to figure out which ones work best for me and as much as I like cauliflower and broccoli, I need to do small portions of them, that zucchini and asparagus work much better for me so you kind of figuring out which ones work best for you. </p>

<p>SARAH: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bananas don't work super good, but if I have them at all I have half of one but you know strawberries, blueberries, oranges, grapefruits, those seem to be fine so just kind of figuring them out for yourself.</p>

<p>SARAH: Okay, because yeah if I have a big apple it's too much, like half an apple or a small apple is fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There you go, so figuring it out. Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: I had a salad for lunch with my half of a sandwich and really that's really helpful to hear but I can barely make myself eat any dinner at all I'm so stuffed and it's like eight hours later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I know.</p>

<p>SARAH: What is it? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's as we get older our digestion slows down, and also too, as we get older we have less resource of digestive enzymes and then if you throw in on top of it, that most of us have taxed that system by having an eating addiction, the digestion system is a little bit compromised.  Sometimes taking some digestive enzymes with your meal kind of helps.  I think that you're 54 now, right? </p>

<p>SARAH: Me, no, I'll be 57 in August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  So my guess is that as you are figuring out what works for your body and what doesn't.</p>

<p>SARAH:  I don't know if you remember Josephine, but like a few years ago I came off the macrobiotics diet and started binging and then I couldn't digest anything, no vegetables, no fruits, no brown rice, no salt, impossible and I went to a Chinese physician and in addition to giving me herbs that were digestive enzymes also explained to me the difference between body types and the list of foods that were for best for my body type. This is very much Chinese medicine, cook all of our vegetables. People say it's better to have raw vegetables in salad, but that's especially not true in winter.  I do find that I can digest most everything now but at certain times of the month or certain times of the year, it's much better for me to eat cooked vegetables.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I totally agree. Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I went to a nutritionist years ago because I developed sort of a digestive problem due to my binging and just like what Josephine said I had to be very careful about broccoli, beans, whole grains, lettuce and a lot of the vegetables that I eat have to be cooked and I can't even eat raw apples. They have to be baked so I bake them all the time now. I have to cook a lot of it, I can't eat one raw onion, I'm sick for days so that's due to I think the fallout from my eating disorder. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's a compromised system and so as we go in to just getting a little bit older, then that's a system that oftentimes acts up a little bit and we are the most baffled by it even though we shouldn't be you know but that's a good exchange of information you guys. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: She gave me a list. I still have it to this day, what to eat and what not to eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'll bet the list is similar to what Ana is talking about.  Is it four different body types Ana?</p>

<p>ANA: Well, it's three but you can have combinations.</p>

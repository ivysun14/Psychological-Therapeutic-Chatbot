<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence)  I was thinking about (clears throat) thoughts I've had since yesterday.  And more (exhales), not so much about the thoughts as the fact that, uhm, I think I remember the one I had after I left here.  But I had a dream this morning that, uhm, when I woke up from it I remembered the dream, and I also connected it with what I was talking about yesterday.  And then I found that I couldn't remember the dream.  It was as if right while I was thinking about it, I forgot the dream itself, but I remembered what thoughts I had in connection with yesterday.  And now I ca—, all I can remember is that I had some thoughts.  I can't even remember what they were.  But I was thinking about what occurred to me yesterday when I left.  And it just leads me to other things that wh—, I'm—, the not remembering makes me suspect I don't want to remember.  I don't want to think about it and—.  And what I do remember leads me to things that I know I don't really want to think about.</p>

<p>Because I think when I left, maybe partly because I was then talking about my father and his room and my reaction to it, I just suddenly remembered that, uhm, Monday night I'd had this feeling.  On the one hand I wanted to be close to MSCZ physically.  I wanted to feel I could make love to him and respond to him, and I could as long as we weren't near each other.  But as soon as we were near each other I couldn't.  And I don't know, somehow I was connecting that with the fact that money had been so much on my mind, and my need of it, my wanting it, to have it, and my feeling that that's what's necessary.  So that would mean if money somehow means a penis to me that, MSCZ's penis wouldn't be necessary.  And plus the fact that I'm pregnant, and I've had that problem with being pregnant anyway.  But then I just started thinking about that mixed feeling of wanting to respond to MSCZ in a sexual way and being r—, I mean literally unable to.  Only able to in my mind.  Or else feeling that I could.  I mean not being able to in my mind exactly, but thinking I'd like to.  Feeling a response to him until it's actually possible to carry it out physically, and then I can't and—.  I don't know what other word to use except—.  Eh, and thinking about it makes me feel so frustrated that I just don't want to think about it.  (silence)</p>

<p>And it—, I was thinking about the fact that I forgot the dream this morning and what I was thinking about the dream, too.  Which is—, I don't think that happens very often to me, that I forget both things.  And I was wondering why I was forgetting, because both Monday and Tuesday when I was talking about money or what I was talking about Tuesday, too.  I don't know how to explain this either.  I mean it wasn't—.  Well I had a feeling that I wanted to understand what was happening about—, in terms of the different things that I was talking about.  And I gu—, I wasn't conscious of a great resistance.  I guess that would be the way to pu—, well, I was conscious Monday of not understanding something but—.  (pause)</p>

<p> I guess what I'm thinking is, this morning when I knew I'd had the dream, and then I was thinking about it, I was feeling that I wanted to remember both.</p>

<p>ANALYST: For what purpose?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because it seemed to me it had something to do with what I'd been talking about yesterday, I guess.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But to come and tell me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh, so, what really happened is identical to what you described with MSCZ.  You treated me the same way as you do him.  At a distance you can think about things you want to discuss with me.  But when you actually get here it's all forgotten.  And it's exactly analogous to what you described with MSCZ.  You can feel responsive, like you want to be with him, at a distance only.</p>

<p>PATIENT:    (pause)  Mm.  I was thinking that I hadn't connected that reaction of forgetting once I got here with anything else before, but it just made me think, in a slightly different vein, that lots of times I've thought of things that seemed important to say here to you.  And then when I got here I would convin—.  It wouldn't be that I'd forgotten them so much as I'd decided they weren't important.  But it was essentially the same thing was happening.  I wasn't going to tell you.  And I—, and then I was just wondering what happens when I'm—, I don't know, when it's not a situation where I can think about and imagine—,  where it's actually at—, where I'm in it.  The person's there that I was thinking of, and—.  Well, again, I find it easier to wonder about that in terms of my reaction to MSCZ, maybe because he's not here.  But It just seemed to me that somehow when I'm actually with him after feeling the way I was describing, I get—, I don't know, I just automatically react that there's some vague thing I have to be defensive about.  Or if I'm thinking about those other times, maybe they're not quite the same.  I'm not sure, but they seem so, when I convince myself that something's not important after all, once I get here.  It's thinking also that, well, you really wouldn't care to hear it.  I mean it's, it's definitely involving you and my imagining, I guess what your reaction's going to be, and therefore what my position should be a result of that.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>First I was thinking on—, I was feeling I was on the wrong track because I kept thinking I don't understand.  Uhm, I realize I do it, both with you and with MSCZ, but I don't understand— (exhales).  I don't know, I just was feeling I couldn't get anywhere further than where I was right then and that what I was trying to understand was the wrong thing somehow.  And that I just wanted to understand and then it was as if it would go away because I understood it.</p>

<p>And then the next thing I started to think of was little things like—, well, I think I first—, the baby was kicking a little bit, so I thought of that and how some women have been very evident about feeling good when their baby kicks.  And I mean sharing this pleasure or whatever, feeling of joy or whatever.  And I was thinking sort of that I wouldn't react that way.  And then, then it made me think of after the baby's born, just wondering how I'd be, how I might be here and imagining that I wouldn't be able to—, I would talk about my unhappy feelings.  But I wondering if I could express happy feelings about it.  And feeling that those feelings would be ones I'd want to keep very private.  So I wouldn't even think of them here.</p>

<p>And it ju—, also made me think of just moments when, well I think I was thinking more of, uhm, moments when I'd get pleasure from something visual like, uhm.  Well, one thing it ma—, I think of is—, uh, because specifically this happened.  I felt this pleasure then.  W_ w_ MSCZ and I were walking home one night, and it was in the spring and the leaves were very small, just beginning to come out.  And the street lights were shining on them in such a way that it struck me as being very beautiful and made me feel very good.  And it was the kind of thing that I said something to MSCZ to share that feeling, but I was hesitant to do it, and in a way I didn't like doing it, in a way I was afraid something would be taken away from it if I shared it.  And it's-, it—, well as I talk, what I think of is that it's like not wanting to tell you the amount of money I had Monday, when— or any amount that I was thinking of, because somehow if you knew the amount you'd take it away.  I mean it seems similar somehow.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know there's a difference I guess.  I do—, I'm not too sure, but they seem connect to of keeping those feelings private and then not being able, let say to respond to MSCZ after having thought I'd like to, when I wasn't right with him.  But again there's something about the fact that they're a good feeling in each case that I'm not able to express with anyone, or I don't like to.  (pause)</p>

<p>And all I can think of again is that what connects them is that I would feel vulnerable in either case express—, or in any of those cases expressing those feelings.  Because I could be turned down, somebody could say to me, like about those leaves, "Well, that's not very attractive."  Or, "That's nothing much." Or I mean it could be played down or a person could disagree and somehow to me that would spoil it for me.  If I keep it to myself, no matter what the other person's thinking it can't be spoiled.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I was—, and then I was just thinking about how I do feel safe with tho—, all those other feelings.  Whether they're just plain unhappy feelings, depressed, resisting.  I don't know, yesterday I was talking about feeling that I was hiding, or, or being defensive today.  I don't know I keep thinking in terms of being defensive.  All those things, somehow they're all safe, and i—, they're safe.  I used to think they were real feelings, but just now I was thinking they were safe partly because the real feelings are the ones I'm not showing.  They've always seemed real, but I don't know they wouldn't be so safe if they were real.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Another thing keeps coming to my mind, too.  Uhm, because I was just thinking that last night MSCZ balanced his checkbook and was paying bills and I don't know, generally figuring out things.  And then he asked me how much I'd want before the end of the month, because he doesn't want to start any kind of budget or whatever system we use until next month.  And I said, "Well, I don't need anything yet but I will eventually."  I mean I—, here again I was worrying before the time I needed to worry.  And then later he—, he was—, he was really I don't know I almost thought he was feeling happy about the fact that now he'll be giving me money, that he's fully supporting me somehow.</p>

<p>And he was just joking me about, "Well when we start in August I want you to know specifically how much you want, and not just some—."  And I was thinking, well there was a time back when we talked about it and I'd figured out what I thought I'd need, but I hadn't wor—, figured it out on the basis of anything too specific, except I was sort of taking lump sums of what I thought I paid for food for month, and laundry and cleaning and the bill I pay here and, uhm.  So I said that to him and he said, "Well, you've go—."  He was, and he was really joking with me even then and saying, "Well, I want you to be more specific."  And, uhm, it ma—, it didn't make me feel badly at all the way he was saying it, but then today I started—,  I thou—, I don't think I was feeling it last night, but today I just started thinking, "Then I won't be able to make any of the little purchases that, I don't know, strike me impulsively I'd like to make."  Not that I do that often, but I mean like maybe I'll see a book I'd like to buy and (clears throat), just little things like that I somehow have the feeling that if I figure out right down to the penny, or not literally to the penny, but quite accurately, it'll be like being in a straight jacket almost.  (clears throat).  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, really I think what I'm feeling is—, because I was thinking of what I'd said about what money seemed to mean to me after yesterday and—, or after what you had said yesterday when you were mentioning all the different things I'd been talking about and how—.  Somehow it seemed to, well, in one sense be a penis to me, having the money or give me the opportunity to be masculine, in a way.  Or somehow, well, same thing really I guess.  And so I don—, it seems like when I think about not having it, except what MSCZ gives to me, it's almost as if, I don't know, that I can't conceive any way that can work out.  And I feel threatened, and I can't conceive I'll be anything but threatened, by this kind of a system.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p> I was just comparing becau—, uh, first I was thinking how hard it's been for me to think very far on anything today.  Things that I'm feeling I really want to think about, but yet I'm finding it very hard to do it.  And it reminded me of how I felt this morning which sort of had seemed odd to me.  Odd, not because it never happens to me, but just odd because I'd already thought I was going to be doing this today.  I'd planned to go into PTT and to get together with FHYZ for lunch, or at least I planned to call her and see if she could, because I had put it off until this morning.  But I was pretty sure she'd be able to, which she was when I finally did it, but I found that I just could hardly face doing that.  I really wanted to sit home.  I felt even more strongly today than I did any other day this week.  And I remember describing that feeling either yesterday or the day before, but I really wanted to stay at home and hide until coming here, to hide away from my feelings, my thoughts, from people, from everything.  I didn't want to go outside.  And I didn't want to get out of bed, because once I got out of bed I'd have to make a decision about was I going to do today what I had already thought I would do.  Or wasn't I, and—.  It got so, as much as I enjoy seeing FHYZ and had wanted to do this I didn't—, I just couldn't imagine I could want to see her.  And I don't know then eventually I just decided well this is silly and I called her and, and it—.  I kind of got over that whole reaction, but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>But it still wasn't as nice as day as it would have been if I'd woken up thinking I'm going in today and meet FHYZ and I want to.  And I mean I felt as if I were fighting myself, and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, again I_ just—, well I was thinking about this feeling I was having just recently about what I was just saying about MSCZ's giving me money and my f_ fears about it and all, or feelings, my reaction to it and—.  And maybe this goes for all the other things, too, but it's almost as if, by looking at it, thinking about, I realize another reaction is possible and might be much better.  But I I don't know, I run away from it.  And what I do is kind of think, "Well, I don't know what that could possibly be."  And then sort of—, that's when I can't think anymore.  Just like when I was thinking about reacting as I do with MSCZ.  As I did Monday night, thinking there must be a way out of it.  And then I was just thinking, but I don't know what it could be.  I can't understand it.  And I couldn't think beyond that.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, one thing you certainly seem to be emphasizing is how you really want to feel self-contained, as though you now have in you all that you really need.  You don't want to feel you need MSCZ, that you need his penis or that you need his money, or that you need my ideas or that you need FHYZ or anybody.  You have everything in you that you want and need.  Or you'd like to feel that.  That feels safe. (pause) And you want to keep it secret to boot.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (silence) I don—, I don't know, I just feel confused because first when you're saying 'what you've made clear is everything you need you have within you,' I was thinking I'd like to feel that way.  And then you added that.  But as soon as you'd added it, I was—, it made me remember how I'd felt this morning about calling FHYZ, and how I feeling well, I really didn't want to, which was another way of saying I didn't need to.  I didn't need her company.  I didn't need her friendship or association with her.  But yet, if I think one way then I start feeling the other and I keep reversing.  And then I start thinking about the feeling toward MSCZ and the feeling that I do need him and I want to feel I need him.  I want to feel free about feeling that I need him.  And I don't—, I don't want to keep it a secret, so then I—, and I was wondering about that, too.  Just, I don't know if that it's I'm disagreeing with what you've said as that I don't understand exactly (hesitates) or maybe exactly how I am keeping it a secret or what I think I'm doing about keeping it a secret.  Because I think underneath everything I don't feel I have everything I need.  I'd like to but—.  And like I think what I feel is a feeling, sometimes a compulsive feeling that I've got to get everything I need within me, or at least get the feeling I don't need anything or anybody else and—.  But yet I don't really, but what I succeed in doing is, instead of just going off living all by myself, I stay living with people, but yet I essentially cut myself off from people.  But I still feel enough that I need people so I don't—, I keep around them, but yet I don't really share things with them, I don't really associate with them.  And it seems like maybe I'm doing that—.  I'm afraid to share because then it will develop a greater need.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it doesn't matter that I can be thinking when I'm not writing this—, any of these situations that I'd be happier being able to share I mean in a se—.  I mean I'm even thinking of sharing my thoughts with you or sharing that feeling I had of wanting to respond to MSCZ sexually.  Any of those things where I know I'd feel happier.  I'd feel more relaxed.  I'd feel freer, that I was being more myself, but yet because—.  But then I'd need to do it more, and I can even think that—, I don't know, this is sort of intellectualizing that the more you can do it, the more you may need it.  But somehow the easier it is to fulfill that need, and I don't know how to explain it further, because it's not something I've experienced.  But I don't know just from seeing people, from reading.  It seems clear to me it would be true, but I don't—.  But I just respond by not reacting that way, by pulling away from that.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, it's not ever thinking that need would get greater so much as just the fact that I can't—, I just—, well it's not instinctive but my feelings react against needing—, admitting I need anything at all.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, there's another part of it, you know, that you—, seems to be another clue.  That is you emphasize that some private pleasure that you're going to lose. If I know how much money you have, I'm going to take that away from you and the money gives you great pleasure to have and to hoard, to be yours, to be part of you almost.  You keep the baby and your pleasure in it's moving and so forth private.  You mentioned it twice I think, so far.  So you're keeping that secret.  But you've emphasized your feeling that if you don't, pleasure will be taken away from you.  You'll be robbed of it.  Somehow whatever this is, it involves some very private, personal secret pleasure on your part, that you're going to lose if somebody discovers it, if you don't keep it hidden and secret.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I immediately think of—, well wondering if that has anything to do with keeping secret feelings when I was little, toward my father, any sexual feelings I had, or toward my brother.  My brother I know I was feeling I had to keep it secret.  And, and then it made me think of anytime I feel the way I described Monday night, with MSCZ.  I always feel, once I voice feelings of that.  Once—, or once I do anything to show that I'm having those feelings, so in a sense it's voicing them.  That then they're going to be lost.  And most of the things you were mentioning I know it's alright for me to feel the way I'm feeling about them, but what I thought of while you were talking that wouldn't—, that I wouldn't have felt was alright—, that I didn't especially in terms of my brother, would be feelings toward my father, feeling's—. Well, I mean those were the only two males that I knew then.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

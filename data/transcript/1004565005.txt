<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Put it wherever you want. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like trying to have it be comfortable, and it's not working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I will send you a bill. I don't think I yet have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You haven't yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I'll try to do it today. I mean, I'm not in a rush but I imagine it would be a good thing to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A good thing to have. I also won't be here on Monday because I am on a plane. I will be going out of town this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What makes sense? Do you want to try and reschedule for another day or just meet Wednesday/Thursday of next week? What would you prefer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I would prefer to try and reschedule if you had another day, but I don't expect you to.</p>

<p>[00:54.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. I only have Friday of next week. That would be one possibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Any time then would be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I imagine Tuesday would also be good, but I don't know if I have anything at the moment. So Friday I could do 12:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds great. Okay. (pause) Yeah, I'm going to this wedding. We talked about what happens if Bryan is there. James says he's probably outgrown the urge to punch him in the face so, you know, that would be good. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[01:58.9]</p>

<p>So do you want to hear about this conversation I had with James? Or do you want to hear the theory I have for why these CBT things — why I'm not really doing them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Well, actually, when you said we should talk about this conversation, I was like "I'm going to forget about it." So I wrote down everything, like what happened, because I forget conversations. So [that's the day] I was calling him. It was like 8:00 at night. I had kind of a normal day, which was kind of like fighting pretty hard to be cheerful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want to be sure I've got the time right. This is Saturday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, this is Saturday night. Yeah, because this is the same night that I then woke up in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's part of why I thought —</p>

<p>[03:04.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I had like a normal day which was a pretty bad day. So I called and was like "Yeah, I haven't had a great day. I just need to go to bed right now." I didn't really talk about it, so we just kind of chatted a little bit about other things, like light things. That helped some, and I was feeling better. Then suddenly it was like the bottom dropped out again, and I said something to the effect of "You know, I talk like everything is fine but I'm just a mess. Everything is a mess."</p>

<p>And James said "I don't really know how to take that. You can't say things like that to me." And I said "Well, I don't know how to take that. You know, I don't want to hurt you with what I'm saying, but I have to be able to tell you how I'm doing."</p>

<p>[04:05.4]</p>

<p>And he said "Oh, no, no. I want to know how you feel. I want you to tell me how you feel. But what you said seemed like it wasn't a statement of reality, a statement of what you thought was fact. And I feel that even to listen to that is to implicitly agree with it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said "Yeah, but I can't fact-check my statements." I basically said "I can't have —"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're being mad, if I follow, is not being able to edit so carefully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't have a very good grasp on reality. One of the CBT skills they talk about is spotting cognitive distortions. There's a reason that's a skill that they teach people. (laughter) And I'm pretty good at it. I'm pretty good at getting it so that the cognitive distortions don't make it into my speech. But I'm not perfect at it, and I can't — I basically have to be able to say this.</p>

<p>[05:11.8]</p>

<p>So then it turned into a conversation where I was saying "Look, I feel like I'm struggling. I'm in the hardest time of my life ever. I'm struggling really really hard. I'm trying to get people to hear me, and I feel like I can't make people hear me. So I need you to hear me, even when I'm saying things that you don't agree with." I'm like "My world is crazy. I'm in a crazy world. I feel like I'm in Alice in Wonderland." And he said "Okay, yeah, yeah." Then he said "Look, I'm not, I'm not going to leave you alone in this. So yeah, tell me what you need to tell me."</p>

<p>[06:07.2]</p>

<p>And so we both agreed that maybe the better way to handle it would be for him to listen, and then to say "I don't agree with your statement of the world. I don't think you're right to say this is how things are." Rather than to say — and basically what set me off was when he said "You can't say this to me." I was like "You can't tell me I can't say things to you." So it was a hard conversation but productive. We felt closer at the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When he doesn't dispute statements like that, does it make you feel like he implicitly agrees with them?</p>

<p>[06:53.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. He'll usually call out something he disagrees with. Like he'll usually, if he thinks I'm voicing distorted thinking, he'll say that. But when he doesn't — like there is a real degree to which I accept my picture of reality from what James thinks. But it's not total and it's not uncritical, if that makes sense. If he hadn't flagged that, I would have not thought that's the way the world actually was. I mean, really, I was speaking as though this was a statement of reality, when what I meant was I feel as though this is the way my world is. So it was a language barrier as much as anything else.</p>

<p>[08:04.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I get that it was a] good conversation, and it sounds as though it made both of you feel easier about you saying more to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it made me feel like I could trust him to hear me more. And having anybody that I can trust to hear me is really good for me right now. I had a conversation with Franco about it this morning — I'm staying with Franco right now, by the way, because it's kind of a — did we talk about that on Monday? I can't remember. Oh, okay, well then I thought about it after I left. Like I'm not going to the hospital, but I can kind of stay safer this way.</p>

<p>[08:55.7]</p>

<p>Franco and I had the conversation about it this morning. People don't know what to do with suffering. It's not other people's fault that they suck at listening to it. (laughter) It's just that you want to do the right thing, but it's so hard to know — like, they don't know what I want out of the conversation. I don't even know what I really want out of the conversation. Partly I just want them to know that if I act like I'm insane, it's because my life is in turmoil. They should know that, that's all.</p>

<p>But there is this sense that I really do feel like I'm in Alice in Wonderland. I want people to be able to understand that. But I think it's an inherently solitary thing. I think there's a quality in suffering that is inherently solitary, like you are alone. That's hard. (pause)</p>

<p>[10:39.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well, what's your concern?] I mean, about that or, [I don't know].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this is what I'm thinking about CBT. Sometimes it's bad that some interaction between medications has made the side effects of the Adderall ramped up so I can't sleep, and I don't ever want to eat. I really just noticed the eating thing yesterday when I was going to bed and I was like, I've had two CLIF Bars and an apple today, and I'm not hungry. (laughter) Maybe I should try to get in a more structured environment where the time of day dictates the meals. But on the other hand, I do some good thinking at night, which is nice.</p>

<p>[11:35.8]</p>

<p>So the way I experience emotions is changing in the last year, and the last six months in particular. The kind of model that I'm used to is having huge, big, overwhelming, very very present emotions. Like, I'm a crier. When I get in a fight and I'm angry at somebody, I start crying. And when I'm happy, I'm radiantly happy. That's what I'm used to.</p>

<p>What's been happening in the last six months is I'm not doing that anymore. It's like I'm taking a huge portion of my mental and emotional energy and using it to shut off a lot of my emotions. And so I'll be going along, doing distracting things or whatever I need to do or watching TV, and suddenly I'll kind of wake up and realize that I don't feel much.</p>

<p>[12:54.1]</p>

<p>But I do feel under the surface that there's this massive amount of rage and fear and sadness. It's just huge. It's like in the movies when someone is drowning and they pop up and wave and yell, then they go down again and everything is quiet. Or it's like when you're on a laptop typing a paper but on another screen you've got a movie running, and you can't understand why the battery is running out so fast. I don't know if that analogy makes sense. (chuckles) But it's like so much of my energy is going to this thing I'm not necessarily conscious of.</p>

<p>[13:47.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like, if I follow, tremendous, intense drama going on, mostly under the surface with occasional incidents of it breaking through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And in some ways that's really really scary for me. I don't want it to be under the surface. That's way worse in some ways, although not worse is other ways because, you know, I don't want to kill myself, although sometimes I do.</p>

<p>So for me, what I've been doing is trying to bring it up, not try to push it down. Trying to experience what I'm actually feeling, rather than trying to manage it away. That's my theory, anyway.</p>

<p>[15:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds plausible to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really scary because I feel like so much less of a person when this is happening. The parts of me that are available — this is where the computer thing — the parts of me that are available to be with other people or read or focus on anything or live my life, are just so much smaller. I feel like I'm becoming this little person. And I really really don't want that.</p>

<p>So some days it's better, or worth it, to have these cataclysmic emotions because they're happening anyway. (laughter)</p>

<p>[16:18.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's tricky because I guess they don't make a whole lot of sense mostly yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know what you mean about making sense. I feel like I understand where they come from, and I feel like in some ways they're reasonable and in some ways they're not. I just don't know what to do about them. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My guess is that it makes a whole lot of sense, we just don't know — I especially — just don't know how yet.</p>

<p>[17:19.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Something about anger and blaming people or blame. (pause) The problem with (inaudible at 17:41.1) people is you get to see how people do terrible things, thinking it's for the best. Or they do terrible things without quite realizing it. Like you see how people justify their lives to themselves, then you start to buy it. (pause)</p>

<p>[18:10.6]</p>

<p>So I spent a lot of time between the ages of, I don't know, seven and 12 basically pretty emotionally neglected, and to some extent physically neglected, but not seriously. I'm like yeah, it's my parents' fault, they should have done better but they were both really sick. They were both doing the absolute best they could. So how can I be angry at them because that wasn't good enough? And it's not like how do I justify being angry at them. I truly put myself in their position and then I'm not angry at them anymore. But then I'm still angry that it happened. (pause) I don't think you believe me that I'm not angry at them anymore.</p>

<p>[19:36.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I appreciate your leveling with me. (laughter) Yes, when you say something like "I put myself in their position and then I'm not angry at them anymore," which is I believe exactly what you said, that does seem plausibly like a way of coping with being angry. I mean, just parse closely what you said: "I put myself in their position." Like I shift out of my own point of view into theirs, or my point of view becomes theirs instead of what it was before. "And then I'm not angry anymore."</p>

<p>[20:19.8]</p>

<p>Yes, that does make me imagine that as in many other instances, you think about things from the other person's point of view in a way that does away with the anger you had just previously felt. However, okay, if you don't feel it, you don't feel it. You know, I'm not going to tell you to feel something that you don't feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's kind of exactly what I mean. I'm not angry at them, but I'm still really fucking angry. I just don't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it like?</p>

<p>[21:07.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel helpless. I mean, in some ways I'm helpless because this was a long time ago and that's over. I got a lot of bad things out of it and some really good things out of it, and I'm coping. (pause) And, you know, to some extent it affects the way I have relationships with them now. With my dad, I've really been able to kind of — I mean, with both of them I've kind of leveled and said "Yeah, you failed me." But in both cases, I said "You failed me, but I understand why and it's okay."</p>

<p>[22:09.8]</p>

<p>I was able to be a little more honest with my dad than with my mom, in that I was able to be a little more blunt about it. (chuckles) (pause) But it's like, it still happened. (pause) You know, I don't have those needs anymore. What I needed when I was 10, I don't need the same things in the same way anymore. I'm not 10 anymore. But the fact remains that those needs at that time were not met, and it just wasn't fair. (pause) (sniffling)</p>

<p>[23:16.2]</p>

<p>And so I'm still paralyzed by having — you know, there's nothing I can say like "You should fix this." (pause) Because, I mean, in a lot of ways I have fixed it. In a lot of ways, I'm fixing it right now. Like, this is what we're doing. And in a lot of ways, there is no way to fix it. It happened. It was. (pause) (sniffling)</p>

<p>[24:31.3]</p>

<p>And I guess I kind of don't understand why it matters now. (pause) Because I don't need the same things anymore. I mean, I need versions of them, obviously. I know you're going to say "Well, but are the versions of the things you need now" — I'm sorry. I shouldn't put words in your mouth. (laughter) That was just (inaudible at 24:58.3) (laughter) Like I said, I over-interpret sometimes. (pause)</p>

<p>[25:39.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you get pretty analytical about all of this, and I think you also kind of want me too as well. Like to, you know, take another angle or maybe an opposing view. But to help you kind of, sort of in an analytical fashion, hash it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's certainly my instinct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be that with this, that would leave you still feeling quite unheard by either of us.</p>

<p>[26:44.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't understand. (long pause)</p>

<p>[27:32.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm thinking of a way to say it. (long pause) Maybe hashing these things out, or sort of being analytical about them, leaves you or leaves us at some distance from what you're suffering with or what it really feels like. What helps you feel less alone with it. (pause)</p>

<p>[28:57.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, analyzing it is how I both kind of try to get away from it and try to get as close to it as possible. (pause) Because I don't know how to deal with something without naming it, you know? (pause) Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>[30:20.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do I do? (crying) I mean, [I just keep throwing my head at it.] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) I was helping my sister track down some poems for a project she's working on for her job. I found two of my favorite poems that I really both liked when I was younger, and particularly now really speak to me. And those were — you know, I just felt heard by the poems, if that makes sense. Roethke's <i>In a Dark Time</i>, if you —</p>

<p>[31:31.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been a while (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Milton's <i>When I Consider How My Light is Spent</i>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like to —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wrote it down. (laughter) Sorry. It says:</p>

<p>"When I consider how my light is spent,</p>

<p>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,</p>

<p>And that one talent which is death to hide</p>

<p>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent</p>

<p>To serve therewith my Maker, and present</p>

<p>My true account, lest He returning chide;</p>

<p>"Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?"</p>

<p>I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent</p>

<p>That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need</p>

<p>Either man's work or His own gifts. Who best</p>

<p>Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best. His state</p>

<p>Is kingly: thousands at His bidding speed,</p>

<p>And post o'er land and ocean without rest;</p>

<p>They also serve who only stand and wait."</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>[33:23.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I [just thought I'd] sit and weep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I do realize it. (pause) I just can't understand it. (crying) (pause) I don't know whether this is something that's happening to me or something that I'm creating. (sniffling) (pause)</p>

<p>[34:57.8]</p>

<p>You know, I put my faith in figuring things out. I can't figure this out. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it's mostly about [the way you're feeling awful], pretty much. I mean, as much as you try, and often try real hard to figure it out, it seems like most of the time is spent just being pretty overwhelmed by it. Sounds like a wreck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at this point, not being overwhelmed by it, which is really way worse. I feel like I'm losing myself, because I feel like there's some part of me that's moving and functioning and making sure I take all my medicine on time and filling out all these goddamn forms so that I can take a year off and apply for jobs, because external structure is really the only thing that keeps me feeding myself during the day. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[36:41.7]</p>

<p>But like the part of me that matters is gone. And, you know, the people I love the most can't tell the difference. I can't tell the difference sometimes. (sniffling) (pause) You know, then sometimes I think — well, there's always a point in the day where I think I'm being a baby. "See, it's not so bad. Look, see how well I'm functioning. I'm fine." And then there's always a point in the day where I think I'm going to kill myself. I'm not going to be able to live like this.</p>

<p>[37:49.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that's one of the clearest communications you've had about how terribly wrong things are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I am — (sniffling) I mean, in the middle of a conversation and just very clearly in my head is just, you know, "I should just go and slit my wrists now. This is not worth it." (crying) It's so weird. (chuckles) It's awful and it sucks, but it's also just I don't — it's so strange. And then it's awful.</p>

<p>[38:55.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing this has made me think is, we don't have to talk anymore about CBT. I think it's very clear why you fucking hate it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't hate it though. (voices overlapping 00:39:07) I think it's — I know we don't have to talk about it anymore, but I think that it's really useful for some things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look, my point is that — no, it's okay. I'm not being very clear. (pause) So much of what you're saying you're doing is going through various motions and adaptive sorts of behavior to keep yourself going in some sense. At the same time, it's totally killing you.</p>

<p>[39:55.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least not contributing to my reasons to keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess obscuring —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Certainly that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: — how things really are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't tell what an emergency is anymore, you know? Like when I called urgent care on Saturday, she said "Is it an emergency?" and I said "I don't know what that means anymore." (pause) No, I'm not going to kill myself. I mean, I'm really not. I've taken all the necessary steps to make sure that I don't. (pause)</p>

<p>[41:09.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there are moments where you really feel like it, and some part of you really wants to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean if I hadn't taken the necessary steps, I think I'd already be dead. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, "steps" just being I don't look things up on the Internet, [except for a couple of times]. (laughter) I don't like any of the things that would be easy for me to have access to, and I don't try to get the things that are not easy for me to have access to. So no, I'm not going to, because I always snap out of it in enough time. But I kind of wish I would. (crying) (pause)</p>

<p>[42:25.8]</p>

<p>I don't — part of me cares that that would be betraying James and betraying my family and leaving people who need me. (crying) And part of me just really doesn't care. (long pause)</p>

<p>[43:34.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. We'll talk more about it tomorrow.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow. So this week I moved back to the office.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The office?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The office. There's this person that sort of worked there off and on for a few years; a lawyer. It's such a strange world. Three or four people in the office, but hardly everybody really talks inside. It's - always doing some kind of written problem or another. People are busy at computers or writing, and sometimes you just go for long periods of time and don't talk to anybody, so it's sort of strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strange, strange. This is somebody I've known for a few years, but hardly ever - really don't know very much about her really, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what are you doing there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Motions, discovery, inspection, letters, call people on the phone, you know, whatever you do in an office. [2:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You went back there permanently or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no. They called me for it sometime last year, well, Christmas and said well, she's got a couple of trials back to back. And so the trial takes a lot of time, and then what happens when she's stuck in the trial is that the people are maxed up in litigations or people are working a lot of - a lot of motions back and forth and it's moves at a glacially slow pace. But there's a lot of paper that moves along and it gets - I don't know of a way of describing it - and whatever gets resolved gets resolved. Sometimes it seems like one comma at a time you deal with, and then you figure you'll mix (ph) comments and so ...</p>

<p>Anyway, your mind on their work and stuff; it's that sort of thing for a few weeks, I guess, until they catch up with the - until I get tired of that or they get tired of me, whichever happens first at this point.</p>

<p>Used to be it was - she used to call me and say, "Come for a certain number of weeks" or "Come for the trial." Now she's saying just a few weeks, so I don't know what time to leave. It's sort of - I did this last year and it was just a few weeks, and a lot of times weeks are offered and I'm sort of done with it, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're done with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Done with it for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean "done with it?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, get onto something else. There's always more stuff to do than I can quite get done. I've still got the show that's opening so I've got to get back and make sure I'm in on that. Turns out that the subject the guy that's - yeah, he (inaudible at 4:22) died a couple of nights ago so... [4:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A couple of nights ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A couple of nights ago, Sunday night. Well, I guess three nights ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two nights ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, anyway, I [already computed] (ph) it. So Jared, who is the senior, is all wrong (ph). I guess he was counting on the guy coming to the show and things like that, so he was complaining about... I think he's also sort of not quite ready in the sense that he doesn't have a lot of experience doing it through things so he's... Well, you know, the things that you find out that you only find out when you do it and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I've been listening to you and I'm noticing that you're telling me - for example, you're talking about Jared, and you're saying something about Jared and it feels like you were going to say something about him, about how he feels. You say "He is," and then you stop and then you give an explanation, instead of - it felt to me like you were going to say "Oh, he is upset because..." or "He is worried because..." but you kind of skip the feeling thing and you say, "Well, this and this happened and he is - well, I guess he expected that he should come or..." So I have to guess what actually he's feeling, because you're talking - you're trying to tell me what Jared is going on or going through with. [6:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure what's going on with Jared, because he says he's upset, but I don't know, is he really? I guess - I think he's partially upset because the show's sort of a little bit not quite focused yet; I'm not sure he realizes that. I don't he has very much that he does. I mean sort of he's focusing a lot of tension on - a lot of energy on doing the show and it's the sort of thing it's hard to invest a lot of energy and that sort of thing because you don't know exactly... What is the term to explain this? You know, if you've only done just a few of those kinds of things, then you might have a lot of anxiety about how it's going but you wouldn't necessarily have a very clear idea of what to do about it or how to go about it or what to work on or what you need to do.</p>

<p>And so what tends to happen or what's happened to me in situations like that is I'll spend a lot of energy on it, but the energy doesn't go anyplace because they don't know what's - exactly what to do. I think that's what's going on with him, and I think he's a little - I wonder if he gets a little upset because he's - it's not really as well prepared from the last one, his concert, and then a free flowing anxiety and he's nervous about doing the show. And the fact is, all of a sudden, Jack Trenton dies and I think Jared's upset about that. I think he's a little bit - I think he's also upset about the show and I think he's saying that's he's more upset about the fact that Jack Trenton died than - I guess he could be upset about that, because I think he's more upset - he thinks he's more upset about that than he really is. [8:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he's really more upset about - he's really more anxious about the show, but he's saying that he's upset because he's  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a very (cross talk). I think he is upset. I think he's not quite sure what it is that's going on because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is why you were escaping the statement that (cross talk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was escaping it because I didn't know exactly how to express it without going into a long exposition about it. I guess maybe I should just go into the long exposition, because it's a little bit more interesting than my point. At least it's something that I can recognize and identify with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because, well, it's - you can get involved with that sort of thing as a way of avoiding doing other things that maybe are not family or things that you want to personally (inaudible at 9:39)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you're saying. He can get involved with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he's been at odds with his sister and brother-in-law and there was a - we met over there on some evening last week, and by the time I got there - I think he's fine - by the time I got there... He lives way out in Dunning, it's so far and it's in one of those suburbs that's out of the way and you have to follow country roads and sort of proceed to get lost, because people sort of choose to live out of the way in nice large houses and like that. [10:21]</p>

<p>So by the time I got there, there was nobody there but Jared and apparently he didn't have a phone (ph), sort of, you know, on the outs with his sister and children. And so they all left. I guess he was complaining that the children were making too much noise or something like that, and you know, that's not the sort of thing that's really annoying unless he's also concerned about the show or something else or... This was before the sudden death. And if you're being focused on the show and if the show is not quite exactly where it needs to be but it's not going to be where it needs to be until you try it out a few times and, you know, sort of working [as if them] (ph), then the...</p>

<p>And also he has no family other than just the sister and the nieces and the nephews and the brother and the in-laws and stuff like that. So he just lives with his father. I think he has this sort of lack of connection with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much zero connection was there? [11:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, friendly I guess. It's just the - it was supposed to be a business relationship I guess, and then the show - but the show doesn't make any - none of the shows make any money, so it sort of goes on.</p>

<p>And now there's these performances and there's some other performance in May and maybe another performance in May, and I spend a lot of time with it and he sort of depends on me to do a certain amount of work, maybe a little bit more of the work than I'd really like to do, and so I am sort of getting a little tired of it. It's something which doesn't lead anyplace that's beneficial to me, or hasn't yet, and I don't know if it's ever going to and... I don't know, we'll see what happens. Those sorts of things tend not to become wild successes as most everybody knows business (inaudible at 13:06).</p>

<p>But if it might lead to some other things just sort of by accident. There's a lot of stuff that I wind up doing in the music business which doesn't really generate any income particularly but which sort of, maybe somewhere down the line, it sort of seems to be characteristic of that sort of thing. So I'm sort of beginning to wonder if the effort, which there hasn't been much effort, is really something that I want to do again. I would suppose there could be other shows to chunt (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking now about what you want to talk about? [14:15]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure what I want to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been listening to you and I had - all of a sudden I had an eerie feeling, like - and remembering our previous meeting, where we started talking about something. It was about your show actually, about similar thing - I know it wasn't about Jared - and then you told me, "Well, this is actually not what I wanted to talk about."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm bothered by the fact that I was thinking last night that all the people I know and all the relationships (inaudible at 15:03) with people sort of [after fall] (ph), the certain fall apart ones, and I was just thinking about that last night. It's just like every single one of them sort of goes for a while and then where they're - [whether they find that it's just] (ph)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing that's coming - nothing that's coming off that's - that it's what they want or vice versa (inaudible at 16:06) I know people for a while and then it's just ... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just heard you laugh; I'm not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckling) [I've been through] (ph) two marriages and (inaudible at 16:44) some - what's the word? Burdensome.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And after a while he's (inaudible at 17:15) Everything gets so angry after a while and basically I just want out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm thinking about last week, about how you came here last week and sounded like you'd got here in the same state of mind, or did you? Because you came and you said that you didn't feel that anything was happening and you were wondering about the whole thing, is it (inaudible) for you. And it did sound a little bit like you were thinking about getting out. But what you told me last week wasn't that you didn't have anything to say, but on the contrary, that you felt that you had a lot to say but you were afraid of saying that. Actually, you said that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have this urge. I just think it's hard to (inaudible at 19:38) sometimes and it's hard to (inaudible). It's like, "Hey, I've got to quit the running." I'm running away I guess. [20:04}</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what are you running away from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Running away from anybody else because... I'm not even sure what it is. It's like the secrets I have are no big deal. I have these - I have all kinds of... For instance, I go to an island. There's a - the people have never been home and we - involved with the chorus, and I never - it's just silly. [I marry her] (ph) and never told any of them that I went. I know I went to school recently, but I never told them that or told them to think about it, and like I'm just - you know, there's really no reason to talk about it but it seems... There doesn't seem to be any good reason, well, not to worry there. Because I think - I used to think that they would say, "Well, we can't do this anymore because your loyalty is someplace else." It didn't seem to be anything at all. [22:37]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you couldn't state that you had worked in a law firm because that would mean that your loyalties were somewhere else than music?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 22:51). It might be that they would think it was pretty impersonal in some way, but I don't know why. I can't imagine why that it would be sort of important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't imagine either, why it could be so important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe somebody would ask "Why did you do that," and then I wouldn't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't know what to say? [24:27]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The [moat say why] (ph)(inaudible at 24:38) (chuckling). I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Elliot, what is this place that you're laughing about now? What is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 25:00) funny I (chuckling) I know all these... no, it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold a second. Hold a second. You're not going to answer me  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckling)[The flying star] (ph)(chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking of all these people that I've met who were at (inaudible at 25:27) [global performers] (ph) and they were - it seemed like such a pleasant existence (ph). I wasn't - it wasn't going anyplace and I never thought that it was - it sort of seemed like it might be fun and it just sort of [lumpy leads to murder in their yards] (ph). Strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is amusing? [26:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now (ph), some of the people were amusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What... You see, I'm trying to be with you as your  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just (inaudible at 26:18)(chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not blaming you of anything, I just want to tell you what Kurt's doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry. It's [gen formation] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just trying to follow you, and it seems like, you know, I'm going in all kinds of places.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Down at the funny place is prominent now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckling). I don't know if it's funny or not. I'm sorry. There was this woman I met that was also (ph), and I went down to the apartment and, you know, we went out a couple of times and I just got so more involved than I thought was - more involved than I expected to be, and it was just a couple of - just went out a couple of times. But I don't know why it was - really got very upset afterwards; didn't seem to go anyplace. [28:09]</p>

<p>And it was some years ago, and it wasn't all that much left in the marriage I had really, and after that it was (inaudible at 29:18) just nothing that (inaudible at 29:29) she sort of (inaudible at 29:35) so (inaudible at 29:40) very frustrating for her not having any idea what's going on (inaudible at 29:58) matter anyways. I mean I wasn't quite the jolly (inaudible at 30:25) you only [discover] (ph) those things that you expect to somehow improve the situation and resolve the situation there. It seemed to be pretty dreadful then, so what it is that come out of your (inaudible at 30:44).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is another example for a secret that you kept.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you started by telling me about secrets.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 31:02) always telling a secret. I've gotten very tired of secrets. It's always been secrets. Even when I was a child the secrets - you have to be careful about secrets, because secrets you tell can come back and hit you; your secrets, anybody's secrets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you keeping any secrets from me, right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Undoubtedly I can look around and find lots and lots of secrets. I don't think so, not - maybe. Let me think. It's - some are true. In terms of... If it was a secret about something that was going on, there would be no secrets. You need a secret [as if nothing goes along] (ph). [32:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't follow you. I don't understand what you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean last time I went out with somebody was this other person, you know (inaudible at 32:43)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were at school.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, before. And I was beginning to realize that it's kind of foreseeable future and it's not good; it's the last chance. It's (chuckling)(inaudible at 33:57) Remember when I was here before?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were here before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not here, but this program.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Previous therapy you had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It's (inaudible at 34:16) completed this (inaudible at 34:18) the guy said that - I guess this was in his car and he was supposed to be going along and he's (inaudible at 34:34) that... let's try and meet somebody, but soon, but then we didn't so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He said that you should meet somebody, that you should try to meet somebody? You're speaking so quietly that I have to recreate what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sorry. Try to meet somebody. What I thought was, how could he say that? I thought how could he say that when it was obvious that that couldn't happen at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was (inaudible at 36:22) did that with you? [36:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Well, I think not. [Truly may] (ph), I mean when it happened before there were these unpleasant things that happened afterwards, like this church choir thing that they sent for one reason or another. It might be some (inaudible at 37:05) have to do with the other. It wasn't as if it was (inaudible at 37:11).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [If I had just been dating a woman] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I think she probably called them up and delivered something. She sort of was the type that would do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't sound very pleasant (inaudible at 37:37).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe she was angry at me because I never told her that I was married, unless maybe she figured out so... And maybe she decided that just, you know, really - going to decide after a little while it's not quite the same anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of kept her a secret from your wife, and you kept your wife a secret from her? [38:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I mean like it was [more of a big deal] (ph). Turned out to be a bigger deal than I thought; can't seem to let it go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't seem to let it go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can't seem to let it go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That's a fear and what it could do] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't even the fear (inaudible at 38:50)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This felt like now - when I repeated what you said and you repeated it again to me - this felt to me that you were doing this with anger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, that you were annoyed that I didn't get you; that you had to repeat it. Were you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. What I heard you say was let "her" go and what I meant to say was let "it" go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was wrong; I didn't get what you were saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure that it was - I'm not sure that it runs to the level of an affair, not (inaudible at 39:50) so... When you think of an affair it's usually something that just - you acquired it and it's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were kind of annoyed with me or..</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. [40:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was trying to say what I felt. No reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We've really got to stop in a minute and I'm wondering how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's very - sort of hard to feel like - it's very hard for me to talk about these things (inaudible at 41:06) feel a little of the (inaudible at 41:12) let some of it out. Obviously (inaudible at 41:23) talk about. And of course, present employment would be the same probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Present employment? [42:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm. Some of the churches, different churches (inaudible at 42:26)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kind of afraid that your present employment, it prevents [when you meet] (ph) the potential?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 42:40)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 42:43)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You would think so. I would think so. This is the [places where they make people] (ph) so certainly, you know, considering the general attitude - considering the general attitude it would be somewhat lost, somehow lost in the minds of (inaudible 43:17) going to be there, that's for sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Triple assets] (ph). I always have to go through that step by step, because with a new job or new people you (inaudible at 43:52) think through these things; "Is this somebody I'd like to know, is this somebody I'd like to know," and you have to (chuckling) after I go through the process of elimination, then it's apparent that the answer's always no so I just feel like I'm, you know, sort of stranded again. [44:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's stop for today. I've been wondering, could you come at 3 o'clock instead of 3:15?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? So can we change that from now on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great. Thank you; that will help me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So next week at 3.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's turning next week full to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is yours.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF: Client 018 Session 8 Tape 128</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This Is Client 1923-018, Client 1923-018, Session # 8, Session # 8. February 23, 1971, Session #8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm so tired </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, hi (ph), you were on the ski trip (inaudible at 0:26) you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes. I had a fairly good time, but not as much as I usually would with several reasons. One of which is the fact that there was ice. Because it was raining here, and I thought it'd never rain way over in Missouri. It's raining here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it raining in Missouri?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was ice </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that (inaudible at 0:58) really wrecks your skiing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh listen, I was, actually I want to say it was better Sunday than it was bad Saturday, than Saturday, but I think actually for me it was better Saturday. Sunday was like, Saturday was like skiing on a snow cone, which you might ski on it. I mean you could get an edge into it. You could move around. Once you break the surface you could move in it, but this (inaudible at 1:24) I think I would have enjoyed it if it'd been regular snow, but instead it was, had about an inch of snow on top of ice. And it was just, it'd been, it'd been rained over. By night it'd been rained on, and it just glazed the whole thing, just a solid sheet of ice. And then Saturday night it snowed on top of it. And there was a little bit of snow, a little bit of snow on top of this ice and the ice was the worst where people had been boring down the middle you know of the la . . . [2:06].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whatever they're called.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People had been boring down the middle, or on the sides, until it was really packed down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was really bad. I just get so nervous, but it made me so mad because I was trying to, I'm getting a little better at skiing. And, but I had rented skis, and I couldn't set my edges very well. And I was scared from the time I got off the chair lift until I got back down to the boot again. Well there were some spaces were it wasn't bad; it was all right. But, the hills, it seemed like the steeper it got, the worse it got. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: First, the whole bad feeling about the skiing and being scared and not being able to enjoy it, not being able to feel like it was going well? I mean [3:02] . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but I enjoyed it. I was going to think just about skiing right? I, I forgot what I was going to think about. I just, I just, I can't go like . . . I, I didn't talk to myself before that. What we had talked about on Thursday, the 'n' word that I probably, in order to have a good time, just relax. But I was, when I was skiing, I was concentrating on skiing. Because I wasn't, I didn't ski with Jesse, and most of the time I skied by myself. It's why I didn't have any . . . I just skied, mostly.</p>

<p>Oh, I took a lesson Sunday. We were doing sideslipping. I can't sideslip. I cannot do it. I keep putting my weight on my uphill ski. I just put my little butt too far back, too far forward. I spent an hour sitting on the ice, and I don't even learn how to sideslip. Ouch, every time I fell. And you fall on your rear, and it, usually it doesn't hurt when you fall on your rear. You sit down in the snow and everything. Well this is solid ice. You land on your rear and it just, oh and slide and it hurts, oh. [4:18].</p>

<p>Jesse was with another girl all weekend too, which didn't, did not do anything for my mood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmmm, okay, so growled that (inaudible at 4:24).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean he was very pleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean </p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The . . .not that he growled at you, but that you growled at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah right, I did. I really did.</p>

<p>I kind of expected it. You know, I told you</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know what to do. I like him. I said hello. He complimented me on my pantsuit. I about dropped dead right there before him because, I told you, Jesse just doesn't do things like that. And I thought maybe I was wrong? And so, and he was busy doing his little chip trip chair run, so he was quite busy getting everything, making everything look like it's really going smooth and everything. [5:09]</p>

<p>So I just didn't, I didn't bother him. And then I got on the bus and I got and went and put my junk on the bus and everything and to get the seat I wanted and stuff. And I was sitting there and everybody was getting on the bus, and I was sitting by myself, and I didn't know whether to save a place for Jesse or not.</p>

<p>And Peter Maze, who's just a buddy of mine, just a friend, I was carrying some of his junk for him. I was carrying his water flask, and so I still had it when we got on the bus, and he was sitting down, and somebody said where you sitting? And Peter said," I'm sitting here. I've got to stay close to my flask." Because I had the flask. And, I said, well you can sit with me if you want. And he said, "Are you sitting with anybody?" And I said, no. And then I thought oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that [6:06]</p>

<p>Jesse got on the bus and sat down with Sue, who I thought he was going to be with, and he gave me a funny look. And I thought, uh oh, I shouldn't have done that. He looked so freaked.</p>

<p>Later on we were just talking. I mean the whole time Peter Maze and I were just talking. </p>

<p>So like well when I was (inaudible at 6:23), I play guitar, and I took my guitar with me. And we were both, Jesse plays pretty good too. He plays a lot better than I do, and we were both playing guitar and singing and stuff, you know, a bunch of people and everything. And he just kept staring straight at me. And I thought well, you know, maybe all is not lost. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? (inaudible at 6:39)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, and then he sat back down after we were singing and everything. He sat back down with Emily. So I sat back down with Peter</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hm, It's clear that he was, the way was staring at you like, he was enthralled and he was thinking about you [7:00].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then I don't know, so finally, and he was with Emily all the time on Sunday. And it's such a weird feeling to know that you really really like this guy, and so, and he knows, and you know, and she knows that, because all three are on all three trips that I was with Jesse. And she knew that I used to, that I was going with Jesse. Until just recently I was going with Jesse. And we both, and she knew we used to ski together all the time, just the two of us. We used to do everything all toget-, two, just the two of us together all the time we were on the ski trips. </p>

<p>We're skiing, and I'm talking to her and he's skiing with her. I mean she doesn't ski with him, he skied with her. I mean she was just kind of . . . he came up and started skiing with her and everything. And I don't know how she felt. I was, I got, well if he's gonna do that . . . because she and I were skiing together and she and I are about the same, like beginning intermediates or getting close to intermediate intermediates. And she and I . . . so we ski together a lot because we, we ski the same slopes, and we have about the same ability. And so he came up and started skiing with us. And she didn't know what to do, and I didn't know what to do, so we both just didn't do anything. We just pretended like he was another girl or something. [8:28]</p>

<p>Oh, I was kind of mad at him for that. I mean he didn't have to come over and ski with both of us at the same time. I mean well, he actually wasn't skiing with both of us. He was skiing with Sue. But I was skiing with Emily, and if he thinks I'm going to leave just because he came up, he's out of his mind because I enjoy skiing with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: something about adding. . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Insult to injury.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yes, not only does he ski with another girl, he skis with the girl you are skiing with. [9:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. The girl, I wouldn't have been skiing with her because I knew he was going to be with her. I wouldn't have been skiing with her if he'd been out there. I mean I wouldn't have come up and started skiing with the two of them. But like I was there first, oh well anyway. I didn't think he was going to ski. He's having trouble with his leg.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about the whole thing that . . . </p>

<p>PATIENT. Yeah. So finally he was with Emily Saturday night, and I wanted to talk to him. So filled with liquid courage, I finally asked him to rub my back. I thought that'd be a good excuse for me to talk to him. Well, we get in my room, and he started rubbing my back and two and a half seconds later, all three of my roommates walk in. So I couldn't talk to him then, I said, just enjoy the backrub. He gives excellent backrubs.</p>

<p>And so then he started to leave. So I had the thought oh, I've got to ask him now because if I don't ask him now, I never going to ask him, and I would definitely like to know what's going on, right? [10:07]</p>

<p>And I, so I, I've only had the courage to ask a guy just a couple of times in my life, and I've never gotten a straight answer before, but I'd get a straight answer from him.</p>

<p>I said, Jesse (inaudible at 10:20), come here I want to talk to you. I've been wanting to talk to him all evening, and I told him that, but I'd never really had the chance to really get started.</p>

<p>And I said, listen, I'd really like to know what's going on because . . . and then I just . . . well just because. Because if he doesn't know why I really have an interest, then he's just stupid </p>

<p>I have a right to know. And I said I'd like to know what's happening?</p>

<p>And he said, "Well." He said, "Nothing has changed, first of all."</p>

<p>And I said well that's strange. I would have sworn something had changed.</p>

<p>He said, "Nothing has changed. I still feel the same way about you." He said, "But I felt that things were getting a little too serious." [11:12]</p>

<p>Now, I don't know whether he thought that he was getting serious or whether he thought that I was getting serious. I never did get that out of him. </p>

<p>But . . . I'm not, I thought of a much better way to say this last night as I was going to sleep. Unfortunately, it was a little bit late. Saturday night would have been a much better time to think of it, anyway.</p>

<p>But he said nothing has changed. He just felt that things were getting a little bit too serious, and he wasn't ready to get serious right now. Now whether he thought I was getting serious and he wasn't ready to get serious, or he was getting serious and wasn't ready to, again, like I said, I don't know. </p>

<p>And he . . . so I said, well last night I thought of a beautiful line, but I said, I said, well look, I said you really didn't have anything to worry about. You could have asked me, and I would have told you. I said I like you, and, and I, I like you more than just friends, I said but I'm not ready,. I'm not hearing wedding bells or seeing stars. And things are not that serious. I'm, I told him, if you were, I'm a very affectionate person, and I'm warm, and I may seem more zealous or more affected than I really, than I am because you don't know people who are like me. [12:35]</p>

<p>And he said, well he just felt that it'd be better to cool it for a while, but things are still the same as they were. Nothing has changed.</p>

<p>So I went back to my room totally unsatisfied. I thought, I thought yeah, nothing has changed. Well, does that mean that he never did like me and was just fooling around with me for a little while or really did like me, and he's, and he's torturing himself by being with other women for the weekend, so he won't be with me. So he won't get serious, or what does this mean? [13:10]</p>

<p>And then I said, well, go ask him. I'd just love to. I know where he is; he is in Emily room right now. So I thought, I'll never have another chance like this. I'll never have the guts to do this again. So I got up, put Alicia robe on, walked down the hall, knocked on the door and said, Jesse, can I talk to you for a minute? I said, Emily, I'll bring him right back.</p>

<p>She's, "Fine." She said, she said, "Don't hurry. I want to go to sleep before he gets back."</p>

<p>He was keeping her awake because she'd, she'd, she'd been making cracks all day about he and he and one other guy, who were making cracks, and she said, she was saying, "Well all right, just wait until you try to go to sleep tonight." </p>

<p>And so he was going to keep her awake. Anyway.</p>

<p>And I said, I have one question further, I . . . </p>

<p>And he said, "What's that?"</p>

<p>I said do I have anything to lose?</p>

<p>"No." He said, "What did you mean did you have anything to lose?"[14:11]</p>

<p>I said, well you told, you said that things hadn't changed. Things were the same as they are. I said but how were things when they that, they are the same as they are now? What was there before? And I get another unsatisfactory answer, but I couldn't, I, I just wasn't thinking fast enough to push it any further.</p>

<p>He said, he said, "Well."</p>

<p>I said, what was there? What did I have? That I've lost or haven't lost?</p>

<p>What has not changed? What do I have?</p>

<p>And he said, "Well." He said, "I . . . "</p>

<p>Oh how did he say it? I remember the first part. Second part he said was, he said, he said that he'd never go, he doesn't even bother about anybody that he doesn't like except to say hello or something like that, but he'd wouldn't bother, but that he wouldn't bother, he wouldn't bother going out with someone he didn't like. In other words, he liked me a little bit. He went out with somebody, and then like nobody is going to take people out on dates that they didn't like. [15:16]</p>

<p>So, so what makes him think he's different from anybody else doing that? He just liked me. He didn't like me a lot or have any kind of special feeling for me at all. Or, he could have, or he could admit that he doesn't mess around with anybody that he just doesn't have a special feeling for . . . I don't know. But . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you still don't know whether. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something next door to indifference or something that's . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That's a good phrase. If I ever get up enough nerve to talk to Jesse again, I'm going to use that. "Next door to indifference." I like that. Oh I was thinking about last night, writing him a letter because I was thinking, I was just clicking right along with neat things to say last night. Good things, not just silly neat, cute things, but things that were short and sweet and really said what I wanted to say. I was thinking about writing him a letter, but that's dumb. Didn't want to write him a letter, I'd rather talk to him. But I don't, I can't get up enough nerve to talk to him besides I've already brought up the subject twice already in one night. But I still don't know where I am. [16:24]</p>

<p>And then, I'm like, it's like, I'm not, I told him I'm not asking for a commitment or anything. But I'm not saying, I'm not asking you to say yes or no or maybe or what it's just, I just want to know if, if, if I was just someone that, well she's a nice kid you know, and she's, she's, she's, she's, she's all right to go out with or something like that. I mean. Someone that . . . I mean just saying that he wouldn't go out with someone he didn't like is, is, is not saying a whole lot. Because I don't know of any guy who's going to ask a girl out on any date that he doesn't like. </p>

<p>I mean that's just a little silly . . .unless, he's getting paid for it or something.[17:04]</p>

<p>So the weekend, and it's so funny though. I was never, I always had a guy all weekend.</p>

<p>And it was so strange because I figured if I wasn't with Jesse; I'd just be really all by myself and be spending the evening with the girls or something. And that gets a bit boring because Alicia is usually off with Jimmy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought well we had a, a ski instructor who was an 18 year old girl. She can't go in the bar, but she's a real nice kid. So I thought I'd just spend the evening with her. If nothing else, we could start a party in her room or something. But she got sick. She'd taught all day Saturday, but she didn't feel well at all. And so she spent all night Saturday night in bed. She was in good shape Sunday. But she didn't feel well Saturday night. [18:02]</p>

<p>And Josie was in a very bad mood. And all she, the things that she has to talk about I get very bored with very fast. And she talks about more trivia and more junk than I do. And people listen to her. That's what gets me. I'll sit there and listen. They'll gripe, but they'll sit there and listen. When she's gone, they'll say, oh boy, but they sit there and listen. Me, they wouldn't even listen to. I don't understand it.</p>

<p>She has done some things to guys in their lives just really mean rotten things and they just, and they, they do nothing. They just get furious at her, but they, do they stop seeing her or anything? No. I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She gets all this attention without deserving it at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, well, it's just that if she does these things to me and when she starts making me mad and everything, I just tell her to go to hell . . . and these guys, and so she doesn't get on my back too much. I've known her for years, and I just won't put up with the garbage she has to hand out, and she knows it. So when she starts handing out garbage, I usually just leave. Or I, or if I can't possibly leave, I tell her to leave me alone.[19:19]</p>

<p>But, we get along fine. But she does things like the . . . a guy will come over to see her and she's been when she's was sick she'd be home all day, and it'd be like a half hour before her mom was supposed to get home, and she hadn't done anything all day, and there were dishes in the sink and different things that had to be done and everything like that, and she'd say, "Quick, help me clean up the house."</p>

<p>Once. This happening once, maybe twice, two times apart, far apart, it's all right. But it happens three times a week, and the guy goes ahead and helps her. I think if I were him, I'd schedule my visits so that I got there after her mother got home. If I wanted to see her, or just quit going.[20:02]</p>

<p>I mean like, I don't really need to go over and help her clean up her house. I wouldn't do it, and I'm a girl. I mean, I mean I wouldn't do it simply because of the fact that I know Josie hasn't done anything all day. And I know Lynn. And I know, no matter what she says to somebody else, I know what's going on. I've known her too long.</p>

<p>But . . . and she'll talk about, and I'm sitting there thinking, when she's talking, about how ridiculous and stupid the conversation is. And Josie never says one word when she can use twenty. If she can explain it three different ways instead of one way, she will . . . in the same sentence. And so her stories just drag on, and they really do worse than mine. That's what happens to my stories too sometimes they tend to drag on. I get too particular. But I and people sit there and listen to her. Nobody gets ups and walk away or interrupts her or anything else. And I have the feeling that everybody is just as bored with the whole subject, with the whole story as I am [21:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She does all this to . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she still commands this attention that I can't command out of anybody. And I don't know if it's so much respect for the person individually because of some of the junk Josie pulls she doesn't, people like her, but they don't so much respect her.</p>

<p>She does pull a lot of sneaky stuff, and everybody knows it. It's like I don't respect her too much, but I really like her. She's . . .and I don't understand. I'm the same way. I really kind of like the kid. I don't know why. She aggravates me, and I keep saying I'm never going to talk to her again if she keeps this up. She pulls all these little conniving tricks and everything, and yet I still . . . and if I did things like that at all, I would become the world's loneliest person so fast.[22:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because like you feel like you're, if you lost anything more you'd have zero.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm. I just don't know what this quality is about her that makes people like her. She's not necessarily bubbly. She's not ugly, but she's not pretty. She's . . . I mean this is the quality that people have that I don't know what it is, but all as long as I've known her different boyfriends she's had, she's really treated them wrong and they just keep coming back. So,</p>

<p>they, they, most of them were my buddies. Her boyfriends were my buddies, and I'd get these phone calls at odd hours bitching about her, "Do you know what she did now?"[23:09]</p>

<p>And I always got both sides of the story because Josie always had a story to tell me too. She didn't know that I'd talked to them. But, it really aggravates me, and yet they keep going with her and going with her and going with her.</p>

<p>You can develop ulcers and high blood pressure at the same time, but I mean. And this, this is what I don't have. And I don't think it, and this is, this is the frustrating thing about it, is, is that I should tell myself not to worry about it, first of all. Because what this is, is, is, is natural. It's not something I can do. It's not necessarily anything wrong with me. There's nothing that I can do to change me and become like her. And I don't want . . . I wouldn't want to become like her, but I 'd want to have this like magnetic quality. But I just think it's . . . it's like my dad. My dad. Everybody likes my dad. And, and he doesn't really do anything special. He's just nice to people. He's not, he doesn't, he's not, he doesn't do anything that special to people, he's just nice to them. [24:20]</p>

<p>I'm nice to people and it doesn't get me anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you've been saying over and over again. Something that other people have that draws people to them, and I don't have it, and I don't really know what it is, and it's elusive, and I couldn't even really put my finger on it . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: . . . and it's, it's just disturbing and confusing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it, it, it, it, it bothers me, and it bothers me, and I, and I really, I don't think there's anything I can do about it. Like I say, it's a natural quality some people have, but . . . </p>

<p>I don't know. Anyway.[25:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm wasting time. Do you want to talk about something else? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll talk about I was going to this weekend concentrate on just concentrate on really getting into one thing at a time. I was going to concentrate on really getting into skiing, but and I was doing it all right on the gentle slopes, but the steeper slopes, I'd forget about it and just get scared because I'd get to going so fast. I'd got frustrated with myself because I couldn't set my edges. But, I don't know, I, I was, I really didn't, I pretty much did what I said I was going to do like try to relax and concentrate on one thing at a time and not so much worry about how I'm getting across to other people. And I was thinking about this last night as I was going to sleep, that I really didn't worry that much. [26:05]</p>

<p>Occasionally, I'd, I mean what, there were three ski clubs up there, ours and two others at the lodge. And Saturday night everybody was down at the bar, and I saw one cute guy. And I thought to myself, I wonder what his opinion is? And I wonder sometimes, if I don't look kind of cold or something like that because, I know, you walk across the room, and you see a guy staring at you, out of the corner of your eye, and you're wondering what he's thinking. And if he looks at you for very long, if you can see him looking at you like you're walking halfway across the room, you think well now, if he didn't like me at first glance, he wouldn't have kept looking right? </p>

<p>But then you wonder . . .do I look cold or why wouldn't that person, if I'm just sitting there doing nothing, walk up and start talking to me? Unless the guy is shy too or something like that. Most of these guys I run into, these skiers, aren't necessarily that shy. But yeah, there are still shy people and extraverts (inaudible at 27:04) who go skiing. </p>

<p>But, yeah a couple of times like that I think about it, but I was too worried, I was too busy most of the time worrying about where Jesse was and what he was doing. Or skiing and getting frustrated about that. But I didn't so much like worry, I enjoyed myself this weekend, but I was, I spent more time seems like I spent more time wondering like about where Jesse was and what was happening with Jesse. </p>

<p>But I didn't follow, I'd kind . . . I came well, like I'd come off the slopes, and I'd want to have something to say, and so I'd start griping about how bad I was skiing. And that made me mad, I wish I'd just kept my mouth shut. And yet if I'd walked in and sat down and not said anything, I would have gotten questions, "(inaudible at 27:58) What's the matter"</p>

<p>But I didn't have anything else to say, so I said something about skiing, and then I'd just kind of sit there and listen to everybody else talk.</p>

<p>I don't know. So I did a pretty good job of not talking too much, and not telling too many stories that went along with other people's stories. I think I did that twice. Passing around stories.</p>

<p>And one of them was, we were talking about dogs biting people and then being thrown immediately into quarantine for two weeks for having rabies, and which I thought was a little dumb because the only time my dog ever bit anybody was, he was protecting me. And the person he bit was the person he was protecting me against. Same thing happened to Josie's dog. This cop, Josie was sitting, she's got two great big Great Danes, and this cop walks, she was sitting in her car, and this cop walked up without any lights or anything and walked up and started putting his hand in the window. And her female dog was sitting right in front in the seat next to her and went right past her and went right through the window after the guy, the cop. And we were discussing it so I put one story in there about my dog and he was protecting me too, and they had to put him in quarantine. Rambo was this mild-mannered dog. He was a Cocker Spaniel, but . . . and I think I told one other story. Most of the time I kept my mouth pretty much shut and had a good time [29:34]</p>

<p>I was playing Ping-Pong. I'd never played Ping-Pong before. Alicia and I were playing Ping- Pong, but we were just doing the lousiest job in the world, laughing and having a good time, and I really enjoyed it. I just really enjoyed it. I wasn't really worried about impressing anybody</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's just kind of like what you wanted in a way, the way you got into the Ping- Pong game, like . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSEOR: There's nothing there but the Ping-Pong game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well like the people were laughing at us. We were laughing at us. And I knew we were putting on a show, so I might have put on a little more of a show than I would have, being a little sillier. I was having a good time though. And, then I see Jesse, and then I start to worry about Jesse. </p>

<p>Yeah, basically it was a good trip. I was like, I didn't really concentrate and think about relaxing or doing anything or just getting into anything really big. I had like, forgot all about it, just forgot all about that I was going to do that. But even though I forgot about it, I kind of did it anyway mostly. Yeah, I, a couple of times I was down on myself because I was sitting, well I was sitting with one guy going up on the bus -excuse me- and sitting with another guy coming back. I really didn't have anything to say to these people who were sitting there talking. I sat there talking to a couple of the girls, and I can talk to them all night, but I have nothing to say to these guys. [31:16]</p>

<p>Say unless you start telling family histories or something, or talking about your job or something, just chitchatting. I can't do it. I never can figure out subjects. Someday I'm gonna sit down and write down a list of subjects to talk about. Someday I'm going to mentally memorize them so that in any situation, when I need something to talk about, I can just consult my list 'oh by the way,' and I really hate to start a political argument or anything like that. </p>

<p>I love to get into political arguments that are already going on, but I don't want to start it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? [32:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Uh, I, I, I used to know a person who was always starting arguments about political situations and everything. And every once in a while, it's good. I just like it better when a topic just kinda wanders around to a political question or a question on the war. Just wanders to it rather than just starting out conversation bang, we're . . . I had a friend who, was always, never opened his mouth until he wanted to argue with somebody about a political situation, right?</p>

<p>It . . . so and I remember how it used to aggravate me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, you don't want to be that aggravated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It s' not that if I just did it once somebody would want to talk about it </p>

<p>But I, like you have to know. You have to know the person and you have to know what they like to talk about and what they're like and some of the likes and dislikes can start an argument.</p>

<p>Or you may say something and have him agree with you and . . . well, that's nice we agree on that, but so much for the conversation.</p>

<p>Like this one girlfriend and I used to argue all the time. I love to argue anyway, but I never got into any arguments with people in the ski club or any people that I know that I really enjoy. </p>

<p>[33:37]</p>

<p>You know these people I won't, as a matter of fact I almost refuse to argue, because they make such stupid statements. They just are so illogical and everything that I just, I just will not argue with them. I like to argue with someone who has intelligent things to say, who can argue with you on both sides.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I used to argue. She's a Lutheran, and I'm a Catholic, and we were taking catechism at the same time. And Lutheran catechism and Catholic catechism are almost the same, almost exactly the same, and so we were arguing fine points of our religion. We were arguing, we were both saying the same thing but in different ways. We were arguing about the different ways we were saying it. It was about the only difference and so we, I enjoyed arguing with her.[34:25]</p>

<p>My father has got this friend who loves to aggravate me, who loves to really get me going in an argument. He'd say stupid things because he knows it aggravates me. We'll be discussing a topic, his side versus mine, just discussing it, and then when he thinks I'm really getting into it, really starting to get good with my mind, my mind's limbered up a little bit, he starts to throwing me stupid statements because he knows it makes me mad. It really aggravates me. We were discussing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting off of topic again, [inaudible at 35:15] get back on topic . . . what to talk about with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I felt like a dud that's the only time I was really down on myself</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 35:20) What to say to these guys.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I walk up and see Jesse and Emily really into some conversation. When we were sitting on the bus together, we never talked. Now whether she starts the conversations or not, I don know. I didn't have anything. I'd try to think of things to say, and I couldn't think of anything to say, and Jesse intuitively would talk. I saw that. But I just saw other people sitting there talking, and I really feel like sitting there on the bus, duh, especially I was sitting with Adam on the way back. </p>

<p>Peter going up, I have a lot of things to talk about because he's chairman of the scuba committee. And I'm gonna ask. I'm going, hopefully, take scuba lessons if I can scratch up the money. Tired of being broke. But if I can scratch up the money I'm going to go on this, take scuba lessons. And I was talking to him about scuba because he's been scuba diving for years. And there are different things we have in common to talk about. He likes bikes, motorcycles, and so do I. The scuba diving, the skiing like that. So we can talk about sports activities. [36:36]</p>

<p>And we're both elbow-benders from way back so we can discuss uh, oh we've got things to talk about. And he's usually talking a lot anyway. You know what I mean? Being friendly with everybody. I like it when you're sitting with a group of people and talking, but on the way back everybody was tired too. There wasn't so much group action going on. But I always feel so stupid when I can't think of anything to say, so duddy (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like this dull person who just doesn't have anything, nothing to offer people just a blob sitting there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I can't get away from it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't get away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just can't get away from being a nice kid, but just a nice kid, nothing special. No. I don't consider myself a brain. I consider myself a fairly intelligent person. And I feel like I ought to be able to create an image of . . . but I don't want to create an image. If I was willing to work at it, I could probably create an image. If I really worked at it hard, but I'd rather instead of creating an extra image, I just want to, I don't know. I guess, I guess I want to change myself, which is impossible to do. I mean my personality is my personality. But I think you can develop personality so I can't change it, but I can probably develop it.[38:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like to develop into something more special.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't know, maybe a, just a question of gaining more poise. The art of conversation. Maybe I could read a book on the art of conversation or something (inaudible at 38:52) book </p>

<p>Do you know of anybody who wrote a book on the art of conversation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oddly enough I do. I don't know if you'll like it. (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. I picked it up over Christmas vacation. It's called How To Get a Teenage Boy and What to Do With Him When You Get Him. It has a chapter on how to talk to boys.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it any good? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well . . . </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want a teenage boy, but (laughter).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Actually, I was sort of impressed. I mean I was fairly impressed with it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. There's something, it's very imagey (ph). It's the only practical thing I've ever heard anyone say on the matter</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, I wonder if they've got a book on how to attract an adult man or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have the feeling that some of the same stuff would work. (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, men are always boys or something. Yeah, I might . . . what is it a paperback book?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might buy it and see what it has to say about the art of conversation because there probably I mean would be pointers. People who don't know how to talk to other people learn how to talk to other people. I mean, it's just, I don't know how to go about doing it (inaudible at 40:14) I suppose.</p>

<p>They don't offer any courses here about how to talk to people. I take public speaking, but that doesn't help much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's different or something. That's . . . </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, talking to people on a personal level. I have no trouble talking to people who are older than me. I don't know why. Maybe it's because it's like talking to somebody's parents. They do most of the question asking, and I can respond to questions and get going from there. But as far as initiating conversations . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about getting it going yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, initiating conversations. I mean I can keep going. I can join in on a conversation as anybody can. [41:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, but providing that initial momentum </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah, unless I have something specific I want to talk to somebody about and then . . . like when I wanted to talk to Jesse. You know I could have, I could have planned. I didn't plan it because I plan things, and then I never say them anyway because I get all upset and uptight and everything, and I really can't, so I just, I just talk. I just open my mouth and words fall out. And like I said, I thought of all these things last night when I was . . . I do all my thinking in the shower and bed </p>

<p>And, I was thinking about like things I would have said. I almost got up and wrote him a letter. I might. I probably should have just got up and written him a letter and then thrown it away. It probably would have helped me, but I didn't do. Why am I going to write him a letter if I not going to send it to him. That's stupid. </p>

<p>And just letting him know exactly where I am, and how I feel. What I'm looking for in a relationship maybe it wouldn't scare him; maybe I'd get him back that way. I don't know. Like I say, if he was talking about things were getting too serious, and he didn't want to get serious. No. If he was talking about he didn't want to get serious, and he was getting serious, then nothing is going to help. If he thinks it's getting serious, and he doesn't want to get serious, he's going to stay clear of me. But if he thought I was getting serious, and he didn't want to drag it out or let me think that I was going somewhere that I wasn't going or anything, if he wanted to lead me on, I think that's the word, right? [42:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That completely, that you could fix</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I could settle the situation. Because I was serious about Jesse but not in a forever way type way. I liked him I liked to talk to him. I liked him physically. I liked to talk to him, but I never had the feeling that he'd be someone that I'd want to marry. But I just enjoyed his company, and I want to have some male company. It's about the art of conversation. It's about just the art of getting to know somebody. I've never really wanted to get to know somebody. And just having a relationship with someone, just a personal relationship, knowing their likes and dislikes, being able to talk to them, knowing who they really are or getting to know the person. And, I think it'd be an excellent opportunity. </p>

<p>Like I say, I'm also a very affectionate person. When I like somebody, I'm affectionate. And I do things for them; I go out of my way to do things for them like that. And I guess I'd really have to explain to him this. That I really wasn't, I don't how you say to a guy, I really don't want to marry you. I didn't have that idea in the first place, but I just wanted to get to know you. And I don't know if that'd work or not. He wasn't mad at me because I asked him all these things Saturday night. I said, I hope you're not upset. [44:24] </p>

<p>And he said, "No not at all."</p>

<p>But I said I just needed to know. </p>

<p>And he said, "Yeah, of course."</p>

<p>But I think the tip-off was the fact that he complimented me on my outfit that it was over. But I didn't know. I don't know. If I had not let Peter Maze sit down with me, if he would have sat with me. Because he looked at me, he gave me a funny look when he saw me sitting with Peter Maze when he got on the bus and sat down with Emily. But I thought he was getting ready to sit down with Emily anyway. He was just looking to see who I was with. </p>

<p>And then we were singing, he was singing right to me, he was singing, what was the song we were singing? It was kind of a love song, and he was just sitting there and somebody else suggested it. And the whole time he was playing, he was just staring right at me. He was just looking right into my eyes, like he was singing just to me, like nobody else in the world was there. And I'm not really fantasying he was doing that.[45:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. What does that mean? I don't think that was what he said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No well, he did this before we had the talk, but it didn't fit with his other actions. It didn't really fit with what he told me Saturday night. Why he was doing that, I don't know. There were other people to look at, he didn't have to sit and stare at me. There was about seven people standing there and sitting there singing, and he could have just looked around at all of them. He didn't have to stare at me because Alicia and Josie noticed it too. It wasn't just my imagination.</p>

<p>But then, I told you before it's frustrating because he just, you know </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really (phone rings) - Hello? Oh, hi. Can I call you back? - I don't know what to do about him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I think that's the main reason, that's one of the reasons I didn't worry about myself all weekend. I was too worried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too worried about Jesse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Too busy worrying about him. What's he doing now? Where is he? What's he doing? Tried to remain cool though, I think I did a pretty good job. I mean I was thinking about him all the time, and it might have been obvious a couple of times, but most of the time we're skiing and I'm just talking to him casually like I've just known him as a casual friend. Just knew who he was and we had talked and we were in the same club together so maybe waiting to go up the towrope or the ski lift and we'd be talking. Then he'd go on his way, and I'd go on my way, and everything was fine. [47:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Felt fairly successful at being cool.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I did. I really did. I was like downstairs watching the kids play Ping-Pong. I was just watching. I wasn't really worried about anything. I was just kind of, first of all, I was kind of dead, but I was kind of sitting there. But and there were other people around, and I was talking to them and having a fairly decent time. There wasn't anything wrong with it. I wouldn't call it fun, but I've never . . . </p>

<p>My mom said, "Well, did you have fun?" She's always said this to me a lot. "Did you have fun?" No, I really didn't have. I had a good time. I didn't have fun. And mom says, "Isn't that the same thing?" And to me, it's not. And I don't know what fun would be. I had fun when I was being silly. Alicia and I were being silly in playing Ping Pong. That was fun. I was getting, I was, I was tired, and I was getting kind of silly . . . I had a couple of drinks. I wasn't drunk or high or anything, but I was loose. And I was having a good time just being silly playing Ping Pong. And I was, I was doing a pretty good job, I suppose, of putting on a show for the people who were watching us play Ping- Pong. But we were having a good time, we really were. Now that was fun, and the rest of the time I just had, I had a good time talking to these people and everything. But, it was really rough being in a social situation with him. [48:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With Jesse?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Emily sat down in his lap and everything, and I'm sitting over there. I'm sitting over there and Adam and I are holding hands. So for all practical intents and purposes, nobody else would have been able to know, you know, sitting there holding hands with Adam. And Jesse was laughing and it just, I don't know what he was thinking. I don't know what Emily was thinking. I didn't know what Adam was thinking because how they approached the situation because Adam has been on all the ski trips too. And he knows that Jesse and I are usually together. I guess he just figures that I don't know. We didn't act like lovers who'd broken up or anything. We just acted like casual friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you're not quite sure too, what you think about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I 'd really like to know. I thought I was fairly cool about it, but I'd really like to know what all the other people were thinking about it, I really would. What was going through their minds? Especially Adam's. I'd also like to know what was going through Emily's mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like was she wondering if you were jealous or was she thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was wondering if she was uncomfortable at all or what? I was wondering if she was as uncomfortable as I was? Not just so I could have revenge. I was like kinda feeling sorry for her. I mean we're not two good friends or anything, but we do know each other, And . . . [50:14]</p>

<p>She didn't seem uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I'd seem that uncomfortable either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're having a meeting Wednesday night, and so, an officer's meeting</p>

<p>So I suppose I'll have a chance to practice not worrying about myself again. But I'll probably spend the whole evening worrying about Jesse. I wish I could just not worry about anything.</p>

<p>You know, just to hell with everything. That's what Alicia does sometimes </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Says to hell with everything? [55:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: She just kind of acts like it, to hell with everything. I'm just going to have a good time and not worry about anything else. She says I should do that, just not worry Well, all right not worry, how do you do that? Oh, I'm still tired from that ski trip. If I'd go to sleep when I go to bed, I might feel better. But when I go to bed, I stay awake for about an hour</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About things that I should do, things that I should . . . recapping the trip and all this stuff. I didn't even go bowling last night, I was in too much misery to go bowling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In too much misery?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Physical misery.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you stepped on the ski?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, I got a bad hip over here and a bad shoulder over here. I should, by all rights, I should be bruised all over, but I don't bruise. I mean it takes, it takes a real big wallop to bruise me. Most people like Alicia, you look at her, and you go like that, you tap her, she'll have a big bruise go like that You know she's got . . . [52:13] </p>

<p>I fell on my shoulder. I was skiing by myself Saturday, and I was doing, I was getting better. I was trying all these tricky things. I was getting really cocky, and I took a couple of really bad spills, and I twisted, like I said, I twisted my hip, I think, and my shoulder is real sore. And then that's just the two places it hurts the worse. The worst. I miss those (inaudible at 52:40).</p>

<p>But it's like my leg muscles are sore, not as sore as the last time though. Last time was when I really first skiing well, and I was like on the tips of my skis leaning forward and my leg muscles were really sore. I couldn't even walk I was getting cramps in my legs, and everything, and I never get cramps. [53:06]</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't know. I really think I ought to talk to Jesse again, but I don't know if it'd be redundant to go over the same thing again whether I should talk to him again or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanting to go back and get it straight now, just what was it that happened and just what did you feel and . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just so I'd know in my own mind. Just so I can, I know I think I'd, I'd probably talk to him and say you're going to get tired of hearing about this subject but I've got to straighten it out in my own mind. I said, like I might even ask him what it is that, what I did that turned him off. And just let's be friends and for my own future reference and future happiness could you help me. I just wonder if I could try it. It still seems I don't know if I should bring anything up or not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something makes you hesitate doesn't it? Is it appropriate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't want to be pushy about it. I don't want to make uncomfortable situations for him, but I would like to know. I still would like to know. I suppose I probably won't do it, but I think I shall though. I think I'll decide to hell with thinking about him and think about me. What do I want? He's doing a pretty good job of going about getting what he wants. I ought to do the same thing for me. [55:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just keep telling yourself that</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do a lot of that. I do a lot of worrying about other people instead of worrying about me. Maybe if I worried about myself more and well, I do worry about myself</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this is different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. What do I want? What's best for me instead of worrying about everyone else. You know, not worry so much about hurting other people's feelings. Don't be such a sweet kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you sort of determined about you going about getting what you want? [55:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, and because everybody else does it. That's why I got the label of being a nice, sweet kid. Always the first to give in or not in a situation and anything like that</p>

<p>I let myself get walked all over. My mother says, "Quit letting people walk allover you."</p>

<p>That might help if I'd became more assertive, more sure of myself</p>

<p>I'm going to make him tell me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to make him tell me but then, here I go excuses right? He may have nothing to tell. It's putting him in a bad situation (inaudible at 56:47) again. Again, I might just be, I might be putting him in a situation where he had to make a commitment, but I have a feeling it's a past commitment. It's over. It's like saying you're not committing yourself to me now. I just want to know how you did feel because it's over now. I know it is. Even if he doesn't know it, I know it.</p>

<p>I don't know. I'm getting a little bored with the whole thing of having to worrying about worrying about men and all this whole . . . I just want, maybe I, maybe if I get bored enough, I'll just forget it and I'll worry about how I'm coming across to men and everything else, and how I am with men in social situations and why I don't attract men. Things like this, I'm getting rather bored with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Come on, it's really not quite worth all this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but I just said forget men, don't worry about them, just forget them. Take time for something else. But I find myself unconsciously thinking about them. Even though I am bored with it, it just pops into my mind. Like this is really one of my priorities, and whether I want to worry about it or not, subconsciously I really worry about it. It's like, I do want to find somebody and get married and everything, and I am going to worried about it until it happens, and I really, and I'm going to end up the rest of my life worrying about it because I really have doubts whether I'll ever get married. I definitely think I will talk to Jesse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's 4:30.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I can't think very well (inaudible at 00:00:15).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, let's see... Although in terms of time... I guess, it would be helpful if we since we're starting a good fifteen minutes late, if we went about half that over and then added another half tomorrow is that (inaudible at 00:00:29).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be fine. I was actually going to suggest that (inaudible at 00:00:35)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like I said, I, I'm not, I'm just not thinking well today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... Like, I'm awake, which is good. I made it here sort of on time which is good. (PAUSE) [00:00:57]</p>

<p>All yesterday, I, it was like, I was, I was exhausted, couldn't sleep, my mind was like racing and I couldn't stop thinking and that was really bad. And now, I'm... (PAUSE) Sorry. (PAUSE) Yeah, I'm tempted to suggest we just skip today but I'm also, I feel like that would really leave me not doing well at all if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about that impulse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well thinking I just don't know if I can string a sentence together today at all. And, you know, you've got other stuff happening and so I'm just like, "Well would it make more sense to just say skip it?" [00:02:05]</p>

<p>But then I would feel really bad. Like I would, I would not feel guilty necessarily but I would, I, I would be very unhappy. (PAUSE) I hate drugs that cloud my mind. They, they like, it's like feeling like my mind clouded provokes panic but then they're... At least this one is kind of sedative also so it's not, it's like smushing it down but it's still...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...panicking. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like panicking and sedating you and causing you to panic but sedating you at the same time. [00:02:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Yes. But I don't know (inaudible at 00:03:07) But at the same time, I've literally taken one dose so part of me... I mean, I kind of want to say, "Well, see what it does in a couple, three days." Like, you know, in a couple of days. Yeah. (PAUSE) But the, you know, the alarm or the panic comes like the impulse to hurt myself and like that's no good. (PAUSE) I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm good for anything when I'm like this. I just (inaudible at 00:03:57). Both not being good for anything and thinking that I'm not good for anything. (LAUGHTER) I can't think very clearly. [00:04:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Is that what it feels like when you imagine here that you won't really be able to string a sentence together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah... (PAUSE) It at least comes from the same place. (PAUSE) Well it's still the same thing. You know. I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is that a problem here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess let me put it another way because that's really a leading question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) [00:04:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because the answer I have in mind is... (PAUSE) In, in a sense here that doesn't matter that I'm aware of. It may matter a lot in terms of how it makes you feel and that's very important. But (PAUSE) being able to be clear, articulate, coherent, not necessarily so important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you say that and I try to believe you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well tell me why you don't. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel kind of like a vegetable right now. It's like, "Well I can't, I can't figure things out as a vegetable." (LAUGHTER) Yes?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just keeps coming back to that. How do I figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it about safety and control?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I really don't want it to be but it is. (PAUSE) But it's not... I guess what I'm afraid of isn't that I will say something that I don't want to share with you or that I don't want to come out. [00:07:00]</p>

<p>I'm afraid of I'll say something that's not true and then that thing that's not actually true, you will take or we'll both take as like the basis for other things. Which I know you said before that like to say something that is, that that's not actually how this works but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what it feels like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. Also this is hard work and I don't want to work very hard right now. I'm already working really hard to kind of keep my eyes focused and opened. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:07:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't you close, sit back and close your eyes (inaudible at 00:08:05) come to mind and be quiet (inaudible at 00:08:11).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could. (PAUSE) That seems really hard.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That (PAUSE) that, just that... It's harder to let go of the impulse to keep myself together than it is to keep myself together. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I sense for you to even suggest that and for me to then do it, that would be like, that's another example of me telling myself to be a certain way and then trying to live that out as opposed to just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (inaudible) more genuinely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's important.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:10:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate to... (PAUSE) I really don't want to be where I am. (PAUSE) [00:11:00]</p>

<p>I worry that I may not ever be able to work again. That I won't be able to support myself. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:12:29) If James hadn't, hasn't been cooking for me for the last 24 hours, I wouldn't have eaten anything. It's just a combination of not being hungry and not wanting enough. (PAUSE) And I, I really don't like being helpless in that way. (PAUSE) [00:13:00]</p>

<p>I think one of the reasons that I have been reluctant to be like, "Let's talk about my childhood," is that... Well two reasons. The first is that I've got, as you may have noticed, a chip on my shoulder. (LAUGHTER) There has just been a lot of instances where people have kind of said, "Well, you know, let's look at the things that happened in your past that and how they might have affected your present at moments when I was in crisis. And so it's like, "Dude. What I need is a tourniquet. I can't give you a medical history when I'm bleeding out." (LAUGHTER) That's just not going to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not going to work. Yeah. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (PAUSE) the other thing I think is that like, you know, there are a certain number of kind of obvious conclusions that I have come to and kind of been like, "Well. I guess I got that figured out." I've been like, "There's a shock." I don't like feeling helpless because when I was a kid, I couldn't guarantee that somebody would make food for me if I couldn't make it myself. Wonder where that comes from? (LAUGHTER) And so I'm... (PAUSE) [00:14:51]</p>

<p>It's kind of like I have, I have a story of how the past relates to the present that is probably more or less accurate insofar as it goes. Maybe not. But I've kind of wanted to make that story work instead of building a new story, you know? (PAUSE) Like, "Oh. There's a shock. I don't tend to trust older women very easily." (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Well, you describe it, the connections as being being also really trite. [00:16:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They do feel trite, yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And useless. (PAUSE) (inaudible) knowing that you have the ability of trusting (inaudible) your mother's untrustworthiness. Like, sounds like (inaudible) [00:16:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see the use other than saying, "Okay well I know this. I'll watch out for it."</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:17:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well... (PAUSE) I mean in a way, it's not really the past that matters. (PAUSE) And... (PAUSE) I mean, in fact, while I'm sure some of it's quite (inaudible) some of the ways that you're putting together the past are, in a way (inaudible) symptomatic of the way you put together things in the present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That seems useful. (LAUGHTER) [00:19:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of disparate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean knowing that seems useful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like, okay, like... (PAUSE) Looking at sort of how in pieces and how creative conflict you sort of keep the stories you tell, you were telling yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:19:35)</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you would say something, you would describe something as being bad or either pretty awful and then like talk about it from a very different point of view or quickly put a better face on it or talk about how it was actually really okay. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that to be heavy handed about it, was like sort of tearing what sort of happened into bits and putting it away instead of really digesting what you went through.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, how great in some ways and really very difficult in other ways (inaudible) [00:21:03) mother (inaudible) could be or like... [00:21:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like how awful the experience with your grandfather (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't tell anybody that story for like ten years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I didn't talk about it until like, I until after I had gotten to the point where I, I said, "Okay. I'm not that person anymore."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or your sort of terror at your therapist finding out you were depressed. Like, that's a lot of things but one of them...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) [00:21:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...is terribly sad. It is. I mean, not having anybody you could share anything with. You're scared your fucking therapist is going to find out how bad things really are which probably, in a way, (inaudible) but whatever like who cares? Somebody whose only job was there, was to be there and listen to you. (PAUSE) And like, you know, maybe there are ways they could have noticed or been helpful. Anyway, I'm not trying to say they didn't have some responsibility but like, you weren't in a position to really, as I've been hearing it, make much use of it at all which (PAUSE) is terrible. I mean, given... It says something about the other things you were going through but it also, it's also really unfortunate given the things you were going through. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And another thing I really remember about talking, talking with that with her was a kind of early days when she said, "What do you want?" And I said, "I want to be with my mother." And that just didn't. I mean, it couldn't have happened because like my mom wasn't in a position for us to be with her. But... (PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p>

<p>Yeah. I mean, the easy connection in my mind is, you know, I didn't trust her. Because, I mean, what good is she if she asks me what I want and I say, "I want this," and nothing happens. (PAUSE) Yeah I just really missed my mom for a really long time. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You just said, "Oh?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had no idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. (PAUSE) That was like ground I walked on for years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I just took it as a given.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't recall your saying anything about a feeling, thought, or interaction with your mother when you were a kid.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. (PAUSE) [00:26:00]</p>

<p>That's probably important. Yeah, I, I wanted to live with her and I kind of said that over and over again until I was about, you know, twelve or thirteen. I really, really missed her and I thought she was the most wonderful person in the world and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually maybe you said something general like that about having thought she was really wonderful...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and only later kind of seeing her differently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know, because I was and I was living with my dad and things weren't very good and everything kind of shifted around when I was, over time when I was in high school. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>And, you know, it was like the older I got, the younger she got. You know, when we were in high school and (PAUSE) men would hit on her while I was there and be like, "You guys look like sisters." And she'd be like, "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" And I was like, "That is A, really creepy and B, not what I want you to do around me." Like... (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she just loved that. Like that was what she wanted. She didn't want to be my mother. She wanted to be my sibling. And like, "Well, I have a sister. (PAUSE) I don't have a mother. I can't help you there." (PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean... (LAUGHTER) ...so striking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "Look lady, I've already got a sister and I've already got a mother so I can't help you with your wanting to be my sister instead of my mother." Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just so turned around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The problem here is you're unable to help your mother be more like your sister.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because what you really need is a mother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was also, I mean, I was terrified that she would kill herself when I was little. Like when I was... You know, I think she told us when I was like nine or ten that she had tried to kill herself like the night that she left my dad. So like I knew that was a possibility. You know, I, I, I thought I had to take... [00:29:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Sorry, somehow I thought I just told you these things already. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I mean...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also, it feels to me (PAUSE) clearly with your other therapist but a bit with this sort of this my profession in general, you set yourself a bit of opposed to us in the like, we want to know your history and we think that's important and relevant but you don't see why and not helpful in the right way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you're just on the unfortunate, in the unfortunate position of catching me as like the fifteenth therapist...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to whom I've had to tell my life story. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:29:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There gets to be a, a kind of condensed narrative that I just say, "This is what I have because..." You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...practice your lines enough times...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... they pretty much just come out pat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess part of where I'm going is I don't especially have a, an agenda. I mean, I certainly haven't asked really but I've probably asked...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...some general questions to get up to speed about certain things. But I haven't, that I'm aware, made a point of asking...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for this stuff about what does or doesn't emerge and when how is this important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And yeah. And it's one of those things that... Like at this point...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...even though I haven't talked about it, I've kind of just assumed that you knew.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Which is interesting. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, there was that. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she was saying she made an attempt after leaving your dad. She told you that when you were about nine or ten.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. As best I remember, she was telling us about like, like the night that resulted in her leaving my dad. Like all I remember is, is like waking up one morning and coming down into the kitchen and there were these ladies from church that I didn't know very well in the kitchen and my mother was gone. And eventually, like, I was told that she was in the hospital. And like I don't remember when I saw her next but it wasn't for a while, I think. You know, I imagined it was when, after she got out of the hospital. Maybe I visited. I only visited her in the hospital like once or twice. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She had not been hospitalized before that during your lifetime?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh she had been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was hospitalized, she had been hospitalized at least a couple of times before them. But I was too young to kind of realize what that meant. So like one of my very earliest memories was being at the beach and my mom, with my dad and my mom was in the hospital. I just knew mom was in the hospital and that's all like it didn't mean anything. (PAUSE) But (PAUSE) you know, we visited her, she had us every other weekend and that's not very much. So... (PAUSE) [00:33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did she have any suicide attempts that you knew of (inaudible at 00:33:09).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would, she would just drop off the map for long periods of time or what felt like long periods of time. There was one time that I was at camp and she was really good about like, she would always send me a care package when I was camp which was really nice. And there was one year that I just didn't hear from her at all. And I like wrote to my dad and was like, "Where is mom?" and he didn't answer. And finally I like flipped out, you know, hysterical, crying, like... (LAUGHTER) In retrospect, these, you know, 20 year old counselors were like, "What the fuck do we do with this fifth grader...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...who's losing it?" And I found out that like she was in the hospital but she had told my dad that he couldn't tell me that she was in the hospital. She never wanted anybody to know that she was sick. So she would just, so she would just be gone and I didn't know why. And... (PAUSE) You know, so it was like I never knew. Like I still feel like I have to be very careful what I say to her because if I say the wrong thing, she'll kill herself. (PAUSE) I was going to make that, say that less. I don't necessarily think she'll actually kill herself but yeah I think I need to change that. But yeah, I, yeah, I, I missed her and I felt like it was my responsibility to take care of her. Yeah. And then she started smoking and I liked freaked out. She started smoking when I was like eight. Like, right after she got divorced. [00:35:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was really upset because like, that's the one thing that they tell kids is like smoking will kill you. (LAUGHTER) And I couldn't make her stop doing it and like I hated that. You know? (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You worried that you would like lose her forever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I thought it would kill her. Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:36:00]</p>

<p>The only times that she got upset with me for any reason whatsoever were when I pushed too hard on it. You know, she'd like... (PAUSE) She didn't really do like, like telling us no at all really, at least for me. Not much with Amanda (ph) either. But I was... (PAUSE) I always, I always was really careful not to ask for things and Amanda just asked for what she wanted which I, I, I think is more two halves of the same coin than anything else but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We'll stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah sure.</p>

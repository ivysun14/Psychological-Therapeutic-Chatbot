<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's too much blank space on that thing.  Um, all right, well, thank you for your flexibility. I know we had to change your appointment right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, not a problem. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Something. I have no idea what.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You were out of town or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, it was Thursday morning, my, uh, um, it was a while ago, right, a couple weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was, at one point my, uh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually it was the [DATE] I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of March?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe that was it. I think, I think it's, my father went from hospital to rehab and so I had to go Wednesday night up there.  I think that's what it was.  Was it Thursday morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that must have been what it was.  He's getting out Saturday.  Turns out it was like, uh, had like, uh, toxic level of one of his medicines and it wasn't -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A stroke. I thought it might have been. But he still couldn't walk regularly after and just some general weakness so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is what I need to speak to you about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> General weakness?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I was here last time I mentioned to you the shaking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said it was like, uh, -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's your primary -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Parkinsonian tremors.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He said and I'm thinking it's from the Abilify.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It might be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I also have sore muscles.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are they tight?  Let me, um, you can sit there, let me just get your arm loose. Both sides?  I mean everything is sore or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, mostly at night I wake up, you know, from the shoulder down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum. Um, uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's embarrassing at work because I write a lot in front of people. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we've gotta do something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now I'm trying to figure out what did he say the soreness was at all, did you tell him about the soreness as well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did he think that was related?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he didn't say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Could that, you know, I mean sometimes you get like some, like dystonia muscles, you know, it's kinda, well it's sorta like you get tightness pockets.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's down here so it's more like, uh, tennis elbow type of, you know, which -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He told me to go out and get an arm band.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's more on the one side or both sides?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's more on my right side than on the left.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That, all right, are you doing something different at work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.  That's very good.  When did you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A week ago.  Actually on the ninth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Same type of, uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, same [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, yeah, hopefully it's starting to pick up a little.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean it's, it's been, I don't know, I think it's been worse and I'm hearing in some areas it's picking up and where is it here, around here or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Up in [DEIDENTIFIED] actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], oh, okay.  New developments?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They've been there for about four years. They didn't have one sale last year so it's a little bit daunting for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, they sell em and then build?  Is that how it is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're built?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, well they have three spec houses that I can sell right away, but they'll build to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  Less expensive there than, uh, here?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not that much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not that much. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  It's still [DEIDENTIFIED] county. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's on the [DEIDENTIFIED] border, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How far is [DEIDENTIFIED] from [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Is it far?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eight miles.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Due west.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when you increased my Abilify up to 15 mg. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  That's when it, um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Showed even more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you were having it before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm also wondering if I might be over medicated because I'm tired all the time.  I had a complete blood work done with an endocrinologist.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he said I had a severe vitamin D deficiency, so he put me on 40,000 units of vitamin D once a week, for four months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it a pill or shot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  Severe vitamin D deficiency, why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good question.  But I would imagine somebody would, uh, and you know I have blood work done every three months, you know for my diabetes and he orders his own blood tests and I guess because he's an endocrinologist his tests are a little different than a G P's would be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, well, yeah, uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So somebody might go to him and think that they have Chronic Fatigue -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Syndrome or something like that, you know, so he would naturally order a vitamin D evaluation. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I guess, yeah, I mean that makes sense, they probably have a whole list of the most common things that works on them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah on that scale.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right so with the vitamin D you're still just as fatigued?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many shots have you gotten?  I mean pills?  Or shots?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He said I'd feel the difference in three weeks and I haven't felt any difference at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Been three weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's been six weeks now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Geez.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He gave me a four month supply, you know sixteen, sixteen pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just wondering if it is a combination of all the medications?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well it might be now let's look at this.  The Remeron, I mean if I just looked at this, wait a second, okay so when are you taking, you're taking the Cymbalta in the morning right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 60 mg one in the morning and the Abilify is 50 mg in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Remeron is 45 mg. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At bedtime.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At night and Xanax we're not using still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not using and Melatonin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Using that.  Are you, all right, so are you having trouble falling asleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  Okay.  And you stay asleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what's your live-in companion status?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean back together?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About three months now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any, um, of those things that have you very upset, any of those periods?  No?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 'Cause I know we talked about that at the end of last time?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I had some unusual suggestions, but just, um, you know, just try to not to like think of the worst scenario, but just to sort of anticipate what possibly might not go like you wanted it to go, because somehow it's, I think the feeling of getting kinda blindsided and overwhelmed by something completely unexpected and, and the reaction to that, you know, whereas if you somewhere at least had in your mind well she might say, you know, she's, um, gonna have her family coming for a week and wants you to move out.  I'm making this up.  Something that, you know, if it's something, you know, you're thinking like her family's coming, I wonder if she's, you know, whatever, if you sort of anticipated it you still get upset if she asks you, but at least you wouldn't be completely blindsided.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean that's the, you know, and you wouldn't end up in this free fall.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] said it's possible that I'm going through, or I could go through post traumatic stress because of where I'd been.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Well, I mean, it is you know some of the symptoms, being overly sensitive, hyper, I don't know if you're hypervigilant, but sometimes an increased startle reaction, but like a devastating reaction to some things that seem to be greatly out of proportion to what, the person doing it was intending.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I haven't done that for quite a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Obviously people can say you're overreacting, well you're not overreacting, they think you're overreacting, the problem is some little thing did something to you to cause you to feel like it was the worst thing that ever happened, you know, and I sometimes will tell people, well if somebody, you know, says whatever, does something, one of these little things, most people would be like, you know, she's crazy, all right, whatever, we'll deal with it in a week, but it's like somebody, it would be like the feeling like someone like tied me up and made me watch them chop up my family with an axe into little pieces. I mean it was some, like, you know, that's what it feels like. So that's what you're reacting to not actually what someone sees, you know, what I'm saying, someone sees this and says what the hell is this, it's the little things.  It doesn't even, you know, that's not what you're reacting to.  You're reacting to how it makes you feel.  What it represents in you for whatever reason, anyway.  All right, that seems to be going either going particularly well or there haven't been any situations to test you, but I can't imagine, you know, if you just started working, you know, I mean you must have been pretty anxious for part of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, so you're doing well.  All right, the tremors and the sedation are the two biggest things today.  All right.  So, tremors, sedation, are you more awake at six or seven in the evening than you are at ten in the morning?  Or are you always tired?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm more awake in the evening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it hard to get up in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  Are you more fatigued an hour or two after you get up than you are when you first get up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, the answer to that would be yes and probably one of the reasons is I don't start work till eleven you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm up at six thirty or six forty five.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the rea-, so but if that's the case than that sorta tells us it's not the Remeron or the Melatonin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you'd be tired when you first got up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So is it the Cymbalta or the Abilify?  My guess is it's been more since you're on the Abilify than it was before, although before you were pretty distraught, so I don't know, um, all right, well anyway -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know when I was in the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Back in October.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The tremors were so bad I called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I said they are really bad and he said - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really, you were in in October, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What were you on then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was on, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Geodon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No that stuff, that black box, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Serzone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, Serzone and he said cut it in half and it worked.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It worked?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, so of course I'm off that now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Interesting.  Yeah, but that -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nefazodone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, yeah actually you're right 'cause they stopped, the company that made the brand stopped making it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's not Serzone anymore it's just the generic Nefazodone you're right, but that's interesting.  So it may not be the Abilify, it may be the Cymbalta, but when did you, how, you ended up -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been on the Cymbalta since December, November/December.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you weren't having the tremors this bad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and you weren't sedated, but you were also, I mean you couldn't be sedated 'cause you were, you're mind was like, you know, I mean it wouldn't leave you alone, so  - well we could do a couple things.  Um, all right, really bad in October, who put you on Nefazodone, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Had you been on a bunch of meds before that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was taking something else with Nefazodone. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Seroquel, Zyprexa, uh, Risperdal, Olanzapine, [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, they took me off of it because of the sexual side effects.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Prozac -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Zoloft, Paxil, uh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been so long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Luvox, Fluvoxamine, um, Lexapro, Celexa, all right.  I mean those are, uh, maybe it's in here.  Well, you were on the Nefazodone a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Six years. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all right.  Okay let's do - are you not having sexual side effects with the Cymbalta?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, because of my testosterone level?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  Is it low?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, yeah that's gotta be analyzed the next time I see the endocrinologist.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right, um, well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've gotten a low score on my testosterone for the past, uh, four years. The last time they did blood work, eight days later he got all the results back except the testosterone, so his office calls over for the testosterone level and they come back with a score over 400 and I said, I said to them point blank, I said that's impossible because nothing has changed, I don't feel any different, I think they invented the number because I'm, I'm normally around 100.  And I use testosterone cream, you know, I have it compounded.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Oh where?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At [DEIDENTIFIED] pharmacy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] pharmacy?  That's a good place.  Um, all right, so I would like to do two things to the same medicine.  I'd like to have you try to switch the Abilify to the evening.  Also, do you notice if the tremors are worse in the day versus the night or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's about the same.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you wake up in the morning before you take your meds it's still the same?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, um, all right so what's your blood pressure in the mornings?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, forget it, it's really low.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm like 120/70.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean not lower than normal, it's normal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's always on the low side.  120/70.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I mean cause there's things that we, I could think about for like Inderal that might help with the, you know, the tremors possibly, that may lower your blood pressure, but it may not, generally it lowers your pulse more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That would be dangerous. I've even gotten up, twice in the past six months I've gotten up at night to go to the bathroom and passed out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I'm not doing that then.  All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I keep a blood pressure monitor in the bathroom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's from getting up too quick, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Now, you know, you do like this with your feet, tighten, anybody ever tell you that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you get up and you have to go to the bathroom, do this, like with your legs and your calves, tighten them, sit up on the side of the bed, keep doing it a couple five/six more times, then stand up.  That sometimes will keep, get the valves and the veins to close 'cause if they don't close fast enough, the blood goes whooooooosh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whoooooosh, which may be what was happening, so, all right, um, okay so, all right, so let's say, um, here I'll write it on here, let's okay, all right, Abilify 15 mg.  Thanks.  Let's do, uh - you already took it today, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay so on [DATE] here's the morning and the night, um, 10 mg, 5 mg and [DATE] 10 mg, 5 mg on [DATE] 5 mg, 10 mg -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What if I did 7.5 and 7.5?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but the reason I say that is because the pills are 15s.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I know, I know they're 15s.  How many do you have left, a lot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, all right, so then we'll do, um, 5 mg, 10 mg.  All right, I mean you can use some, but what I want to do is transition you over to, to 3, um, 4,5,6,7, 4 out of 5, I don't know what I'm doing.  I'll give you some samples. What I want you to do like tomorrow 10 in the morning 5 at night for two days, then 7.5 and 7.5 for a week, and then 5 and 10 one day, and then 2.5 and 10 for two days, and then just 10 at night. Okay, I'll make a copy of that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is that at bedtime along with the Remeron?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and then we'll see what's going on in a couple weeks and I'll give you, I don't know do you need anything today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You need another, you probably need, um, I'll give you Abilify 10, I'll give you some samples, but everything else you have, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you met my grandson, [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I did.  I did.  I actually talked to your daughter [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's going on with your [DEIDENTIFIED] this year?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, my God.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did they win last night?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No. The Nationals won in the thirteenth. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh geez, I knew the score was tied at four-four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They had pitchers, they had pitchers pinch hitting.  All right, so four weeks, let's see.</p>

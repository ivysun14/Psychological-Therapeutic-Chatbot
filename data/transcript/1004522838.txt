<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess there was this incident at the house which is kind of gross. I'm sorry if it grosses you it out, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I have a high tolerance for gross things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) So the way that my house is set up basically, the two car...there's the driveways...there's a driveway. And so when we take out the trash, we take it out through the kitchen. And so I left it out the night before, it was my week to take it out. And so I wanted to do it in the morning. And I was like, "Oh, that'll make me wake up, that I can get my day started or whatever." So I was taking it out in the morning. And I didn't see anything, but I definitely felt something really heavy jump from the trash can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh. [00:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (chuckles) And so I'm like - and...and put -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was freaking out. This was in the kitchen. And so I didn't - I was like, "Ahh," didn't know what to do. Because I didn't know what to do. And so I ran upstairs and cried in my room for 30 minutes. And was like, I don't - it was like seven in the morning, so no one was awake. And so I guess - so I was like, "Okay, well, I've never asked anyone for extreme help." So I texted people to see if they were awake and they weren't. And then I called someone who wakes up usually way earlier than me, and he didn't pick up.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to knock on Phil's door, and I did. And I was so really tearful and stuff. And so I knocked on his door, and he opened the door. And I said, "There's a rat in the kitchen, I don't know what to do." And so...And he basically - he was so rude to me. He said something like, "I don't know what you want me to do. I'm going to go pee, and then I'm going to go back to sleep. And you have to deal with this or something." And then - so he did. And then I guess before he went to the bathroom, he took...he put...because it was just inside; it wasn't all the way inside. And so he put it out and closed the door. And he's like, "Take out the fucking trash." And I was like, "Oh, okay. That's really rude."</p>

<p>And so I guess at the time I was just more upset than anything because I was like, "I don't know what to do." I had to leave, I had a dentist appointment. But then when I drove to the dentist and then maybe on the way back and during all of this, I had been - I started getting really angry, fuming angry. Like those times that I explode at someone and get really angry. Because I started sort of I guess thinking about it. And I thought about it. And I was like, "Well, I've never woken him up for anything ever. I never ask him for help with anything." I don't - I'm not a terrible person to live with. And so the one time that I ask him to do something or help for something - [02:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you're afraid to ask. And it's not just your problem, this is a house issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's animals in the trash.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like a little bit of an idiot for letting a rat into the kitchen. I was like, "I'm sorry for doing that." But at the same time -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the way that everybody - it's for routine for hiding trash (inaudible at 03:09).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think that what also really bothered me was that Tim, the guy that wakes up really early, apparently when I came downstairs they started talking about how ridiculous it was that I had called them. And how he would have said the same thing if I had knocked on his door. And so I was like - I was even more...I was even angrier. And so I guess I don't really know how to handle it. He was - Phil was away for the whole weekend pretty much after...right after this happened, and he just came home last night. And he stopped in my room to say hi or something and pretended like everything was fine. And I was just so angry at him that I was...couldn't make conversation. And he was just like, "Goodnight." (chuckles) And I don't know - I think that I'm not completely making up the reason that I should be angry, but I don't know that I should be this angry. I don't know. And - I don't know. I thought about talking with...talking it out with him, but I think that I'm too angry to do that. [04:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know you're angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, yeah, I think he knows. Yeah, I think that it's still to the point where we could pretend that I'm not, but I think he definitely knows. And I even told Tim...because at least Tim told me what he thought that I was being ridiculous to my face. So I was like, "Okay, well, I'm angry at you." And so that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you - and you were able to say that to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can you express why you're angry? What do you - what is it that you're really angry about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that - it's the prime example of what I don't like about Phil. Is that for other people...if I'm hanging out with other people, I don't feel the need to disclaim everything that I say. And be like, "Well, no offense," or, "I mean, this thing, not that." Or sort - I feel like I have to tiptoe around him and walk on eggshells or something. And with other people, they just know what I mean sort of. And it's almost like I have to be really delicate with him.</p>

<p>And so the one time that I actually, I guess, intrude because, I mean, that sucks that everyone was up at seven in the morning. Or make something inconvenient for him, then he explodes. And I don't think that that's fair because he makes things inconvenient for us sometimes. And - I don't know. I think that, "Yeah, that sucks, but that's part of living with four other people."</p>

<p>So I think it was just his rudeness. And I think it just was sort of like the last straw. Where I was just like, "I...I don't want to just be around you anymore." I don't - and I was like, "I don't feel invested in preserving a friendship or anything like that anymore." I don't know if that's part of my whole, "Everything ends thing," or - so - [05:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not...so it's not - there's choosing to not want - there's the immediate issue of...it sounds like you felt really disappointed that he didn't kind of step up at this time of crisis. I mean, you were feeling...you were freaked out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want - you needed and wanted help right then and he didn't step out. So it sounds like you're feeling pretty disappointed about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. \</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And at the same time it sounds like there's a history of feeling a little bit resentful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel like you have to work so hard in your relationship to make things smooth for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [06:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that that's certainly wasn't reciprocated this time, but it sounds like you're also kind of angry in retrospect for all those -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - other times that you worked harder than he did at making the relationship, the friendship work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and - yeah. And I think - it's hard to describe what it is I guess. But part of it is he's the one that sends out the most angry e-mails to the house, being like, "Oh, this is bothering me." He's really fussy. And sort of hard to - he's high maintenance and none of us are. And so I guess it's fine if one person is like that. But I don't know. This was just a time - I don't know. I just - I thought that it was really - whatever. [07:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you chose his door to knock on versus someone else's?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's downstairs. And going up the stairs is the loudest thing in the world. So I didn't want to wake the rest of the house up. So I was like, "Fuck it." I didn't expect him to react that way at all actually. I didn't - I was really surprised. I think that was my initial reaction was, like "Really, wow, that's interesting. I didn't expect that at all." But anyway, I don't know if like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you imagine would happen if you went to him and say, "I was really surprised by your reaction. And was really disappointed that you couldn't kind of rise to the occasion and help me out when I was so shocked by the rat jumping out of the trash."? What would happen if you went to him with what...what just occurred, and your immediate reaction to the...this very thing? [08:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean at the time or now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you went back home and said, "Hey, this is what - this is why I'm feeling upset." Because he gets it, it sounds like he knows that you're feeling upset from how you responded -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: â€”last night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that - I guess I have expectations of what he would say. So I think that given his conversation with Tim after I left about how ridiculous it was that I reacted in this way and that 25-years-old, should be able to deal with a rat or something. But he would just sort of say, "Well, I thought it was ridiculous. And I was really annoyed that...that you chose to wake me up at seven in the morning. And I was sleeping or something." And I don't...I don't really want that to happen. I feel like that would be worse to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To say something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - say I guess how I feel. And have it be - well, now I think it would be worse than to not say it at all. I don't know if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. What would make that worse? [09:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would just make me feel really sort of exposed. Like, "Oh, this is how I was feeling." And I told him and that still didn't - I don't know. Does that make any sense? I feel like it would be really almost like embarrassing or - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like feeling of embarrassed would feel worse than feeling angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah. I mean - and these are probably irrational things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay to be irrational. Sometimes our emotions are not rational, but they are there so we have - we can't pretend they're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I just - I don't often have good outcomes. Even like the thing with the music, that wasn't a really a great response either. And that was a third of how horrible this was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, this feels much more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because you're feeling the same way about each other. If he thinks it's ridiculous that you woke him up at seven to deal with the rat, do you think it's kind of ridiculous that he couldn't deal with the rat with you for 10 minutes at seven o'clock and then go back to bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like really what you were looking for was someone to come into the kitchen with you probably and negotiate the rat in the trash. And say -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - kind of emphasize that, "Yep, that's surprising and gross." And would freak him out too, and then go back to bed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound about how you would have felt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I wasn't...I wasn't asking him, "Oh, go take care of the rat." I did say like, "Help me sort of thing." But, yeah, I mean, I guess maybe that's part that three of us are Leo's in the house. So maybe that's it. (laughter.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would help me because my horoscope (inaudible at 10:50).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Leo's are really narcissistic, that's the main thing so. (chuckles) Phil and I are two of the three Leo's in the house. But anyway, I don't know. I guess I...I was thinking about it. And I was really disappointed because I feel like that's the first thing that's actually been really important, really, really important to talk about, but I still can't do it. It's still really like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard - I think it's harder to talk about the stuff that feels more important like the less important stuff is less interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's exactly what you're responding to. It feels you'd be really vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the risk piece. And you're worried about feeling embarrassed sort of and then to open -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that to him. [11:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't...I don't exactly know why, but, yeah, I guess - I think the opening and sharing and stuff is not (inaudible at 11:49). But anyway, I guess that was...that was that one thing that happened. And I...I mean, I don't really know what to do.</p>

<p>To be honest, I started thinking about moving out. I'm like, "I don't want to live with Tim anymore, and Phil is moving out in June." And so I started thinking, considering not deciding or anything, but considering all these options. And was like, "Well, maybe I shouldn't be living with four other people." Which I mean, I really like living there. So I don't know. But it's almost like I would rather move out then to have to have this conversation with him. So is that wrong? [12:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not wrong. Are there other reasons for moving out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. I mean, Phil is moving out, so that's going to end soon. He's moving out in June. But I don't know. I mean, I think it's difficult...Tim had that reaction is not surprising at all. Because he's very much like - he doesn't understand feelings. And he's like, "Well, I don't understand what you would be offended about anything." And I'm like, "Well, that's offensive." (chuckles) And I know that he's 20, so I guess maybe that's part of it, but I don't know. It's a little bit difficult living with someone that's so engendering. But I don't know. [13:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things that that you find offensive about him on a regular basis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, that he feels - that you feel offended by him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think - at least he's honest. Maybe I might not like what he's saying, but he's really honest about it. And he wouldn't like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you see is what you get?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. And he won't...I think what I'm scared of with Phil a lot of the times, the reason I don't feel comfortable telling him anything too personal is because he always talks about other people to me. And talks crap about them or whatever. And I...I hate people who do that. And I - there's no reason for me to believe that he's not going to do the same thing -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - about me. And so I have to sort of say - and the thing is he's really perceptive. And so he guesses things too. And it's really, "Get out of my face sort of thing." Anyway, I guess that was one thing, but I don't know what I'm going to do with, but - would it be awkward if I just stopped being his friend? I mean, that's sort of just what I want to do. But is that a rational reaction sort of what I've been thinking about, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, are there good reasons to maintain his friendship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We live together (inaudible at 14:26) and have that sort of friendship in the house. But it's only three months of it. So - I don't know. Anyway, I guess I (inaudible at 14:37).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems a little rash. You talk...you talk about kind of jumping from one end to the extreme to the other -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and it seems to me like ending the friendship is a pretty - it's hard to go back -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and redevelop a friendship later if you want to. It's a pretty extreme action. It doesn't mean that your only other option is to have a big, open conversation about this particular thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [15:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think there may be steps in-between those two things. It's not either or. And I wonder if you could think about what might be some of those other options? What's plan B and see -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - before you feel like you have to give up the friendship or give up the house or be this open and exposed. There's got to be some other stuff we can come up with for you to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I don't know what that would be - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what about...what about talking to him about levels of stuff? You might not want to say - I mean, one of my things is my first inclination would be like, "Well, let's express our disappointment in him." (laughter) [15:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that feels - and I...and your gut reaction is like, "Whoa, that feels way too wrong way, too exposed, no way."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something - can you talk to him about a little piece of it or talk to him about something -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe...maybe next time he sends out an angry e-mail or something, I could say that I didn't...I don't like that he sends out so many of them or something. I know that that's sort of treating me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, is treating them wrong more - because there's two pieces going on and it's sort of long standing built-up resentment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then there's the rat anger. And it sounds like you don't really want to address the rat anger. But, yeah, maybe you could do something to start addressing some of the more built-up resentment. And I wonder if that would change your feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [16:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean, you get another one of these angry e-mails, it is appropriate to say like, "Ahh, sounds like there's a lot of these."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that's what it feels like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's...that's addressing something going on that does impact your relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't have to be all or nothing. You don't have to expose every feeling and every thought or none of them. But you can pick and choose about what you're ready and what feels safe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially with him where it sounds like you don't always feel comfortable if he's being honest with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a...that's a flag that he's maybe not - you don't feel completely trust...you know that he's completely trustworthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So therefore, it's not safe to disclose everything that you don't feel safe disclosing. It's safe to give him things that you wouldn't mind -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people knowing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - if it...if he shared?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's important to kind of tell people what to the degree that you trust them. You tell things, you kind of design what you share with them. [17:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's all really new. I've been thinking - yeah, okay. I - yeah. But I guess I just have trouble - and it...because of the way that we had a conversation last night and it was so awkward. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I don't think that's something that you really want to (inaudible at18:07)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Live with? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made it so awkward?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he only comes to my...to my door and knocks and sort of talks to me from the doorframe or whatever. And we have a conversation, catch up, how's your day sort of thing. But I think it's a little bit weird. When I'm in my room, it's probably because I don't want people coming in. And I actually made that clear in the beginning. When we all moved in together, I said, "Well, why don't we all share our biggest pet peeves? And so that we can keep that in mind for (inaudible at 18:44) of the year or something." And I said, "I don't like it when people sort of come into my space, into my room and stuff because that makes me really uncomfortable."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that why he's standing at the door way because he's not coming in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, no. I invite him in and stuff, and sometimes he like walks around my room or whatever, then leaves. Which is fine, it's not like - I invite him in, so that's okay. But I feel like I have to invite him in or - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not really okay? [19:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's something you feel forced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not forced, but maybe that's the nice thing to do would be to - I don't want to be rude either. But I don't know. It's just - maybe that's one of the things that because when he walks by, I'm like, "Oh, is he going to knock on my door?" Because my room is literally in the middle of - I mean, if anyone wants to go anywhere, they have to pass in front of my room so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever said when he knocks on your door, "Hey, I'm in the middle of something, can I catch up with you later?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I didn't think about that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I think it is a possible response though -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I don't know if you would feel comfortable saying it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think I could because I don't think he would take it the wrong way. Yeah, I don't think that he'd be offended or anything. He'd be like, "Okay, talk to ya later." But - [20:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's stopped you from doing that in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm generally not in the middle of things that are - (laughter). I'm usually petting the cat or something. But I don't know. I guess that's just part of my - I...I don't know. I want to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that is - maybe petting the cat is in the middle of something. I mean, if you're...if you're wanting to be alone or wanting to spend -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - time with your cat, that's what you were doing right then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think part...it sounds like part of the resentment is that you feel like you don't really have a choice. When he knocks, you feel like you have to invite him, so you're not moving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like you're backed into the conversation and looking for ways to give you power in the relationship and not in an antagonistic way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (sneezes).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. But just in the power in terms of...you don't feel forced into your choices, that you actually do have choices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 21:10).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when he says that he wants to talk, you have a choice of talking then or talking later regardless of what you're doing. It's your choice to talk later isn't because...isn't only based on if something that feels really, really important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you're not in the mood to talk right then or have that conversation right then -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that's your choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if the resentment would feel less if you had acted more of your choices?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I would feel at least I could have more space or - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because I never...I never knock on his door ever unless there's a rat in the kitchen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you did - (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles). [21:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - he had a very easy time letting you know that he was not available at the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And maybe I should do a little bit more of that, but it feels so rude. But at the time I don't mean it to be rude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, I think there are more polite ways to do it. I mean, saying that I'm going to the bathroom, and then I'm going back to bed, and go deal with it on your own, that's a little rude.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they're...I think there are more polite ways to let somebody know that this is not the best time for you. And there's also the difference between someone calling to...or stopping by to chat about the day, and, "I have an issue right now, can you help me?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [22:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I have an issue right now, can you help me? It's urgent." There's a sense of urgency around that versus, I just want to catch up with you, see how was your day was. Well, that can be done now, 10 minutes from now, or even tomorrow morning and you're tired?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah, I guess I hadn't even thought...sometimes I guess I just...I don't realize that this is happening. So I didn't realize that...not that I didn't realize that I had a choice, but I always felt like...that it almost...maybe I hadn't thought about it too much. But I guess I never really felt like...I felt like, "Oh, oh, okay. Well, he's going to talk to me. Okay, well, then it's okay because I'll be alone after that or whatever." I never really was like, "Well, how would I ask him to not talk right now?" I guess I never thought that that was an option? And maybe that happens in other places as well. [23:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder. Because it's interesting because the... it...it's healthy to understand why it feels like you're always tiptoeing around him and sort of navigating around him. Because you know what you just said is like, "Well, he's going to come talk to me now." So immediately, you start thinking about how you bend your schedule or bend what you're doing to arrange to the fact that he's going to talk to you now. Not that he wants to talk, and then -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you decide whether he could. But it just sounds...he's got all the power, he decides. And you just mold around it to make it fit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also don't think that that's an unusual way of relating for me. I don't know that that's necessarily just with Phil.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what that's about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really could be just balance of the power -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, sort of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - structure with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's hard, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's hard? Tell me more about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that a lot of what I have wanted to do, even just growing up. And a lot of...actually, I think the reason why I study what I study in terms of what I study, at least in undergrad where these (inaudible at 24:27) and their main thing was empowerment. And that's sort of been a consistency in my life, to try to be in control and empowered. Not like...like you said, not over other people or anything, but just sort of over my own life and to have the freedom to make my own choices. And that's - it's weird that it fell back and I don't know happened. [24:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I wonder if it's not...if it's that you were having to fight for your...for your own empowerment in so many places, that you sort of found a bigger [show your bound] (ph). And you're â€”and that's at the expense of these more sort of insidious ones. Because you did win some big battles where you didn't have very much power. I mean, you're...you spent so much energy trying to fight for your choice to go in school. And that was a huge battle against your parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you won. You got out of where you were living. You got to go away to school. You had a...you got that undergraduate experience that you were looking for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like that was a very hard fought and won battle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [25:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe because so much energy was devoted to what you had to do in order to lay the ground work to be able to succeed on that one, some of these sort of not quite as observable battles may have...you didn't have the energy to devote to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or they didn't seem as important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because that one was - that one was so important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you probably weren't wrong, I mean, being able to go away to school and chose a college that felt like a good fit for you, probably had a lot of impact -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - on other things too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it might have been a very appropriately focused energy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're...you're also a bit of resource-ive. (sp?) [26:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe you couldn't pay attention to some of these other kinds of dynamics at the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's interesting too because I...I've always...even when I was in college or whatever, I've always sort of been...I've always had trouble saying no. And whenever anyone would ask me to do something, I was like, "Okay, yeah, I'll make that poster. Okay, yeah, I will totally organize that meeting." And so â€”and then I would, at the end of every semester, have a mental break down and freak out. And for a day...and just go crazy and not sleep for a week or something. And it - I don't know. Yeah, that seems like...its overcommitting thing may be life difficulties.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel overcommitted now too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that (inaudible at 27:11)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, sort of, but less, much less. So I don't - I can sleep for - I don't stay up for more than a day or two. And I remember that not being the case at the other college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I bet there are people that don't pull all-nighters at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. But I mean, I've sort of just accepted that it's part of the way that I function. You know maybe I shouldn't, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's all relative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, if you're doing it a lot of less than you felt like before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am, oh, yeah, so much less, yeah. But anyway, okay. I should think about that for a while. I guess on the positive side or whatever was that I...I went out on a date with a boy. And he like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old was he, do you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Twenty-four, I think. [28:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think he's still a boy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughter) No. So I went out on a date with a man. (laughter) And he...we went back to his place. And I didn't want...I wanted - I told him I was very...was very explicit which is totally new for me. I was like, "I want to take things really, really slow." And he was like, "Okay." And that was...that was fine. I mean, I don't think - I'm never -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh, there's a really good example of being able to assert your voice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's...that's a fantastic use of power. It's not manipulative, it's not - it needs to be your power. And sometimes you think like, "Oh, I'm being controlled in a relationship."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't have to be that way. But knowing what felt comfortable for you, being able to state it clearly, and have it respected -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - is an awesome use of power. [29:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess that - I felt really good after that. And I don't know that I'm going to go out with him again or anything. But it wasn't anything that he did, it was just no chemistry or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you meet him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I went to a forum party at... on Saturday, last Saturday. And so it was sort of - it was I think that the reason I'm hesitant is just because he's moving very quickly. And I don't want that. I just want to like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you met him on Saturday and you went out - [29:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he wanted to go out twice from then until now. And I'm like, "Okay, well, calm down." And he had this elaborate date planned out. And I was like, "Okay, I don't know about that." And so that's okay that it's - I don't know, but I think a lot of what I realized was I could, I could do that. And I immediately felt back to college and my relationships back then and how...how different that felt. Just on...when I was going home, I was thinking about all this. And then I sort of - I didn't realize this before I guess. And I don't know that I...I think this, but I was surprised that someone might be interested in me. And I was like, "Wait, why am I surprised? And so I guess I realized that maybe I intuitively don't think that people are going to be interested in me. Which is interesting because I didn't really realize that before. And I didn't really realize that I thought that or - I don't know. It was all this going on. (chuckles)</p>

<p>And I guess the other thing that sort of came up, there's all these things that came up right after, was that I don't really know what...what a healthy relationship looks like. And so I was sort of - that's why I really want - I'm...I really want to go slow is because I don't know what - this is scary sort of new territory.</p>

<p>And so - well, yeah, I guess that's...that's another thing that's sort of been I think the main thing that I was taking away from it. Was that I don't really know what a healthy relationship looks like or what to expect or - any of that makes me sound like I'm 15, but I don't know. [31:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nah, relationships are complicated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 31:33) at only at 15. Most 15-year-olds have no clue what a healthy relationship is, nor should they. They're just figuring out what healthy relationships are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're...you're probably more intelligent than you think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it's less about what it looks like and using your intuition to guide what you're feeling. And the interesting thing is we talked about trusting yourself and trusting your feelings. And I think relationships are a really good opportunity to practice that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you feel? How did...how did you feel when you were spending time with him? If you got out of your head and stopped thinking about it -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - what did it feel like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I would say that's...this is where we practice is taking a moment and you...your go-to place is to analyze and to start thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 32:25) yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a bad skill, but not the only skill you need in order to be able to ascertain whether the relationship, any relationship, whether it's a relationship with a guy or a friendship or what's going on with your mom -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and you're stepping outside of your head for a minute and checking in with you're feeling. And you're generally, I think, more in a good way of figuring out whether the relationship is working is if you step...you come away from time spent with someone and you feel good about yourself is probably a good relationship. If you come away from spending time with someone and you feel badly about yourself, something is off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might not be that that person is a bad person, but it's - that's the most basic level of ascertaining whether this is a good relationship or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because spending time with a good friend, having a healthy relationship with a friend or having a healthy relationship with a romantic partner, should feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might get more complicated after that, but your first go-to thing is, do I feel good or do I feel bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, okay. Maybe I...I started to do a little bit of that again. Because when we were supposed to go out on a second date, I was really dreading it. And I was like, "Oh, I don't know, very quick, I don't want to do that. That's too fast." And so I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:40)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I cancelled and with time and stuff, but so maybe I guess something like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really didn't have a reason, but I was like, "Well, I'm dreading it. I don't know why." But maybe this was something I should ask why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you listen to it, and then you can ask more questions. Because then you can figure out, "Well, is it because I don't want to spend time with him at all or that this feels too fast, and I want a little bit more time in-between?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then these...then you can start to ask yourself more complicated questions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those answers might be harder to figure out. That's when you can start analyzing. [34:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But starting at irrational feelings of - (laughter) okay, I can try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what - do you know sort of with some time away - not some time away, but what that dread was about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that, like I said, there was - he was really nice and I think that we got along well. But I don't know that - I would want to be his friend. But I don't know that chemistry-wise, if that's working. And also it was moving very quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think those two things together -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And it sounds like you not feeling like there's that chemistry, and him pushing for something faster, that mismatch is probably what that dread is about -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - when someone wants something different than what you want from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [34:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which could be any - I mean, as I said that, I thought, "Huh, I could have said that about Phil."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? He wants something different than you do, and he wants to come into your room and have a conversation, that's not what you want right then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That like, "Oh, he's going to want to talk to me right now. That's a little bit of dread.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not that he's - there's a different thing he might be wanting from you. He's not wanting a romantic relationship -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that you don't want, but he wants your time and you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [35:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that mismatch of, "Ahh, somebody wants something from you that I don't really want to give them."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. And, yeah, I think maybe that goes back to the whole overcommitting thing. And maybe that's part of it, that I'm not used to saying no or really expressing how I feel at all. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:47)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit I guess. I mean, I could try to - I don't know. I mean, I think that there's - in order to continue to be friends with Phil, I would have to forgive him for his reaction, and that's hard for me. Because I...I don't - I'm not resentful. I don't hold grudges against people, but I don't forget either.</p>

<p>And so just - I'm not going to tell him really personal things because I'm afraid that he's going to go share them. It would take a really long time for that to change, a really, really long time of seeing that he didn't do that. And maybe sharing with a little bit of things and then have it not be shared or whatever. So I don't - yeah. And then - does that...does that make sense? [36:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, you want to be careful with who you give your trust to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But in terms of...I can't just be, "Okay, well, you're forgiven."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, actually it's really hard to forgive somebody for something that hasn't been acknowledged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And has - he hasn't...he doesn't know that you're mad. Or he knows that you're mad, but it hasn't been spoken, it's an unspoken message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that makes it much harder because one thing that makes it easier to forgive somebody is when they acknowledge that it's there. And it doesn't - when someone gives you a sincere apology, they can't undue what happened - [37:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but they've acknowledged that there's some hurt at least in what they've done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that makes everything much easier to expect that apology which actually a true exception of an apology is...is forgiveness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [37:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if someone can say, "I'm sorry that what I said hurt your feelings so badly." Even if they don't disagree with you, they still could have said whatever it was. I think it's a lot easier to them...forgive them for these things -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - acknowledged that there was some personal transgression, an awareness of your feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that hasn't occurred with you and Phil in this...in this instance. And so he got based - that's like a huge barrier to you being able to sort of let it go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I would do if he...if he was like, "Well, I'm not going to apologize because that was a terrible thing you did." I think that would be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be really hard too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that would also I think sort of corner me instead of saying - I was like, "Well, okay. Well, what am I supposed to do with that?" I just can't move on from that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would knowingly disagree...you would have to knowingly disagree. [38:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that would - yeah. Maybe - yeah. So maybe I'm skipping a step, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sort of just assuming that he's going to say no and...or like, "You were wrong or whatever." And sort of moving to that, "Well, I can't really be friends with you because of hard sort of things."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you both be right or both be wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. That's the hard part though is I...I feel like I'm acknowledging that that was a really annoying thing to do, to wake him up at seven in the morning. But then this other part and I don't think that I'm getting the same sort of...or that I - I don't know. [39:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never acknowledged his response was problematic even if you're...even if your entry was problematic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's like a two - there's just one person stepping doesn't undo the other persons stepping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I don't know exactly. Okay, yeah. That's what that means. I don't know what - that's hard. It's hard to have a conversation. But I guess if we're going to live with each other for another three months I guess really talking about other things might be great for long term stuff. But I think that to get to that point, there's really this hurdle. I don't know. I was sort of just hoping to avoid it all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is totally my very naturally, very normal reaction now, but maybe not the best thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's no one right way to handle it. But I think we do know is that if you totally ignore it, you're going to...you're going to feel the resentment for some amount of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [40:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not going to just dissipate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe even guilt. Like the time that...with...because I feel like this is the same thing that happened with the girls, right? Little things bother me about them, and I never say anything. I never said anything. I never said anything. And then there was this one big thing, and I exploded. And I feel like that this is sort of the same pattern. And I don't want to do that again, I don't. But at the same time, that's so hard to try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's really hard to do something to - yeah, it's really hard to do something different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [40:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But changing your response is about doing something that's going to be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't need to be the most uncomfortable thing that you could think of though. Which would be exposing how you feel very openly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it does, if you want to change the pattern, you got to do something that's a little bit off the beaten path -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - of what you typically do. So it sounds like your job this week is to sort of think about what are all...what are all the ways that you could do something a little bit differently and then challenge yourself to pick one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay, I think I can do that. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really got your eyes open to see how things...how you kind of daily interactions are feeding into the pattern and handle these ways, so that you can notice how they're happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's - yeah. That's also frustrating, but, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I know it's frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's interesting to note also I guess how strong...how strong of a feeling that is to...that's...everything about me is being like, "Well, no. Just don't his friend anymore." I don't - and it's almost like that, how I told you how my dad is totally ungiven (sp?) he gives no room, not a point at all. And so this became like this sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you got really girded up for a huge battle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you got to cut it all off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you can't give an inch because then they'll take a foot or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you're probably totally right with your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your dad, you can't give an inch because he'll take the whole thing and he'll run away with it. And you know that from experience. You know, I don't know your dad at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't have to use that same strategy with everybody because not everybody - [42:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - is like your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's maybe what's kind of happening. And it sounds like there may be some similarities between Phil and your dad. Or you know and that it doesn't feel totally trustworthy...doesn't feel safe to give them anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they're not the same person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's...when we get into trouble in our relationships is when we have one extreme way of dealing with a person, and it works for them. And we apply it to everybody else and not all...as you know, not -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - all people are the same, not all people have the same kinds of way of relating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can't use - we have to use the pattern of relating that works for each person. [043:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of using what's safe with your dad on everybody, not everybody, but a lot. It doesn't - that's kind of your go-to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I - yeah. I didn't realize how...how instinctual that's become really (inaudible at 43:37).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it protected you. And in a lot of ways it worked. So why wouldn't you use it and repeat it? And you could keep noticing the relationships in maybe which it doesn't work or has side effects that aren't so great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, okay, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot to overwhelm you. I mean, you feel...you get overwhelmed with all this stuff that we've -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, because - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - covered in a session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think - yeah, part of it is because maybe seeing how this doesn't work with Phil, means that like, "Oh, I have to figure out whether or not this has worked with every other friendship I've had." Or like that's what it feels like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But let's not do that, okay? Because I know that's one of the things that overwhelms you. And I know we talked last time about trying to focus the sessions a little bit more, and have me be more active in that. So let's not apply it to everything else in life. This is...this is an incident that came up. It's a good example for a pattern that's part of your life. But let's keep it focused on this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [44:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then your next time you come back, I'm going to follow-up on, "Okay, what was the change that you decided to enact -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - with Phil and with this particular thing to keep you focused on that." And practicing that. That's going to eventually trickle out to all the other places in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't have to be thinking about every single relationship in your life right now. I'm going to work on this one because it makes sense to focus on this one right now because it's a good example.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we'll see what happens with this one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop there for now? [45:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe take a deep breath.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think - I don't know - I put you in my book. I don't know if I checked in with you about that, but for two weeks or do you want to come back -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, two weeks would be great. I don't know if you have availability more in the afternoon? If that would be possible, that would be great, but if not, this is fine too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For all the time or just for that session or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the time would be great. It's just hard to go from here to class. And then it's distracting and - but if it's not possible, it's not a big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Mondays I consistently have a 3:30 in the afternoon that we could switch to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I have class 2:00 to 4:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don't think - I don't have another consistent spot on Monday afternoons. That would - I have a 2:30, so that wouldn't work for you either. I gave you the latest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I sometimes have a 5:00, but it's not consistent because I have some of that (inaudible at 46:08) on that spot too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I don't know if it would be preferable to have a consistent 12:30 or flip-flop around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would there be anything on another day of the week or - it doesn't really have to be - as long as it's not on Friday, Saturdays because I work on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. 2:00 - the only other possibility would be Tuesday. What's your class schedule on Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 2:00 to 4:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, then. So it's that same thing where I - it would be flip-flopping between some...sometimes I have a five o'clock. Five o'clock is a really popular time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) So maybe -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then we can be consistent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe it would be too inconsistent, Monday and Tuesday five o'clocks? (sp?) [46:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could we -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if they - let's see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 46:55).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering if it...they were...if they're working together? And it looks like they could be. Because we did - yeah, I could do Monday, April 2<sup>nd</sup> at 5:00.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my God, April.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's our next -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like New Year's yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's our next week. And then...and then so the following one would be the Tuesday, April 17<sup>th</sup> at 5:00?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So 2/17?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so 2/2 at 5:00 and then 2/17 or - no, 4?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 47:33).</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I like the pants.</p>

<p>MORGAN: You look good, too. Things at home have been a disaster. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m worried to hear that.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Mom’s drinking again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the day?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yes. Sorry to put you down in the dumps and not trying to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. Don’t worry about me.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Gordon is on a rampage, too. It’s like he’s physically violent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Towards who?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Both my parents. Beating them up. [00:01:01] He has a fixation with Bruce Jeffries murdering our family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s literally hurting your parents to the point where they’re bruised?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah, and my mom. Either she or Gordon has punched my father and I’m in a nightmare right now. I don’t know what more to do. It’s been hell on fucking earth. I apologize for the language. Tomorrow night I plan on getting out and being alone, like eating out. I know that sounds childish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no.</p>

<p>MORGAN: And immature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to escape. You need to be away.</p>

<p>MORGAN: I know it sounds odd. I know it sounds weird, but I need to have some privacy for an hour or two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing sounds weird about that at all, Morgan. It sounds very logical. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>MORGAN: I know Gordon cares about our safety from a serial killer. This is not a joke. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. I understand.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Bruce Jeffries is some false friend he had bank from high school and now he turned into an enemy. He turned into an enemy back in late May or early June.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He talked to me a little bit on the phone.</p>

<p>MORGAN: He turned into an enemy a year or two ago. I don’t know why he was friends with an enemy until many months ago and he’s an official enemy now. We appreciate him trying to save our lives and caring about our safety, but he can’t put it to sleep one single day, not a week, not a month, not two months even, not a whole season, not even two seasons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He talks about it all the time?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah. We know we can’t even shout in the house because the surfaces are so thin and the neighbors in our neighborhood are not nice people. They’re very mean and most of them are senior citizens. It’s like an old-people’s neighborhood we have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you doing anything that helps you take care of yourself?</p>

<p>MORGAN: (pause) (sighs) [00:04:02] I am not happy right now. None of us are in this family. And my parents live like spoiled brats. They live like they’re spoiled and bratty children babies. They don’t listen to anything we say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even to Emily?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Sometimes and often to Brett, very often to Brett. On a scale from one to ten, a ten out of ten.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They respect Brett.</p>

<p>MORGAN: No. Not much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don’t respect anybody?</p>

<p>MORGAN: They respect him but they don’t listen to what he says.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they sometimes listen to Emily?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Not much. On a high scale with Emily it’s like an eight. [00:05:03] They don’t listen to her. And for me it’s probably an eight out of ten.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do listen to you occasionally?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But very rarely.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in terms of taking care of yourself, though. Let’s just talk about Morgan for a second here. What are you doing to keeping yourself not completely overwhelmed all the time?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Whenever I eat breakfast in the morning I have to take it on a tray upstairs and eat it so I don’t have to see my father watch the depressing news.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He never stopped?</p>

<p>MORGAN: No. It’s nonstop with him watching the depressing news MSNBC. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your neighborhood is safe enough for you to walk around, though?</p>

<p>MORGAN: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not really. It’s literally not a safe area? [00:06:03]</p>

<p>MORGAN: It’s a great house, but Gordon is not happy at all, any way, shape, or form. With the house, he thinks something good with the house is going to happen. We got a good letter yesterday that our landlord, Collin News, says, “I’m thinking of selling the house to you guys.” That’s the only thing Gordon is satisfied with, but he’s not happy at all with this life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he working?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Not with his life, because of the serial killer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he working at all?</p>

<p>MORGAN: No because he hates his life. [00:06:56] Right now, back to the subject of me, this thing about me, it’s a very short subject in (sighs) . . . yeah. Like every morning I have to take my breakfast upstairs on a tray so I don’t have to watch my father watch the depressing news. I have to take my breakfast up on a tray and eat it and watch TV, watch something totally different enough, something that’s not depressing news or anything depressing. Nothing that’s news or a doctor’s TV channel or a medical thing, something that’s . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Light. You want something airy; something that’s not a downer.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah. Anything that’s entertainment, an entertainment channel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you painting?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yes, but I had to take off today because I had disappointment and tomorrow I might take off because of all the stress I’ve been through. [00:08:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you’re going out to dinner tonight?</p>

<p>MORGAN: No, tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow night. Where are you going to go?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Panera.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And that helps you to get some time away?</p>

<p>MORGAN: I can’t always go to the same restaurant. It gets boring and it might annoy customers, like staff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any place that you can walk to or relax at all? There’s isn’t a park that’s a beautiful place. There’s nothing near you?</p>

<p>MORGAN: No. All there is, is the lake, but that’s not enough for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To sit and look at.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Because what we have near us is a McDonald’s, a Wawa, McDonalds – yuck! That’s not very good for you. That’s awful. A McDonalds, a Walgreens, a Wawa, and a bank. [00:09:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don’t want to belong to a gym or anything like that? I’m just wondering more – not about physical fitness – more about just you having an escape.</p>

<p>MORGAN: I don’t want an exercise program.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about a library? I’m just curious if there is a place for you to be that’s not at home once in a while.</p>

<p>MORGAN: I’m not overweight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I’m not even pushing exercise. I’m talking about – it could be a library, it could be a coffee shop. I’m just trying to see if there is a place that you could occasionally be that allows you to be with your own thoughts.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Not that I can think of. You don’t have to report me or anything. I know you’re doing your best. I appreciate your suggestions, but nothing that I can think of. I haven’t gained a single pound.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you’re right, nothing like that. [00:09:57]</p>

<p>MORGAN: My weight has dropped down. It’s like a side effect from my medication. The generic brand medications, the only difference from them is the quality. The side effects hardly change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we return for a second about why you think Gordon hit your family?</p>

<p>MORGAN: For self-defense. He had to beat my mom for self-defense of her drinking. He did it for good and for bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How badly did he hit her?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Like the cheeks; both of them. My mother beat my father. She gave him a black eye and a scar on his nose. It’s been giving him headaches terribly. [00:11:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I should meet with them. I’m wondering whether it might be better . . . </p>

<p>MORGAN: I’m not ready for that yet. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. I’m even thinking when the time comes if maybe I’ll see them without you for a while. I don’t want you to be in the middle of it all the time.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah. Later during this appointment, but I’m not ready for it at this second.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I’m not pushing it. I’m not. I’m not ending. I’m not ending. </p>

<p>MORGAN: I’m in a fucking nightmare right now with all three of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you are, Morgan.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Gordon is not my parent. He’s not my future parent after my parents would pass in the next three or four decades. He’s not my security guard, MD, or psychologist, or chaperone. [00:12:05] It’s like he tries to invade my whole life and take away my independence. I know he cares about my safety, me avoiding seizures and being a life-saver, but he has no need and right to take away my independence. It’s not fair. It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does he do that?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Following me around. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He follows you around.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Treating me like I’m a fucking baby. Like what the fuck? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is his rationale for following you around? Why does he think he should?</p>

<p>MORGAN: He does it for care and safety, but he doesn’t have to do it every so often. [00:12:57] The occasions he’s ever ruined for me was my 27th birthday in 2010, Halloween of 2010, which were both when we still lived in North Carolina just before we moved out of there. He moved out of there before we did, a month and a quarter before we did. He moved out of there a month-and-a-half before we did. We were the last ones to move out of North Carolina, me and my parents. We were the last, a month-and-a-half after he left. He left before us. He tried hard to help us move out of there, but me and my parents were the last ones to move out of there. Me and my parents moved out of there December 3rd, after Thanksgiving, yet I remember exactly when we moved out. Gordon moved out in November, before Thanksgiving. It wasn’t a month-and-a-half, it was like three weeks, I think, or two-and-a-half. Yeah, it was two-and-a-half weeks after Gordon left. We left after him. And then the other occasions he’s ruined were Christmas Day of 2010. Christmas Day of 2010 is what he ruined for all of us, actually, December 25th the exact day. My high school reunion. Fourth of July of 2010, less than a month after he came down to North Carolina to help us move out. [00:14:59] He moved out again before we had, as I previously told you. Yeah, my high school reunion, which he turned into a disaster. He cared about me fainting, seizures or whatever, but he had not right to follow me around or whatever. He kept saying, “Can we go in 20 minutes? Can we go in 20 minutes?” I hate being the first one to leave, but it’s not fair. He has to spoil people’s fun, spoil people’s joy, like I can’t have a smile on my face. I can’t laugh. I always have to suffer, worry, stress, and be terrified. It’s not fair. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would he do if you were happy?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Not be around either him or my parents. [00:16:01] My sister is the only one with a good attitude. Brett is often trouble sometimes. He’s modeling my father. Brett can be trouble quite often on a high scale of one to ten, like an eight out of ten is when he’s trouble to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you and Emily re the only two that are sort of upbeat?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Upbeat like getting along well is what you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like happy, like you can be happy at times?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah. She and I have a lot in common. I know she’s a female. I know she’s the opposite sex, but there are a lot of things that we have in common, like the holidays. Some other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m so sorry you’re going through such a bad time, Morgan.</p>

<p>MORGAN: (breathing heavily) It’s like not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not. Definitely not fair. I realize that Gordon’s behavior and your parents’ behavior is just intolerable. [00:17:01]</p>

<p>MORGAN: It was a small high school reunion. Only about 30-50 of the graduates were there and I knew over half those people. I knew 20-30; I knew up to 25-30 of the people very well. Not all of them are on my Facebook, but I still knew them very well and I remembered them. I gave 12 business cards to people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About your art?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah. I gave 12.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I still have that card that you made.</p>

<p>MORGAN: (crying) (pause) [00:18:03] My adulthood has been so ruined. (crying) (pause) It’s been so spoiled. Emily is the only one who’s sweet and caring and loving. (crying) She offers, especially on special occasions. I’m sorry I’m faking a tantrum. I don’t mean to. (pause) I know this sounds like a big tantrum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you’re very upset, Morgan. I don’t question that.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Thanks for having faith in me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>MORGAN: Gordon is such a nut case. He’s not the fucking squad team. He’s not my fucking parent. He’s not my fucking medical doctor. He’s not my fucking psychologist. He’s not my fucking chaperone. He’s not my fucking foster parent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s just an older brother.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Yeah, he’s my fucking older brother. He’s my fucking family member, my fucking protector. He’s my fucking life-saver. That’s what he is. (sobbing) God damn it. (crying) He never learns, nor do my parents nor does Brett. All four of them never learn from me. [00:20:03] (crying) They never learn. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I don’t think they do.</p>

<p>MORGAN: They never fucking learn. They never fucking learn. They never fucking learn. They never fucking learn. Not one. Not one. Not fucking one. Not fucking one lesson. Not one simple lesson. It’s that hard for them. (crying) They don’t get it. Not one day. Not one week. Not one month. Not two months. Not a season. Not two seasons. Not a whole year. Not two years. Not a whole decade. [00:21:02] Not two decades even, without pain and agony and difficult and stress and hell of the four of them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would put John at the same level as Gordon?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Occasionally; not as much, though. Not as much, but occasionally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are you and your dad or you and your mom ever doing okay or is it bad 100% of the time now?</p>

<p>MORGAN: Right now, it’s horrible. (breathing heavily) Fuck. Fuck. Sorry for the language and outbursts, but nothing has gotten much better. I think we can let my parents in now. [00:22:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to be here when they’re here or do you want a little break from them?</p>

<p>MORGAN: I’d rather have a break. I’m sorry but . . . I’m sorry I’ve made you so down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I’m sorry you’ve had such a rough time. Thank you for talking to me about it.</p>

<p>MORGAN: Let me know if you need me back in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will. (pause) </p>

<p>FATHER: Thanks for seeing us. Where am I sitting?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anywhere.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Sit next to me. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>FATHER: Morgan insisted on seeing you first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’ve never, ever, ever . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: He was pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, yeah.</p>

<p>FATHER: Okay, just before, reveal Dora had a scuffle. She beat the shit out of me.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I did not beat the shit out of you. I went like this.</p>

<p>FATHER: The drinking problem. Taking some wine away from her caused that, so I’ll just put these back on. I just wanted you to see that. We seem to be in a better place than where we were. I still don’t think she should drink. We’ve sort of now settled on her having one small bottle of Chianti in our room and just kind of keeping it there, but it continues to be an issue. What the biggest issue is, and I feel bad for Morgan but this is weighing on him, I’m not allowed to watch MSNBC anymore. I get that.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, yeah. They forbade us from watching MSNBC.</p>

<p>FATHER: The one thing in my life that I had other than singing once in a while, which I haven’t done because of schedules and stuff with my partner, is that Gordon is wreaking havoc on . . . [00:24:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I understand. I did speak to him on the phone.</p>

<p>FATHER: You spoke to Gordon on the phone?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that one day that you put him on.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He said to tell you thank you for listening to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I wouldn’t mind seeing him.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I tried to get him to come today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would certainly be fine with that but . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: His brother thinks he’s delusional. My sister, Lorelai, with whom we had a tiff recently – I haven’t spoken to her – but she at the time thought he’s delusional. He’s still convinced . . . He acts like he’s not thinking about it and plays Wii and the physical game downstairs. His pad downstairs is really nice. Also the owner of the property, just as an FYI, has said that, “Hey, look. I’m going to . . .” [00:24:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard. Morgan was very happy about that. That was the one upbeat thing.</p>

<p>FATHER: He’s going to sell in in February and consider it, so we’re going to have to get some consortium together with the family to try to avoid that and get approved because our credit is awful. By the way, speaking of financial issues, I was able to successfully by phone sign up for the Affordable Care Act, Walter. I hope that can help because you’ve been so generous and kind and whatever, that if you can tap into that or tell us how to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s possible. I don’t know, but I’m glad you got through.</p>

<p>FATHER: Yeah. We just did the phone thing because we’re not that good at Internet.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Well the website’s been broken.</p>

<p>FATHER: Dora and I, at this point, we believe that we belong together, but we’re not sure if the way forward with not hurting each other physically, emotionally and Gordon is strained. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you doing?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Physically? I’m a wreck. [00:26:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about emotionally right now?</p>

<p>MOTHER: I’m a wreck. I try to . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: Placate?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Placate Gordon by making it . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: Buying into his bullshit.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Not really buying into it, but listening to him rant about this and this and it’s like being in a [cock show.] (ph?) I’m like, “Well, Gordon, if the forensic evidence is there then they must move forward, but you are not a detective.” He just cannot let it go.</p>

<p>FATHER: And he cannot let it go. He can’t stop putting his life on hold.</p>

<p>MOTHER: And it goes on. He’ll come in the bedroom at like 6:30 in the morning, knocking as hard as he can on the door. Casey will get the door and he’ll walk in and start pacing with, “I think Billy Jeffries is the Zodiac killer.” </p>

<p>FATHER: Or “I think Billy Jeffries has a plane.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: No, we know he has a plane. I’ve seen his plane. [00:27:04]</p>

<p>FATHER: Can you imagine with our conditions, a knock on the door at like 6:00 AM?</p>

<p>MOTHER: And it’s such a strain on Morgan.</p>

<p>FATHER: Morgan cannot handle it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we get Morgan out of the house more often just to have time? </p>

<p>MOTHER: Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know he’s going to Panera tomorrow.</p>

<p>MOTHER: That was the other thing. Gordon said, “You can’t go there alone. You’re in danger.</p>

<p>FATHER: It’s like all pervasive. He’s calling his brother Brett and saying, “Are you all right?” He thinks he’s the protector of the family. I understand it comes from a . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: He’s got a savior complex.</p>

<p>FATHER: Exactly. “Is Emily home yet? Is Devon with her?” It’s like – whoa.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He’s totally convinced.</p>

<p>FATHER: Plus, continuing the strain, just as an aside, Emily had a breakup with her Indian-descent boyfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No? Really?</p>

<p>FATHER: So she’s looking at places by herself. We went with her yesterday. It’s questionable whether he will continue or live with her. [00:27:59] We wish she would just dump him because she’s so gorgeous now and bright and talented and doing well at work. We went to a place yesterday and we’re walking around with a very slick realtor guy who runs the development nearby.</p>

<p>MOTHER: So we’re walking through the garden. You must know the garden, right? It’s beautiful. So we’re walking through the gardens and Casey said, “What about mice here?” Two seconds later a mouse ran in front of . . . The minute the word mice was out of his mouth. Emily looks at the guy; the guy looks at Emily. She looks back at me. I roll my eyes.</p>

<p>FATHER: Thankfully I didn’t see it since I have fear of rodents. I have rodentiaphobia. I will jump on a table.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I cannot do spiders, but he cannot do mice. I can do mice.</p>

<p>FATHER: I don’t know why. I think it’s the Richard Gere story. I think it’s just I’m worried it’s going to crawl up my ass.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It’s a gerbil.</p>

<p>FATHER: Oh, gerbil. Sorry. (laughs)</p>

<p>MOTHER: You know why a gerbil can’t drive a stick shift?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>MOTHER: It can’t get out of gear.</p>

<p>FATHER: That’s terrible. Are we recording this? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FATHER: Hello. </p>

<p>MOTHER: Hi. You owe me for that one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let’s try to bring in some of the Gordon stuff because I’m sort of stymied in the idea that we know that he is somewhat delusional. That’s not a question, but he’s not disturbed enough to be able to 302. </p>

<p>MOTHER: What do I do, 201 him?</p>

<p>FATHER: What do I do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. That’s the question. He’s not going to voluntarily go.</p>

<p>FATHER: We try to weave him into - “Let’s watch this show. Oh, General Hospital is on. There are pretty women on. Come watch it, Gordon, with us.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah, we started a Scrabble game with Morgan, like an ongoing Scrabble game.</p>

<p>FATHER: Oh, by the way, that’s been very good. Morgan wanted to do a game. We started a Scrabble game. He’s in charge of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good.</p>

<p>FATHER: And we can continue to do it. It’s good for us all, the three of us, at least, to bond. [00:29:58]</p>

<p>MOTHER: He won’t involve himself. </p>

<p>FATHER: He won’t be a part of it.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I’m like, “Gordon. You spell a word every two hours. It’s not like a big competition. Just walk by; spell a word.” </p>

<p>FATHER: His brother, Brett, comes over sometimes and plays Wii with him and hangs out.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But he’s sick of listening to him, too.</p>

<p>FATHER: He’s sick of listening to him. We think part of the break-up with Devon was the strain from our family and the Gordon thing because Devon doesn’t want any part of this shit.</p>

<p>MOTHER: See first we had ongoing is the Gordon delusion. Then there’s the seizure. Then what happened right after the seizure? Oh, Gordon checked himself into – you know – the asylum. And then he got out of the asylum.</p>

<p>FATHER: Which supposedly now the cover story is he did that for our protection so that if anyone was coming after . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah. That’s the cover. He’s laying low.</p>

<p>FATHER: Can you imagine this stuff? “Are the doors locked? Close that door.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: He thinks he’s Batman. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m just so sorry you all . . . This just sounds so unbelievably uncontrollable.</p>

<p>FATHER: I don’t know what to do. What do we do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I agree.</p>

<p>FATHER: I finally talked to Lorelai about it. “Lorelai, maybe the only thing to do is you and I and maybe with Morgan, move far away. Let him have the house there with Emily, maybe, if she’ll take it over.” I don’t know, but it’s like I don’t see any escape from this that doesn’t include an escape, God love him, from Gordon. Literally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. I do.</p>

<p>FATHER: It’s the main cause of everything – Morgan’s anxiety, our fighting, our drinking, which precipitates our fighting. Even with my bruises in our last battle, we’re committed. We know that we need to be together.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I know.</p>

<p>FATHER: And so I don’t have my Altrusa outlet.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But then with the outside influence or just Gordon, the seizures, the asylum . . . [00:32:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, are you saying that Morgan literally will not be permitted tomorrow to go to the restaurant?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, he’s going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good.</p>

<p>FATHER: “I’m going to go and I’ll tell Gordon to just sit in the parking lot.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: If I have to go to the pizzeria around the corner and check on him, I will.</p>

<p>FATHER: It’s just like everything – it leaks into all our . . . It’s suffocating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s absolutely nothing. Gordon doesn’t have any concerns about – like where is he getting his money right now?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah, he’s out of money.</p>

<p>FATHER: Well, that’s the thing. He has promised that he’s going to start looking for work. And now it’s – when is he doing it? In November? </p>

<p>MOTHER: December. He promises to be working again by Christmas; plus he’s under this delusion that Bruce Jeffries, evil Bruce Jeffries, who is an evil little smarmy shit, by the way . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: But it’s not like he would . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: I mean, his whole life revolves around putting him away because he’s a serial killer. I don’t doubt that. [00:33:02]</p>

<p>FATHER: Also I think Gordon has deluded himself into he’s a master crime solver, so he thinks this is all going to be finished and he’s going to write a book and be a millionaire. It’s like oh, my God. Give me a break here. I don’t know what to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can’t have Gordon go contact the police, have other voices say to him, “I’m sorry. Thanks, but no thanks.”</p>

<p>FATHER: I think they’re probably afraid to tell him that. They take the information and he goes away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No one wants to touch that.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Right.</p>

<p>FATHER: And supposedly he thinks that they’re onto it and something is going to happen. He’s always down there looking for chatter on his computer. It’s unbelievable. We try to say – the guy’s name is Bruce – I said, “This is a Bruce-free zone now. We’re watching General Hospital or some movie or whatever.” </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he permit there to be Bruce-free zones? [00:34:00]</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah, but then he starts in again.</p>

<p>FATHER: Yeah, or he gets pissy and walks downstairs again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that it’s great that you’re holding a limit, though, that you’re saying this is a Joe-free zone.</p>

<p>FATHER: But see it’s just a veneer because it’s a Bruce-free zone because he doesn’t talk about it, but it’s in his head. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, but it’s not in your head or Morgan’s.</p>

<p>FATHER: But the tough thing is – and I hate to keep reinjecting this – I don’t want any more beatings from Gordon or from anybody. I seem to be one of those things used inflated with the sand on the bottom and the red nose.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bobo. </p>

<p>FATHER: And I don’t know how much more of this I can take.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much is Gordon attacking you all?</p>

<p>FATHER: Here’s a cute one. Gordon had beaten me up a couple of months ago when Dora went into her inebriated rage – is that a fair way? He went over the line and started hitting her to protect me. “Oh, I protected you, dad.” It’s like don’t hurt her. [00:35:06]</p>

<p>MOTHER: I was on the floor and he kicked me in the ribs twice.</p>

<p>FATHER: But Dora, with all due respect, you were insane. And this is something I need somebody to communicate. Her drinking maybe connected with her post-menopausal or whatever it is, she’s irrational sometimes, Walter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are we talking then that the police should be called on Gordon? </p>

<p>FATHER: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not quite that – that would not be helpful? That would just make it worse.</p>

<p>FATHER: Although, oddly he said that he was going to call the police on her for beating me up. I said, “Don’t do that. I don’t need a mug shot of my face.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FATHER: Walter, I’m sorry, I feel terrible that I have to bother you with all of our problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. It’s not your job to feel sorry.</p>

<p>FATHER: But I do. I like you so much, Walter. I feel like I wish I could come in here and say we’re all . . . [00:35:57]</p>

<p>MOTHER: If Gordon was a normal person . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: It would take a lot of the load off everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree. I know that’s the bigger factor. How are you feeling about the drinking?</p>

<p>MOTHER: That particular day was a mess because it was first I had to deal with Gordon and two hours of looking at his forensic evidence against Billy and Bruce. Then Brett and I got into an argument over – I don’t know – Leslie or something. He’s got a new girlfriend and she’s an old friend of Emily’s, so we’ve known her since she was a kid. She’s adorable. She’s a recovering heroin addict, but I guess she’s recovering.</p>

<p>FATHER: She’s from a Catholic family.</p>

<p>MOTHER: She’s a nice Catholic girl, really sweet. </p>

<p>FATHER: She looks cute with Brett.</p>

<p>MOTHER: They look cute together.</p>

<p>FATHER: We’ve known her since she was a kid.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But we got into some penny-ante argument about food and then after that I had to hear more from Gordon. [00:37:04] Then Morgan went off on me for something that I did in his studio. I dared to try and dust his studio. Apparently I’m not allowed to do housework. And then Emily’s car broke down and we had to go rescue her and she was upset. So then he said, “I’m going upstairs.” He takes his ball, goes upstairs, and I just assumed when I’m done with Emily . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: By the way, I’m not bi now. I am totally straight because I know you like to know those things.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But he goes upstairs and I said, “Okay, when I’m done with Emily I’ll come up and we’ll have a bowl and we’ll chat,” because we’re never alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean “have a bowl?”</p>

<p>MOTHER: Of weed. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Okay. But I thought you didn’t?</p>

<p>FATHER: She does now.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, yeah. I smoke. You talked me into it.</p>

<p>FATHER: Which is one of the things because it helps her. It literally helps her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No – I have no objection. I thought it was a different . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: No.</p>

<p>MOTHER: No.</p>

<p>FATHER: Sanjay Gupta. Always.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It does. It helps the MS. I don’t like being high, but I like being not in MS pain.</p>

<p>FATHER: So we literally had a lovely evening.</p>

<p>MOTHER: No, wait. No. So I finished with Emily. I listened to her cry for an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About Devon?</p>

<p>MOTHER: About Devon and the car and the apartment. She’s got to be out of her apartment by November 30th and he’s not helping her find a new place. He has just up and abandoned her. By that time I was spent. I still had a glass of wine on the wine bar. I grab it, I grab my cigarettes, I go upstairs, I’m thinking “I’ll just sit here, sip my wine, smoke a bowl and tell him about my conversation with Emily.” [00:39:07] But all I really wanted to do was to be away from everybody but him and he came at me ballistic. “How dare you bring wine up here.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are we talking about?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Casey. And all I was doing was sitting there . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: Because I thought we had a rule don’t bring wine up there, but that’s . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: I thought that rule was suspended for that night because I hadn’t had that much wine. So the wine is sitting on the table. I’m sitting in the chair. I’m expecting him to pack a bowl and hand it to me and the next thing I know he swats at me. I reach up and apparently I hit his glasses and broke them. The frames are metal and that’s why he has a black eye and I feel like shit about it. I don’t even have the energy to hit anybody. [00:39:57]</p>

<p>FATHER: But when she’s in a rage, though, she loses it.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I just went “tch” and the next thing I know his glasses are flying.</p>

<p>FATHER: But it was an extended rage, Dora. It lasted for minutes. You chased me down the stairs. You were hitting me all the way down.</p>

<p>MOTHER: No. I wasn’t hitting you. I was pulling your hair. I didn’t want to fall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what were you so mad about?</p>

<p>FATHER: Me taking away the wine.</p>

<p>MOTHER: No. It wasn’t that so much as . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: Oh, come on.</p>

<p>MOTHER: . . . I was just so spent from my four kids and listening to them that I just wanted a little island of tranquil quiet in my bedroom. I have a nice bedroom.</p>

<p>FATHER: So literally last night she laid down a checkered towel blanket. </p>

<p>MOTHER: It was a red-checked tablecloth.</p>

<p>FATHER: We had a very small bottle of chianti and we had our dinner up there and it was very pleasant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s great.</p>

<p>FATHER: We locked the door and it was like an oasis.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It was locked, but they still knocked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, but I think that because of that insanity you will have to carve out actual ways. [00:41:02]</p>

<p>FATHER: So now we realize we should just get a TV in our room, a small one, so that we can just get out of the maelstrom and the venue of anxiety, pain and emotionality.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Between Gordon making notes on his smartphone. </p>

<p>FATHER: Did you get that? The venue of anxiety, pain and emotionality. Thank you. (laughs)</p>

<p>MOTHER: Where was I? You go downstairs and it’s beautiful. There’s the TV, there’s a comfy couch, the computer is over here. Morgan is playing all kinds of games and noises. Gordon is on the deck pacing back and forth smoking constantly and putting notes into his smartphone.</p>

<p>FATHER: He smokes like two packs a day.</p>

<p>MOTHER: We’re trying to watch anything. Now we’ve been barred from MSNBC. [00:41:59]</p>

<p>FATHER: The only thing I get calm about is the news. It’s all screwed up, but oh my God, it’s not my problem, you know? Or news on the health care act because I’m so proud that I signed up. I know I’m repeating myself.</p>

<p>MOTHER: So it’s like you can’t be . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: Normal?</p>

<p>MOTHER: . . . around those two. Morgan plays video games on the computer.</p>

<p>FATHER: Sometimes Gordon helps him get to another level or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But Morgan is not painting much anymore?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>FATHER: He’s got his own room that’s a studio. As I said, we’re hoping to buy this place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Gordon doesn’t bother him in there?</p>

<p>FATHER: No.</p>

<p>MOTHER: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because Morgan is very conscious of being followed by Gordon, sort of protected by Gordon.</p>

<p>FATHER: I know. His so-called “protection” is killing us. I’m going to let Morgan go to Panera Bread and I’ll have to tell Gordon, “Look, I’ll be in the car outside watching, okay?” [00:43:00]</p>

<p>MOTHER: They got into it today. That’s what Morgan was so pissed off. Gordon told him, “You can’t go out alone.” And I’m like, “Yes, he can.”</p>

<p>FATHER: Thanksgiving Day, will it come to an end then because he said that? I don’t know. I do not know.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It has to end or I have to hide out in my bedroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I’m very glad the two of you, as much as it might feel like an odd solution, it sounds very smart to me to find ways to carve out your own place.</p>

<p>FATHER: Right, so once we get a little TV up there we can just have an entire little studio apartment in our room and bathroom there. (sighs)</p>

<p>MOTHER: We used to have a mini bar, remember?</p>

<p>FATHER: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As long as Morgan is also afforded some down time.</p>

<p>MOTHER: See Morgan takes his down time whenever he wants. He can go up to his room. He’s got a TV. He can use the computer for video games. [00:44:03] He goes on Facebook a lot. He doesn’t seem to be as affected by Gordon’s mania as Casey and I are. And especially me, because Casey won’t even listen to his – you know.</p>

<p>FATHER: No, I listen to it and then it’s like I pretend to say, “Okay, now we’re watching this show. Can we put it on the shelf for a while?” “You don’t even appreciate me because I’m trying to save your lives.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah. If this is saving my life, please kill me now.</p>

<p>FATHER: And I keep, as I say, dreaming with Dora, “Do you think we could just move to Amsterdam, me, you and Morgan? Should we move to Connecticut or Vancouver?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be worth joining that National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, the families of the mentally ill? I just wonder if it would be worth having some access, having a support group of other families that have mentally ill kids because this sounds so [different] (ph?) [00:45:12]</p>

<p>FATHER: The problem with that is we go to support, but then we come home to the same thing. It would not solve the problem, but thank you. It’s kind of like her drinking and she goes to AA but then comes home and is under stress – and by the way there’s an AA meeting once a week right down the street from us. I wish she would go, but it’s like if nobody encourages her she doesn’t go.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I’ve been to these meetings down the street. It’s old ladies who have Manhattans for breakfast. </p>

<p>FATHER: (sniggers) I don’t know, Walter.</p>

<p>MOTHER: The thing is that with Gordon, my neck has been stiff and tight and my shoulders are tense ever since he left his job. [00:46:01] At least when he was at work all day we had a little respite. Morgan would paint, we would watch MSNBC . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: But then he couldn’t lose his mania at work. </p>

<p>MOTHER: But when he was on the Abilify it seemed like he was getting better. And then he refused to take it anymore and got really mad. He’s still mad. “You forced me on medication that could kill me.” And I feel like saying, “Clue in, buddy. It was helping. You’re a paranoid schizophrenic and you need either Abilify or lithium.”</p>

<p>FATHER: So we never know. We just never know what’s going to happen. And then, of course, if he’s tired and he goes to bed and it’s like 9:00, we have to creep around on the wood floor. It’s like, “I’m trying to sleep! Be quiet!” Can you imagine this? We’re driven literally to our room, to the little respite, the tablecloths on the floor. [00:47:04] The only thing we don’t have up there is a TV which, I guess, we could just get one in a little mini frig. It’s very tough. </p>

<p>MOTHER: That was my idea to escape. I told him yesterday my bag was packed and I was ready to go and Emily said, “You can’t leave your whole family.” I’m like, “Why not? I need to get away.” </p>

<p>FATHER: But she had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Well, I have somewhere to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a place where you could even go for a weekend ever? I don’t mean expensive; I meant even like a friend’s or anything like that?</p>

<p>FATHER: I don’t know. We have a friend at the shore.</p>

<p>MOTHER: They had a lot of damage from Sandy so I wouldn’t ask.</p>

<p>FATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s nothing at the Altrusa that they have availability?</p>

<p>FATHER: There might be something coming up. We did go to a Altrusa silly dinner the other day and took Morgan with us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s just that I think you two – I’m so glad it’s not what it was last time we met, but I still think we need to have a way where you’re not assaulted by Gordon’s attitude. [00:48:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 1 I don’t know what to do. And you know – what are we going to do? What am I going to do?</p>

<p>MOTHER: We could just kill Bruce and Billy and just claim temporary insanity.</p>

<p>FATHER: He was supposed to leave the house and get a job at some point. That’s sort of gone by the boards. Dora did an amazing job literally making him a man cave downstairs. It’s so nice down stairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he uses it?</p>

<p>FATHER: He lives down there. That’s his apartment.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But see, he’s cut off all his friends, so nobody comes to visit him anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No social; nothing.</p>

<p>FATHER: Except for Brett.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He seems to think that they’re all in on it, that we’ve been contacted by the FBI and we haven’t. The only two things that stand out to me is somebody put money in Morgan’s account out of the clear blue sky. [00:49:05] I can’t find out who it was. I know when they did it.</p>

<p>FATHER: What if it was Gordon?</p>

<p>MOTHER: He didn’t have that kind of money then. It just appeared in Morgan’s account. There was like $132, but they won’t tell me who made the deposit.</p>

<p>FATHER: That’s weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ever tell Morgan?</p>

<p>MOTHER: No because I’m his legal guardian and his mother so the thing reads [Dora Sodoti for Custophodo A. Sodoti.] (sp?) That’s how his bank account reads. He has an ATM card or a debit card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They won’t tell you who made the deposit?</p>

<p>MOTHER: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interesting.</p>

<p>MOTHER: And the other odd thing – what was the other odd thing that I said was out of the ordinary and I didn’t understand why it happened?</p>

<p>FATHER: I’m not sure, Dora. [00:50:00]</p>

<p>MOTHER: Those are the only two odd things that lead me to believe somebody is watching us. We do have a lot of planes and helicopters flying over our house.</p>

<p>FATHER: Gordon has got us paranoid with that and all his dangers a plane. He goes out on the terrace and “that’s Bruce Jeffries’ father trying to crash his plane into us” fear. Meanwhile, I get on the terrace and I want to do positive, “Oh, it’s a new comet. The Pleiades is having falling stars and whatever.” I just want to live life.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah. We were going to get up at 5:00 and watch a meteor shower and we were both so exhausted we forgot to wake up. Then ten minutes later I got my first of the 300 texts I get a day from Emily and my fingers are killing me from texting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she fighting you being so upset all the time?</p>

<p>FATHER: Constantly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she was so healthy for so long.</p>

<p>MOTHER: She was, but it just got to her. 2 She was, but it just got to her. [00:51:05] The idiot just up and abandoned her.</p>

<p>FATHER: Supposedly because of his IRS problems and he didn’t want her involved.</p>

<p>MOTHER: But he won’t deal with them.</p>

<p>FATHER: So he lives in his father’s house now.</p>

<p>MOTHER: And his father is in North Carolina so the house is empty.</p>

<p>FATHER: And I think there’s still, if you’ll excuse the expression, “fuck buddies.” You’ve heard that term?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Friend with benefits.</p>

<p>FATHER: All right. I’m sorry. That’s a little crude, but you know what I’m saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MOTHER: That’s from the ‘80s.</p>

<p>FATHER: I think Walter should be venerated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know whether we should call Morgan back in just to check in with him because he was just devastated. He was [pulsing . . . ] (ph?)</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah, he’s frustrated.</p>

<p>FATHER: Get him in. Sure. Okay, the last thing on this topic before – what do I do about this drinking issue?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unless I’m mistaken, it’s getting a little better. </p>

<p>FATHER: We only buy one bottle for her. [00:52:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it should be in moderation.</p>

<p>MOTHER: There was moderation yesterday.</p>

<p>FATHER: Yeah, it was just one and it stuck in the . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: I ran and packed my bag and we decided that we’re going to stick this out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you can’t do moderation, then what about going to the meetings? It’s got to be either it’s real or it’s not.</p>

<p>FATHER: Thank you, Walter. It’s got to be that way, a small Chianti up in the room, only when we’re together. Don’t be going up there by yourself and doing this, okay?</p>

<p>MOTHER: I didn’t last night. (pause) You’re right. We need to get away.</p>

<p>FATHER: We have to get away.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Alone.</p>

<p>FATHER: Yeah, that, too. But I would be worried about . . . I think Morgan should go to Emily’s. Do you know what I mean? Gordon would love it; the house by himself. Of course, we’ll come back to 40 ashtrays filled with cigarettes. [00:53:01]</p>

<p>MOTHER: And a sink full of dishes and a filthy floor and he won’t take his shoes off. My God. There’s no way I can just terminate the Rankas and get . . .</p>

<p>FATHER: Look, Dora, you have to stop being involved in that. You’re feeding into it every time you listen to him and comment and give him credence. Don’t you see that? You need to just say, “Look, Gordon, I don’t . . . “</p>

<p>MOTHER: Today I was less agreeable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn’t really need to meet. He’s upset, but he thought there was no purpose for him to . . . </p>

<p>FATHER: He’d done it. He’d pretty much shot his wad, excuse the French. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wish I had some good advice, other than the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, just to get a sense of support. [00:54:03] I don’t have much to offer you on the fact that you have a son who is disturbed and needs meds and is healthy enough that he can just squeak by without meds and would probably benefit tremendously from meds. I can see the limbo we’re in.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I could see him getting better with the Abilify.</p>

<p>FATHER: But he’s not an unintelligent person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh, no.</p>

<p>FATHER: And he knows how to go on the Internet and look for all the negative side effects and – boom – he can legitimately tell us, “Don’t you see what this does? No, I’m not taking that.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there’s no holistic stuff that’s even considered.</p>

<p>MOTHER: For paranoid schizophrenia?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>FATHER: See I think the best thing is to get him in an environment where he meets new people and new friends and starts to maybe meet a girl.</p>

<p>MOTHER: And then the stupid company he used to work for made him sign a non-compete clause. Then they screwed him over so I say blow off the non-compete clause. Go to another detective agency if you like this so much. [00:55:06] “No, I can’t do that to them because if Tim gets rolling even though he’s a son of a bitch, that takes away the livelihoods of all of these people and their families and then it goes back to the savior complex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How far does the non-compete clause go? How many miles?</p>

<p>MOTHER: That’s a good question. I didn’t think about miles. I only thought about timeframes.</p>

<p>FATHER: What? I’m sorry. I missed . . ?</p>

<p>FATHER: The non-compete clause.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes non-competes are miles. It’s going to be a 25-mile radius or it might be that he could actually . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: I thought it was more a length of time.</p>

<p>FATHER: The thing is he needs to get a job, a life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But he would actually be able to get a job in this area. He’s good at whatever this is.</p>

<p>FATHER: That’s a very good point.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He’s awesome at it. He’s incredible.</p>

<p>FATHER: That’s a very good legal point. Usually non-competes are for a period of time and/or for a geographical location. </p>

<p>MOTHER: I didn’t think about geography. I only thought about length of time.</p>

<p>FATHER: I’m sure he’ll say . . . I’ll ask him. [00:56:04]</p>

<p>MOTHER: Stew negated that when . . . I think the whole contract was negated when Tim got into bed with Bruce.</p>

<p>FATHER: How?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Gordon went to his boss with all this information thinking that this kid is a serial killer – and I don’t doubt that he could be because I caught him with his tongue in my daughter’s mouth when she was 11, so he’s a sleaze. I warned him then not to screw with my daughter because I’ll screw with you back big time. And then he has no follow-through.</p>

<p>FATHER: Would you not scare Walter please? Don’t scare him.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He knows what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I know what you mean. So at this point, what if we all took the position that you have the legal right to work? You’re good at this. We have to find a way for you to not be able to be held to this non-compete clause. What if your energy went into supporting? Just so we have an alternate position. [00:57:06]</p>

<p>FATHER: So when we say that it will be like, “I need to take care of this thing. I need this to resolve itself.”</p>

<p>MOTHER: This has to be over. </p>

<p>FATHER: It’s always an excuse for not getting [ ] (inaudible at 00:57:18). Do you know what I mean? It’s like he’s working without pay to protect our family.</p>

<p>MOTHER: “I can’t work. I have to lay low.” Like he’s in witness protection. Witness protection is fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he’s doing it and he doesn’t deserve a day off ever?</p>

<p>FATHER: Of course he does. He won’t give himself one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you took that position, “We’re worried that we’ll burn you out. We want you to have the day off.”</p>

<p>FATHER: Then it will be the martyr complex. “I can’t take a day off.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously, trying to fight crazy logic eventually fails. That’s the problem.</p>

<p>FATHER: So what do we do? We try to get away for a day or two?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you carve out time for the sanity of the two of you and for the sanity of Morgan. I think that’s the only thing you can do. [00:58:01]</p>

<p>FATHER: Should we take Morgan with us?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think if you can find a way, like if there’s some Altrusa who says, “Yeah, you can borrow my Pocono place.” Whatever it is; if you have some access to something. I think you need it for your sanity so that it doesn’t feel as though . . </p>

<p>FATHER: The only factor is the cost. We don’t have a lot of money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>FATHER: But we have AAA.</p>

<p>MOTHER: When Devon first abandoned Emily, I stayed with her on a Friday night and then again on a . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that for you?</p>

<p>MOTHER: I missed Casey. And then another four or five days later she was so upset I had to stay with her again. It was okay. We did girly things. We cleaned out a bunch of closets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean in terms of you not feeling so overwhelmed by Gordon. Did it help you?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh God, yeah; but I missed him.</p>

<p>FATHER: Scott, if we had the money we would be gone away a lot, believe me. [00:59:02]</p>

<p>MOTHER: If we had the money I’d be living in Amalfi.</p>

<p>FATHER: I want to take her to Ireland. I want to go back to Brussels. I’d like to go up to Vancouver and hang out. We want to travel. We do.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I’d like to be a Rockette, but I can barely walk.</p>

<p>FATHER: Hopefully we’re going to take Morgan back to Dr. Bingham – when? Next month?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Yeah. The Tuesday before Thanksgiving; and traffic is going to be a bitch. I just realized that.</p>

<p>FATHER: We’ll do that. He’ll have Thanksgiving with us and, hopefully, there will be no issues.</p>

<p>MOTHER: There are always issues.</p>

<p>FATHER: Then we’re just hoping to just drive up to Connecticut, just to drive around and look at the tree and maybe have an inexpensive lunch because Morgan likes that. It’s always nice to be in Connecticut at Christmastime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m just very grateful that the two of you are in a better place. With the drinking, I really mean it. I think that it’s either moderation or it’s addiction. (chuckles) </p>

<p>MOTHER: I can drink in moderation. [01:00:02] You know what it was more than the drinking that night? It was the overwhelming feeling that my four kids were unhappy and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it. I was going to be selfish and go to my room and just sit there, get high with him, sip my wine, smoke my cigarette, and feel sorry for myself. But at least I was going to be alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even that didn’t work. I understand. It all blew up.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It all blew up. I overreacted to the point of “look what I did to my husband that I love.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. I know.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He loves pointing that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. I know.</p>

<p>FATHER: I have to wear these glasses if I appear in public. I have mass on Saturday. I’m nervous about seeing my Altrusa brothers.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It will be okay by Saturday.</p>

<p>FATHER: I mean I don’t have much going for me, Scott, other than the hair, the voice. [01:01:02] Other than that, this is sort of a prop if I can use it. (chuckles) A potential weapon in case Gordon wants me to have a weapon. </p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, yeah. He’s all about canes.</p>

<p>FATHER: The other day he handed out canes. I have a cane collection. Not many people have that. Everywhere we go I would be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s a cool cane.” So he handed out canes to everyone. It’s my own personal cane now.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He showed us how to use them as weapons of mass destruction, where to hit to get the most for your value. My God, if he’s right and we are in danger – then shit.</p>

<p>FATHER: I don’t want to keep persevering on this, but he ties this in even to the Bible. Where is it? What passage?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Oh, he’s quoting Revelations now.</p>

<p>FATHER: You see what I’m saying, Walter?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trust me, I believe you entirely. Do not question that.</p>

<p>FATHER: You know what? It made me happy he was looking at the Bible, but holy cow. He’s looking at Revelations and end of the world things.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He did go to mass with us last month. [01:02:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it just sounds so incredibly scary to have him slipping like this. </p>

<p>FATHER: I’m worried he’s going to just go over the edge and stab us all. That’s what I worry about. </p>

<p>MOTHER: He’s got such a savior complex that I’m surprised he beat the shit out of me the other night. He said, “I have to restrain you,” and hit me right here eight different times as hard as he could. And then I tripped and I was on the floor and he kicked me in the ribs twice.</p>

<p>FATHER: But you have to realize that she was threatening me throughout the whole time.</p>

<p>MOTHER: He kept saying that this is restraining you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has he ever said anything afterwards about “this is something that I do not want to be doing?”</p>

<p>MOTHER: (sniggers) No. He thought he was perfectly in the right, restraining me.</p>

<p>FATHER: I kept saying, “Gordon, don’t hit her.” And I’m bruised and all. This physical violence has got to stop.</p>

<p>MOTHER: It’s over. [01:03:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s the line that can’t be crossed.</p>

<p>FATHER: Have I shown you this? I’ve shown you this before.</p>

<p>MOTHER: I said I was sorry.</p>

<p>FATHER: I know, but skippy, what . . . </p>

<p>MOTHER: If you hadn’t had those damn coke-bottle glasses on it wouldn’t have happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Should we take a look at when we can get together?</p>

<p>FATHER: I wish I’d brought my calendar. I don’t have it.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Don’t worry. We’ll all remember.</p>

<p>FATHER: If there is a problem we’ll call you or text you.</p>

<p>HERAPIST: What if we say two weeks, because I’m [here again] (ph?) in two weeks anyway.</p>

<p>FATHER: All right. If you can stand us and you don’t need more time between sessions, Walter.</p>

<p>MOTHER: What’s two weeks?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: November the 7th at 3:00 PM?</p>

<p>MOTHER: Eleven-seven.</p>

<p>FATHER: And I hope this Affordable Care Act something can happen about your care.</p>

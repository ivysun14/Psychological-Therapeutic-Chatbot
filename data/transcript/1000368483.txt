<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) When I left yesterday I remember feeling or thinking I was relieved because now I could stop thinking about all the, I don't know.  I almost felt as if I were making myself think about the fact that I feel angry.  And, well, I can hardly even make myself think about it today to even say what I was thinking about yesterday.  (Pause) I just started thinking about, uhm, a frog we have at school that was getting very thin and we started trying to feed it worms today and had, and sort of had some fun doing it.  And I just began thinking about that, which seems to me escaping from thinking about anything else.</p>

<p>And there is something else in my mind, which just came to my mind after I started talking about — well, it's slightly different but it is another aspect of making, feeling that there's something very antagonistic in my feelings.  (Pause) Because a friend of mine called last night asking us if we could join them this Saturday.  And, uhm, we have introduced them to another couple that are friends of ours.  And the girl of, the, the girl that called me made it very obvious that she was going to pursue this acquaintance.  And that always upset me and I, I couldn't quite figure out why except that for some reason I was very jealous of the fact that those 2 couples might become friends now, probably worrying that it would then exclude us.  And when she invited MSCZ and me to join them she mentioned that some other people would be there and that she'd ask this couple.  And I think I almost would have refused to go because I do have to get a lot of work done this weekend but hearing that the other couple was there made me say yes.  Almost like I couldn't risk not being there.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are any of these people you've mentioned or referred to before?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I almost think I referred to this particular situation before but perhaps I've just thought about it.  (Pause) And one other time when we were with, uhm, one of the couples, we ran into the other while we were bicycling in the park.  And so we were all together for a while.  And I almost seemed to be looking for (clears throat violently) things that I hoped each couple would find to criticize in the other one so that they could find fault with each other.  Or at least, have one couple find fault with the other.  And then that would make me feel more secure.  I guess that it's just I was afraid or am afraid that they're both more interesting couples and individuals and once they know each other then th—, they won't really have any need to know me anymore or any desire to.  And it sort of (clears throat) parallels how I feel about being with people in general, that I so often have to be with people alone and I, I feel very uncomfortable when very many more come.  Because then it makes me feel competitive.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I was just thinking about how you looked when I came in today.  And I just have had a, a very mixed feeling about saying it or talking about it because in a way it, I didn't take it personally today.  Or I was looking at you to see how you were reacting to me because I wanted to take it personally but then when I saw the way you looked, I didn't take it personally.  And somehow it bothers me that I didn't now.  And I almost feel that — perhaps I still did take it personally but I feel as if I looked at you with an ability to see how you look more objectively than I sometimes can.  And then I sort of distrust myself and wonder, I, I sort of feel as if, well, that means I'm feeling nice towards you so I'm being nice to you.  And so I'm trying to appease you for some reason.  And so at first I didn't want to say anything because it's very hard for me to be nice in that way.  And then I talked myself around so I wasn't going to say anything because then I'd be avoiding this trap of pretending to be nice when I really wasn't.  I don't know which it is.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You left one thing out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  How you looked.  (Laughs) Well, I felt sort of, well, I don't know what the word would be.  I guess "sympathetic" maybe.  You looked very tired and that, I suppose I was feeling sympathetic or concerned or what, I don't know what word it would be.  But I've been feeling tired so to have somebody else look tired, I feel as if I understand how they feel.  But then that makes me think, well, maybe I am seeing it in a very subjective way.  Since that's how I feel.  (Pause) But I think what was making me uncomfortable about thinking it at first was, assuming you did look tired or are tired, then I was wondering what was making you tired and, I suppose, feeling concern that you were.  And I don't know, just thinking about you in that way upset me.  I think I almost prefer being angry at you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you explain to yourself my seeing, seeming to appear tired.  Or didn't you let yourself think of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I just probably thought — I didn't think about it too much but just, you must have an awful lot to do.  I didn't think in particular what you were doing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Your thoughts, you know, just before you were silent and then said what you just said, you were, you ended up thinking how competitive you felt with the women that you were referring to.  Uhm, could it be any connection at all?  Because you said those things and then you were quiet and then you talk about having noticed especially how I appeared today.   (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I suppose there is but I don't particularly want to admit it.  (Pause) And it always is true that, with either of these couples and I suppose many couples, if the male is enjoying my company then I relax much more then if it's just the female enjoying it.  So I suppose I'm feeling competitive with the women because I'm hoping to attract the attention of the men.  But when I'm thinking about it to myself, I always think in terms of that the 2 women will like each other and exclude me.  And I always think about it in those terms so it just leaves me feeling confused.  (Pause) And when you suggested there might be a connection I was just thinking, well, what does that have to do with having seen, observed how you looked to me.  And it, when you suggested there might be a connection, I immediately thought it's because I want the attention of males and I notice them first, although I pretend to myself I don't. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think while I was growing up or whenever I was handling this emotion, I used to be so unsure about what to do with boys that I just convinced myself that I really didn't care about them or that they weren't any more important than how I thought about girls.  And, and at least through high school and most of college, I sort of withdrew from having to handle relationships with boys.  And even now I think I do.  And it almost seems as if, when I can get along with a male, it can affect me more, making me more, feel more relaxed than if I happen to get along with a female but if I'm not getting along with males or if I'm feeling afraid of trying so I withdraw, then that can affect how I get along with females.  And it, I don't know, not that I feel that good about a lot of my relationship, ships with females but somehow I just f—, I feel as if I can handle them if I really wanted to, if I really want to be with people. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I know one thing I've had to practically tell myself over and over again is that men aren't different from women in that they, they're people too.  Because I used to always think there was some secret to getting along with men and I didn't know it.  And it was something that had nothing to do with getting along with women.  It was like women and men were 2 entirely different things.  And I can even remember in high school when I began to want to get along with boys and to have a boyfriend and so forth, asking my father how a girl should be with a boy and trying to ask him questions so I could understand.  (Pause) Or I think I just wanted to hear more about relationships between boys and girls or his experience or something so I could realize there wasn't anything special and that you could relax and just be yourself. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>My thoughts just jumped to — I don't know whether it was first thinking about how I relate to some women, but I just started thinking about my supervisor and a talk I had with her today, when we were both giving ideas to a certain problem.  And it made me feel that this is one of the few times that I've worked with somebody who's superior to me, anyway, that I felt I was cooperating, that I could cooperate, that I wasn't either having to withdraw and let her direct or be offensive about it and take over.  And this particular angle of it is on my mind, I imagine, because I'm working on reports on the children now.  And I'm thinking about how well they cooperate.  And it just made me realize, so often I have felt, in working with people, that when I have an idea it's got to be followed and I can't stand it if it isn't.  And if I know it might not be or it might be changed, then I feel I just have to withdraw.  And that seems to explain this inability I've ever had to, I don't know, participate, I guess.  I've always found I either have to lead or completely follow.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I began thinking again about my reaction to men.  And it just occurred to me, something that happened the other day, that, uhm, sort of is an example of how I react generally.  I was coming upstairs from lunch and I heard some people in the faculty room.  It's not a time I usually go in but they obviously having a good time.  And the only thing that kept me from going in there was the fact that it was mostly men in there.  And I knew I'd feel very uncomfortable coming in because I somehow have this idea that, well, the conversation is somewhat different but I somehow have this feeling that I don't know what's expected when it's a conversation with a lot of men and I might not meet the expectations.  But yet, on the other hand, very often it's a much easier situation for me.  It just, again, seems to be a very confusing thing.  Because the men sort of will carry the ball and I can just kind of be passive.  And I suppose that's why it seems easier.  So that would make me be afraid of it because then I'm thinking about participating. (Silence)</p>

<p>I began thinking again about this party we'll be going to and just worrying about whether I'd handle myself enough so that these mutual friends would want to continue to have me for a friend.  And also I was thinking about another party of this couple's we went to.  And there were some, to me, strange people there.  I didn't know how to approach them at all because they just looked upon things very differently than I did.  And it made me feel uncomfortable.  And I began thinking, then, just about that and wondering if I would find sort of socializing at this party awfully uncomfortable.  (Pause) I feel as if I'm sort of at a dead end.  And all I can think is that I'm just afraid and everywhere I look there's something that I'm afraid of.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, maybe you could go back to, ah, again, what you, what you felt ah, when you looked at me and thought I was tired.  You said that you began to feel some concern but you'd rather feel that than feel — but you'd almost rather feel angry than to feel concerned?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you didn't say what the concern was about or, I mean, what form that took or — you dropped that.  What does it bring to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that I, I think of being tired as being — or as tired or as concerned as you looked, an unhappy situation to be in and that I don't like feeling that way.  And I was going to say I felt sorry for you but it's not, that's not quite right in how I felt.  Because that implies pity in a way that I don't think it was.  But all just wishing you didn't have to feel that way, whatever the way was you were feeling.  (Pause) And it was well, almost, when I reacted I really cared whether you were feeling tired or not.  And I don't often care how other people are feeling that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, why does that frighten you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because I don't usually feel that.  (Pause) Or else, because if I'm going to feel it, I should feel it for other people that I know better.  (Pause) Because I think I have felt this sometimes for MSCZ.  But sometimes when he's under a lot of pressure and working awfully hard I don't think I really feel concern for him.  I, I'm too busy, if it's at times when I'm quite pressed too then I'm so busy thinking about myself that I don't think about him except sort of, well, he's got to get through it and I've got to get through it.  And, but there's not that what, again I don't know what, sympathy or whatever the word is that I'm looking for.  And it's, if I do feel it for him, it's rare and it usually has to be at times when I'm not under any kind of pressure.  Which is another thing, I suppose, that made me feel sort of strange about feeling it for you besides not knowing you very well, is — or knowing you at all, is, uhm, right now I am feeling under pressure so I would have expected I'd just be thinking about myself.  (Pause) And if my emotions or whatever they are start doing strange things then I suppose I'm afraid, well, what will they do next?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And what comes to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) 2 things do.  One is something I've, I didn't understand exactly when I started but I've been afraid of ever since I started coming.  And that is the saying that is passed around that when people or when women have psychoanalysis they fall in love with their analyst.  And the other thing that comes to mind is that I'll make you into some kind of a father figure that sort of answers needs that I have.  (Pause) And in both cases, as soon as I think these things I think they're ridiculous because it's such a one way thing.  It's me feeling it and there's absolutely no response from you in any way.  So that seems ridiculous that I could feel any of these things.  And yet I'm afraid of it.  Especially when I feel something like today, which is — well, I don't know.  I was trying to think how, how much I've ever felt that kind of concern before or for what kinds of people and it does seem that it's for people who mean a lot to me, if I feel it at all.  And I don't know how else to put it, but that it seems very unrealistic for you to mean a lot to me, for me to be able to feel that.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And it just struck me that this kind of concern I felt might be something that a person could feel for many people.  And it, the fact that I don't makes me feel very inadequate.  It's funny, when I think about so many times after the day when you made the comment that I had put myself into a corner, I don't recall now what it was about, but whatever the emotion is, whether I'm feeling frustrated or angry or afraid or anything, it seems like I do this with myself, I talk to myself so that either way I look there's something wrong and, and, or guilt, I guess that was it.  Or I sort of box myself in.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is the box here that on the one had you want to be able to feel concern but on the other hand, that if you do, you'll feel vulnerable?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  For you or for people generally?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, both.  But it seems to me —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  Yeah, I think that's it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Perhaps here especially.  You made a similar kind of a comment, eh, had an orgasm with MSCZ, you felt what you called soft.  And that also left you feeling vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I thought of that today too or a similar weakness, when I didn't want to tell you about these thoughts.  I compared it to the same feeling of not wanting to talk about having enjoyed intercourse.  It's, there's something participating again.  (Pause) It just seems fantastic to me that I don't feel I've been sort of pulling points but I've used these words in such different ways today and they do seem to be all connected.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time is up.</p>

<p>(background noise until 00:00:25)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you guys doing?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Bad week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bad week? What's been going on?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess I can just go in chronological order.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Some are worse than others. (pause) So I guess the first thing - I was at work one night and I got a text from him that said his friend Scott was in our area and that we should go see him because he was in our area. So I get home and he's getting ready and I asked if - that guy's name is Scott - I asked if his girlfriend was there (pause) and he said no. So I said, "Okay, I'll just stay home. I don't really want to hang out with you and your guy friend. No big deal." So he says, "Fine." And then while he's out I'm thinking why is Scott just by himself at a bar right next to our house? It's a little odd. So I asked him when he got back and he said, "Yeah, he was just there by himself." So long story short it turns out that he (pause) actually made plans with Peter to meet up. That's why he was at the bar. So it wasn't just that Scott was in the north end and we should go see him. He had to go see him already. He made those plans and the text was just misleading me to believe that he was around coincidentally so we should go see him so he had to go. [00:01:47]</p>

<p>And I don't have a problem with him going to see his friends or hanging out with them and leaving me at home or leaving me at work. (pause) I don't know why there was that little white lie there. There was no reason for it to be there. So it's just something that is like a red flag to me. Now there's doubt when he says things. (pause) Like I just...there was just no reason for it so I was very bothered by it and he just kind of brushes it off like (pause) "No big deal. Get over it. Don't read more into it." (pause) So that was incident (ph) number one. (pause) Should I just go straight through them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:02:31]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) Then he told me a few days ago that he went swimming at this pond near his parent's house (pause) which is normal so that ended that conversation. And then a few days later he says out of the blue, "So just in case it comes up that day that I went swimming..." this girl receptionist at his hair salon went with him. (pause) So I was completely caught off guard and was just in shock that he wouldn't tell me something like that beforehand. And I don't know this girl. I've never heard her name. I didn't know she existed, never seen her, didn't know they text each other back and forth and this is how they met up. [00:03:25]</p>

<p>(pause) So he said that she just invited herself and he kind of went along with it. And I said, "Well how could you not tell me about it?" And he said something like, "You were at work." Like he couldn't send me a text message or something or try calling me. (pause) And then I said, "Well how could you just keep that in and not tell me for three days and now just tell me?" And he says, "Well because...it didn't come up." But it did come up when he told me he went swimming at the pond and just didn't finish the sentence "with someone else." And I know if it was the other way around he would be livid and so my mind is running like a million miles an hour thinking why did he lie about this girl? What else is he lying about? I didn't know he actually lies to me. [00:04:22]</p>

<p>(pause) And I think the worst part...it's not even when he tells me nothing happened with the girl and she's just a girl from the town. She invited herself and whatever, no big deal, I believe in that he didn't care whether she was there or not and I don't have any trust issues as far as his fidelity goes but I can't get over this feeling of sadness that he didn't, when she invited herself and he knew they were going to go to the other, he didn't feel (crying) in the pit of his stomach guilty that he didn't ask me if it was okay or guilty that he didn't tell me. Because the only time that I've ever gone out with a guy since we've been here in New Haven was two guys at work and the second I found out they were going out for drinks and I wanted to go out because I don't have any friends here I wrote to him. "Some guys are going out for drinks. Do you mind if I go with them?" Like it wasn't that I was going and I just had to tell him. I made sure he was okay with it. And I think he knew it would of have been a little weird to me if he said he was going swimming during the day with some girl I don't know, I've never heard of, and they're not really friends and then why are the texting each other? How many other girls is he texting? Now I'm just thinking of a million things. What else does he do behind my back that he doesn't tell me about? Why is it so easy for him to lie to me? How come he didn't feel that feeling of feeling bad? How come there was no guilt involved and he didn't tell me until three days later? [00:06:02]</p>

<p>(pause) That's that. And then the following day, or two days later, although extremely immature made me feel a little better, I got called in to work and I told him I was on call that day. So I got called in to work and I didn't text him that I got called in. I just went to work. And I felt like shit about it because I would never have done that. I always text him where I am, who I'm with, and what I'm doing. (crying) I literally had to take a few breaks from work. I told my manager I was having a really bad day. I took a few breaks away from people so I could just have a quick cry and then get back to work. I just felt off because I knew I was doing it on purpose. If he wasn't going to do that for me - tell me where he was and what he was doing and who he was with - then I don't feel the need to do it for him. (crying) [00:07:05]</p>

<p>So I went to work, I got a bunch of mixed texts from him, and I was working so I just didn't check my phone and I didn't want to check my phone anyways. (chuckle) So when I finished I got all his texts and I wrote him back, "Yeah I got called in to work and now I'm going out for drinks with a few people." And two people at work wanted to go for drinks so I went with them because I just didn't want to go home anyways. And then he asked me, "Who are you going with?" and I wrote back, "People from work." And he wrote back, "Yeah obviously. What are their names?" And I just didn't write back. At that point I had put my phone away and I didn't want to answer any more questions anyways. So at the end of the night I saw [his phone] (ph) had asked what their names were and I just didn't care and walked home. And at that point we were broken down and he didn't want to talk. He was obviously upset and I just felt like if he wasn't going to give me that then I don't feel the need to do it for him anymore. And that's just not how you're supposed to be thinking at all. You should probably just fix the problem and then move on instead of immaturely...two wrongs don't make a right. [00:08:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) So it feels for you at least Melanie that something is breaking down between the two of you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling the same way about it Peter?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Something is definitely breaking down. I don't know that that outline of the story is the sign of it but it's been breaking down before that. This is kind of a new issue that has come up. We haven't really had an issue like the trust thing before or at least she hasn't. (pause) But I don't see it exactly the same way, or even close, to the way that she sees it. But I don't know where we're going in this session if I should sit and tell my side of the story or where do you think we should go here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wherever...however...I want to sort of just see what unfolds and I'm usually most helpful that way so whatever you want to...if you want to address what Melanie is saying or talk more about what you feel is breaking down. [00:09:18]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think I'll address what she just said but I think that the bigger issue is (pause) the last part of it. I mean (pause) the one that she just streamed over in the end is that (pause) what she did...she has a history and she knows that I want to know where she is. There's a big reason for it that came up recently. She tends to make friends with guys much quicker than women and she tends to like to hang out with guys. It's...the reason I asked who she was with was that the last time that she went out with guys from work - she works at a restaurant - so she went out with a few waiters and hung out and (pause) on her way home, it's a long story, but on her way home this guy who she just met up with five minutes before the night was over walked her down the street to the house and then outside the window tried to make out with her (pause) which she obviously didn't let him make out but it wasn't like a shocking slap in the face or "Go away" or whatever. It was like, "Oh you're drunk. Go home." [00:10:49]</p>

<p>So it was (pause)...needless to say that stirred up a lot of trust issues and after that I just don't really...I wanted to know where she was and who she was with because it's an issue of safety and trust and everything else. So she knew that not answering at all would be (pause) basically a way to get revenge for me not telling her that a girl went swimming the day I went swimming, or not telling her immediately after or before. So I think without going into all the other my side of the story of what she just said, that's the issue that we keep having is the way that we deal with things. And (pause) it's out of spite and it's not like...I completely apologized and admitted that I was wrong and that I should have told her ahead of time. I had my own reasons probably why I didn't feel that guilt or driving force to tell her and it goes far back to the way that she casually feels like she can just hang out with guys like it's the same thing as hanging out with girls and it's not a big deal. [00:12:19]</p>

<p>So (pause) that's why I didn't but the point is, in not telling her, the way that she fixed that is not accepting my apology and trying to move on and maybe we can do better at that. It's "I'm going to show him" and then just doesn't answer me at all. (pause) And then when we get home, instead of addressing that issue, she said she wanted to talk and I said, "I'll be home at 9." I had to go to work and then right after the gym I would be there. And then the way that she brings up conversation, we sit in silence. We don't talk and then I asked her if she wanted to talk and the thing that she brings up is (pause) a completely related issue. She asked me how work was that day which is just unnatural and (pause) waits for me to say that I worked in New Haven and when she hears that she acts all surprised and starts a fight with me about the fact that I didn't leave my car key with her when I didn't need it. (pause) And meanwhile the elephant in the room is the issue that we need to deal with that just happened and she wants to fight about some minor sub-issue that she knows that (pause) is not even close to what needs to happen. It was just frustrating so I didn't even entertain it. I was frustrated. [00:13:47]</p>

<p>(pause) As far as going to the other stuff that she was talking about (pause) like I said (pause) she does usually tell me where she's going and who she's hanging out with, however, it isn't like a "I'm telling you to make sure you're comfortable" thing. It's she knows that I'm not comfortable when she goes to hang out with especially guys from her restaurant, stuff like that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Once (pause) - before this continues - I hung out with them once. I haven't hung out with guys in two months since I don't know anyone here. (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Two guys from work? (chuckle) Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible) casually hang out with guys and that's why you didn't tell me because you casually hang out with girls like it's okay. Like, it's been once. In two months, it's been once. [00:14:45]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, so the guy that tried to make out with you in front of our house you only hung out with five minutes that night because you walked him to the corner.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That was the only time you ever hung out with him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) With...are you talking about Dwayne and that night that I was with your friends and him?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, so she's classifying hanging out with my friends and him as she was walking out of a restaurant going to the cigar room with him and my friends just happened to appear on the street.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's not true. That's not true. Why do you keep changing the story?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay did I interrupt you when I was talking?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You're just lying.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. (pause) It's not even...it's also a history of that she always hangs out with guys anyways. What's new? All of her friends from up there...a lot of her friends from Montana...she's from Helena. She has friends that she goes and hangs out with up there, friends in law school. I don't have a problem with it. I mean, I do, she knows that I do, but it's something that I'm willing to kind of adjust and accept. (pause) But I lost trust with the types of guys - not to stereotype - but the people that are waiting at a restaurant, I just don't (pause) like their motives. I don't know if... [00:16:06]</p>

<p>(pause) I guess what I have trouble coping with is I know that Melanie has a good intuition on (pause) feeling out what guys' intentions are. She's adept in it and I know right away what they are in some of those cases and she tends to maybe fool herself. I don't think it's malicious but act as though, "Yeah we're just hanging out. We're friends. They like my personality and it's all comfortable." But I don't see it that way. I think that's why there's a little bit of a trust issue. It's like I have to decide whether it's her (pause) not be realizing it which is hard for me to accept or it's just a way that she's comfortable at being in a relationship...or having friends that are guys that feel that she's an attractive woman. If she ever gave them any type of sign in a second they would be pursuing her. But as long as she's in control and she keeps it in check then everything is fine. (pause) That whole arrangement just bothers me. [00:17:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has this been an issue throughout your relationship, at least from your end?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: A little, a little bit. It's not a huge issue. It is something that just pecks every few months or something. It arises. It's not always there. It's not (pause) a huge reason for breakdown. The breakdown is the way that we handle things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah one thing that I was thinking is issues of trust come on when people don't feel like they have...they're secure in their relationship. When people feel secure in their relationship (pause) typically these are not concerns. So clearly I would imagine both of you are feeling that way.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well issues of trust came up because he lied to me and mislead me this week. I don't have trust issues with him. I have girlfriends who go through their boyfriends' phone, hack into their Facebook, read their e-mails. I would never want to be like that. I would never want to not trust him. I don't want to doubt him when he tells me something. I don't want to be that girl that feels like I need to sneak into his phone when he's not looking and (pause) after this week's events I'm just angry because I don't want to look through his phone but that's how I feel right now. I feel like I don't trust him. Whatever he tells me could be a lie. I don't know what else he's lied about. Like my mind is going to a million different places that I don't ever want it going to and I always said I'm not going to be with someone if I don't trust them. It's just a waste and I don't not trust him because our relationship is breaking down. I don't trust him because of specific events that happened. As much as he wants to talk about me having guy friends, yeah I have an equal amount of male friends and female friends, both from law school in Maine and back home. When I go home I hang out with my next door neighbor who's a guy a lot. We grew up together but the majority of my time is spent with my close girlfriends. I'm very close to my girlfriends back home. [00:19:24]</p>

<p>So it's being spun a little bit differently but regardless of that it's just all avoiding the fact that he lied to me about hanging out with a girl. And if I can't get over it it's because I'm dwelling on it. I'm just not accepting his apology and I'm dwelling on it. Forget the fact that my mind has a million things in it right now and I'm wondering how come he didn't feel guilty about lying? It's not because I have so many guy friends and I casually hang out with them all the time. It's happened once. (sigh)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't understand why you say that. It hasn't happened once.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What are you talking about? </p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You hang out with guy friends. You've done it the whole time we've been together.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We're talking about New Haven, since we've been here and I have zero friends here!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Why are we talking about New Haven? Why would that be zeroed in? I don't understand. We've lived here two months.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, and in the past two months I've gone out once with guys and it's only because I work with all guys! (chuckle)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We're talking about the last two years.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay so when are all the times I go out with guys? Who...what guys? My best friends are Miranda, Kelly, and Penelope. Will? Bernie? Guys that I hang out with...you know them! It's like you can't compare that to you lying to me about hanging out with a girl that I don't know. I've never heard of before. You're texting her behind my back. That's completely different than him knowing who my friends are and that I'm out with them. [00:20:45]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's not any different from the guy you hung out with at the restaurant, the two or three guys you hung out with at the restaurant. I didn't know them. I've never met them before.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right but what did I do? I sent you a text and said they're going out.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...until he's trying to make out with you outside our house.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, that's obviously all my fault. He wants to blame me for that. But what did I do the night that I went out with those guys? Did I not text you saying, "These guys are going out tonight. Do you mind if I go with them?" (pause) I gave you the decency (pause) to tell you where I was. I told you exactly which bar I was going to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You're right and I said that. And that's great but you don't actually care if I'm comfortable with it. You just...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right because had you said no I obviously wouldn't have gone. </p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...check your luck.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you not feel that's true?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Melanie is saying that she wants you to be comfortable with it and that's sort of what would dictate. Do you not feel that's true?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not at all. I feel that she does it (pause) to basically inform me but if I'm not comfortable and I say no it's going to be very awkward and a big deal. I would just...I have to just put up with it. [00:21:53]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well it's going to bother me if he says no. I think that's normal. But I still, had he said no to me, I wouldn't have gone out to spite him. I would have gone home and I would have been upset, naturally, (pause) but that doesn't mean I don't care about whether he's comfortable with it or not. There are plenty of things I have not done because he's not comfortable with them. (pause) I haven't seen or spoken to the guy at work who tried to make out with me that night and I would never, ever, go out with him again, which I'm sure (pause) Peter would not give me the benefit of the doubt of and probably thought I was maybe with him the other night and that's why he was upset when I didn't tell him who I was with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not even...I don't know why you would even think that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well because you brought it up when you said I wouldn't tell you the names of the people I was with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I didn't think you were with him. I just figured you were with some other guy at work.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So why do you want to know their names? [00:22:45]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because I'm... (pause)...I always want to know...I have an issue with security at work as a private detective. When I was in the military I was in the Rangers in the army and I always liked to (pause) make sure first. There are issues of trust, things like that, there's jealousy. I'm not saying none of those are an issue but I always want to make sure that she's safe and that other day there is a sign that this guy that she walked home with is extremely sketchy. (pause)</p>

<p>I've talked to a friend of mine that works with the New Haven Police and stuff like that...the crew that he is with is also kind of sketchy. Enough said, it's not a good environment and it brings issues of (pause) like I was saying, what is Melanie's motive? How does she assess this situation and think it's a good idea? And I have to wonder is she (pause) blind to all of these situations and threats? I mean, she's attracted to the bad boy type of person...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh my God. Are you fucking serious?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...anyway (pause) and this guys is just, he prides himself on being (pause) like a Spanish gangster type of person. And she, up until when I saw that happening - which another issue is that she never would have told me about it had I not have seen it - this guy was like her...the coolest guy at work that she could hang out with and talk to, that she related to the most. And (pause) he goes to the cigar bar next door every night so I don't know, you said it's been once so she's hung out with him one time after this...before this night. But it's the only guy that has been described to me as somebody who she likes at work. [00:25:08]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's not true. (pause) Sergio the Serbian kid on the block (ph) guy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, but this is my perspective.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But you're lying! It's not true!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm not lying. It's just those...whatever the impression that I got from your description of those people, that was really like blurb, blurb, and this was like paragraphs of a description.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you concerned that Melanie is putting herself in situations where she's not safe or are you concerned that Melanie wants to cheat on you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think she wants to cheat on me. I just think that she (pause) puts herself in situations where she's in control of exactly how that... (pause) The motive isn't to cheat. It's just the questionable circumstances. Why does she need that? I don't know if it's the male attention or if it's just she (pause) needs to be able to...she relates better to guys in certain circumstances. I don't know. [00:26:20]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I can solve that puzzle for you. It's because I moved to New Haven to be with Peter. I know zero people here. It's miserable and I am dying for someone to hang out with me after work or just have a drink, do something, anything, and he was the waiter that trained me so he was the person I had the most interaction with my first week at work. So naturally when (chuckle) I'm starting to make friends at work, he's the first person that offers. We can go out for a drink or we can hang out and he knows about my boyfriend. Everyone at my work does. There are no female waitresses there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: See this one quick thing is that (pause) right there. It's neither here nor there. "He knows about my boyfriend." (pause) I've described the guy. I don't know how far I need to go into detail. I know that he doesn't give a shit that she has a boyfriend.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, we know that now because he tried to make out with me. [00:27:14]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. (pause) I'm pretty sure that would have been my assessment from the beginning. What I wonder is why doesn't she get that from people? This guy is a scumbag. Why doesn't she realize that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because like he said...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Or does she not want to...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...I can be in control of a situation if I want to. If he does come on to me like he did, I push him away and tell him to go home. Then Peter opened the door and I walked inside. To me (pause) yeah it sucks that he did that and he's a jerk for trying but it's not going to be the end of the world for me. I've been hit on by guys enough that it doesn't faze me as much anymore. And if I am in control of the situation and I just want to go out and have someone to hang out with...I didn't even spend a night with him. He was at a bar on the corner of my street so when I was walking home from hanging out with the other two guys, he offered to walk me home. I spoke to him for five minutes and he walked me home. (pause) I wasn't even spending time with him. He wasn't like this one person that totally tricked me and he was the closest person I got to at the restaurant. He was just the person I spent the most time with. So I have his cell phone number and he told me he was around the corner so I met up with him. [00:28:25]</p>

<p>Like, (pause) it's just the fact that I'm lonely and that I want people to hang out with and I just happen to work with majority men. So when they all go out for a drink after (pause) that's my only opportunity to have someone to hang out with. (pause) So that night I went out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me ask you, I mean in this way, you guys have very different feelings about the situation. Do you feel - for each of you - do you feel that you understand why the other person is thinking that? Not that you have to agree with it but do you understand why they got to the conclusion they did or do you just think this is nuts?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think she understands why I go to my conclusion (ph).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: See he can't answer for himself. He has to already judge what I'm going to say and think the most negative thing possible and then answer for me because I would have said, "Yes, I understand how he gets to that conclusion." [00:29:21]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So how do I get to it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But that doesn't scream doubt to you? Like there's no faith. There's no trust whatsoever. (pause) I have to prove it to you!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Through our conversations is what I'm basing it off so why don't you just go ahead and answer me?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's frustrating to me. I don't want to have to prove myself. (crying) I want him to take what I'm saying and just believe me and there's...I don't even do the same thing he does. I don't even lie to him! There's no reason why he should have zero faith in me. He hasn't even answered why he's lied about hanging out with that girl. He skips over everything he does. There's no fault in anything, ever. (pause) I don't feel the need to prove anything to him right now. I'm still extremely upset and hurt about what happened and he hasn't taken any ownership for it. He just sees me dwelling on something and that I should get over it. [00:30:21]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>He has caused me to doubt him and no longer trust him. That is a huge problem in a relationship. (crying) It's not just this one incident I need to get over. (pause) And I'm not getting over it. (pause) And he's not addressing it because he doesn't want to.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you asked him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, he just doesn't want me to dwell on it. He said sorry already.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not true at all. I did, I apologized for it. I said I should have let her know ahead of time. I (pause) took complete ownership for it and I never (pause)...that's not even the issue right...that's not (pause)...that was the day before and then you went and you did your revenge scheme afterward.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, so we should just focus on the revenge thing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I mean, we took care of it. I said I'm sorry. I said I would not do that again. I would make sure that I let you know and then I realized the importance of it to you and then the next day there was another issue that we need to talk... [00:31:26]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But that's not the end of it for me. You can't just say sorry and then if I don't get over it I'm dwelling on it. It doesn't work that way! I'm not over it!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Alright so, how many more times are you going to do a revenge scheme and then we'll get to talk more about how sorry I am? I don't understand at all what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you think...did you not tell her because you were worried she wouldn't approve?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She was at work. When I text her at work it's not like...she's usually extremely busy so it's not like I planned to go swimming for the day with her. This isn't like you go to the beach and put down a picnic, stuff like that. This was on my way to my mom's house. I go to this pond. It's where I swim laps, like a half mile back and forth. And she texted saying, "Are you coming into Cheshire?" And the reason she texts is she's a receptionist at my hair salon. The hair salon woman that owns it is coming into the law firm that I work at. She's going through a divorce so she's going to come in and we're going to represent her. So this woman, she will usually make my appointments via her text on her cell phone and then tell the hair salon owner, "This is when Peter is coming in." [00:32:46]</p>

<p>So I was coming in and when I let Abby, the hair salon woman, I let her know that I was going to be in to Cheshire - it's a town my mom lives in - so I was going to get their divorce complete. And so she knew, the receptionist knew, that I was coming in so she said, "Hey you're coming to Cheshire?" And I said, "Yeah, I'm going swimming on my way in." And then she said, "Oh I want to go." And I just didn't say no. I mean, a lot of things probably went through my mind like is this alright to do? And I just kind of thought Melanie hangs out with guys all the time. I don't really think that she'd see it as a big deal. She may not have actually gone...she goes to the beach...in the past she's gone to the beach with guys before and she's intended to her with guys from work. It just didn't pan out for whatever reason. But I don't see it as any big deal. I was going there to swim as exercise. It's not like I said a beach thing. [00:33:55]</p>

<p>So I did it and I didn't text her at work. It just felt a little weird, like, "I'm going with this girl to go swimming." Text her at work just for information. I didn't do that and in hindsight I said okay, I can do that. I apologized for not doing it but I didn't do it at the time. (pause) And that was it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And didn't tell me when you said you went swimming, just implied that you went by yourself, lie about it again?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (pause) You just throw that out there. First of all...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well why did you do that that time? I wasn't at work. I was sitting staring at you. (pause) You said, "I went swimming today at the pond," and didn't say who you were with. Why would you do that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah I...because it was...you two were having a conversation and I said I was going swimming. The conversation went to something else and then I would have had to bring up, "Oh by the way, I was going swimming with that girl." [00:34:52]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Does that sound believable to anyone? Are you serious?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It is believable.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You said, "I went swimming at the pond." You didn't finish the sentence by saying "with someone else."</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The conversation changed so you couldn't tell me anymore?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is how we get to these places where somebody apologizes. I didn't do it, I should have, and it just seemed like an awkward thing to bring up at that time and I didn't realize the importance of it and I did want to make sure that she knew. There was no reason...I didn't need to tell her at all. She would have never found out that I went swimming with someone. I did it because I wanted her to know. In reality my intention was to tell her that night but it just didn't (pause) come out. It was awkward to bring up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well here's the basic problem that (pause) is probably obvious but I'll say it anyway. Neither of you are buying each other's story.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you're not buying (chuckle) each other's story. And I'm not sure how to help you resolve it but certainly that's a pretty core issue and it's not clear how you guys will get on the same page because evidence or trying to explain your point of view doesn't facilitate the other person (chuckle) buying the story. It seems like a justification that makes the story fall apart even more. And (pause) I'm not really sure what's going on to the point, with you guys, to the point that you're like, "I'm not buying this at all." [00:36:18]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well now I just don't...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's true.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just...it's getting worse and worse.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's somewhat in the way that we handle and cope with things, it doesn't mesh. I would say (pause) since the beginning a lot of the way that she handles and copes with things, I sometimes don't buy it. It's true, I don't. It is a core issue. (pause) Because I feel like sometimes it's a masquerade, there's a diversion, things like that. (pause) When that happens I tend to do and revert to the... (pause) maybe the tactics from growing up that I had learned... (pause) Whenever we had an issue or get in trouble as kids - I had three siblings...two siblings including me - we'd get in trouble and we'd have all these elaborate stories about why we weren't guilty and my dad would just sit and listen and he wouldn't even buy any of it. He would just at the end have already known what we did, somehow. [00:37:38]</p>

<p>(pause) And I don't know, sometimes I feel like there's an elaborate story and diversion for her. I don't know. I mean (pause) I don't understand how, after yesterday, when (pause) I came home and we were supposed to talk about this last thing that happened where she went out with whatever people from work and instead she brings up the conversation about how I didn't leave her the car key when I was at work, which I've never done before at all. It was just so odd and she claims I didn't tell her I was going to be working in Boston that day but I did and she went off aggressively about how I'm lying to her and "you never said that before" and everything. I actually remember telling her that that hair salon woman was not going to be able to make it on Monday. She's coming in on Thursday. I told her that in the beginning of the week. She probably maybe doesn't remember that but the point is, she's so adamant on the fact that I never told her that and my schedule is Monday and Friday which is just not true. [00:38:58]</p>

<p>And all that we get tied up in this massive bullshit that has nothing to do with the real issue we have to talk about and I feel like one of her tactics that she just doesn't realize, maybe it's subconscious, is that when she knows there's something that is heavy on her that she needs to explain or might be in the wrong she tends to pick a fight about something else that might be a sub-issue so that she can win that one and then get a foothold and go from there. (pause) Like last night it was extremely frustrating so I just didn't talk to her about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well one thing...well I have a couple thoughts. One, sort of an odd way of putting it, and I don't think you guys are there yet because you're both very distressed, but I guess on one level maybe you guys can empathize...you're having the same experience. You're not feeling like you can trust the other person and you know how bad that feels and that's how the other person is feeling. (pause) You can sort of say the evidence doesn't bare it out and obviously each of you are entitled to your perspective but the other person is feeling just the way (chuckle) you're feeling which is, "I can't feel safe with this person. I don't know what's true and not true." And being in that position is pretty crazy-making, when the person that you love and rely on the most, you can't even sort out what's happening. It's a very crazy-making position to be in. And it seems like right now both of you are in that position. It sounds like for you Peter this has been a lot more long term issue whereas it seems like for you Melanie this is sort of a new element to the relationship that's feeling very unsettling. [00:40:47]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I've just recently (pause) found him in several lies this week so yeah, it's (crying) gotten worse. </p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is also frustrating, it's this...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We shouldn't call it a lie right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...she throws out like I've been lying...the thing with Scott, it was something spawned from a good intention where I know that after work she wants to hang out and she doesn't have a lot of friends that she knows in New Haven so I got out of work much later than I thought an I made a plan with Bernie I wanted to do earlier. It was something I kind of...it was a flexible plan that I made three days earlier but I haven't seen him in a long time and he helped us move all of our stuff into our house. I felt bad because I made a kind of tentative plan for that day which I would have liked to have done from 9pm to midnight and then when she got out I would be home. But instead it went from...it started at around the time she got out, 11:30 or something like that, midnight and so that's when I actually got around to being able to meet him and so there was a fighting match on TV down the street. Bernie 's like, "Okay, why don't we go there," so we made a plan to meet up there. [00:42:10]</p>

<p>Yeah, I was just getting out of work so I felt bad that I didn't plan it earlier and so I presented it in a way it was like, " Bernie’s in town. Do you want to go and hang out with him?" I had already asked Bernie about having the three of us go and he was all for it. So I wanted us all to meet up. So the way I presented it, Melanie classifies it as a lie because I didn't inform her that I'm already obligated to go and I don't (pause)...I just don't see it. It's not like that's a malicious lie. I just wanted to let her know that this is an inviting option. I don't want her to think Bernie and I made a plan, "would you want to come and be the third leg?" I wanted her to think this is a fun thing. We can all go as a group. [00:43:01]</p>

<p>So that basically for her was misleading and that's a lie and then that gets somehow grouped into the same category of me not telling her that I went swimming with a girl which is...that is something I feel might be more...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Might be more...of a lie?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: More criminal or whatever.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, but was that a lie? Was that an omission? That's not a lie?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We're not at home fighting...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh we're using synonyms so that you don't have to admit that you lied. It's ridiculous! He misled me. He did it on purpose. He lied to me! He didn't tell me he was out swimming with a girl and only told me three days later so when he told me he was out swimming, implying that he did it by himself, he lied! </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let me put this in a sort of particular framework - it was interesting when you used the word "criminal." You guys are both in a courtroom now and each of you are on the witness stand. You take turns trying to explain your side of the story and the other person is yelling, "Perjury." (chuckle) To me this is a fundamental problem in your relationship. This is what your relationship is about or at least a big piece of it is about right now. That's a problem for the relationship. The facts for each of you are important and I don't want to completely dismiss them but this is the context of your relationship is a big problem. [00:44:24]</p>

<p>I certainly don't want to play judge and jury (chuckle). I mean on some level, I'm not...I mean I'm concerned about the facts and so far as you are but I'm more concerned to figuring out why your relationship has become this and what the two of you can do to have a different kind of relationship where you guys are not in court all the time. It's not really a nice way to be with someone and most people don't want that kind of relationship and you guys clearly don't because you're distressed about it. So (pause) I'd like to sort of see if we can figure out what to do about this. Does that sound like a helpful way to frame it or does it seem accurate?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I mean our biggest problem is how we deal with our fights and how we argue and how we get over things. [00:45:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's very hard to (pause) deal with fights effectively when there's little trust. (chuckle) It's hard because there's not...people need a certain level of safety in a relationship to...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think the trust thing is a recent addition. It's not (pause)...it's just the fallout of events of the last two weeks is that. I don't think the core fundamental problem is the trust. It's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel it's more symptomatic?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's the way that we naturally and subconsciously deal with...whereas...I don't know. It's just (pause) we have a certain...everybody has a certain way of coping and dealing with fights and conflicts and resolving them and ours, (pause) it's like a square peg in a round hole. There's...I'm sure that ours would be completely effective in ways that would work properly but just not with each other. [00:46:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interesting. I realize that we're going to need to stop in a moment and this is what I'd like to do...I think I...well I don't know if I mentioned the first session, that the main move that I work with people is together obviously because it's helping you work on your relationship. I do typically early on meet with each of you individually because it helps me to sort of get a broader idea of who each of you are so I can help you more effectively as a couple. So what I'd like to do is the next session I'd like to meet with the two of you again because I want to get a little more of your interaction and then meet with each of you separately after that as the following two sessions. Does that sound okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) So let's...you don't have a...I will be able to make a regular time for you in the next couple of weeks. My schedule is a little bit more irregular over the next few weeks so why don't we find a time for next week and then I'll see what I have. It sounds like morning times are better for you, like an early morning time? Is that...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that sort of the best option?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like seven...like right now, you mean? Today? [00:47:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, do you ever have a slightly later in the morning? Because I'll have a couple of those times come up real soon. That would work, like eight or nine or is that going to interfere with your work schedule?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Could you e-mail it again and then we could check?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure! I'm just trying to look...one thing I can do, I'm not here...well obviously next Wednesday is a holiday but I could meet (pause) next Thursday. I could do a seven...actually a couple of things. On Tuesday I could meet at 9:10. Is that...is that something that would work for you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just have to make sure I check in with it but (pause) I think so. I think that would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so I'll put you in for Tuesday at 9:10 and let me know if it doesn't work. I'll take another work and then maybe we can try to find a more regular time? Is that good? [00:48:35]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in terms of...so like I said you guys are going to get the reduced fee. Do you want me to use the credit card that you guys gave me last time or what would you like to do?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sure, you can do that. [00:48:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay that's fine. (pause) Okay, very good. Oh, in terms of this, the company just started charging a few dollar fee, like $2.50 or something. I just want to make sure...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: To swipe the card you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that okay? Because you don't have to do that if you do check but obviously it's not a lot of money but I don't want to charge your card something that you're not aware of.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it would be like $2 or $2.50. Okay, I just wanted to check with you. Okay, so I have you guys down for 9:10. If you find out that doesn't work just let me know okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (background noise) Take care!</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks. [00:49:25]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Wednesday, January 27, Wednesday, January 27.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You probably, I've been here (chuckles) for two hours. Crazy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry about that. I was called to go into court to testify for somebody, is what I went for, so I couldn't....</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought you weren't feeling well because my girlfriend said, you know when she called she didn't sound like she was feeling too well. So I said, "Oh well, she's probably not feeling (inaudible at 0:00:27.4)." I didn't come in. I called. Everybody got a good laugh though because I said my doctor was sick. (chuckles) You know, because I told them I had to go to the doctor. So you know, they said, oh, ok. And then they said, (inaudible at 0:00:42.8) you're not going to the doctor? I said, "Oh, my doctor's sick." And they all cracked up they thought it was so funny. Oh well, that's the way that goes. </p>

<p>I had a funny week though. I don't know. Kinda weird. Because I'm so used to coming to therapy and everything. I think last Wednesday I was kinda depressed. I could feel it. It was really funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you didn't get to come here? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it was funny because I was used to. I know, what? Like I, I guess every time I come out, I mean I feel lots of times I start thinking about what I had said and everything and some of the hurts that start coming. But at least then it's like saying, well now I'm discovering some of the reasons why I feel, you know like the way I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know, I talked to my Mother Saturday and it was such a rotten experience. Because you know like I went away and I still felt so empty. I talked to her and like, every time I went to talk about one of my problems, I wanted to talk about my Grandfather or something. Do you know she wouldn't even listen more or less. It was like, like she'd listen and then she'd start getting tears in her eyes and so she'd change the subject. It was like she's fighting it as much as I am. Only I don't want to fight it. I want to find out what the hell is going on with me. And she doesn't seem to even care enough, you know like to really get it out, into the open.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said, you know like, "Do you remember any things that I did? Like do you remember any time we had a fight or we had something that I was, you know like really moody or really hurt about it?" She says, "No." But just something I kinda bugged me because I did it later on. I thought it started, you know, when I went to the first foster home. But it didn't. It started when I was home. She said, "When you didn't want to talk to somebody, you wouldn't." 0:02:22.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you know like sometimes I just would sort of go into that shell by myself even when I was a little kid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't remember that. And I had, I talked about my father. And I said you know like, "Did my Father pay a lot of attention to me?" She said, "No because he was afraid he would hurt you." So you know, it was something like what my girlfriend had with her father. You know like he was afraid to play with her. And he would never take her any place because he didn't know what to do with her, you know. Well not so much he didn't know what to do with her, he was afraid of her. And you know I said, "Jesus." So, that much I found out. And I kinda figured that. You know like there was no real relationship with my father. And I guess that bothered me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that made you kind of sad though just to find out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Very. Yeah. It did. It hurt again. You know because it was like when I'm just conjecturing things and I say, "Well maybe." But then it's always like, see? I'm kinda funny in real life. Sometimes I'll say, "Well it could be. But then it could be something else too. It doesn't have to be that way." You know, and it's like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But to find it out for real....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and now I know. There's no way to run from it. There's no way to say maybe it's not. But maybe he really did, but maybe it's you know. You know. That's it. That's it Charlie. You had it. And when you think about, you know I used to think about it and go, "Oh Jesus." You know. I felt so depressed. But you know like I started talking about my Grandfather. This really kind of got me mad. Not mad but I felt hurt again because my Mother wouldn't even really listen. She saw me start to cry. And rather than just let me, so what if there's people around? Let them look. I don't care, you know. So they're her friends. She could say, "Well she had a fight with her boyfriend." You know, she didn't have to tell anything. We weren't getting real loud or anything. 0:04:02.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said, "Jesus, she's not even listening to me." It's like, and it's like I know she really wants to help. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But like that was so important to you to get it out and she couldn't....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I want it out in the open. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I want her to talk about it. She'll start to get tears in her eyes and everything. And then I don't want to push her too much, one thing. And then she just changes the subject. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She off and running on something else. And I say something like, "My brother, I don't think my brother cares about me." "Oh don't say that." You know, that's it. Subject's closed. She completely dismisses me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just won't listen to your feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I try to get them out. And now they're starting to come, you know. And like you talk to your own mother and you think that.. Ok, I told my girlfriend even this. I don't have a relationship with my Mother anymore. I told my Mother this. I said, "Mom, don't you think there's some reason why I couldn't find a way to get out? All this time I couldn't find a way to get out. I could get out of this area. I could have done this all the time." I said, "Why don't you think it is? Why do you think it's like I don't even think sometimes to come out here? Or I don't want to come out here for some reason." And I says, "I guess part of it is because it's like a rejection and part of it is like, you know like it, I guess it hurts me." Like when I go out to see her. Because it is like, it like reminds me that I don't have her around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I told her like that time when I was crying when I was sixteen and I was crying for her. So I'm sixteen years old and I needed my mother and I was crying for her. And I knew you couldn't be there and I knew you wanted to be there but it was still like the idea that I was hurt because you weren't there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was telling her this and then she just, it was like, I don't know it is just like she keeps cutting me short, like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were trying so hard to let her see you to tell her how you felt and she just couldn't..0:05:46.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: She couldn't, I don't know if she couldn't accept it yet or whether she can't accept that there's you know like something's wrong with me, or she blames herself, or what the heck it is. But, you know it's like I can't talk to her. I try. And I try to get her into a serious conversation like, "Mom, there is something wrong with me. This is one thing. Admit it. It's not your fault. It's not anybody's fault. There's just something wrong with me and I want to get it over with." 0:06:10.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And it's things like every time I go out there she wants me to get married. I can't get married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean Jesus. Can you imagine the kids I'd come out with if I ever did?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But it's almost like she's standing in your way there. Like you really have to do something with her and she can't let that happen. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And she won't let me, you know like I want to talk to her about. I said like, "Do you remember any times when I was with my father?" You know like, part of it is my father too I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like, she says no he was sleeping lots of times. And he didn't hug you and everything because he was afraid he was going to hurt you. And this is what I needed because she's, I said did my Grandfather do that and she said yeah. Not often but he did. And I, it wasn't even, you know it wasn't even all the physical. I wanted the physical. But my Grandfather was so nice to me. He just, you know he had so much love and my Father didn't have it for me at all. (crying) All he cared about was my brother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And my brother became my father to me and I know it. Because he was there to protect me all the time. And now he doesn't care. (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You lost him too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I told my mother that and all she says is, "Oh, don't say that. Your brother loves you. I'm sure he loves you." You know like, what the hell good does that do? She thinks he loves me. I know he doesn't love me. (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And you need to get the hurt out and she won't let you do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) She won't even admit it, you know. She, I don't know, she's like I am in a way. But at least I try to face reality. 0:08:00.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) I guess I just feel so sad because she won't help me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't help me all my life and now when I come to her and all I'm asking her is to tell me a little bit about anything. Anything she can remember. And all she can remember is "Oh you were a pretty good little kid. Sometimes you wouldn't talk to people."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the only thing she gave me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're asking her to give you something and she can't do that. She won't do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) You know when you're a little kid you don't always remember. But my Mother was an adult. And if she cared a lot about me she'd remember some of the things I did. Whether they were good or bad, she'd remember them. She remembers like two or three little things that I remember myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) It's almost like she had no excuse because my Father was sick. He wasn't sick but he was always sleeping. But she was awake all the time and she was with me. And she doesn't remember half the things that we did together or anything. Some of the things I have to remind her that I do remember. And she's supposed to be my Mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't even remember you. Why would....</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) You know, I know we've been strangers for the last couple of years, if she doesn't, you know if she doesn't know me now ok. But she should have known her own daughter when she was little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really want her to remember that but she just doesn't. 0:09:59.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) It doesn't seem like there is anything there, you know. It's like, it's still that strange though it bugs me. It still always with Ed and her (inaudible at 0:10:06.6). That was before I was there. I remember even when I was a little kid asking, "But Mommy where was I? Why wasn't I there, Mommy?" It always made me feel like that. Like she was, the only thing she used to tell me about when, you know, when she was younger. Well she told me once she was in an orphanage. Yeah. That was another thing. I can remember one thing that really hurt me. She said, "Oh I want you to go to Minnieville because that was where I was raised. And it's a real nice place." You know and all this bull shit that even as a little kid I was afraid and I didn't know why. And I think it's because before that she told me about this nun. That she had broken a dish and the nun beat her up for it. And I guess even as a little kid I was like, wait, why does my mother want to send me some place where they beat her up? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't make any sense. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know I keep trying to think logically. I keep saying, my Mother couldn't help it. She couldn't help it. But then when, you know. I just don't know why I feel like this. I just feel like I needed her, you know like I couldn't ever go to her. Even when I went to see her I couldn't talk to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even know why. Even when I was a little kid I couldn't talk to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd go out there and I'd watch TV or some stupid thing and I remember sometimes I used to get spanked because I wouldn't even, I wouldn't talk to her when I was there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't know what to say to her. (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She kept telling me what a bad mother she was. And I kept saying, "No you're not. No you're not." And that was about all we ever said to each other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew she felt bad because she wasn't there, but you know like....0:12:03.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All you wanted was just to have her be your mother, that's all. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) She didn't even have to be with me all the time. I could write a letter to her or something but I can't even talk to her. I really can't. I go out there and... I used to talk like a bullet. I just told her anything and everything. And sometimes like when I told her I'd given the Catholic Church up, I think it was just to hurt her. I don't even know why I wanted to hurt her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I felt rejected and I wanted to reject her for, I don't know what it was. But I just, I couldn't even talk to her like a, like in a loving term or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, or like have a discussion with her because like first of all, she's (nothing) in the world. She reads and she sees the news but like she's not out living. I just can't even talk to her. I see my girlfriend and her mother how they talk. And I want the relationship they've got. (crying) My mother and I don't have anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) It's just like one big hole and that's what I'm in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you've needed her for so long.0:13:59.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) That's the way it feels like I need friends or somebody. I think that's why I latch on to friends the way I do. It's like, it's somebody to care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you really need somebody because you're so alone. You really need somebody to be there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) And you know, I don't think I would have had that need if I would have had her when I did need her. When I was a little kid so I could become secure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. If somebody had given to you sometime, if somebody had given you something, then you'd be ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now it's like, I don't know I just feel like, I'm almost afraid. I'm afraid of getting real close. I'm afraid like, I get so paranoid. And hurt right away. Like my teacher, Saturdays he'll take me home. Well, the first thing I thought of was he likes my roommate and I know he does. And it's like, well he'll expect me, the first thing I think of, well he'll expect me to invite him in. And he wants to see her. All he's doing is using me. It's like, you know like, I really get so mad because it's like people don't really care about me. I'm just like a vehicle to get to somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like that hurts so much. Because it's like, it's like saying, like you're nothing. You know like, I don't care that he doesn't like me. I don't like him. You know and I don't care that he doesn't like me. The only thing I do care about is I like people to respect me when I know them. I respect him as a teacher and as a man. And I want him to respect me the same way. You know like, and what did I do to have him feel like, you know like use me as just like something you know to get to somebody else. I think that is a most sick thing. You know like, when I'm the one that is being the object of it, it really bugs me. And it's like they, I don't know. I wouldn't use anybody to get to somebody else. I think that's one of the worse things in the world to do. Because I know how I feel. And I wouldn't want to make somebody else feel like that.0:16:35.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Just to use you, not to really care about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and like I said, I don't care that he doesn't like me. He said I'm good at working out, I said very good. You know and I'm really happy about that. But you know like, why use me, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, it's happened before. They'll talk to me because they want to talk to her, things like this. I said, well partly it's because she is so much more advanced and she's got a natural magnetism for people. Maybe I don't have it. I don't know. But I don't really care if everybody doesn't like me. Just like, I don't want to be used to get to somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) You know? I want to be somebody. And I want somebody to care about me just because I'm me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I can take other people and I can like them and they've got lots of faults and things like this and they may not even be all that smart. They might not have a college degree. There's a fellow I like right now who doesn't have any of those things. And he's not even that smart, but it's just that he's good at caring about people. The people he works with. The people, you know like, for girls, for me. It's just like, that's the type of relationship I like. And he likes me. So you know like this is fine. But like in general, I don't feel like I have anybody. And you know just basically like some, some crazy little things. Like he'll walk in when I'm typing, because this is where I go at night. He's not my boss, he's just one of the other guys. He'll come up, he'll mouth the words I love you. You know, to me, I know he doesn't mean it. He's just infatuated. The whole baloney, but. He just makes me feel so good. Because somebody said I love you, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.0:18:22.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, it's serious. It's all the, you know I'm in love with her. Infatuated. It's like, oh man, I'm madly in love with this woman and she's perfect. All this baloney. But you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's getting something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It's just like, it is something. It makes you feel like wow, you know. You know it's not true. You know it's not real. But it is. It's like saying, you know you're somebody special. And it just makes you feel so good. And so many other people are so, I don't know. They just take you for anything they can get you for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like my boss is back now. I'm working for him. I don't know. He hasn't touched me anymore. I told him you know. I just gave him the hint. Just leave me alone. But I don't know how long that's going to last either. You know, and what really hurts me about him, it wasn't so much because, I needed that attention. I really needed it. I needed somebody to come and put his arm around me and say, you know, say nice things to me and things like this. I needed that attention then. When I got it from him, I didn't care who I got it from really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But, now I don't know what to do. Because I don't feel like I need it from him anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you don't get it from him then who are you going to get it from? </p>

<p>PATIENT: My other boss, which is crazy. He was another one that started things like, you know like, in front of people he started to grab a hold of me and things that I could say, you know like, stop it already. You know I don't like going out afterwards or you know like kissing and all this baloney. This is fine because we also kind of date in a round about way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:20:05.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I said that's fine. As long as it's not in front of other people because that makes me feel cheap again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And like, I'm not a cheap girl. And I don't run around with everybody. And it just burns me that people get this idea, part of it I think it is because I just you know, like I don't know what it is about me that sometimes people get that idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Always get that idea. Now some of my skirts because I got heavier got too short. And I know that much. But it's not like, like at one time I did do that. I know I did. But it was just for attention. It wasn't for you know, I didn't want to go to bed with anybody. I just wanted a fellow to notice me. And I would do anything I had to to make him notice me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But like now I don't feel like I do that. There's lots of fellows who do think you know, I'm classy and things like this. He even thinks I'm classy. But he's just like, I don't know whether it's an ego thing with him and I'm another object or what it is. You know but it's like, like none of the other fellows would think of doing that, you know. None of the other, I was working with these other fellows. And none of them ever laid a hand on me. They never said a word out of the way. They were perfect gentlemen. They all said they were real sad to see me go because they really liked me and I really liked them. And you know, I think I'd worked for them two weeks and they give you this gorgeous present for Christmas and everything. And you have to go back to this other ass. I can't stand that guy any more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's because probably what I did, probably what he did to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He made me feel cheap. Things like I'd say, "Please don't put your hands on my arms or anything when people are around. People are talking. I'm losing my reputation." He'd say, "Oh, well that doesn't bother me, boy." You know, it's like. I'd said all that and he said something like, "Don't worry about your reputation. That makes me feel good." All this because he's an older man. It's a big thing with him to have a young girl around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what's most important for you in there is that you want people to really see you. 0:22:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want, yeah. I don't even care. You know like I would rather have a fellow as a friend, and have him respect me. No matter how sexy, no matter how attracted, some fellows I am attracted to sexually. Every girl is. But I would rather have him for a friend. And have him around for a long time and have him respect me than have some, some guy come up and pay lots of attention nicely. And then all of a sudden it's like hands all over you and all this bullshit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not real, you're saying. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like, it's like, what they're doing, it's not me that they're after, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They see a girl and maybe a couple of the other fellows say she's classy looking. Or she dressy sharply. Or she's this or she's that. So right away, if I can put my hands all over her and if I can do it in like (inaudible at 0:22:41.4) can pick up because my girlfriend says it's to be very careful. Because when I first started working for him I was looking for somebody or something so badly and I didn't understand it at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like I was. I was just, it wasn't even crying. It was like I needed somebody so badly it was like I was half dead, you know. Somebody's got to love me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't realize what I was saying, you know. It was like, when he started paying attention to me, boy it was great. I used to think he was sexy. When I first started therapy, oh gee, you know I thought he was so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I realized all it was like you know he was an older man. And he was paying the kind of attention at first like I wanted my father to pay to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So that's the way you were. You wanted just any kind of attention. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Any kind of attention from a man because I was looking for my Father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you've changed. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I couldn't get anybody to give me, or my Grandfather probably more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you're different and you don't want people to see you in that old way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want him. I still have that hurt but I know what it is. It's so I'm not grasping for something. And like since I haven't, I've gotten this, you know this younger other boss. And he kind of likes me. He's still playing around on a wife and that so he's not really madly in love with me, but. You know we've got like a real honest relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:24:04.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: He says he thinks I'm sexy and he likes me. And he likes to be with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he likes to kiss me. And things like this. And he said eventually he'd like to go to bed with me. He came out very honestly and said that. And it was like, it was like saying, I'm not going to use you. Because see, if he would have said I love you and all this other baloney and I'm going to divorce my wife and I'm going to marry you and let's go to bed and all of this, I would have said you know like, oh here we go again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But Seth was very honest with me. He just said you know like, "I like you. I like to be with you." Which is actually a lot more to me than somebody saying you know like, "Oh wow. Gee. I'm madly in love with you." All this other baloney. And then not have it last, you know like two weeks from now he won't even know you, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like with Seth is very, very honest about it. He just says, you know like, "I'm sexually attracted to you." I say, "Ok. You know, this is how you feel. Ok."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. That's real. And honest. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And like every time, I've always come out, like you know we'll start kissing or something and he'll start getting, now he starts to start petting. And I say you know stop. And I told him this, well I did make up one story. But I had to with Seth. Seth's got a wife. And Seth loves his wife. And if I let myself go and say I didn't have anybody. And nobody, you know like, I really didn't have anybody right now and I didn't care about anybody and nobody cared about me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then what I'd be saying to you is I'd be letting him, letting myself open for him to come and you know just walk all over me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know like if you don't have anybody a fellow's going to say, "Well, she's got nobody anyway. This is better than nothing." You know? And then this way, like I tell him I've got a boyfriend in Connecticut. You know like and I see him every once in a while when he comes in. So it's like saying like, "I really care for somebody else too. So you don't have to lie." See? This is what I'm saying. It's like you don't have to lie to me. You don't have to say you love me and all this baloney for me to go out with you. Or even to kiss you or whatever. If it goes any further to go any further, you know. It's like, and I kind of feel good about it because now I can... I mean it hurts a little bit. To have somebody say like, well but he doesn't really say that because he also says he likes my mind by saying he likes to be with me. You know but like, I don't like somebody just to take me as a shell, this or that. You know like, I like you spiritually. I like you physically. I like you mentally or whatever. I want to be liked as me. The whole thing me, you know.0:26:37.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like he's saying in so many words that he does like me that way. I mean like he likes having me around. And it's nice. It's a nice feeling for me to have somebody say that even though they don't love me. Just to say, "You know, it's nice having you around." And I don't know. But then like Will makes me feel good too because he gives me the other that I need. The romantic bullshit. And I know that's all it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, he's just a nice guy. He's very loyal. It's like, somebody tried to attack me up in the bathroom. So like when I go up now, I go to tell him. I say you know like, "I'll be back in five minutes. If I'm not back, somebody come and check." He's like, "Oh, no, no, no." Takes me up in the elevator, you know. Like Seth took me up yesterday and waited for me until I was finished and then took me down again. And, but it's like, you know this is like little things, like people show me finally. People are starting to show me that they care. And it's like, I need part of this, because like I'm giving a little more. But it's still, it's still I'm actually afraid. I don't know. Like Jodie says to me, "Why don't you have people over to the house?" I said, " Because I don't know anybody well enough. I'm afraid to ask them."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And it's like I'm so afraid to ask them partly because I'm afraid they're going to say no. And it's just like, and I know this. I say, "Oh it's because I don't know them well enough and you know like who knows what they are. What kind of people they are until you get to know them." And all this bullshit. But it just, I think it just comes right down to the fact that I'm afraid somebody's going to say no. I'm going to say you know, here I am, open like a book, be my friend or if you want to be my friend. And somebody's going to turn around and say no and walk away. 0:28:13.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just going to like shatter me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like, see it's happened so often with people who shouldn't be that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That when you just lay yourself out and open up then people are just going to shove you away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They're just going to walk, they're just going either walk away or they're going to use you and then walk away. I have been so afraid of that. I don't know why. I don't know. I think I felt like I was a little bit used at Foley's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because all I did was, all I can remember doing is working and babysitting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I was nine years old when I came there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just, I just figured because when I was home, I figured it was going to be like when I was home. When I was home I just ran and I played and I did whatever I wanted to do. I hardly did any work at all. In fact I don't think I did any. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was like, I was spoiled. And I know it. I was a spoiled brat. At eight years old you can at least be able to make your own bed and do dishes. There's no reason why you can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was spoiled and my Mother wasn't up to teaching me things. And then like I think I figured I'd go back to my home type life. And you know, it just wasn't like that. And it was like another shattering. Wait a minute you know. This isn't the way I thought it would be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just like, I guess maybe that is the way it has been all the time and it's like I'm afraid this is going to happen again. You know like, "Ok, I'm in the real world folks. Ok, Hi, I'm here." I'm not going to lie to myself. I'm not going to say that you know like things are the way I want them to be when I know they're not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I can see myself doing it again. I can just see it. Like we all went off. This is what happened. I was working the other day. And you know, the first day I was back with my boss. So this other fellow who works with us, he's real nice. He's a real sweet guy. And he's a pretty good friend to me. He said, "Don't forget to say good night to us before you leave." So I did. And when I did, they said, he said, well they both said, "Are you hungry?" And I said yeah I was hungry. So we went out to eat. But I ended up, my boss wanted to take me and I wouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:30:21.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, the first time when we had to take one car to pick up the other car and I said, "Oh I don't want to get out because it's muddy." You know so I stayed with Rori. And then we went out and ate. And I don't know, like when I went to go home, like Rori said, "Oh you don't trust me as much as him." and things like this. And he kept saying to me, "You know he really is a nice guy." And I'm thinking that, see right away I'm defending him. I say, "Oh yeah well, he did say Rori why don't you take her home." Because he knew I didn't want to go home with him. He knew like I don't want to start anything up after I haven't worked with him. I just don't want to start anything. We can be friendly. We can go out for a drink or have a sandwich as long as there is somebody else there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or a group of people. But I don't want to start anything. And you know like, I want him to know that. But like it's, like it's almost like saying, "Oh now Jane, you were wrong." And the first thing it's like, it's like I don't want it to be real. I don't want it to be the way I know it is. I know he's using me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know if I let him he'd walk all over me and leave me there and maybe come back and stomp again on me. Because he's just that type. If somebody gets in his way, poom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like, like when Rori says, "Most people don't like him but I understand him and I know he's a nice guy." But then, you know the first thing I said, "Oh yeah, gee, he really is." And then I thought to myself, "Bull. Remember the last time you were talking to Rori and he didn't like it." Because again, you know it was like his toy was talking to somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said, what did he say? Oh, Rori left. He said, "Rori. Ugh, you could do better than that I hope." You know so it's like, Rori is a nice, big, puppy dog type guy. He's just a sweet nice guy. 0:31:59.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's, you know he just, he doesn't have any kind of polish. But things like, he broke his foot and I got him coffee. And he came out and he said. You know he made me feel so good. Because he said, "No wonder everybody likes you because you always do such nice things for people." And I said, "Why? You mean there really are some people around here who don't talk about my dresses and don't talk about tits." Oh, like the old ladies. Oh Christ. But you know he could just make you feel so good by saying nice things like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, and it wasn't like, "Boy you're so sharp. Boy you're this. Boy you're that." It was just a nice honest thing like saying, "I can see down. And there's something good there that I can see." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like lots of other people can't see it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It felt like he could see that you could give to people and you could be warm and you could be a good person. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and like I care about other people. And it's like, you know I wasn't doing it because I wanted to, I can't even say I even wanted to wait on him or anything. It's just like, it's very easy for me to feel for other people. And feel what other people's positions and places. Like I could see myself. I wouldn't want to be running around with a cast when I first got it on and be going to get coffee and coming back and things like this. And you know like, I got him a pack of cigarettes one day and left them on his desk to make sure he had those too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like walking all the way to the elevator and going downstairs and then getting those, you know going down the escalator, and then getting the cigarettes, coming back up. That's a big job for somebody that's got a cast on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just like you know it's not, it's just like it's very easy for like, you know for me. I have no problem with that. Feeling for other people. But it's like I know what I want to do for other people but like I'm just afraid to do it a lots of times. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so funny because I'm not afraid in the office. I always use the excuse like, "Well, you're supposed to do this. Because then you get raises." And all this bullshit which isn't true. It's like, I want to do it. That's why I do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Thing like emptying their ashtrays. Like this one boss used to always have his, the one when I was working for them, use to always...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just want to be good with other people. 0:34:06.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's just like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And have people be together and be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And be happy. And it's just like, if you can do something that's so easy and makes people happy. I mean they don't have to come to you all the time and say, "Oh thank you so much" and all this baloney. But like, like Mr. Keener. He was so cute when I went to leave. He's a great big fellow like a football player. And this other, this wasn't the great big bosses, these fellows are the smaller partners. You know like they've got little hang ups here. One has a lisp. You know you can kind of tell like why they just didn't make it in some different ways. Some of them aren't assertive enough. You know it just, like, you can tell. They're like the smallest partners in the firm and I was working for them. But the biggest gentlemen. You know? You know to me they were the biggest men. Oh I mean they were like babies and things like this but like, they were just so nice to me. 0:34:54.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And things like, when this other guy would say something, "You're not supposed to Xerox these minutes." Or something, he was giving me this great big rough time. And I didn't know. I don't go to their partner's meetings. He said, "It was decided at a meeting." I said, "I wasn't at the meeting sir. Sorry." I said, "Sorry, I didn't know."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So he's giving me this rough time and my big boss just walked up. And he took a cigar out of his mouth, put his shoulder in front of me and said, "Look Whit, she did a very good job while she was here." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And all he did was take one look at that mountain and say, "Oh, ok" And walked away. But I mean it was just like, it was like he came when I. It's so funny because it sounds so melodramatic. But it was like he came when I needed him, you know? And part of it I know was because, like he was the one that smokes the pipes or the cigars. And like I know like I took special attention to make sure that ashtray was clean. The desk was clean around it and that type of thing. And like, now he was coming back and he was protecting me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, you know like, like a man really should do for a woman first of all. I don't think any man should come up and yell at a girl like that guy did, but. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're just, you're trying to make a way to be with people that doesn't have anything to do with being used, or manipulated or anything like that. 0:36:05.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I don't want to give and take. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Kind of a warm person to person kind of thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like, it's I don't have a real relationship with my other girlfriend. I call her my girlfriend but like ok, like she said she cared about me and everything when we had that party and you know like I got weird and started crying and all this baloney. But it was just like, what does she ever do? I came right to myself and said, all right my girlfriend said that she had invited my other girlfriend over for dinner last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said, "I told you twice. I told you yesterday and this morning." And I said to myself, "Baloney. You were sleeping yesterday when I came in. I don't remember you saying anything this morning." Which was possible because I got to bed like three o'clock in the morning and I was half asleep, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like I said, "Well if you said something, I didn't hear you." So she's playing all these little games like when I said something she wouldn't remember. You know, like last night, you know when I came home we started talking. Like this morning, "Oh you left this money here for the bills." I told her last night. I said, "Here's the money. I'm putting it here on your dresser." You know and it seems like she's trying to play this little game. I know what she's doing. It's like saying it's very bad that you don't listen. Like first of all, I can remember her very vaguely something in the back of my mind, something about Eliza coming over for dinner Tuesday night, which was like, told me like Saturday or Sunday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I work on Tuesday nights. And then I went out to have a hamburger because I was feeling kind of low. Because Seth and I were kissing a little bit and he wanted me to go to his house because his wife isn't there. And like, all right, I wouldn't mind going to bed with him. He's a very sexy guy and I need an affair. I've haven't been in bed with a guy in like a year. And I think I'm just about ready for, you know like a little more adult affair. Like that time was just like I was experimenting. I didn't know what I was doing. I was even more mixed up than I am now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but like, I said, "Seth, you're going to bring me to your house this late at night? And you're married with the neighbors all around?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:38:01.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you know like, I said, to myself, "Boy, this guy must be awfully..." You know like, I can see, it's more than just for his wife. It's like saying, this guy is very honest in certain ways, but like, what would he do to his wife? Would he jeopardize? And he loves her. He's crazy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, why would you bring a girl home this late at night? All right he says, "Nothing will happen if you don't want it to. We can have champagne." So it was real nice, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But to his house?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know to the suburbs with all these people. You know, let's face it. In the suburbs everybody knows everybody else's business. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's like you're kind of asking could he really care about his wife if he would do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Could he really care about anybody? You know, he's supposed to love his wife. He doesn't care about anybody but him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He wants the pleasure for the moment. He doesn't care. Unless he wants to hurt his wife. Maybe he was mad and he wanted to hurt her or something. I said that, he says, "I hate to get into these things. But that's all right." You know like, I guess maybe, maybe he just didn't even think. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess it's like in some ways he's honest. But in other ways...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But for some reasons he's lying to himself I think. You know because like, he admits he doesn't really like me. And I mean, if you really loved a girl, you didn't care if your wife turned around and walked out the next day. Ok, so do something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but, like how can you do that and then turn around and say you love somebody. You know it's like, it's almost like saying, can he really love? Like he's only been married two years. It's kinda, you know, short marriage and divorce situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like on one hand you want to be into a relationship with him. It seems more honest than anything else you've ever had. But on the other hand, there's all this stuff about the wife and wanting to take you home and that makes it seem artificial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just don't do that. Yeah. It's like, it's like he's got counterfeit with himself. Like another girlfriend of mine does some work for him too and she said, "You know who he reminds me of?" I said, "Who?" Like he's trying to imitate. You know like I do some imitating too. But she says he looks like Mannix from TV when he's walking and some of the things he does. So I tried that on him. I wanted to pull it on him and see what he'd say. You know I said, "You know who you remind me of? You remind me of Mannix sometimes." So, this is the other thing. He lies. And you can tell. Because like I said this in the beginning of the night. And it was almost like he didn't hear me. And then like, at the end of the night he comes out. Like you know like, I'd been working for him. Like I'd been typing an envelope. I'd forgot I'd said it. It just completely. 0:40:33.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like this was three hours later. He said, "Why do you say I remind you of Mannix?" I said, "No." He said, "Ah hah." I said, "Well you know who he is don't you? " He says no. Well first of all, a name like Mannix isn't all that easy to remember if you just like hear it said once and sort of just like slurred over more or less and then you like change the subject right away. Because he started like talking when he came up to me about something else. Unless you really do see this guy a lot or whatever. He said, "I never saw him. I don't know who he is. I never saw." You like it's like, and again he's like lying. And he's trying to pull it on me. And I'm not that dumb anymore. I pick on things like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so this is why I don't know where in the heck I am with this guy. I know he doesn't care about me. I said, "Ok, fine." I mean as far as a girlfriend really goes. Like he doesn't really want a long term relationship with me. Well maybe he does. Because he said, "So the big boss has been doing this for eight years. Having a secretary and they go out afterwards." And things like this. And he was married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like where you're caught is that he seems to really accept you as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not quite sure if you respect him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's it. That's very true. I think maybe, you know it's like, my girlfriend doesn't like a fellow who dotes on her. And like lots of times I take on her values. But I do like a fellow who likes, I mean like, I may not if I ever get married, I may not marry a fellow who's like that. You know who's constantly doting on me. But like, I think it's kind of fun. You know you have a fellow come up to you, like she doesn't like this bit where fellows come up and say I love you and all this. But things like Will does are so cute. Like he comes up, he won't say it out loud because somebody else is there. He always says like, "We don't want, you know, make sure that nobody's around." He doesn't want. What he's doing, what he's saying in essence is like, I don't want them to talk. But not just about me. I don't want them to talk about you. Because I, you know like I, I care about you more or less. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like, which is very nice. Like this other guy, he doesn't care. He puts his hands on me in an office. Like there's six men sitting around and he's going to put his hands on me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, what is that saying. It's like saying, "Well, this is my little number on the side folks." You know. And like what does that make me feel like? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like again, it's like, I don't know, like a toy. Like a thing. And Will just makes me feel like such a queen. Because it's like he keeps saying, "I shouldn't be such a nice guy." Because you know like, and then he goes something like, I think he even says, "I want to marry you." I always laugh and go, "Oh Will. Come on. Go away." Like he'd say, "I'm not going to be a nice guy anymore. Nice guys always finish last." And I keep trying to tell him that, "Will don't feel that way. Because I feel a lot more for you than I do for Seth or anybody else in the office." You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like they come out with all these lies and all this other. He's just like a puppy dog coming up and say, lick, lick, yelp, I love you. (chuckles) It's just so cute, you just want to take him and do like this to him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not quite, quite real with him, that playing up to you. But it's a lot more genuine than anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like, but it's like he is almost like that. I think you can, you can see where like this fellow could get very hurt. And like he can feel. Because he was telling me about this girl. And this was one thing that really got me to, first it got me jealous. Which naturally because it was just like saying he still likes her. Because you could see when he had tears in his eyes when he talked about her that there was something there. But it was like saying like, this fellow can talk about somebody and like he can feel when he's talking. 0:44:08.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a beautiful. All right. People say this baloney that ok, you have to get very intellectual. I say ok. You know like, my mind has been pushed down for a while. I've got to get that. But I don't want to ever get to the point where I don't have emotions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I can't feel for somebody else. Because like what is that? That's like a stone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I don't want to be a stone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be alive. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I want to have feelings. And be warm like he is. And he's talking about this girl and I'm like. I don't know maybe he thought I was kind of wild too. Because one time he said, "Why do you think that every guy who's nice to you wants to get your body or get into your pants." He's kinda crude. But he says it. Phoom, like that. He doesn't pussyfoot around. He doesn't come out with all these nice little niceys. You know he comes out and says it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He says you know. And he's not, he's not all that quick with the brain. But like he sees things. He perceives a lot of things like other people don't see in people and in things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But like he was telling me like he liked this girls. He didn't say he liked her. He just talked about her. You know it was much as saying he liked her. Because he started to, you know like tears in the eyes and the whole baloney. I shouldn't say baloney, that's not the most real thing around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But like he just talked about her like, you know like how she was, she used to run around with lots of fellows and she was a strip teaser, the whole baloney. But like she married a truck driver. He said it's so beautiful to see them. Because like she really loves him and he really loves her. And that's like, see this is what he's like looking for too. He's looking for a girl who's like her. Maybe. Maybe not just her but somebody who could love him and he could love her. Like nobody could come between them. Nobody. Because it was a real true thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, she said he loves me for me. You know he never touched her, he never. You know, this was part of the thing with her. Like all the fellows all they wanted to do was to go to bed with her. And that was it and then she'd get trapped. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And like she had something that was, you know this fellow really cared about her as a person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:45:58.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think this is very beautiful and if a person could you know like experience it, fine. You know like a lifetime of this. This is fine if you can do it. But, it's just so beautiful to meet somebody like Will because he can feel things like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like. When you see him, like when he's talking about this, I don't know. He's just so. He's got so much love down there, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like he shouldn't be in the business he's in because he's going to get killed. But you know it's just like he's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you feel really warm and protective toward him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My mother instinct comes out towards a guy like that. But it is a feeling there. And it's like, I just keep trying to tell him that you know, "Will, don't keep saying you don't want to be like what you are." You know like I really like him the way he is. I don't think I could ever get seriously involved in it like he would maybe eventually want. Or maybe he thinks he wants. Or you know like this, you know, this bit you know, like marriage type thing. It couldn't be like that. But I mean like to have a fellow like that as a friend, somebody who is so sensitive. And you know to see him quite often and just talk to him. It's such a beautiful experience because you like, you can feel with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he can feel with you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And besides he's very honest with you. He'll come right out and say you know, this, this and this, boom. You know, oh, ok. (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet like my other friend Jim. Like I feel so sorry for him because like he said he was in Viet Nam. And he, he told me, you know like I could feel, like I know he's, he's doing what I did and I'm trying to break through. I told him I was going to therapy. And the first thing he did was, "Oh you're going to see a shrink." And you know like, he says he's so liberal minded. But he's really not. He's still, you know like, I told myself, "Oh my God. He's not going to like me. Why did I do that? I'm so stupid." You know, and like, and then I realized Jim's been my friend for eight or nine years. If something like this was going to mess our friendship up then there wasn't anything to base it on anyway. It was just like, I guess we just knew each other so we went out, you know. 0:48:13.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So then I tried to tell him you know like, he's been even harder now since he's been back from Viet Nam. It's like he's got this big shell around him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I tried to explain to him one of the reasons he didn't have friends was because he never gave. He never. He'd pick me up and say, well ok. First he says we'll go to a movie. I says ok so I get dressed like I would to the movies. I want to go to the movies. And then he says like, "Well, maybe we'll just go eat. Maybe we can go here." I said, "Where." "I don't know. You pick a place." I said, "Ok, Can I really?" "Yeah., any place." I said, "Good, I'd like to go Japanese." "No Oriental." "Well I know a good Italian." "I don't like Italian food." It's like saying like if you don't like this, for God's sake, tell me. Find a place you'd like to go to, pick me up and bring me there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:48:58.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like. I don't, I get a little bit irritated. So like if I was just a girl that didn't know him and this was like my first date, I'd tell him to fly a kite. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I told him this finally. But it's like a breakthrough for me because like I could never tell him before. I could see things. I could see him intimidating me with college. He really intimidated me a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I already had the inferiority complex to begin with and he just fed it. You know it's like, "Oh Jesus, I'm so stupid."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But you could see things about him and really wanted to tell him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was afraid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted him to see some of the things that you could see. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But see I was afraid because, I can't really explain it. Maybe I was afraid I would lose him. Like when I brought him home. Maybe I was afraid he wouldn't like me anymore, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe, maybe it was just because I was afraid partly not only that but I was afraid I would lose him you know like one way or another. I'd either lose him to lots of other friends because now he overcomes. He overcomes it when he's secure like in his surroundings. He's funny. He's funny as heck.0:49:58.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it's hard for you to tell people or even to feel things toward people that are kind of critical or that, you know, are really honestly the way you feel somehow. 0:50:11.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, well part of it with me too was another inferiority complex. I'd say to myself, well he knows a lot more than I do. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. But see, like he can work at one level. He can work in the intellectual level a lot better than I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But in the feeling level, like his background too. His father used to beat him all the time. All you hear was his mother and father fighting. You know like he never, he never learned to feel towards anybody, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like, I guess just for survival he was all for himself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I was too for a while. And it's like, but now he's got to learn. Because he says things, he says like, "I don't have time." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I say, "Oh come on Jim. Every time I'm with you you keep saying all the girls that call for your little brother Ed." I said, "It's because Ed gives." Any police around? Ed, his brother made some, some, like a real light potion of marijuana, you know. And I never tried it. So I tried it with them. But you know like, it was like, he made one. And he said, this is what he, when Jim come out he says, "Oh Ed said he made this one especially for you and he made it real light. Because he knew you were just starting and he didn't want anything to happen." You know, and that's when I say, I said, "Jim, look at this. This is the way Ed is." And I'm not talking about, you know, giving drugs to people you know like he's a pusher or anything. He's not. They sometimes make you know like a real light portion for themselves. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's just like the way he did it. It's like he wanted to make sure. "I want to make sure now because I understand. And I don't want anything to happen to you." And it's like, I said, "Ed cares. That's all it is. He cares about other people and you don't."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess for you it's like you feel like you really have something to show him there, to teach him. Something you know about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I know about love a little more than he does. And lots more about sharing than he does.0:52:01.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it's like, and it's like I don't want him to feel that way. And then like he said he was back from Viet Nam. He said, you know I know it bothers him. But he says it didn't. He says like, "You know I used to see dead bodies and laugh." He says, "As long as they weren't Americans because we would identify with Americans." He says, "Because they were funny. Just in the way the position they were in or whatever." It was, he said they were funny and then he stopped talking. And like I knew. I said, "Jim don't you realize what you did? It was like so you wouldn't go crazy. You know you put like a wall around you." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, well at first I though it was just hysteria, you know. Because like that's what I would do if I saw somebody, I might laugh because I was hysterical. But he said no. And then I said, "Well then what you were doing is building a wall around you. Like I did. And I know I did." And I said, "But you've got to break through that wall. Because if you don't, oh God." You know like he's never happy. All he does is, you know like when we go out or something all he does is he's either cutting something down or he's, you know like and I can see how unhappy that guy is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Because you remember how it felt for you and you feel that so strongly in him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like now, now I don't know where I'm going. And now, like I feel lots of hurt. So I know there's more hurts that I've got to, you know that are going to come out. But like at least now, like I get to talking and I can cry. I don't think Jim even knows what the word means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just like, like he doesn't really even laugh when he laughs. He's like. I can't really explain it. It's just so sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) Because he's so young. He's really got. Like he tried to help me. He was, he may not have gone around it right. But like Jim could share with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why, you know. But like he was very considerate and lots of times he was for himself. But you know like one, in one way he tried helping me. And like lots of other people didn't care. Like my foster parents said, "Oh college. That's so stupid for a girl." All of this bull. You know but like he was trying to help me. He could see that my mind needed developing. He could see it was a good mind. 0:54:03.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like at least he was saying, you know like, "I'm your friend and I want to help you." But like, it's all like, now I want to help him but I don't know what the hell to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I said, I came out, you know it just kind of fell out because I had been thinking about doing it. I shouldn't have done it that way. I said, "Yes I'm taking therapy." After he said that I said, "Yeah, and it might be a good idea for you to try to get into the same type of program where you're going." And this other girl that we know who's a nurse. And like she lives in a little fairy tale world. I'm a little mother and you, like it's unbelievable. She's not even in this world. It's terrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like, you know, I just have, I mentioned, I said, "Oh shit, I shouldn't have done it that way." You know it's like he did it the wrong with me and now I'm doing it the wrong way with him. And we want to help each other and don't know how the hell to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know I really, he really intimidated me for a while. And I admit it. But like I am the type of person that that's what I needed. Especially then because like I didn't know where I was going. I was like here. I was there. And you know, it was a terrible feeling just to say like, you know like, almost like I was nothing. You know like I didn't care. I didn't care if I lived or died from day to day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like, like he says like I'm going through college and I'm going through all this baloney. Like lots of the courses are irrelevant. And I'm working all the time. I don't have times for friends. Which is a bunch of baloney right there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then he says, he says, "Now I'm going to have to do what Uncle Sam expects you to do in order to get into, to do anything." Like to be able to get a job or anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said to myself like, "It almost seems like you don't enjoy anything you're doing."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, I've even learned to enjoy secretarial work a little. Not because of the work itself but things like the client contact and making sure this is done and making sure it's near, whatever it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's just like, it's like a little bit of a pride in what I'm doing. Even though I really don't care for it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like he hates every minute of the day. And like when we go out even. You know he says, "The only time I really have fun is when I go out." I said, "Jesus, half the night we're out, you're complaining, you know. Or you get into what you call intellectual discussion." He's not that much of an intellectual. I found that out now. I never realized, you know because it was always because he was ahead of me. He's a level higher than I am. Maybe two. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:56:20.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like, he thinks he's like way above. Like he was talking to this friend of my girlfriend's who is like really, God is that guy smart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean he's smart and you can tell. And he knows everything. You ask about a subject he doesn't know and probably he'll read a whole entire book on it by next week and come back and you know, and he'll be able to discuss it with you. And it's like, but, you know like I just can't get through to my friend. And I want to. But like with this other friend. Like you know I was saying before. Like she said she told me and all this. And then like she's almost like mad at me because like I wasn't home. And I don't remember her ever saying anything. I don't know whether she forgot and thought she said something. Or like maybe if something was said two or three days before and I made a mental note like, "Yeah, I have to get home early." Now part of it's like, I didn't want to be there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to be there until later on and maybe just to see her, have a couple of drinks with her and then when she went home. Because they have a trip to plan. And I know, I admit I feel left out because I'm not going. And I'd love to. I realize the educational value. You know like seeing, meeting all different kinds of people all over the world. And what, the growth you could you know, go through. Plus the fun you could have, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right so I'm not going and I feel a little bit bad about it. But it doesn't bother me when I'm not around them. When I'm around them and all they do is talk about it it bugs me yeah. I like to be with one or the other. I don't like to be with both of them together because that's all they talk about is their trip. And I think this is fine when the two of them are there. You know and I was trying to explain it to them and they said, "Well then you should change the subject." But then if that's the only time they see each other it's not fair for you to change the subject either, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not fair. It just isn't fair. So I say to myself, I guess maybe, maybe, maybe she did tell me like two or three days ago. I know she didn't tell me when she said she did. But she could have told me two or three days ago. And I just didn't want to be there. 0:58:08.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really didn't want to be there. So I told her I'd invite her out to lunch or something one day. Meet her for meditation on Sundays at her guru. And then, but it's just like I can't get close to her. And you know like, and I said to myself like, look. She says friendship. She's always yelling at me because she says I don't give enough, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She says, "You give so far but for friends you've got to give more." I say to myself, "What has Eliza ever done for me?" In terms of a friend? She hasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. Seriously, she has not done anything for me. And it's like, I say, I don't mind being friends with somebody and feeling a friendship and doing things but like why should it be always me doing it and not her? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like Jodie and I give back and forth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like sometimes I give a little more, sometimes she gives a little more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I can just pull that out or something. Like what you keep saying about all these people. It's something like you're beginning to be able to get together how you feel about them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because it was always like I was afraid they didn't like me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So now it's about you and how you feel about them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Probably that's coming out I think.</p>

<p>(telephone rings)</p>

<p> -  COUNSELOR: Hello. Hi, can I call you back? Yeah. Sure. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. Ok, bye. - </p>

<p> It's just about time to stop. But I wanted you know like, that's what you keep saying. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is coming out now a little bit more. It's like, like I'm just beginning a little bit to get some kind of a, of something that at least I'm a person. You know like, like for a long time it was like, I was just like a like, I can't really explain it. It was like a vegetable that was just trying to take in here and take in there and try to find something to be or to do. 1:00:12.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't know anything. And it's like now I can say a little bit. It's like, you know I've got a long way to go but I can say like a little bit with Jodie like I can say like. Everything she says, I don't just say, "Yes, Jodie." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And you, you can know something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. Yeah. And it's partly like if she does say something to me, sometimes I can say, "You're full of baloney." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I don't come out and say that. But like in my mind I can say like, "You're not always right. That's not true." Because I do know maybe. I do know that it's not true. Or it doesn't make sense to me. And you know like unless you can make sense to me, forget it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was like, you know like, it is a little bit better of a feeling. But like, oh God, it's still like. I still have that rejection feeling. And I still have you know like the feeling like. And I know the closer it gets to that trip and breaking up housekeeping and that, the more I feel. You know like it's like, they're leaving and it's like saying again, it's like a rejection. And it's going to take like a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To get, to feel like it's not a rejection. I can't have the same friends around me all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know that but it's still really strong, that feeling. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because well see, first of all like I said, I told her one day. I said, "I wish I had some friends." Because it's like, it's going to be the same thing all over again. To find a friend like Jodie is going to, you know like take a lifetime. Maybe I'll never find another friend like her. And like, partly it's because I don't want everybody. But I do want somebody who's really a real good friend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like there is one girl at work who's quite like something because she's like a foster girl background like I do. That we have lots of common ground. But like, I can't really explain it, you know. Like people do lots for you. You know like I can't help but think about like all the things Jodie's done for Eliza. And like I don't remember Eliza doing all that much for her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 1:02:03.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I don't mind this if this is the way you want to be. But like, well Jodie and I are more alike anyway in that way. But, you know I say to myself like, "She likes Eliza as much as she likes me. Or just about as much. And like what does Eliza do for her really?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like she got her the job at the school. The one I was supposed to get first of all. And you know like she keeps her going with money you know and teaching so she makes extra money. And like she's always, I don't remember ever Eliza ever asking her to go out. It's always Jodie asking Eliza. You know always asking her to go along. She's never been to her house. Well that's because of her mother mostly though because her mother is you know like doesn't like Jodie because what Jodie helped Eliza you know to progress and change a lot of her views. And kind of took her out of her grasp a little bit, you know. And it's like, well like I'm going to ask her out again. But like, Eliza has asked me out exactly once in all the time that you know. She asked me to go to a party. And it was only because she felt sorry for me because I wasn't going anywhere. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And partly I think, you know like I knew something I never told Jodie and that was that she got an invitation to a party in the neighborhood from this fellow from the bike shop. Well we had both been out to the bike shop together. And so the invitation, I didn't mean to read it. But it was like open or something like this and I just read it. And then I saw on the bottom, oh this was to go to Jodie. Sorry. And it said, you know, the party's going to be such and such and your roommate definitely is invited. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm a room mate, you know. So who goes but Eliza. She asks Eliza to go. And so first of all I guess maybe there's a little bit of hurt and I kind of directed it to Eliza and Jodie both. And then I guess Eliza kind of knew maybe because I was going through really a bad period then. That was like, aww. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then so like, all right so I understand why she didn't want me there because like I was like half, didn't know where I was going and what I was doing. And you know like some of the time I was still with the fellows you know like trying to get attention and everything. But it was like, hell it was like a rejection and I didn't like it. 1:04:00.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it was a lousy thing to do to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like ok so then she then she takes Eliza and like again Eliza asks me out of almost out of I think she kind of felt bad because I think Jodie probably told her. So she asks me to go to a party. Yeah and then when I'm there she doesn't pay any attention to me because of her mother. You know it was like her mother was there so like she had to be distant. And it was like, you know I say well what has she done for me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She says she loves, she really cares about me. She's got a love like a friend. And yet like what has she done for me and why should I have to be doing all this? Why should I have to be home when you invite her over for dinner to talk about your trip?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why should I have to be home? You know. I didn't invite her over to dinner. You did. </p>

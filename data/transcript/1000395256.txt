<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) As soon as I came in here I started thinking about how I uh, well I guess felt, Friday included, but anyway over the weekend, I know I was Saturday, and then yesterday.  And it was, I suppose, just like so many other times that I used to get stomachaches and I had a stomachache the whole weekend and uh, but I don't think there was anything wrong with me.  And I noticed that I, it would be particularly bad whenever FSO coughed, because her cold, I think her cold was getting better, but her cough got a lot worse. </p>

<p>And in one sense, I really was concerned for awhile, because it sounded so horrible and I'd never heard a baby that young cough before with a cold.  And uh, but I don't know, in another way it was more that it reminded me that she was there and needed something from me, and, or might need something from me.  And I wasn't even sure if, I mean, in light of last week in talking about at the end, my feelings about her, it seemed like it must have something to do with her.  But I wasn't even sure if that were it entirely.  I know it made me feel very nasty toward MSCZ, almost as if I could blame him for the way I was feeling.  And not just for the stomachache, but for what—, whatever was behind it.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And then when, I don't know, I, I thought of that, and then immediately I thought of something that hadn't really occurred to me lately, but I noticed just like before she was born, I didn't like people telling me what I was going to find I was doing, or would have to do, or would want to do.  And, I mean I didn't mind them saying, I do it this way, but I did mind them telling me that was the way I was going to want to do it.  And then after she was born, I noticed that I wasn't quite as bad when people would make suggestions to me, but I don't know, I, I, I reacted in a defensive way when an_ anybody ever told me any,  gave me any advice about taking care of babies, or with her in particular. </p>

<p>And I think I thought of that, I don't know whether it's connected with this feeling I had over the weekend, but I think I thought of it right away in here, because of your s—, your saying to me, "Watch out for the paint."  And, and I can't figure out why I'd react that way, because I wasn't thinking about the paint, so it was nice of you to warn me.  But I think I reacted defensively immediately, when you said that, too.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How do you mean defensive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost like, you don't have to tell me that.  Except that I wasn't thinking about it, so the only way I, I me—, I either would — nothing would have happened and I wouldn't have thought of it ever, or I would have gotten paint on me, and then I would have thought of it.  And so I don't know why I'd react that way.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Also, maybe it's something else I've told you that —</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I don't like?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, right.  That's connected with your stomachache whenever FSO seemed worse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it ma—, m—, m—, reminds me of uh, one of the days last week after you brought up that what I, we—, all the different things I've been talking about seemed to point, in part anyway, toward my feelings about her.  And uh, I don't know whether you said something like this, or whether I just began thinking it, but (Clears throat) thinking of her getting worse seemed connected with my desire to get rid of her, or I mean thinking of something horrible happening seemed connected with a wish that she weren't there, or s—</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yes, maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I immediately want to deny it, because I think how can I feel that way, because I do want her to be there, but in a way I don't.  (Sniff, Pause) I don't know what connection this has, except that it's my mother telling me things, and I didn't want to hear her telling me.  But it made me think of the fact that all, all through my growing up years, she'd always be telling me, "Don't worry."  Because I think I probably was a worrier.  Or things concerned me, and It made me feel worse to have somebody say, "Well don't worry."  Because they were worrying me.  And, and yet at the time, I used to deny that they were worrying me, they were just on my mind, or something.  And so I used to think that was why I was annoyed. </p>

<p>But uh, it makes me think in particular, uh, I, I think it was, my mother was down for a week after I came home from the hospital, then she went home.  And then she and my father came back for just the 3 days, right around Christmas.  And I think it was that second time, we were going somewhere and I couldn't find anything I could fit into, and I, but I don't think my feeling upset about it, h_ had as much directly to do with the fact I couldn't find things to fit into, as just, it was my frame of mind anyway. </p>

<p>But uhm, I was trying 1 or 2 things, and then looking for something, and my mother was sort of hovering over me, saying, well, "Don't worry, don't worry.  In a short time you'll be back the way you were, so you'll be able to fit into things."  And I just, I felt my usual, my old way, I mean of years ago, of feeling just completely mad at her and uhm, annoyed and frustrated and everything, that she'd be saying that.  And I was surprised, because generally now I can, I do—, I don't know whether it's, think well, it's my own feelings, it has nothing to do with my mother, or not that much.  Or whether I just keep quiet when things bother me, and I'm not going around being as unpleasant.  But this time I reacted in my old way, I really flared up at her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But it is true, wh—, I w—, I don't know, just somehow, I guess thinking, because I said I reacted my old way, uhm, then I was thinking, well things worked out very well when she was there for the week.  It was — I think MSCZ was the one under the most tension then, because he was just sort of like playing host to a guest the whole time.  And our apartment is small enough, so that it was kind of hard on him, I think.  But as far as I was concerned, I was glad my mother had come.  And I was surprised, because I never felt any of the feelings of annoyance or anything that I often do feel if I'm with my parents for very long. </p>

<p>But i—, I was just thinking now, it was almost as if I were back to being her daughter, and she was in charge, and she was taking care of me, I mean, which she was literally doing.  And, that she, she was trying to be careful in a way, I think, not to boss me about on how to take care of FSO.  But yet, if she had, I, I probably would have been horrible, because I think I was falling very much into the role of being the daughter that had to be taken care of.  And th_ then I don't know where FSO fits in.  It was almost like I didn't have to somehow face up to FSO, until my mother left.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>I'm s—, I mean, I was sort of hearing myself say again that it seemed like my being upset at FSO's coughing had something to do with — and maybe my reaction to you, your saying, watch out for the paint today, too — to the thought that, in way I want to get rid of her, so then I get more upset when something's happened to her that might turn into getting rid of her.  I mean it might turn to something serious.  (Sniff) And, I mean I was just thinking, that whenever I have gone out and left her, I suppose to an extent even coming here, but I mean more, I think, unusual times, or times that aren't part of my routine when I go off somewhere.  Especially if we are — I mean, we haven't done it very much, think we've only done it twice. </p>

<p>But if we go out either to somebody else's house or out to dinner, or something, and leave her with the babysitter.  And then when I come back, I'm really happy to see her, and, and I don't know, I enjoy her in the way, or at least I think I am, that I'm always thinking I wish I could enjoy her.  And if I'm, if I don't get away like that, it just, things are more apt to fall into a routine, and I'm very mechanical and spending my time just sort of taking good care of her.  Although I'm not so much now, but I mean, it used to be very much that way.  And I guess I'm wondering now, if it has anything to do with, too, this desire that she weren't there.  So I feel sort of guilty when I come back after having left her, because I'm so happy in a way, to have left her.  (Pause) 
 
I don't know, I find it hard to deal with, because I don't know whether I'm telling myself this to make, make it seem like I really don't feel the way I do.  Or whether there can be these 2 opposite feelings involved.  But I keep thinking, that I really, I mean there are times when I can admit, sort of wishing that she weren't there, so I'd feel so tied down.  But that isn't as extreme as really wishing I could get rid of her, as, as it seems that I do feel sometimes.  And, maybe is underlying things.  But then other, other times I'm thinking well, I'm glad she's there and I really love her, and I enjoy her, and things like that.  And I don't know whether I — well I don't know, it just seems like the 2 things are so opposite. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, it's always been hard for you to imagine feeling opposite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I suppose that's just another way of, my attempt to have control over myself and my life, and everything.  Because I, I was sort of thinking that it's not only finding it hard to imagine people can have, or that I can have contradictory feelings, but that I don't know, I can have more than 1 motive, or more than 1 reason for a certain feeling, or, I don't know, it just seems like I'm almost trying to see everything in a very simplistic way.  And, I suppose if, I don't know, it just strikes me right now, that's part of my, if, if things are simple, then they'll be easier to control. </p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking too, about something that I sort of vaguely known or at least thought, but it struck me this weekend — or I don't remember just when it occurred to me and seemed so very important, but at some point it did — uhm, because I was thinking well I'd had a, I had to renew a prescription for some hemorrhoids that I'd had, and I don't know, I mean, the timing was probably that they'd get better anyway.  But it seemed like they got better faster, when I started coming back here.  And I don't know whether the fact they'd gotten better faster had anything to do with it. </p>

<p>But it just seemed to me, when I was thinking about them, that this particular time, that I'd really caused them to happen.  Well, I mean, it was part of, I guess, what you'd been pointing out to me of my attempt to control everything, keep a very tight rein on things.  But I don't know, it, well, I mean, it would be part of it I guess, but it almost seemed like I didn't want anything to come out of me.  (Pause) And I don't know whether it's part of that, or part of something else, because it seems like sometimes I let myself do things like get tired, so then I can be tired, or I, almost as if I enjoy feeling uncomfortable. </p>

<p>And I don't know whether there's something about that, too.  Because there were 2 different times before, e_e_ each time before I had the prescription, that, uhm, I was extremely uncomfortable.  And it's almost like I caused them to happen, and to happen enough so that I'd really feel uncomfortable.  Because they didn't occur until — I mean, I might have had a little bit after FSO was born, but (Sniff) I didn't have any great discomfort or anything until several weeks afterwards, and it seemed like, I don't know, my thinking I don't know that much about them, but that somehow, if I were going to have really bad ones right after she was born, they would have occurred sooner.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Now you were making the point, uh, which you clarified you said, when you talked to your mother, was that she had hemorrhoids after Bill.  Eh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.  Hmm.  But I, yeah, well that brings me back to the question I'd had last week of just, I don't know, wondering why I would sort of try to make myself repeat her experience after Bill.  Because I hadn't had a boy, and it, I don't know, it just, I, I, maybe I'm sort of caught on the thing that I didn't have a boy, and so it would seem to me I wouldn't want to repeat what my mother had experienced after Bill.  But then, I, I, I suppose what I, strikes me right now is I'm wondering, maybe I think somehow if I repeat what mY mother went through after having Bill, that it will turn FSO into a boy, or what I wanted in some way.  (Stomach growls, Pause)</p>

<p>And it just, I d—, I guess I just immediately thought of uh, well in particular, the BFM son.  Uhm, we were there last night, and so it might be why they particularly come into my mind.  But uhm, I've been aware for quite awhile lately that I feel awkward with him, he's almost 6, I think.  And so he's right at the age of all the children I used to teach, and I keep, I think that's why it has struck me now.  And I don't know whether I used to be awkward with him, or not.  But lately, I certainly have been.  And it, I was just wondering right now if it's connected with, I don't know, some feeling on my part, of being jealous or somehow feeling what I had is inferior to the first child the BFM had.  And yet then, then I get upset at feeling that way, although I was awkward with him before.  And I'm not, I don't feel awkward with their daughter.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then that makes me just think that, well it makes me think of when I was growing up I was, after a certain point, I don't remember when, I became aware of boys and be_ began to feel awkward with them.  But certainly, I know by high school I was feeling very awkward with boys and now I'll often feel awkward with men.  And so i—, I don't know whether it's all part of that, or — although I suppose my wanting FSO to be a boy is part of that, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And what I thought next, was I don't know whether this is the answer to it, or part of an answer to a question I'd had.  Once I started talking about my feelings about FSO, but I was — if my feelings were so strong that I wanted a boy, then I was wondering, well, I wondered why I'd want a boy that strongly.  Because it seemed beyond just the feeling that, I don't know, the boy — well, a man should feel that way about a boy, more than a woman. </p>

<p>So I was wondering, and It just, I don't even like to say it, I guess I'm having a hard time even thinking about it.  Yet it seemed like, if I'm feeling so awkward with men, or anybody male, It's part of a wish to have a relationship with him, I'm not even sure I, I guess it must be sexual.  Because I don't know why else I'd feel that I had to suppress it.  And, I don't know, it just s—, I just thought, I'm wondering if my wanting a boy was because then I'd have a male around to fulfill this wish that I'm always hiding from myself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, why should you not want to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, I , I think partly because I still feel the way I always have about just (Sniff), I don't know, I guess, I guess it's just having sexual feelings of any kind toward men in general, or MSCZ in particular.  And sometimes I think of it as because I'm feeling it more, toward more people than just MSCZ, or that it's just sort of a general feeling on my part.  And then, it seems worse to me if I'm going to feel that way toward a son of mine.  Or th_ that I want a son for that reason. </p>

<p>And what it reminds me of, although the age differences and our roles are entirely different, but it just reminds me again, of, of a period of time when I practically expressed the wish by doing things with Bill.  And that, well there was that one time, I know, when I at some point had him in bed with me, when we were at some hotel.  And I don't know how that happened.  Except we must have all been sleeping in the same room.  (Sniff)  And maybe not much happened when he was in bed with me, except that I must have had a desire for more to happen on my part.  At least, something was in my mind, that has always made me think of it and feel guilty.  (Silence) 

Well, the next thing that came to my mind, I, I don't want to talk about it, or think about it, I guess, because I think I have some motive I don't fully realize yet.  But that, I don't think I'm going to like it when I find out.  But I, I started thinking about, well, I guess it was mostly, my desire which I've sort of hidden it in the fact that I have to go out every afternoon and people are going to be wondering where I'm going.  But uhm, I think anyway, I just have a desire to tell people that I'm going through analysis, and I don't think it's just part of a thing where I'm accepting it, and therefore, I don't mind people knowing it.  It's an active thing on my part, an aggressive thing, somehow, of wanting to tell people. </p>

<p>And I suppose, I was thinking of it in particular, because uhm, again last night, well, uh, we were talking about another couple, the DGK, w—, w—, this is the couple I introduced to the BFM and I was so worried about a long time ago that they'd become friends, and we'd be left out, or I would be left out.  And they have become good friends, but I mean it hasn't — and there is a 3-way competitive situation sometimes, which I don't like, but it isn't as bad as I anticipated. </p>

<p>But anyway, uh, the DGK are separated right now.  This happened just recently, and MPC is going, this is, the fellow is going to an a—, well, a psychiatrist, I don't know whether it's analysis or not.  And the BFM were mentioning, or talking about that last night, a little bit.  And then, FNI just said, mentioned somebody else going, and said, everybody I know is going.  And again, I had this feeling of, you don't know everything and, and wanting to tell her.  And I think more than with many people, I've had a desire to tell FNI.  And I don't, and I, I have had a s—, a very strong reaction to her telling me things to do, and so forth, with FSO.  And just generally, I think I feel very competitive with her.  And I don't quite understand how this desire to tell her works in.  But, and it's not just with her, but it seems to be strongest with her. </p>

<p>And I'll sometimes, especially after I got home and I was trying to find somebody, and FNI had — that was one of her pieces of advice, too, was to get somebody to come in every day, so I could take a nap or be free to go out, or something.  But uh, I knew I was trying to find somebody and I wouldn't be using them that way, and she would think I was.  And I was feeling very angry that then she'd be thinking well, your life's pretty soft.  You've got somebody coming in every day and you're getting off.  Or can do whatever you want and kn—, and my knowing I wasn't, and feeling, I don't know, I was just feeling very angry, and that I should tell her things with the way she thought, at all.  And yet I don't think that was the real reason why I wanted to tell her. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you suspect is the real reason?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I find it very hard, I've asked myself that before, too.  And I know one time I was talking with MSCZ about it, and he s—, he said to me, this is all I can think of, and I don't know whether it's true or not.  I, I think at first I was denying it.  But now I wonder, and, and yet, well, I'm just not sure.  But he, he said, "Well I think you, you feel superior, or that somehow, it will make you feel superior if you tell her."   
ANALYST:   Well, you know, in a funny way, that, that fits something I was thinking.  You see, the real puzzle I suppose, is why you want to tell her right now, especially since I remember in the past, you uh, you didn't want her to know.  Or at least you felt it was very important that she not know, part of which you attributed to MSCZ.  But you know, it occurs to me now, that you should feel competitive like this, and the feelings you expressed about telling her would make sense, at a time when you feel that uh, in another way you haven't really competed in your own eyes, successfully.  You haven't competed with her in having a son, nor with FYC, nor with FNA, nor with all the other women who had sons first.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it is true, that all the friends of mine who had daughters first, I feel very relaxed with.  And I was just thinking there's uh, well, 2 friends in particular who had girls very recently first child, who have both, one in particular out, right outwardly said, if you ever want any advice, ask me.  And the other one has implied it.  And I didn't feel annoyed with either of them.  But if somebody like FNI said it, or even gave it, I would feel really annoyed, or FNA, or, I, me—, whether it was through my mother or directly to me, I can't remember which, suggested there might be questions I'd have that she would be able to help me with, because her child is older.  I mean, enough older so she would have been through it.  And I was thinking, I'd never ask her anything. </p>

<p>I, well, another thing that occurred to me is, when, when you were talking is that, I mean, this has been a real issue at times.  I'll bring it up over and over.  I don't realize I am, until MSCZ will say you've brought that up.  It's almost like I'm bringing it up on the hour, or something.  At least every day for a period of time.  Mainly in connection with telling FNI, but just — sometimes it will really bother me about telling people in general, or not being able to, because it still is something that MSCZ doesn't want me telling anyone.  Because he doesn't feel that it would be a good thing for him in business, for people to know.  And if people know about me, he's afraid that, because of the times he's off and so forth, that they'll know about him, too.  And uhm, and I don't, I don't know, how this works into it, too, of sort of the fact it's not my choice one way or the other, for whatever motives I have.  He's telling me I can't do it. </p>

<p>And I think maybe I keep bringing it up, because I want him to keep telling me I can't do it.  (Swallows) And I don't quite understand that, either.  (Sigh, Pause)  Although it seems that my wanting to tell people, I don't know, sometimes — well, I suppose it's 3 things.  Sometimes it just seems that it would make life easier when I'm, I mean some people have given me names of people to try for baby-sitting and so, they're wondering what it is I'm doing.  And uhm, I suppose, sometimes I think it would just be easier to be able to be honest, and, or just frank.  I mean, sometimes I just don't say anything, so it's not that I'm being — making up a lie.  But I, I feel I might have to, and I don't like that feeling.  And, but then I, the strongest times, feelings of wanting to tell, seem to come either like with FNI, where I'm feeling competitive, or when it's the case with somebody else getting some kind of help, whether it's analysis or some other form, and so that it would be a matter of sort of sharing feelings, and I don't know, sharing an experience that, I guess, you always like to share, if you can.  And uhm, but that, even then that seems easier not to tell in that state, than when I'm feeling competitive. </p>

<p>And I don't quite understand why I'd, why it would make me feel superior.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What occurs to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and then I mean, I think, well I do in FNI's case, who's a very high-strung, nervous person, I imagine what I'm thinking is, you have problems, too.  And sort of like, I'm doing something about mine.   
And it, I don't know, kind of like, in this area I know more than you, and that type of thing, as if, I don't know, somehow I'm thinkingI'm more of a complete person than she, and she couldn't be unless she went through analysis.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So at a time when you maybe in some way feel incomplete, because you had a daughter instead of a son, it might seem especially important to you to want to do this, for example, which, as you say, makes you feel more complete.  So you have some compensation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, m—, m—, uh, that is m—, a—, you're putting it in words I wasn't, I hadn't thought, I mean it's clearer, but that does seem like exactly what I was saying and yet when you say it, it sounds crazy, almost.  I mean, not — well, that's kind of a strong way to put it, but (Sigh) I, I, I suppose, I mean, I start asking a question, how can first of all, I mean, how can telling somebody like FNI I'm going through analysis, make me feel more complete?  Or how can even having a son, make me more complete?    

And, I mean, in a way I know how, and from what I've been saying today, but I guess what I'm thinking is, it won't work.  (Pause) I think that must be — because I remember before I might have even said it here, thinking in a way it was lucky we didn't have a boy.  Because the feelings that I would have put on a son would have been so overwhelmingly strong for him and for me, that it would have been awful.  And I think that might be part of what I was feeling, that it would have seemed like then, what I wanted I got, but yet I don't think I would have been satisfied.  (Sniff, Sigh, Pause) 
 
I don't know, it r_r_ reminds me somehow, of being pregnant and wanting to stay pregnant, because I, then I felt complete or well, full, in many senses.  And, and yet at the same time I was feeling very frustrated because I knew it had to end, and it wasn't the answer, yet I wanted it to be the answer, or temporarily I'd let it be the answer for what I wanted and for making myself feel better about myself.  And, I think maybe having a son would have been the same kind of thing.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I'm asking myself, something I'm not, you know I, maybe it's 2 different things, but I'm not quite sure about one, uhm, one is sort of how t—, I guess, how did I — as if it would explain why I think these things would make me feel complete, I'm asking, so how did I get there?  And yet I know I've talked about how I, well at least how I got to feeling being pregnant made me feel complete.  But I, I guess again, I'm just wondering how I think well, having a son would make me feel complete.  But beyond that, which having a son would be part of, this whole thing of my relationship with men, and what it is I want, and what it is I keep running away from.  And, because it seems like there's something in there that, if I have it, it will make me feel complete.  And yet, I think I shouldn't have it. </p>

<p>And it seems like then I thought I was going to, if I had a son I could under cover of having a son, get it.  (Sigh, Pause)  And then I think that it would, somewhere along the line, it was wanting to have a closer relationship with my father and that the way you have a close relationship with a man, is a sexual relationship. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up. </p>

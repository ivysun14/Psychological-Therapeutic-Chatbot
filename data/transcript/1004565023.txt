<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. How are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. Sorry, I just got a text. I made a new friend. It's no big deal. I'm going to rush myself for making a new friend. She's texting me. Anyway. These boots are awkward. So I kind of wanted to talk a little bit about the weekend with my friends. I saw Emma and Jay on Monday because we all had tickets to the game. Emma and I talked about it a little bit more because on Sunday morning we had talked and, I don't know if you'd say "had it out", but had the whole "what's up" conversation, then Sunday was great. Everybody got along and everybody was in a great mood, so we just talked more about it on Monday. It was a really nice. What you said was really logical and it made sense; and after I left, it's just not my fault if Emma has those feelings of insecurity. It's just not my fault, and so I need to kind stop trying to fix that for her in some moments. [00:01:48] It's like I really struggled with being aware of it and trying to make her be responsible for it. I feel like she wanted me to be responsible for it and saying like "you guys are really exclusive." I didn't say that to her on Monday. I had felt when she said that that it was true because sometimes I feel a little uneasy when I'm around people who are really good friends and I'm not close to them. That's a really awkward situation and I understand I should feel, but there's a difference between understanding how she feels and being responsible for it, so I need to find that place. I feel like when you do take responsibility for that and say "Yeah, I could see how Chrissie and I could be that way." I feel that's like me taking responsibility for that and allowing her to say to me, "This is something you do." And maybe that is true in certain circumstances, but I feel like for the most part it is something that she has going on more than I'm doing to her. Anyway, we just talked about it again Monday evening, she and I, and just re-went over how this is just the situation that she and I are often in and we're both extremely opposite in those situations and she likes to take her time and go slowly and I don't. [00:03:50] I like to get in and do it and I'm there and I want to do it, so it was nice for us to just talk when we were out of the situation again and talk more calmly. I explained a little bit more. I was really invested in Jay, her husband, having a good time because he hadn't ever been to Chicago. I shouldn't care if Jay has a good time (laughs). He'll make sure he has a good time. I know that. That is part of the reason.</p>

<p>I do want to see people around me happy and I don't think that should go away. (chuckles) The amount that I try to control needs to be toned down. [00:04:43] I feel pretty resolved with that and I feel like going into another situation like that (chuckles) I will be able to be a little bit more understanding and calm about it. I'm just used to doing it a certain way. Chris and I have been going on these little weekend trips for the last four years since we've lived here and I'm used to just going in and doing it like boom — let's go. Let's get on it. Let's go. And it's just not the same with a group of six people. I really need to work on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you come by this honestly, since it's such the role you played in your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely. Everybody get on my page. That is how I kind of operate. It's not very realistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being with a group of people, especially in Chicago, for two days is like herding sheep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. I can have so much patience with small children — like patience out the ear — but with adults I have none of it. I have none. It's like, "You're an adult, let's go," and that's a problem I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well with children, too, it's clear that you're in charge, even if they don't always recognize it. It's not really clear with adults who's in charge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. That's a very valid point. [00:06:35] I don't need to be in charge all the time. The thing is I'm really okay not being in charge all the time, it's when I feel that no one's in charge all the time that I have a hard time, like we're all in free-for-all. We're all kind of like, "Whoa — [ ]," (inaudible at 00:06:59) and I'm like, "No, we need a direction. This needs to happen. Somebody needs to take the reins here."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like with your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your parents were not in charge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no. No one was in charge. I don't know if that's necessarily such a bad thing that I like take control in most situations. I mean it's a bad thing if I'm being tortured, like this weekend it was a bad thing for me because I was torturing myself. If I'm going to lead those situations, then I need to do it with a grain of salt. I need to realize that they just may not follow. (chuckles) It may not go according to your plan. [00:07:56] A lot of times standing on a street and everyone standing around in a group is like, "So, what do we do? Where are we going to go?" and literally they will just stand there and people will throw out a bunch of ops. This particular group of people is just bad at making decisions. My friend, Jay, will not make a decision about anything ever, and that's infuriating for his wife and for us, who spend a lot of time with him. In those situations I feel okay being the one making the decisions because somebody needs to, but this is my whole life. I have a hard time with balance. It's "this" or "this", and I have a hard time co-mingling those things. How do I find a medium where somebody needs to make a decision, I'm okay with making the decisions, and then letting everybody go at their own speed — to kind of do that. That's kind of what I struggle with. It's exercising that muscle. (laughs) Isn't it? No? [00:09:13] What? What was this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You smirked like that was either right or that was not correct. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: H-m-m-m</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, see, that's how the brain works. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What? I wasn't aware of smirking. Is that what I was doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you smiled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seemed like I was weighing in on what you should do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. You were saying something with it, but I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very — you're sensitized to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go ahead and [need some what you belief, because I'm sign off with it], (inaudible at 00:10:04) because if I don't know what somebody means by it, if you and I were having a conversation on the street I would be like, "What was that? What do you mean? What's the smile about?" That's just what I would do. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any ideas on what it could be about or it's just confusing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was when I said, "I need to exercise those muscles," so I have three things that I think about it. I think you could either think, "Yep, you got it," or "Huh, that's wrong," or you're thinking that was a funny way to say that. Those are my three things that I would think about that, but in regular life I would have just asked you. 00:10:50</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you ask here to me in your "non-regular" life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (chuckles) What did the smile mean, I guess?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually wasn't aware I smiled. I have two thoughts. One thought is the extent to which you're sensitized to other peoples' response is certainly something we could continue talking about; and if I think about it, probably — I mean I wasn't aware at the time — I think I was responding to the fact that you tend to kind of want to put into place an action plan when you identify something. That identifying it without a plan to address it is hard for you and maybe that's why I was smiling; but I think that's what I was thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, plans need to be made because otherwise I feel like I'm just flailing here. I need to know things that are going to happen, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen if you just didn't know what to do with what you brought up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me feel totally out of control. I just feel when I come here and I talk about something and I don't know where to go with it, I feel really, really upset, and I leave and I feel like I'm not doing something right. I feel really stupid and I feel there's something that I'm not seeing and there's something really obvious that needs to be addressed. I just can't see that thing. If there's not a concrete thing to work on or a concrete thing that needs to change or a concrete thing that needs to change or a concrete thing that I'm doing wrong, then I feel lost. That's a really unsettling thing for me. [00:13:03] That just taps into this helpless feeling that I don't like. I feel unable to help myself and that's the most stressful thing for me to ever imagine. I don't rely on anybody else to help me. If I can't help myself then I'm f**ked. That's kind of it. Honestly, in these situations nobody else can help me but myself. If I'm not the one identifying the problem or the issue, it's certainly not something I can rely on somebody else for. I' m the one that needs to do this and I have those feelings from when I first came in here, like, "This will always be how it is. Nothing will change. This is it." It's like a sentence and when I can't see it, it feels like a forever thing. 00:14:36</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So by doing something you're helping to prove the opposite — that there is something, that this is not forever — it's like you need to convince yourself of the opposite?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum. And that there is a solution, a physical way out of it. So this is the problem and this is an attempt at a solution. Maybe it's not good work, like there is something I can do. I love control. (chuckles) I can control it by working on this. I like to fix all the little problems, apparently, (chuckles) not work on the bigger ones. It's just my desperate need for control. (chuckles) I mean that's the biggest issue I have. That is the issue that encapsulates all the little issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's control for fear of chaos. 00:15:44</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum. And everything seems chaotic. Everything. I haven't cleaned my apartment in months. I'm a very tidy person. (chuckles) All the magazines are put away. All the dishes are put away, but I haven't cleaned my house really, like swept and mopped and washed the windows, in probably two months and it drives me crazy. So we're doing it tonight because we have guests coming into town this weekend and we have a party and stuff and so like even Chris has nothing to do so he's going to start cleaning today. He's like, "All right, I can start. Leave me a list of what you want me to do," and I'm only leaving him a list of the things I feel okay letting him do. Shake out the rugs. Wash the windows, but don't go near the kitchen. I'll just take care of that, because he's just not going to do it right. On top of that, this is the hard thing I struggle with to, I could let him do it because he's offering to do it, and then I would come home and I would see that he didn't wash — we have a tile backsplash against the back of the sink and stove and it always gets gross and it drives me crazy — and he won't notice to do that. He won't wash the cabinets. I'll come home after he's cleaned the kitchen and I'll re-clean those things that haven't been cleaned; and I know that will annoy him because he'll think, "That's belittling me. I just did this and you're saying I didn't do a good job." My solution to that is just don't worry about the kitchen. I'll take care of it when I get home. (pause) [00:17:41] (chuckles)</p>

<p>I'm trying to strike a balance of things that I feel comfortable taking control over. I even said last night, he's like, "I can do the laundry while you're gone." I said, "Okay, but you're going to remember to sort the whites and the colors, right?" and he laughed at me. "Yeah, I'm going to remember it. Don't worry about that" (laughs) I can't . I can't. I know he laughs, but he did laundry last week and he didn't, and all my whites were right there unbleached. I'm trying. I'm really trying, but it's slow going for me. I have a sensitive husband. I know that I shouldn't put it all on him. The reality is we've had these situations before where he's said he'd do something and then I come home and it's not done how I expect it or like it to be done. And if this was a no-safe situation and it was just he was going to clean the house, I would just leave it and maybe clean it secretly when he wasn't around. His friend is coming in at 5 AM tomorrow and then he's staying at our apartment and I have a whole bunch of people coming over on Saturday for a party. I need the house to be clean and sparkling. But these are the things (chuckles) I can't just let go of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like there's a metaphor in that, too, letting someone in your house if it's not perfectly neat, tidy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I will never let anybody over, even if I know my friends — our best friends, Jay and Emma — even if I know they're coming and they're going to swing through the house to pick us up and they're maybe going to come in and say "Hi" and maybe use the bathroom, I run through the house like a maniac tidying because I thought they're going to be here in ten minutes. (chuckles) I need things to be in order. 00:20:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you feel if they came in and it wasn't, not dirty, but not super clean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would feel so embarrassed. I would feel so embarrassed and I would apologize profusely. I still already do and Chris looks at me like, "You need to calm down," because I'll say, "I'm sorry, that was really gross, I'm sorry." They'll say, "No, it's fine." My mom doesn't sit down. She does not stop moving. She is cleaning constantly. Constantly. It was a defense mechanism when I was growing up. I think she just wouldn't let herself sit. I didn't see my mom watch television until I was a teenager. She just didn't sit down, and she still does that most of the time at home. The counters are always perfectly wiped down and she sweeps the floor like five times a day. If people are coming over, everyone should clean their house, I think, but she's like everything is like done. (chuckles) For me, that's how a home should be. When people come to your home everything should be looking in order so they don't see the damaged people that live there. (chuckles) That was kind of a joke. 00:21:33</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't. It was a dark joke. I mean, obviously that's what it was. We should always look good on the outside. Everything should look good. We should wear nice clothes and we should look good and we should have a nice home, all those things, which is why me getting fat really bothers her, I think. (chuckles) That's a whole separate story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a separate story?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not. I think it's probably all one and the same, but definitely it bothers her that I'm not skinny. She won't say to me — they're very congratulatory but they're like, "Oh, have you lost weight?" every time I see them, which sounds like a nice thing to say, but it's condescending because every time I see you I can't have lost weight every time I see you. So I usually just say, "Nope. I think I've actually gained." She's always sending me, if she sends me clothes — which is a really sweet, sweet, really nice thing to do — but they're always a size small. It's like I'm not. I have size double D boobs. I'm not going to fit in a size small T-shirt. I'm just not. Always sending me clothes that are too small and always really congratulatory about exercising that I've been doing and kind of fibbing to me about (chuckles) running stuff. I know what she's doing, like telling me that you should always run at a 2 percent incline to simulate outdoor running, which is just a lie because everything you read says you run at a 1 percent incline on treadmills to simulate outdoor. Why would you say that to me? 00:23:51</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't simulate outdoor running on a treadmill, but that's a whole issue. You're jumping on a treadmill and you're not striding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to be . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the same thing . . . (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. You can't. I always run at a one. Thank you mother. I know how to run at a one, but there's just these things that she says. Like she said to me this weekend, she and my brother are splitting a marathon next weekend. She was going to go for a long run with him on Mother's Day, and he bailed at the last minute. I asked her why and she's like, "He thought I was going to push him too hard and he wasn't up for it, which I was. I was going to take him an extra two miles." It's like, "Mom, an extra two miles is not pushing him a little harder. Adding two miles when you're already planning to go an eight- to ten-mile run is way further for him." (chuckles) We don't all live up here like you do where you like for some reason don't feel pain. It's bizarre. [00:25:04] Anyway, that was kind of an extended tantrum. I do always feel less than. Like she can do things regarding fitness and exercise — she can do them better than me. It's like no. She made a point of my brother and me made a bet about who's going to run the half faster and it's all funny like, "What are you going to lose if I win?" That is pretty embarrassing for a 25-year-old kid to run slower than his 49-year-old mother. It's like that would be embarrassing grandma and you know Thomas is sensitive about that and he was really athletic growing up and he's just not now. It's a really sensitive thing for him. She thinks it will push him further. She thinks it will drive him. He'll do better because of it. I just think, "No, this is such a bad idea." [00:26:24] (chuckles) I haven't said it's a bad idea, because they both are fine with it. I'm going to keep my mouth shut because it's not my business. That's just how she is. She thinks these are ways to push her kids. She sees those things as they're better for us and that's her arena where she chose to push her kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've identified with her. You've internalized those messages.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm fat and she's not? I mean, it's just the reality of the situation. My mom . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's not what I was [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:08) on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Three inches taller than me and weighs at least 15 pounds less than me. It's just like when you see us next to each other it's just not normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not normal to have a mother that's so much better looking than me. (chuckles) Just doesn't feel right. It's not internal. I mean a lot of it's internal; a lot of it's external. A lot of it's right there for everyone to see. (pause) [00:28:03] At the same time, I know that I can't help my genes and I know that I get half my genes from my dad's side and that makes sense to me and I get that, but it's just very known that like my stepsister's mom is pudgy, and my parents only call her "pig". That's all they call her, which is incredibly — they've done that in front of my little sister since she was nine, which is a whole other separate problem. And her whole side of the family is — not chubby — but her mom's bigger and her stepdad's bigger and her [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:56) are chubby. My sister is tiny. She's my size and tiny, but my mom will always make a comment like, "Oh, yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:09) has got her mom's thighs." It's always a comment that her mom's chubby. It's always a comment about the [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:15) side, my dad's side, being chubby and how they're all big. If I ever say anything like I've got my dad's genes it's always like, "No, you didn't," like, "Ugh, it's disgusting you would say that." The truth of the matter is — I just did. I have a hard time with it. Obviously I'm not excited about that so please don't make disgusted comments about it. I already feel badly about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think I was commenting on when I said you internalized that? I think you took it a different way than I meant it, but I'm not sure how you took it. 00:30:02</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought you meant "internalized" like her success with physical activity over mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I was doubting your perception of what you were saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Just that I've taken roles that have kind of existed and internalized them maybe since I was too young to even do much about it, and then internalized it and made it into something that's kind of bigger than it is? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm-m. I think I was specifically referring to this feeling that you are less than, that you need to drive yourself, sort of being very hard on yourself the way you feel your mother is on you — being very critical. 00:31:03</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do. I'm also just frustrated. (sigh) I'm just frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Working out five to six days a week and not seeing results and feeling like if I could just do something different, then it would work and that what she's saying is true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a hard time embracing your own beauty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) That's not like a "thing" to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? 00:32:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see anything about myself as — this is really corny — attractive or beautiful or anything. I have really nice hair, really silky, but that's kind of it. I just don't believe it when other people will compliment. I feel you're throwing the fat girl kind of like a pity compliment, because you see those people and you're like, "Oh, you have gorgeous eyes," and that's what I always feel like it is, even that weekend our friends from [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:06) I don't know how this conversation came up, but it was the most awkward conversation. We were doing like a "what if" or asking questions for the group to answer and someone said, "What's your favorite physical feature about yourself?" Everyone went around the group answering it and it was the worst. Emma is 5'9" and weighs five more pounds than me, and Dawn is my height and blond and blue eyed and totally cute and perky. It's like — ughh. What an obnoxious question to ask right now. We had already talked earlier in the night about how I'm feeling really sad and gross and struggling with my weight. Everyone went around in the circle and it came to me and I was like, "I . . um . ." I sat there stumbling for a while and Chris was like, "Oh, come on." It was awkward. He was like, "She's fishing. She's fishing." I was like, "This is so uncomfortable for me." Finally my friend Dawn said, "You have great legs. I've always been really envious of your legs." I'm 5' 2½". No one who's 5' 2 ½" has great legs, so I just went with it like, "Yeah, I've got really muscular legs and that's totally my thing." Those conversations are so uncomfortable for me I could crawl into my own skin and just die. I just can't handle it. [00:34:37] It's just ughh. And then I'm mad at them like, "Why would you ask that question? That's such an awful thing to put everyone on the spot," and I'm mad at them for doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of immature.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really immature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An immature question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't understand why — I just didn't understand — maybe that's just me. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I appreciate that there are a lot of cultural norms and stereotypes, but you do associate being skinny with being attractive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just need to go to a couple of running races. Maybe that will [ ](inaudible at 00:35:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everyone's so muscular.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People don't look that good. Some people do. Again, I'm making a value judgment, but people are skinny and not necessarily ideally attractive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can see other people who are probably my size or little bit bigger and think that they're really attractive. I'll see other girls who are probably bigger than me. I'd be okay — she looks so comfortable in her skin. She looks so beautiful as she is and to me I see that and think, "I can't feel that way about myself personally."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's important because you feel what you're identifying as the problem is your weight; and yet you feel that right at this moment the problem is actually being comfortable with my body. 00:36:29</p>

<p>CLIENT: It absolutely is, but I don't know how to be comfortable with my body when I look in the mirror and I see something disgusting. The whole time I feel my neck fat giggling. Like "Gee, that's all I can focus on. That's all I can think about and that's all I can focus on ever," and I don't know how to have that go away. I just don't know how. It's a huge problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's self-consciousness that gets really played out with your physicality, your appearance, and it very much reminds me of you were talking about having to have your house spotless, that everything is about appearance, and a particular kind of appearance. I guess in that way I was also talking about your really internalizing your mom's message like making everything look nice as a way of almost distracting from what doesn't feel like it's so nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, absolutely. It's why I'm always up on trends. I'm always dressing "trendy". I would never put on something that I just felt good in just to wear it, because I would be like, "No. Those jeans are totally not "in" right now. I have to disguise it in other ways." 00:38:11</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You [make qualifiers as,] (inaudible at 00:38:17) especially about your appearance in here. What do you think about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's how I value things. I want people to know that I'm a certain way. I know that I come here looking disgusting. (chuckles) For me that's an embarrassing thing. I just left the gym and that's gross.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're worried about what I see or what I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm worried about what everybody thinks. (pause) But that's just the name of the game. I've learned it from every member of my family. My crazy, lunatic grandmother just went onto Facebook the other day and wrote something on the bottom. I had a wedding album on Facebook. I got married over a year-and-a-half ago. You can comment on the whole album and she wrote, "Nice pictures. Looked through all of them. Didn't see a single picture of you and me. Made me so sad because you were my first. Always fond memories. Love you always. Nanny," [00:39:42] and I just thought . . . I don't know. And then in the same night you can go see onto somebody's Facebook wall. She went on every single other of my girl cousin's profiles (chuckles) and wrote how beautiful they were on the picture of each one of them. I felt like . . . one of my cousins was just in a play and, granted, she's like a little kid. She's fourteen. "Nanny's so proud of you. You're the most amazing," you know like this. And on my other cousins who are like eighteen about how stunningly beautiful they are. I can't help but think, "Was this all a little intentional? Because you did that after commenting on my wedding album about how I hurt you because there's no picture on Facebook of you and I on my wedding." The truth of the matter is the only picture I have with her is awful because she had just made me cry. You can see my eyes are bloodshot red. She had yelled at me and I had just been crying in the picture. That's why I didn't put it on Facebook. (chuckles) But the only reason she wrote that is because family members of ours can see the wedding album — at least how I interpret it — and can see there are no pictures of she and I together. It's like I'm sure it hurt her feelings that there isn't a picture of she and I on Facebook. I know this all comes from an insecurity for her, but writing that to me in a public format like that isn't the way to make it better, in my opinion. (chuckles) [00:41:49] To me, it's embarrassing. It's all spelled wrong. She can't spell "made" or "feel" correctly. There was no punctuation. It was all . . . 00:42:04</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she an illiterate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't know. She's never worked. She's never had to challenge herself since high school. She married my grandfather right out of high school and just stayed home and had kids. Now hangs out with her girlfriends and plays golf and drinks. She reads. She'll read like John Grisham novels and stuff like that. So I deleted it. I don't need this on an album on my wedding for people to see and look at this. I don't want to look at this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I ask that question because you see her as so powerful. People graduate high school and don't work. They still can write stuff. "Feel" and "made" are pretty basic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. 00:43:17</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's something going on with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean she drinks herself into oblivion every night for the last twenty years. I'm sure she's damaged a lot of cells there. It makes me feel embarrassed. I was saying to Chris that I think of myself as a fairly intelligent human being who likes to learn and wants to better themselves. I see where I come from sometimes and it makes me more defiant. I'm sure she thinks of herself as an intelligent person, but I come from that and so I just think like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm totally fooling myself. This is what I come from and my dad is not smart. I'm just totally fooling myself."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you say that about your dad? 00:44:07</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's a moron. He doesn't make sense. He's gone. There's nothing logical. It's the drugs and the alcohol. He's just not a smart person. (chuckles) He maybe was at one point and I just never saw it. (pause) But they care all about appearance, too, that whole side of the family. That's why my grandmother was so mad when I would tell her best friend's daughter-in-law about things going on with our family. It's like, "Don't tell anybody anything," and then it was a whole big problem. She was the one where with the car, too, who I would spend a lot of time when I was growing up. They lived through the backyard. Everybody cares. Everybody cares a lot about what everybody thinks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there's so much insecurity. If you feel good about yourself you're less likely to go outside for affirmation and validation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's why I moved so far away. I just don't want to be in a place where I need to care about going out. I'll run into . . . caring about what everybody around thinks all the time because we know everybody. That's why I just needed to go to a place where I didn't know anybody and it didn't matter anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you so much.</p>

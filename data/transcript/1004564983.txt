<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like I've been on this sort of crazy emotional roller coaster for the past 48 hours because yesterday I had the most amazingly great day not because of anything that happened, but I woke up feeling relatively rested. I'm not talking like energetic jumping out of my skin but rested and in moderate amounts of pain but not like anything I couldn't deal with. And it was like the best day ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was literally the best day I've had in two years. And it's weird because I was trying to explain to people it wasn't anything specific that happened. It wasn't like I was feeling especially (pause) physically above and beyond like elated or this, or that in terms of (pause) the way I was feeling. It was just gone for a while or mostly gone. Like when you're taking pain medicines that are narcotics the lack of pain is a different feeling. [00:01:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it usually has sort of like a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean for the lack of pain as compared to just having it be gone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a different type of lack of pain and also, just like I said, not feeling super hyperactive or anything like that but just feeling like wow it's not that bad. I'm not that sleepy. I'm doing okay which was absolutely fascinating seeing as that I spent most of the weekend sleeping including Friday to Saturday where I spent like 15 hours maybe. So normally when I do that I get more sleepy. So pardon me for just a moment. I just need to make sure this isn't anything. [00:02:18]</p>

<p>Okay. Great. So I went from having this fantastic day. I was very careful not to overdo it because sometimes when I'm feeling pretty good I overdo it. And then I walked in today which I'm feeling sore and screwed up but not like nearly as bad. I mean honestly if I could have one day every other week that felt like yesterday I'd just be thrilled. I mean seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'd be a different world I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd be a different world. I really had to keep myself from doing things like saying this is the time I want to reorganize my house and all that kind of stuff. It wasn't like I had energy to burn but you still kind of want to take advantage of it. [00:03:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. I imagine it's like not being so better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so it was really nice. And then today I was feeling really, really crummy, and then I walked into the world's biggest disaster trap at work. And so at first I got really, really defensive and I realized that I'm almost always when I am presented with something that something goes wrong, I immediately assume the worst and always backpedaling trying to deal with something. But then I'm like wait a second this isn't my fault. Screw this. Finally I'm like you know what I did nothing to deserve this. And then having to get this resolved and then explaining to my boss that for a while it was simpler. It's very hard to actually get them to believe you at this that it is easier to accept blame and say I'm sorry and just get it over and done with than to actually scramble for the no it's not my fault and let me prove to you why. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>I think they believe me. I'm not entirely certain, but I had to explain to them that it's been so exhausting to deal with this that it's easier just to suck it up and say I'm sorry I did this wrong. Well then I get this track record of screwing, and I'm not actually screwing up. I'm just trying to get things done to keep going. So that's the reason I was late is that they wanted to have a meeting with me about something and I'm like oh fuck. I thought I was not going to be able to make it here in time. And if I was going to be late I was be like 30 minutes late.</p>

<p>But when I called my husband to tell him because I didn't have in hand information for you originally he offered to come out and get me. I mean he drove me to work this morning too because I was feeling crummy. And that really meant a lot both directions. One because I was not one of the people who was late this morning, which apparently there was a tremendous amount of people who were late this morning, and two because I need to be able to get to my appointment on time which is kind of a big deal and to see a friendly face instead of be on the bus to stew about how angry I am about certain things. So it was really - It did a lot to change... And I don't know how much this day was really a bad day more than just simply because it was so different than yesterday. [00:05:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it could be back to normal as far as anything you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but maybe I'm just taking it badly like you get a cold snap out of somewhere and you're used to warm weather. It feels a lot colder that kind of thing. But this is more than weather. And so (pause) I am just exhausted from being on this up down, up down kind of thing. And so I don't really know why yesterday things worked out. I haven't had that happen in many, many years and I guess that made me... [00:06:27]</p>

<p>I try really hard just to be happy that it happened and I was able to sit in the Square for 45 minutes in the sun and just read my e-mail without feeling like I had to drag my ass home so I can go to sleep. But it was just - It was more than - I can't necessarily expect that it'll ever happen again and that's kind of hard. And by I say ever happen again I mean it might as well be because it could be another two years. I mean that's the equivalent of ever. I'm not being over dramatic about that. And just having to deal with too many things that are up in the air are just more than I can handle right now. [00:07:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) using whatever goofy pain scale where are you? What's your typical range day-to-day as compared to yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the thing is it depends on what kind of pain it is because I'm able to bear other things better than others. Somewhere between a seven or eight every day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what was yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Five, four, something like that; much, much lower. I mean probably lower than that even. It was enough that I was noticing silly things in terms of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what? [00:08:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things like when I skinned myself in certain places; that kind of stuff. I don't notice bruises when I do that because normally I have so much intense pain that I don't notice little things. Oh, I guess I got a blister walking home; that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't notice until you see it because you're hurting so much elsewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That kind of stuff. But (pause) it is very difficult for me right now because of trying to stand up for myself, having done things wrong at work in the past and having decided to take the path of least resistance was saying... And quite frankly there's no reason in the world they should've ever believed me anyway so it was just not worth fighting on this. If a customer says you did something that you didn't do and you have done it in the past, therefore, it's easier just to say yeah maybe I promised them more than I could although I didn't. [00:09:19]</p>

<p>I can recover this data or I can do this when I couldn't, therefore - and this has been a decent amount of time but it's easier just to say okay whatever because once you screw up you can't live it down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like once you screw up at work sometimes it takes a long time to live it down. And having this much doubt cast was very hard. It makes me very bitter and unwilling to stick my neck out for anybody right now because it only comes back to haunt you. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Why wouldn't somebody believe you just because you said it and you tend to be honest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean but I have done it... Like say I screwed up something in the past something like oh yeah I told a customer that we could do this for them but we cannot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And were you honest about it then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why wouldn't you be honest about it this time? In other words you could say well if I made that mistake before everybody's going to think I made it again, but you could also say well if I was honest about it again people might just assume I was going to be honest about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sometimes I have to track this down. I'm being told oh well your name was on this piece of paper in your handwriting. And I look at this and this isn't my handwriting. At first when I hear your name is on something with your handwriting I'm thinking oh my God I must have flaked out and really said something. Then I look at this, this isn't my handwriting. My name isn't even spelled right in this. You see where I'm coming from? But I just take the benefit of the doubt sometimes. At first and then it became like... It's very hard. [00:11:30]</p>

<p>This morning I had somebody - this is where it started out - a customer who comes in and she insists... I don't know if she insisted. She told me otherwise but when I came in I was accosted with this well this person came into work with you and you weren't here. You promised that you'd be working with them and you weren't supposed to be here and you've made promises you're not keeping. And not just you're not keeping but like that you shouldn't be making promises like this. If you're going to work this out, do this during the hours you're scheduled. I'm like okay maybe I did. I can't imagine I did. Talk to her, no. I briefly lost it and basically told her I'm in a lot of trouble right now because they think I promised you this and I didn't. But somebody really wanted to make this into something, and I don't really know what's being manipulated or what isn't at this point. But I was so angry about that being put up to that... But sometimes it's just easier to say okay well maybe I did do that. [00:12:31]</p>

<p>My memory's bad but you know what when all is said and done I know I didn't do it. (Pause) It is hard for me sometimes to (pause) not immediately feel like I'm on the defensive and like oh my God what the hell did I do wrong now. Because quite frankly I've been on the defensive since 1998. It's kind of hard. And I don't communicate well when I'm on the defensive. I don't even make sense to myself a whole lot because I'm just so nervous that I go in the fight or flight response of oh my God what can I do to make this stop. I want to get out - not just get out of trouble but I just need to make this conflict end. So what can I do? What kind of self-flagellation can I get involved in that will let me walk away from this situation? [00:13:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me kind of like the sort of opposite or underside of the confidence you used to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you could generally be pretty sure you were right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) now it sounds like you start out generally kind of sure that you're wrong until...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I am wrong almost all the time lately at least...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like when it comes to piddly things like who's in charge of scheduling now or whatever it is, I'm wrong. Who's in charge of this, who is responsible for that, and what drawer we keep something in yeah I'm wrong. When it comes to knowing what can and cannot be done I'm right. But because I've lost my sense of... [00:14:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Confidence I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like if I do not keep vigilant all the time on this kind of stuff that it's coming back to haunt me and that's exhausting. (Pause) It's really exhausting. And this is going to seem like the world's most random thing in the world, (inaudible at 00:15:32) thing like (pause) - Oh God I don't even know how to start this. This has nothing to do with work and it's going to seem like the world's most random thing to bring up. [00:15:43]</p>

<p>So as you know my turtle passed away, and I went for a very long time without any sick animals; things like that. Well Athena was injured. The other two are Isis and Athena. We had this theme here. Isis lately has been nipping at Athena and she's really, really badly hurt right now. And I don't really know why. I'm really upset about the whole thing. I've got them separated. Right now one of them is getting cared for. The last time I did something I pulled this whole oh my God this is what went wrong. The next thing you know I'm burying an animal. So I'm like I don't know... I feel like I need to be a lot more vigilant because I was pretty darn vigilant last time and I still had things go wrong in ways that I can't understand. [00:16:38]</p>

<p>And so now I'm getting a text message from my husband. I'm like look before you go to work can you stop in and check in on the turtles? I haven't had to feel like I needed to check in on my pets to make they're still breathing in a long time, but it happened recently. And it feels like every time that I don't do these kind of things - and I don't believe the universe is coming back to haunt me. I just feel like sometimes I don't feel like I have enough control over that kind of stuff. If I don't constantly monitor and keep up to date with everything that is humanly possible, then something bad can happen. Like if I don't find out who is currently doing the scheduling and understand it completely, then when it comes down to it and I need to know that I'm going to make ass out myself. So why don't I just every month ask just casually oh who's doing this. I can make sure that later I don't have people rolling their eyes at me saying why aren't you with the program. These are not irrational expectations because I've had a series of - in all these different pieces in my life I've had a series of data points showing that when I don't do this. [00:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no I imagine you just can't trust your mind the way you used to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or others sometimes either. Like one of the moves I had people were like relax, sit down, everything's going to be fine, we're going to help you move. I still haven't found half the stuff in that move like literally haven't found the stuff. Don't know where it went to at all. You know I feel like... It isn't even just trusting myself. It is trusting everything trusting people, trusting this. I mean I feel like I have to keep records of what's in what box, what's happening. I feel like I'm really just unable to relax anymore because if I don't constantly be checking around me to make sure everything's okay, then it all goes to hell. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>And I'm not the person who goes back and checks their doorknob 50 times to see if the door's locked except for... And I haven't done this in years but the point in which I realized I had left the door open made me check for quite a long time because I was regularly occasionally forgetting to lock the door. And so these were rational... Like I said, this is an example from many, many years ago. But it's like that kind of stuff. Little did I know that because I was living in Kentucky and when I became humid I couldn't figure out why the door wasn't actually locking. Wood expands so during very, very humid seasons I needed to be closing the door differently. But that actually really helped because I really thought I was losing my mind there for a bit. I feel like I'm picking up a case of OCD without actually having the disease behind it. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well sometimes people get a lot more obsessive in response to not being able to think or remember as well which, I guess, I'm imagining could be happening at times for you because of the pain, and depression, and the effects of some of the drugs that you've taken. It's actually not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm making the joke about the OCD because I knew people who were like that. But it's not like that at all. I don't feel like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It doesn't sound like OCD. It sounds like a kind of vigilance that comes from not being able to trust things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there are actually some... This is not what we're talking about, but just sort of identical. There are some people who have ADHD and OCD because they know that they're disorganized and can be sort of flaky or forgetful about things. And they sort of anxiously work very hard to compensate for that. (Pause) It's a problem but you can see how there's some sense in that reaction. They're just trying to manage something they inherently had difficulty with. This could be something - it's not quite like that, but a little bit like that. [00:21:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like right now and sometimes it's just the active of managing the task is helpful. Like I scan in a lot of things that way at least I know that I can find it. But I don't have to keep checking to make sure they're there. I don't feel like... Okay, with my job I do because that could change but that's just because there's an external force that's changing it. I don't have anyone going to my computer and rearranging my files. But (pause) it's constantly like that and I feel like I'm just very unable to cope with the changes that are happening. It isn't just that I'm forgetting. It's also that things are changing and I'm not - either I'm not noticing. But I'm actually really to suspect that I'm being kept out of the loop. Pardon me for a second. I need to make sure this isn't - because I have to go to work tomorrow. [00:22:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Shows okay but that just told me that a second ago. Why does it keep telling me that? Oh well. But it's like (pause) I feel like I'm really out of the loop on certain things and I've just not noticed. And part of it's the fact that I've been working for Microsoft too long so if someone asks me how something's done I'm like okay I can tell you all the ways it's been done over the years. I have no idea what the current way is to do something. That's part of it.</p>

<p>I had to force myself for a long time not to memorize things because they would change anyways. And it was sort of like a... It was always sort of like it's always going to be that way until next time, but no one actually ever wants to say that. I'm like that will actually state until next time this is exactly our procedure but this is the way it's going to be. No, it's going to be that way until you change your mind. I mean that's just the nature of having more than two people in a room and making decisions. It's not like it's a thing against my company. But I feel like sometimes thing just change so damn much that I just don't know, and I feel like I constantly don't know. And so I feel like I constantly have this learning curve towards that and it is frustrating. [00:23:51]</p>

<p>And sometimes they're things that I can't easily get the knowledge for. It would be different if there was a list of things like this is the first one for this. If there was an organizational list or this is what's happening that I could check easily but there isn't. So I have to make an ass out of myself every so often. And that's a lot of energy to have to manage. So that's pretty much the (pause) long and short of it in terms of that. But I just... I don't know. It's just really frustrating. I just want to get better so that I can be able to manage my life again. [00:24:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate doubting myself. It isn't just the medication though. I know that I'm doubting myself too because of the fact that I have been around people who have gone out of their way to make me feel like I'm insignificant and, therefore, I'm doubt myself. I mean (pause) just being told by - Even from the beginning of meeting my in-laws of the oh just be yourself. Stop being so fake. I am being myself. I'm not being fake. I mean that's just the beginning of the indoctrination of down is up, up is down, and getting all mixed up. [00:25:21]</p>

<p>And so it's... I used to feel very sure about things. Now I don't. And so the uncertainty is almost paralyzing sometimes. And I (pause) just don't know how to make it stop, and I don't know if I can. So until then I keep notes, I scan in everything because heck if at any given time I might need it, and occasionally it works out okay. Not everybody has to do this. Not everybody has to live this way. [00:26:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't used to have to live this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No (pause) and I don't like that. I keep hoping that maybe, maybe, maybe I can start repairing, regenerating some of these neurons that I killed when I didn't realize that I wasn't getting the B12 I needed, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we talked (inaudible at 00:27:11) but if you want to do the neurocite (sp?)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm actually feeling like right now I can. Before I was overwhelmed with too many things. Now I can finally do that. Now May is an insane month for me, but I really feel like if I call now I can talk to somebody in June or July and that would be fine. [00:27:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I can get you somebody's name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And do so at least I have it. There was too much going on all at once. I'm only finally now getting around to doing all the things that were just - and it sounds stupid to say that they were overwhelming, but yeah it was overwhelming for me. To get to the orthodontist was more than I could really handle. That meant that I had to figure out where the hell this one place was (inaudible at 00:28:02). Like I said, is it north, south, east, west? And so it seemed like it was a stupid amount of tasks, but the thing that kills me is that I know other towns or other things like that well enough that it doesn't bother me. I don't know why it's so exhausting right now here, and I think it's maybe because I'm making it to be that way. I don't know. [00:28:29]</p>

<p>It's (pause) I don't know. But I'm just being so - I was just so used to (inaudible at 00:28:45) so great. And yeah it was stupid to see it that way but... I even forced myself to rest even though I'm not that tired but I'm going to rest because I need to and it was just really nice. I'm good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, It sounds like it just really, really sucks to be back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't dare to think that it was going to be like the next day, but I wasn't dreading it either. I don't know. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I had a customer drop me off something that's supposed to help me with my life. They apparently saw me at one point with my cane and all this stuff. I have I kid you not I think it is some sort of psychological reinterpretation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. I'm not really sure if I'm going to burn, or I'm going to have friends over to drink and laugh at it. I don't know. But it has to do with bardo and transitions and how one side give up the ego of my pain and things will be fine. It's like some sort of Jung/pain management/hippie sparkle and Tibetan Book of the Dead book. And they bought it for me and they dropped it off. I don't even know who it is and put my name on it. And it's really kind of disturbing. [00:30:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Finally some answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. Like apparently I need to accept this and, therefore, my soul can transition onto the next part of my life. I'm like what the fuck? Please excuse my swearing but I've never seen anything so completely weird and contrived in my life. I mean I understand there's a lot of very vague... It's almost like saying that it's a blender and a vacuum cleaner at the same time. These things are very valid but when you shove everything together it's kind of creepy. It was so bizarre. I don't know why in the world... I mean it's weird because it isn't just me but the kind of relationship we have with the people we teach they have this desire to either fix us or do stuff like that. Occasionally they drop off food which is sometimes okay. I mean it's not all useless stuff, but it's just so strange. [00:31:12]</p>

<p>I'm not even really sure what to think about this one, but it was very strange. I'm having a laugh at work and I'm like the only way that's going to get any weirder if it was a pop up book. It was like drawn like Dr. Seuss; very strange. But yet they had an extensive appendix in which they're citing all these Jung, and this, and that. Well actually Timothy Leary was extensively talked about. Yeah I know. So I don't understand but yeah so that was kind of strange. But occasionally people will drop of shark pills and things like that too. Or when somebody's pregnant they'll bring them - I kid you not - what do you call these - not medallions - like talismans. Yeah, we get that a lot. Like things for healthy pregnancies or something. It isn't just me. It just feels like it because somebody saw that I was having trouble walking. I guess they took it upon themselves to do that one. [00:32:34]</p>

<p>But I understand that I need to stop fretting over being in pain, but quite frankly it's - there are a lot of things that you can distract yourself with and it'll be fine. This is not one of them. Just like I tried... And actually I went back and looked at some of my own things back when I actually bothered writing about my feelings about my husband's addiction. I tried to seriously distract myself and focus on myself. You know what yeah I got good at gardening. My husband was still an addict. You know it did not change a freaking thing. I learned how to plant tulips; still an addict. [00:33:20]</p>

<p>And I mean there are things - I mean with the pain it's a lot harder than that. There are ways to occasionally distract myself but not really. It's more about modifying things so that you can do stuff. I just don't like having to accept that there are things that I can't control. And even more so when I feel like I'm being a little bit gas lit in terms of like when I stop and immediately believe maybe that I fucked up and then go back and look at these things again and I think to myself maybe I didn't do this wrong. And then it becomes even more hard because it's... I'm not even making sense to myself. [00:34:22]</p>

<p>It's very hard for me to have this kind of vagueness in my life, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. It's frustrating. Although what I do at work it's supposed to be a skill I can develop and improve but I'm not really certain a lot of the stuff - I mean if I'm not just railing against not being able to do it just like I'll never be very good at Latin no matter how many times I take it. I don't know why I keep doing it. And I'm not really sure how to feel about being able to accept that. (Pause) That's really (pause) pretty much it. [00:35:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened with Mike's dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh he flew in this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I attempted to bail, but I'm not going to be able to. So they'll be in town. We'll see what happens from then. (Pause) I have a lot of worries and fears about that. Some of them I can control, some of them I can't. Some of them just has to do with the fact that my house is a mess. In my thoughts it's a mess. And some of them have to do with the fact that I am concerned they're going to want to more than I can physically do, or they are hoping that I have figured out what they want to do. And I'm really not good at that because well - whatever is in the city I haven't done it. I'm sure that they're like oh well whatever you want. Whatever it is I haven't done it. But I also don't really know them well enough to be able to suggest too many activities. They're passive enough to say oh we're easy. Don't worry. Just pick something out. Great. [00:37:34]</p>

<p>(Pause) We'll see. We'll see. I (pause) I've talked with my parents about my anxiety about this. I mean they don't know most of it. They do know and my dad doesn't really have a whole lot of wisdom for that other than just like it's going to be unpleasant most likely. Don't try and make yourself believe it's not going to be otherwise, and just muddle through it and they'll go which yeah that's really practical but it doesn't do anything for the sinking in one's stomach. My mom has less practical advice; more about building me up as a person and less about how to get through the day. [00:38:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other ways you're imagining it will go bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean we could be just staring at each other. Then there's my personal favorite where I just get so nervous I make an ass out of myself. (Pause) I won't know what to do, therefore, I won't know what to do or say to entertain them properly at least to [inaudible] belief and, therefore, I could be accused later on of being sullen and being standoffish. I've got some scenarios here. [00:39:26]</p>

<p>At one point when they went to come visit us we had thought about possibly going down to D.C. We were in Cincinnati. And they came to visit and we told them because it's true - I had still been having a lot of trouble with my sutures. I don't want to really get into too much detail, but it has to do with holes opening up occasionally and having to get things cauterized; that kind of stuff. And, therefore, sitting in the car having just had a breast reduction, having the seatbelt across that area was really not something I wanted to do for five hours; sit around and be exhausted. So they went without us. So I would've thought that they would've stuck around for the extra days or two. Nope. They actually abandoned a perfectly well paid for hotel in Cincinnati to go down there which is fine. It was his dad and his brother's step mom. They went down there and they (inaudible at 00:40:37) and they came back for just a - I don't remember - a couple of hours before they caught their flight back. So that's kind of... [00:40:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't sound (inaudible at 00:40:50).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know whether or not they're just going to leave and do things without me. If I should encourage Mike to go... He wasn't going for anything back then because it was things like yeah you're bleeding and stuff. I'm not leaving you by yourself; that kind of thing. But this time encourage him to go off and do things, try to muddle through it and just keep trying, yet if I'm not feeling well am I going to be criticized for being sullen or whatever. You know it's just a lot to have to deal with. [00:41:22]</p>

<p>And I didn't come from a big loud family, not that they're a loud group, but sometimes when I'm quiet and withdraw they perceive it as me being haughty. I'm just sometimes just freaking oblivious and they think that I'm just ignoring them. So it's like I have to second guess every single thing I do. So I don't really know, and I'm not very good at playing counter espionage. I'm not very good at duplicity and trying to do one thing and be something else. I've never been good at that and to have a relationship with them that is moderately satisfying I actually usually have to figure out what kind of thing is going to react, how they are to handle something, and usually lie or make up some sort of story, or do something differently the way that they like it and that's just not my kind of thing. I don't know. So hopefully they'll be gone soon. I mean they're showing up at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday and (inaudible at 00:42:46) I mean on Monday morning so it's not going to be that long. [00:42:50]</p>

<p>Yeah, so I just have to scramble and get everything cleaned up in time. On top of this, this is actually kind of inconvenient because a friend of mine is actually going to be around right now and I really would like to see him. I don't know if I'm going to be able to because of this. You would normally say well why don't go and hide? Well it actually can't be that way because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I know that you originally thought of doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But unfortunately the period of time in which they are there is a period of time where he is not going to be able to visit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would've been very convenient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's the period of time where he is teaching some massive conference or something so he won't actually be available. He's available right now if I wanted to go see him. So I have to wait and find out if I have some stupid brat children showing up tomorrow and get wore out and take care of them. The children are not brats. I'm sorry. The teacher's a brat. I don't know anything about the children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will see you Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you Thursday. Yeah. [00:44:18]</p>

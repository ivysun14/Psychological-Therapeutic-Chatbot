<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) what to say. You know. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) have to wait (inaudible). Like I don't want to wait (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like to have to wait (inaudible) I guess that's what it is. That's not just (inaudible), it's more later, but I think that that's something that I'm angry at. Because if I felt that had to wait for you a number of times and I get (inaudible) to let me know. I guess what's important to me that bothers me is that I found myself in the last week and that's not being able to say things that I need to say to you (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you need to say something to me about the time. You don't (inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess kind of your way of saying (inaudible) ability to really speak. What you should be saying is, ?I'm angry because (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I guess I have trouble to be able to say things. Well to you too, you know, in terms of things I'm thinking or feeling about you and I can't say them. And I - huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just push it down and then I don't say anything. During last week, I didn't let anything happen or the experience with (inaudible) Sunday. I never did therapy. I never did go back to that conversation or did I even open up another conversation that would allow me to say some of the things I thought about that. And I felt like I went through all last week just not saying anything of worth. There were things that I really wanted to say, but I was then clamming up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like just today, I guess I feel so bad (inaudible), that I have to feel angry that I haven't said (inaudible). I really don't have anything to say today. I don't want to even think about coming here because I don't think I wanted to come here. You know? And I guess it makes me angry that I can't say that sometimes I don't feel like coming here. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like, well I said to him that I feel like I've been talking about stuff just to be talking about stuff (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>0:03:29.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of you know the feeling that's like, it's like you didn't really feel like coming in today. (inaudible) and angry at yourself for being (inaudible) I guess the more angry you get, (inaudible) thought about (inaudible) because I said something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't want ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like - I think it's somewhat similar to the things patients seem to do and I don't want to do anything about that because I realize I think you see that that's not fair to you and that's not fair to me. It's because it doesn't get me any closer. Just today I just have been inpatient. Like I can't sit there and read (inaudible) or concentrate on anything. And sometimes I even hate myself. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What (inaudible) felt about not being a good person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) I'm somewhat angry because I'm impatient... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I feel very hostile or hateful towards you or towards anybody today. But ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like you're looking at the world with an evil angry eye?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wasn't angry this morning. I was trying to do some work and so I just didn't get up and go to the library, but I wasn't feeling good (inaudible) and I guess that makes me angry too. But I wasn't so angry as I was just unable to do anything and then just sort of felt hat it's a kind of growing impatience. You know? I really wanted (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. With that kind of growing impatience in yourself (inaudible) probably a combination of the two. It's kind of like the feeling is centered around a lot of things (inaudible) to you. (inaudible) (inaudible) that's kind of a way of looking at the way the world looks (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I just mad. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>0:06:41.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now what do you see?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that I don't feel like talking to anybody. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) you'd rather just be by yourself (inaudible) bugging you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess (inaudible) what I don't like about them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'd like to, but I can't. I don't know if I can. You know? As I was sitting downstairs waiting and I was getting angrier, and I wanted to come up and say things to you that I don't like at all and ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say things about me that you don't like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say things about me that you don't like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I felt like, well I won't do that anyway. You know? I don't know. It's just hard to tell people what I don't (inaudible) I guess its because I don't know if it's right to say it or do that. I was thinking that even if I could do that, maybe I'd feel a lot better, but I don't know. I guess I feel like I hate you, but I don't know if that's really true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) that's kind of (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's only because I'm getting impatient. Because I don't know what this is all accomplishing. I don't see anything happening. On the other hand, sometimes I can look at it now and say, ?Well it's hard to judge kind of experience of coming and talking to you until ?? I guess I sort of look at it as though I ought to wait until it's all over, and look back and see what's happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must be hard for you to do?</p>

<p>0:09:24.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it isn't always hard, but it is right now. I find it difficult to (inaudible). I feel like I'm wasting my time and I'm wasting your time. Last time when I left here, I was thinking that - well just I get sick and tired of talking about myself and not feeling like I'm getting any feedback. Well, I do get some. There are some things you've said that have been really helpful. But on the other hand, I don't know you at all and I guess that begins to make me angry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. not (inaudible) It's just you know it's like this objectivity or something there that you may (inaudible) and I don't know what you're sharing or what your input is. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just sort of a - I guess I dislike you because I don't know anything about you to like. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just sick and tired of hearing you always say, ?(inaudible) That's (inaudible)?. I'm not sure what else you should say or whatever things I would expect anybody to say. It's just that I ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It bugs you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way I say things to you (inaudible) irritates you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What I was going to say before was you know (inaudible) sort of thinking that you looked bored with the whole thing while I was telling you, you were coughing. Maybe I was bored with it too. I don't know. And it was kind of having the feeling that, ?What the fuck am I even coming here for?? You get sort of the feeling of being rather normal and it wasn't anything worthwhile sitting here and talking about it anymore. That if there's something that bothers me about myself, like I feel like it hasn't coming out or I don't feel like I've discovered anything. A few things. Yeah, but it's just kind general dissatisfaction. </p>

<p>I (inaudible) also it was an anger (inaudible). I think about that, but I don't know that there's anything that I can do or should do or can do. </p>

<p>0:12:44.1</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hum. (inaudible) you feel kind of impatient and feeling like (inaudible) nothing you can do about it or ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (inaudible) to do about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel like I - well I don't know what I - I don't know. I'm just getting the feeling like I'm not getting anywhere and some dissatisfaction. But I don't know what to do about what I can do about it or if I should do anything about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well could you do (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I need to know if that accomplishes anything. You know what I mean? You know, I'm just feeling like I'm getting madder. Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like nothing (inaudible), everything (inaudible) nothing accomplished (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Nothing I've been saying or nothing is coming out. I just makes me feel as though I'm not accomplishing anything by it. It's almost as though the things that has (inaudible) feeling like something that I felt like I've saying something about myself that I almost like that discovered because I feel like I ought to be discovering something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I guess that's the way I feel, but I like to feel, well I like to think that - I don't know what the difference between thinking about and feeling something. (inaudible) I'm thinking things before what I was feeling about. I'm thinking angry. I guess the thinking (inaudible) articulating what I'm feeling and attempt to do that. I'm not sure. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know what to say (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm mad at you (inaudible) because I have to wait to see you. You know? And I don't like to wait to see people. I can be made to wait if it's a group of kids or somebody I'm working with. You know? Something like that, but when it comes to having to wait for peers or co-workers, or having to wait for something I have an appointment for, I don't feel like I ought to have to wait for that. I guess I get inpatient. Like standing in lines at the grocery store. I can't stand doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, things like that. </p>

<p>0:17:17.8</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me mad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There might be, but I don't know. It's like there's nothing I can verbalize about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like you (inaudible) before and you're saying like (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: About being mad at you or getting mad. Okay immediately I consider putting my finger on (inaudible) being mad because I have to wait for you. You know? Denying the fact that all mad. Maybe I'm mad because (inaudible) . maybe I'm mad because there were things I wanted to say to him I didn't say. You know? I guess that's part of it that I never told you because I had a long week and it went away and (inaudible. In some way that's sounds scary because (inaudible). You know? I feel like I'm getting antsy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To accomplish something. To do something and, but I can't concentrate or do anything unless it's in terms of like studying and reading anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's kind of like your mood prevents you from doing any kind of (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just bored (inaudible) I don't have anything to be bored about really. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) the details of coming here to work. It's like the way you kind of look at it and to me it's like an irritating thing, annoying. Every thing's like really annoying, like going to the grocery store or - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I (inaudible) sort of waiting it out. You know? (inaudible) something during the day that is halfway interesting or something that keeps my mind off being angry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're angry, what do you usually (inaudible)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sit and think about being angry or try and do something else. Try to do something to take my mind off (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you try to (inaudible)? Sounds like you (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I (inaudible) take it out?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take it (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. (inaudible) talk to people - like I was over at the bookstore this morning, this girl who I (inaudible) grew up (inaudible). And I saw her. I thought it was her, but I didn't want to see her. I didn't want her to see me. I tried to avoid her and she saw me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (inaudible) haven't come by and talk to her, but I didn't (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked her why she didn't bother to say hello because (inaudible) being rude and (inaudible) sort of a ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) irritation. Like you felt kind of ignored and kind of you had to go through some kind of (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be nice. Yeah and have to say something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) it just wasn't what you were feeling. You could (inaudible) you just didn't feel right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know it's been kind of easy (inaudible) walking away from them. I always wanted to do things like that to people and I don't really (inaudible) but I never do that. I guess being nice is easier talking to people (inaudible) . It doesn't make me feel any better or (inaudible) Right before I was sitting in the waiting room, I almost felt like getting up and telling (inaudible) I'm leaving I didn't feel like waiting anymore. But that wouldn't have accomplished anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) it sounds like you needed to express your anger to me and you would have acted on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. At least I don't let anger come out in any way except (inaudible) sharper to people ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible) sounds like it expresses your anger, but really (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's sort of a (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible) quite right (inaudible) kind of compromise (inaudible) and acting on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of it is the thought that I don't like to have to my anger out on people. It's like how are they supposed to know what am I angry about or ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You tell them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not always knowing what I'm angry about. I don't see like it's imposing on people to them that (inaudible) they don't really care to say anything then.</p>

<p>0:23:23.0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But don't you think it's kind of confusing to people like maybe you give off anger vibrations, but you're not clear about why you're angry? don't you think it has some kind of reverse affect also?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's not - I don't think it's always (inaudible) to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure. I guess I would have - like when I asked you to tell me (inaudible) subtle innuendo. Do you understand that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. I really think that it was I don't feel if I want people to tell me that they're very angry at me. I feel - well people just don't tell you when they're angry. Like you don't want to (inaudible) them. People don't tell you when they're angry. Sometimes I can say to people (inaudible) and prefer them not to pursue it because I don't want to be angry at them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess I'm confused on what you're saying. You're saying maybe I don't want people to tell me they're angry or people don't tell me that they're angry. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess then ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: People - you know what, if you do something (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) say anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) I'd probably be more likely to tell them what bugs me if they told me. But then it would be like (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A cat and dog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's really why I don't trust anybody (inaudible) to talk about this (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, but it depends on, you know, if you don't talk about (inaudible) you carry it around with you. Like obviously they do (inaudible) whenever that bitch comes (inaudible) To the extent if you don't talk about (inaudible) </p>

<p>0:26:27.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like if the (inaudible) is not being dealt with in an appropriate way, you've gotten rid of it, then it lingers around and (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Last week, Wednesday, (inaudible) people and (inaudible) And the fellow I work with, George, was going to be late because (inaudible), he said, "Okay, but tell me only the details?, and I was really perturbed. And when I returned later, I did it and they said, "You're in the (inaudible) ?.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who said ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said (inaudible) He said, "No you don't?. He said, "That was a joking thing?. Although I think that I ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) I think because now I wasn't very happy with it, but I really would've have liked to said, just like everybody else in terms of that timing (inaudible) . he was going to change it because of he knew that was going to happen, but he didn't get in touch with me. He didn't call me. Like he called by the time I had already left to go out some place. Well that was 10 of us. He does things like that all the time. Like making me wait on him (inaudible) and I guess I never (inaudible) at the time, but I (inaudible) like to wait for people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you say it, but you don't say it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. But then I guess also figure that they gets the message or the people get the message. I guess it's I don't want to confront people deliberately because that is sort of a threatening thing for me to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? What's going to happen? Why couldn't you come in and say, instead of asking me to (inaudible) why couldn't you just say, ?Well, come in ?? Like you did communicate the message to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) but it's a very sharp (inaudible) . You understand what I ??</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel like I get to the ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like throwing a (inaudible) . Do you understand that? I'm wondering (inaudible) in that case, how (inaudible) yourself becoming all these different (inaudible), ?God damnit. I'm really pissed?. (inaudible) before, or 10 minutes, and I'm angry. </p>

<p>0:29:11.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just I didn't. I just throughout the whole block. I wanted to tell you that before. I just can't say it. (inaudible) okay I'm going to say that I don't want to wait. Let's get this thing settled and what time (inaudible) at that time. And I don't want to have to wait. You can't make it at two. Okay. Then let's not make it at two. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) I know (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably feel (inaudible) feel like you're going to be shot at back or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of it is I think about it. I think well ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel like you're feeling petty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of that it's a petty, stupid thing and that you probably had some (inaudible) sick. But that's to me like you can't help it. You're sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) I'm sick. I might laugh, I get (inaudible) I agree with you. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably laid out on the floor dying. Yeah. You know, but it still made me mad. I think you had a good reason for - okay. So you had to go to the bathroom. You have to do that. You have to do that and I guess it's down the line knowing that there's probably something legitimate about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's kind of like - I guess it's part of the (inaudible) maybe you feel petty. You feel really impatient and angry, but yet you know that there's probably some kind of legitimate thing give or take whatever you need to do (inaudible) legitimate (inaudible) . You kind of feel like you are impatient, but kind of like you don't feel right to be impatient. You don't want to ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I get much angrier at petty things than I do about very big things that I should probably be angry about. It's almost like I can handle - I guess I (inaudible) I guess I feel sort of guilt feeling about being angry about something that's petty, that it takes 10 minutes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like objectively (inaudible) petty doesn't feel to you as it (inaudible) to be more (background noise).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>0:32:19.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like part of why it's hard for you to say you're angry because of objectively it doesn't seem like you should be angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you feel kind of wrong to be angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) angry at something petty and I don't think I want that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) kind of like if you get angry, you'll just cause someone else to be angry (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm saying is like if you express your anger sharply and directly, you get your message across. It has the same affect. In other words ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to people. Try to vocalize your anger (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's not a catastrophe kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's kind of like (inaudible) people. (inaudible) turns people off. What I'm saying is you know, you're being objective. You might be (inaudible) anyway. (inaudible) directly said that you were angry, but you're not getting it cleared up. (inaudible) keep feeling that you're not angry, you (inaudible) really bad feeling to keep it inside of you. It just magnifies things. I know, because it happens to me as well. I mean (inaudible) and after an hour and a half, I said something and my anger was incredibly great by that time, but only because I had (inaudible) power.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To the person who was late?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. So what I'm saying it's like you see it kind of mushrooms if you keep it in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you mull it over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that. Like I guess I know that I have to say it, (inaudible) that I'm angry about something, but I just can't get myself to do it. I get sort of blocked. Can't say anything. </p>

<p>0:34:47.4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really clamped down on it. (inaudible) you keep (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of like I have this self-discipline. You know. Supposed control over my emotions and I guess it sort of blocks (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you control it and perhaps you might (inaudible) control it on the outside, but it's like inside, you could be very (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I suspect if I had decided that I had something that I wanted to talk about today, that I wouldn't have said anything at all about waiting yesterday, but I decided that I didn't have anything to talk about (inaudible) and that as I sat and waited, that that came out. You know. Maybe it was just at the point where I just had (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but (inaudible) but I don't think it has. I don't think because if I really want to, I don't have to (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just wanted to let things out. Like be angry today is something I want to do because I know I have - well I know I can't control my emotions, but I control the way I feel (inaudible) I don't have to let anybody know how I feel and I don't. I think that can be pretty successful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I am (inaudible) that's the reason why I'd like to do something about it. I guess I think of .. having to go into a party and then started putting in certain (inaudible) and I don't have to do that. (inaudible) pretty successfully. And I don't even like that down if I feel maybe trusting (inaudible) or something who may be there or something like that.. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) trying to like you can show your real face to someone that you trust. (inaudible) showing your emotions. Showing your anger. ?What the hell do you care what people think about you?. Like are they going to - like they might be (inaudible) control person who (inaudible) But if I show my feelings, if I show my anger, (inaudible) is it sadness or (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) why should I - why should I show my feelings just to people who don't care about me and I don't care about them? I guess that sounds - well I didn't accomplish anything for them (inaudible). I guess that's the way I feel about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not upset about (inaudible) having some confuse (inaudible) express you're feelings when you've done it?</p>

<p>0:39:15.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's say, you know, like you take this on yourself. You know like the kind of (inaudible) where you really felt that you had (inaudible) working on (inaudible) Now do you think you would have felt if I had (inaudible) somebody (inaudible) I really feel hurt and (inaudible) putting you down (inaudible) I'm working on that, but ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but I already know that I thought he put me down or didn't say that I felt like I didn't recognize (inaudible). I didn't say that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. You didn't really say why. You said you felt (inaudible), but you didn't really talk about the hurt. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think you're right. If I had been able to do that, I probably would have felt better. He would have responded differently too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. That's right. It's like he would have probably (inaudible) .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think he would. I think that's why I wanted to go back to that or find a point where we could talk about it. Go back to the - I guess, I don't know why I can't do that. Why I can't say some things I really want to and it's - like it's feeling, having things stuck in your throat. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like it's coming up, but you just can't get it out. Like they're really there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the voice is blocked (inaudible) That happens to me a lot. I think I've (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) feel blocked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I (inaudible) to say it, to do something (inaudible) Maybe that's what I feel and really become dissatisfied with it, but that was something I really wanted to say to somebody and I couldn't say it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah, because you're singing the same song. (inaudible) I really felt that (inaudible) that you're talking about? Not having ?(inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) put a label like (inaudible) trying to work on or not doing it. Not being able to say it. I guess sometimes when I decided I'm going to say something, I have to almost put myself into a role of acting in order to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of (inaudible) doesn't feel (inaudible) </p>

<p>0:42:47.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) force yourself to do (inaudible) I suppose (inaudible) working with the field inspectors in that case, that I (inaudible) they hadn't really recognized that I had some (inaudible) with case workers and field workers (inaudible) I guess I decided that I was going to let them know that there was some (inaudible) pull them off, but I felt rather to (inaudible) intelligent, safe way not being defensive about it. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why didn't you (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Or just letting them know that I had some expertise and that I knew something. It was like I put myself in a role, don't be uncomfortable. (inaudible) that I was going to be comfortable instead of being (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Almost like that. And it was like I was consciously almost being somebody else sort of. Because otherwise, I allowed myself to be easily intimidated and kept it (inaudible) and quiet. Not saying anything. And that was sort of setting myself up for somebody else to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like very deliberate the way you (inaudible) . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Deciding the role and (inaudible) the role like ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I really do that. I think I do that anyway in terms of saying things to Don. I wanted to talk to him and say things to him, is that I (inaudible) very well prepared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And determine that whatever his response is, I'll be able to respond accordingly (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Respond in a way consistent with (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like something (inaudible) what's really (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. (inaudible) really the way I am, but because I do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's the way you can be.</p>

<p>0:46:23.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not only just - it's like putting on a fa'ade to cover up feeling intimidated or lack of confidence in myself feels like. So I put on a different face so that I - so that that doesn't come out. That I'm not going to let something intimidate me or pull out some of the confidence in me. Maybe that's the realistic way of doing it. (inaudible) except that it doesn't get rid of feeling uncomfortable (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's kind of like (inaudible) people might respond to your problem (inaudible) reflection of yourself. (inaudible) really your own confidence, but it's like you're (inaudible) . Kind of like what they were seeing - maybe a part of you didn't like (inaudible) or (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. Yeah. (inaudible) to cover up something else. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it is. I think all it is, is putting something over it as much as wanting to get something solved ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you've been kind of like (inaudible) having to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I don't have any response to (inaudible) about that? I don't think it's all about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't I what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have a response to (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it makes me sort of mad - I guess it's if (inaudible) responding to things that aren't said all along and - (inaudible) has a very objective, a very kind of perceptual kind of role, without any feelings or (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I ?</p>

<p>0:49:18.1</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it's kind of like you realize I'm kind of (inaudible) scheme or something like that. Like I would take (inaudible), then treat them objectively and I don't have any (inaudible) plan of action or (inaudible) Does that sound - I'm trying to get how you perceive this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand it makes (inaudible) I guess that's (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess one thing that bugs me about the whole idea of counseling of people or whatever it is in my own field is people keep telling me you have to be a sort of professional and objectifying kind of thing just to get (inaudible). And I can't be that way. If a kid is saying something to you that - a kid (inaudible) or that girl that I (inaudible), I felt it very important to let her know that when she picks something that had a lot to do with feelings and bad things and good feelings, then I felt like I had to, because she had more of a sort of empathizing and understanding and reactive, and (inaudible) you sit there and don't react as human way at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Maybe I don't understand (inaudible) yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) a human kind of reaction. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm still trying to understand - what (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (inaudible) in terms if somebody (inaudible) told you that they (inaudible) making them wait. I guess the response I (inaudible) response to make is that I'm (inaudible) realize that I feeling sorry. I guess I didn't realize how much it bugged you and I'll make an attempt not to make you wait anymore. That really doesn't help, but (inaudible) Depending on what kind of thing it is around, sometimes I would like become defensive I suppose.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean - yeah. Kind of what you're saying is that the way you (inaudible) unemotional. Like they don't have any reaction to the things you say, like (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like some of the things that ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess cold feet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (inaudible) and kind of (inaudible) like you think what I don't like about you because I don't know anything about you (inaudible) because (inaudible) </p>

<p>0:52:50.6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean professionally (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't like it either. You know. I guess I don't really feel like a warm and incredible woman. I don't think of myself as an incredibly (inaudible) person. As far as you know really like having a reaction to things you say, I mean I clearly I try to understand you. When you tell me you were angry and you didn't seem like you were angry (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but (inaudible) like you didn't say, ?Okay. You know, I understand?, while you're ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess I tried to show you that without saying that I understood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the same thing (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but you see I just don't believe (inaudible) Like, you know, kind of like the (inaudible) I think (inaudible) that shows. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like when you sometimes say what bothers you (inaudible) bothering you. Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the words don't, they don't show it. Do you hear what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm having a hard time trying to (inaudible) </p>

<p>0:55:08.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even (inaudible) when I say something's bothering me and I don't show that it bothers me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Remember like I told you (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like I can believe what you're saying, but it's hard for me to really get offensive (inaudible) because I don't (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Or the words come out in a way that ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know what you mean. But now I'm confused. I don't know what ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) You don't know what that ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what that ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - has to do with anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (inaudible) Okay. It had been something to do with saying I understand. Like I can say I understand. Great. You know, that doesn't make ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like I didn't feel like you said anything. I mean you said things. You said words. You said ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what's important is maybe objectively I (inaudible) words (inaudible), but you used it to defense language (inaudible) or you didn't sense anything (inaudible) . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got this idea that you understood what I was saying and that I was angry, but like I didn't see any kind of a reaction from you about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And yet (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me feel like sometimes some of the things (inaudible) a bunch of bullshit?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of the things you say are a bunch of bullshit? I don't agree. No. </p>

<p>0:56:53.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess sometimes I (inaudible) to you like (inaudible) I haven't. I mean I said things that I've (inaudible), but it's like I left you in my book. I just sort of (inaudible) about them ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing happened with them (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I get so. And I don't know what it suggests to you. But it's just like - and I can't describe everything, except that it's sort of dissatisfying. Sometimes I feel like I could be talking to myself and that makes me feel more dissatisfied because, shit I said these things to myself or given some thought to them, sometimes they're just said a little differently. Sometimes I feel like I think you pull it out (inaudible) sometimes, but ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But all in all, what you're saying is that you feel like you say things and don't know what the problem is. You don't kind of feel like if there's a person here listening to you, responding to your questions .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes you angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know if it's that and so much making me feel angry. More like sort of dissatisfied. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And impatient too perhaps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And impatient. Sometimes it makes me feel like it's not even worth saying anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I get that (inaudible) it's like a put-down. You feel like you're put down a lot. Like the things you're saying aren't responded to (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I sometimes feel like sometimes when people say things to me, it's hard to respond to them. Like sometimes I feel like I understand what people are saying when I'm not sure if there's anything I can say to them to recognize that I heard what they said. Like I'm also very conscious of letting - I don't know. It sort of like I guess, you know, I guess I do recognize that you do recognize what I say. I guess sometimes it's sort of wanting to know what you think about what I say. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I'm (inaudible) .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you respond and I know you recognize a lot of times what I'm trying to say. It's that you sometimes rephrase what I say or just maybe ask another question or something like that. It's as though it's playing back and the reaction that's not there is like - I guess sometimes I look for well what do you think about it. You know? As just a person. What does that - you know, what do you think about it.</p>

<p>1:00:44.8</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) what you were asking me, but - Okay. I played back a question to you? (inaudible) more. (inaudible) playing back with something else that I must think something about it. Do you (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of like there's no reaction to me as a person. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You see, like I don't - now I listen to what you say and I'm reacting to it as a person trying to understand you. Trying to understand you. I really don't think like judge you or anything like that or (inaudible) You understand what I mean? I guess where I really am is just trying to get a sense of what you're saying to understand you. It's like this other thing of you know what do I think about it, it's like what I'm really thinking, (inaudible) is about it, is trying to get through what it is you're saying, to get that back to you, but (inaudible) I say it back to you so like (inaudible) something will help you to focus on whether there is more. </p>

<p>It's like I'm really not like putting that into any kind of grand scheme or (inaudible) or anything like that, it's just well that's the lousy thing about you, but the good thing about you. (inaudible) I don't feel like (inaudible) like I suppose you try to (inaudible) angry. I mean angry (inaudible) the way you'd like to feel because (inaudible) I mean there aren't really right and wrong rules. I don't think that way. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't think (inaudible) that might make you feel really lousy, but I don't - there isn't that other thing I have in my mind that I'm not saying. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I do. And that's okay. I guess I sort of feel I can accept that. I'm not sure. But I guess I feel like well if some things are not done, then I guess (inaudible) something that I think you'll think about. It's like consideration. That's something to know about you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: See what I'm saying is that I really don't have any kind of morality. I may have - that's the right word (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure that's the right word, except ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That I'm thinking like (inaudible) really doing something else - like two things like (inaudible) like, ?Well that's good. You're doing a good thing?. You know, and I don't think that way. Because I just don't think that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure that's the ?</p>

<p>1:04:03.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I don't have a standard that I'm trying to put you into that. You understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in the same way I don't have a grand scheme I'm trying to put you in. I'm just trying to understand you on your own terms and help you to focus more on what the things are that are bothering you so that you get be better. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not (inaudible). I'm not trying to (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I understand you know and that's - I guess that's one of the things that maybe I am thinking convolution and maybe I (inaudible) or anybody ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or me. You know, with (inaudible) they would make me reinforce sort of bad feelings about myself and allowing me to keep feeling (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it's kind of like maybe that what I look for and I don't realize all the time that I'm not (inaudible) like you were saying, (inaudible) condemnable (inaudible) the (inaudible) things that I look for that people want to condemn me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's why I suggested to you be angry. Tell me what you don't like about me. Why you're angry. Like I don't think I condemned you for (inaudible) . Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I do. I mean I think I do understand what you're saying. I don't know (inaudible) so confusing that it makes me try and think of why it's so important for me to (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To want some kind of ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe that's what I'm looking for and I haven't thought that. (inaudible) what I'm thinking. </p>

<p>1:06:19.4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay now. It's 2:15. Is that the time (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's right. Is that better for you on Monday too?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. If you could make it for 5 after on Monday because I have this other client until 2. If I didn't have time before that to go to the bathroom, (inaudible) </p>

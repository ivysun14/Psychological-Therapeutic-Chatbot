<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client Grogan, seventh interview. Now fellows, I just sat through a horrible naive lecture and I'm running down quickly. And I just thought I'd let you know that, that it'd make me feel better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: About seven years later (inaudible at 0:00:21.4) I thought I'd be here early and I'd sit and grade papers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope it wasn't an inconvenience for you to..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. No of course not. It's just, I thought it was going to be nicer but I didn't think about the rush hour. Probably nicer going the way I go. It's really a beautiful day, really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:02.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Kinda at the moment I'm not really concerned about something that really concerns me. Except I'm concerned about my part in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It has to do with the girl that's my roommate. I don't really know, it's just on my mind, that's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:01:50.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: She used to be married. And when she was married she started going out with girls and stuff to bars and getting dissatisfied. And I fixed her up with someone when she was married. And I thought it was, I didn't really think about it, you know. I mean that broke up her marriage. She's now getting divorced. And a friend of mine, a friend of my boyfriend is nice and nice looking. And he's married. She thought he was very attractive. And he thought the same thing about her but said well, it's too bad but I'm married. </p>

<p>And then last night I threw them together. I really did. And I was just, I don't know why I did that. It's not entirely my fault but I certainly did nothing at all to stop it. In fact I thought it was kinda funny. Which it wasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the man came to school today really upset. 0:02:58.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you, you know on the one hand it's not all your fault. On the other hand it makes you feel kinda guilty. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I thought it was so funny. Not funny ha ha, just sorta..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ironic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, interesting. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't feel real guilty. I feel guilty about not feeling guilty? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah like you shouldn't have thought it was interesting. And it sounds almost like you're a little bit, almost enjoying it right now and feeling lousy about that. Like you should feel terrible. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I really am. I mean I felt really sorry for this man today. He came, he was very upset. And I didn't laugh, but now I want to laugh. I don't know about that at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You shouldn't feel amused about the whole thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't think so. My boyfriend wasn't amused at all. 0:04:02.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think, he didn't realize what was happening at all. I mean he didn't know (inaudible at 0:04:15.4) but I knew it so. He just didn't know it was happening until the very end of the evening. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you did and sorta, not gloated but. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was joke or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why. I haven't talked to her today but I'm sure that she feels very bad. I knew that she was going to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you made both of them feel bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Her I know better than him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok I don't want to, I don't want to think about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to think about why I made her, why I, I obviously must have wanted to, somehow. I did this the other time too. I mean I knew, I didn't think it was going to cause her to leave her husband but I realized of course that she was going to feel bad. Or guilty or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't think about it. I just thought it was fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's like you couldn't, well it's like you knew she was going to feel bad and you knew that again I guess you're saying. You must have known.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like that's not the part of the thing that seemed relevant to you. That seemed the most important. Sounds like what was the most salient was the, it's sorta a larky thing to do. 0:06:12.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I just wondered. That was all that it was. I did. What if I was trying to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hurt her or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you don't think you were. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think I was. Oh well. I was writing down a list of things today to talk about. See I stayed out real late last night. Real stupidly late. And I was real tired and I thought that I should have a list of things. So that's what I did in my class today, tried to write down things to talk about. Because I really couldn't even think of anything to put on the list because I was too tired to think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have a blank piece of paper. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Almost. Almost a blank piece of paper. And that wasn't on it either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I want to know what a self destructive person really is. And I really don't, from what I think about it, I don't think that I really am. Maybe I am but I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was thinking about that in relation to men. Like this married man that I had this long drawn out affair with. I started that out like a larky thing. And I just kept on and on. And I knew that he was married. And I knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere even though that wasn't what he said, I knew that was so. You know. 0:08:10.8</p>

<p>And I'm not sure if I wanted to break free or if I didn't want to. But anyway I didn't for a long time. And I told you last time that I had a baby by him. And when I came back from having that, and I really think I hated him, I made a big point of seeking him out because I wanted to hurt him. But then I started going out with him again and I don't know (inaudible at 0:08:46.2) </p>

<p>So, in that year, this was last year, all the time that I was going out with him I started going out with a lot of different other men. And I was sleeping with a lot of them too. And then right near the end of this relationship, which was about in December or January of this year. I was having three fairly heavy relationships. One with him, one with my present boyfriend, and one with another man. And I never ever really did tell Drew, this first man, about either of the others. I don't know what I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to prove it. 0:09:41.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt totally guilty about breaking up and it's like I don't understand really. I felt guilty maybe because I was going out with these other men. And caring for them both too. I'm not sure, yeah, I lied to him. I didn't tell him about other men, I told him I just wanted to break up with him. And then I broke up with the other one. And then was going out exclusively with my present boyfriend. And at the beginning I was just very sure that this was going to be a very short term relationship because of the kind of person he is. And, but I didn't care. </p>

<p>So when I found myself getting more involved with him. And his attitude is that he cares about me very much but we should be happy together for as long as we're together, like (inaudible at 0:10:56.9) I'm not sure what point I was trying to make I really don't. 0:11:02.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm getting a number of things. One, one thing is it sorta sounds like as you look back over the last few years anyway at how you are with men. Like there are a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense to you. There are a lot of things that are sorta confusing to you. Don't seem well motivated. You don't know why you did it. And you don't know what happened to that motivation. Where'd that go? I wanted to hurt him. What happened to that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that stayed there underneath it all. I really think that was why I was going out with those other men. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So it was really to cause him pain. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he didn't know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't very much pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No, no. Just made me feel guilty. That's why I started, I guess that's why (inaudible at 0:11:54.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So the only one you hurt was you in that. 0:12:01.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In high school the first, not the very first boy I've ever known, but the first boy that I liked, I had a crush on. And I started going out with him. And then I didn't. And then he was going out with another girl. Well, I would still go out with him sometimes. And sometimes, oh this is real, I'm very ashamed of this. I would go out with him after he had taken this other girl out. We'd just go out and do high school necking. Now that's all that I could get from him and that was all that I was willing to take then. And that continued, that really continued on for a couple of years. And I just think something's screwed up about me and men, that's all. 0:12:57.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I hear that. I also, like what were you ashamed of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That he was going out with this girl that was a friend of mine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was, on the sly I was just going out and necking with him which was really ridiculous. It was like all the affection that I could get and so I was just taking it. I wasn't, I must not have thought very much of myself if that's all that I was willing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean sorta you must not have been thinking very much of yourself if you were willing to take second best like that and..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda play your girlfriend false at the same time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did that with this married man. See when I started going out with him, I really thought about this the very first time. And I thought it was the same kinda thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the guy you went necking with in high school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were like feeling pretty screwed up or..0:13:58.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I were (inaudible at 0:14:01.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you said, "When I would start going out with Neal it was like (inaudible at 0:14:05.7) boy in high school." And I thought you were saying like that boy in high school and you felt sorta cruddy or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About necking and what screwed up (inaudible at 0:14:13.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He told me that he liked me but he didn't love me and he never would and I didn't care. Or I did care but I didn't care enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But with him at least you certainly, you had no illusions. Like you knew what you were getting into and you went ahead anyway. And I guess that appalls you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. Maybe I, well I don't even remember even thinking that he was going to break up with this girl, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you didn't have any doubt at all in the world that she was number one and that was the way it was going to stay. 0:15:05.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you went out and necked with him anyway. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for several years. Off and on. It was really more or less the same thing with Drew because, like he'd tell me that he loved me and was going to get a divorce and all this bullshit. And I half believed him and I half didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And this year when I told him I wanted to break up with him, it was at this point where I really almost didn't care about him anymore except for feeling guilty. And he was swearing that he was going to go out and get a divorce. But I just knew that if I had said ok, do that, that he probably wouldn't. 0:16:13.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the meantime I would've lost the other two men. Plus I wasn't even sure that I wanted, I was pretty sure I didn't want him to do that. So in a way in my mind they were related. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't even want him even if he had..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well I did at first. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that was like four years, four and a half years </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But like at the end..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't have the, I couldn't, I didn't have the strength to break it off when I should have. Whenever that was, the first day or the second year or you know, something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. It's like you knew, there was a time when boy you knew this wasn't for you. And you just were too weak. 0:17:14.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, That occurred some time last year but it took until I had two other people that were giving me some real affection back that I was able to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You needed to be propped up by two other people's caring..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before you could move. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I thought that was pretty weak. But I was, I was glad the day came along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Weak or not. Because it felt better for you as in breaking up with him, the thought of breaking up with him with nobody there..</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I guess that I really am bothered by James my boyfriend, by thinking like that. I mean that's a very practical way to think but it's just not the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking of breaking up with James, but..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean no I'm not thinking about. About him being very realistic and saying this is very nice and as long as we're happy together we'll stay together and when we're not then we won't. He hasn't said (inaudible at 0:18:32.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that is very realistic I just don't like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It must threaten me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda the thought of being without him and not having anybody else there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know about, no I don't think that's true. I know that it is in some ways but I don't think it's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:18:59.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm really quite sure I can function pretty well alone for a while. I mean I, I think that it's easy to find people..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok let me try, let me try again. Because what I'm stuck on is like what doesn't sound right about that. What he said. What don't you like about it. If it isn't that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the fact that him leaving and my not having anybody there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact of him leaving, period. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. When you're not ready. </p>

<p>CLIENT: When I'm not ready. Yeah. I get that. Maybe that's real reason he's saying it. But I just don't like to hear him say it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sorta makes you uneasy for him to say it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. And probably, most people if they don't actually think that way. I mean he must feel that way because the feeling can creep up on you, this has gone on too long. I don't know what I'm trying to say. I think I was ashamed to say that too. No, not today. But before I was, yeah. 0:20:31.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About James. Ashamed to say that I was upset by that. I didn't feel that that was right. Are you a psychiatrist? You aren't are you? That's what I thought. My insurance policy has not quite covered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was pretty sure you weren't. (inaudible at 0:21:15.5) No, I'm just kidding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't work. Well if by chance you were serious, the answer is it doesn't work. Because they send you a form and they ask you to state the treatment and all that business and, you know, who you are. So it doesn't work. 0:21:36.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Oh yes. This is funny. I'm not embarrassed to talk about what I'm going to talk about now but I'm embarrassed because I think it's so common. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I really have a great deal of difficulty reaching an orgasm with James more so than with Drew. And that blow my mind because I didn't trust Drew at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And with him it was a heck of a lot easier. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes sense. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it doesn't make sense to me. I had a lot of really stupid sexual experiences when I was younger. That probably messed my mind up about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I had a great deal of trouble with Drew for a while but then I guess I got, maybe just comfortable sexually. I don't know but I don't think that's so. 0:23:06.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like you don't think there's a whole residue of unpleasant memories or something getting in the way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no that's not what I mean. I mean that I could feel just comfortable sexually and that's all that was required. That's what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You follow? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you're saying, let me try. Like you're saying with Neal the issue of like trust maybe wasn't so relevant. Maybe the thing that was important was simply that you felt sexually comfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't think that, I don't think that that's, maybe that is true. I don't think that is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But that it isn't merely that you could feel sexually comfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know what else to say about that because it just, it bothers, it doesn't bother me except at the very time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: When it bothers me a real lot. And, but it's something that I really don't think about the rest of the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. It's like, it's like when you're making love it's damn frustrating or whatever that is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It makes me feel very inadequate. That's what it does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you should be able to have one. There's something wrong with you that you can't? 0:24:33.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um hmm. And I had to write that on my list because I knew that I was going to forget it in here because I, yeah, I really don't think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was something else too that I forgot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really, it gets so, back on that. It sounds like you're saying that something, that something that's very localized in your experience like other than when it actually happens it's totally out of your mind. Like you just..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that it, it's not in my conscious mind anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's something I, I brood about it right at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I guess I just must, well why brood about it all the time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I certainly don't know what to do about it. I mean I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well you know what it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Why think about it if it's nothing you can do about it but feel lousy? 0:25:58.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't have anything to say right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not too bad today. Probably because I'm so tired I'm more relaxed. I was trying to think if I had like a specific problem that I wanted to have solved in my mind. And I couldn't think of anything really concrete or specific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's why I'm so aimless or confused about this. It's not like, let's see, I don't know. I really don't know what a specific problem would be. 0:28:20.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. So it sounds like it's twofold then. Like on the one hand you feel like you don't have a specific problem but furthermore, or even if you did you wouldn't know it. Or you don't know what one would be if you had it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know, like well, my feeling inadequate a lot of times or things like that. Maybe that's the whole thing underneath all these things that I talk about. But like I mean I, ok I can't say it now. That's a crazy thing. I don't know other sessions. (inaudible at 0:29:06.4) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what, ok, so where does that leave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nowhere. I'm just thinking. That's why I feel, maybe that's why I feel, sometimes feel missed, no direction. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. It's like if you had an obsession then you could come and talk about that obsession every time. And you'd know what there is to talk about. You'd talk about the obsession. But it's like you don't have anything readymade to talk about and to sorta serve as a beacon to tell you when you're off track or something. 0:29:54.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. Maybe that's even more the case than what we discussed about my having great traumatic problems. Maybe that's not even it, it's just that I.. I think that, you know, that I'd like to, I don't know what. Understand myself better. But that's kinda a general thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah sorta a general thing but I understand what you're saying. You're saying that's so broad it could be anything in the world, you know. I want to understand myself. But, I guess that's what you mean by that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? Well it does sorta imply stuff like, "Gee there are parts of me I really don't understand. I act or feel in ways, or acted and felt in ways that kinda seem strange to me or bizarre or don't make sense."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's true. And actually for all my, even in my late teenage years and adult life, most of those things could evolve around men really. Things that I consider stupid. 0:31:18.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily strange stupid or like why did you do that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a dumb thing to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like "I want to understand myself" like one aspect of that is something like I want to understand why the heck I act that way or those ways or acted those ways. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The first time that I ever made love I was in Europe and I decided that it was, I was 18 years old and it was time to lose my virginity. So I just found somebody I thought was attractive and screwed him. And that's all. And I was real pleased about it. And I thought that was strange. Looking back on it I thought it was strange. At the time I thought it was neat. 0:32:22.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So it sounds like at the time like the whole thing was kinda enchanted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What happened looking back on it? What's that about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was strange. No, I still think it's funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just thought it was a strange thing to do. Because people that I've gone out with and cared about, I didn't, yeah I didn't sleep with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the thing that's strange is like you've been going out with people and liking them and not making love and then here's somebody that you don't like and you go out and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't even know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I thought it was romantic. I don't know. I mean, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Romantic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Romantic. Here I am on my own in Europe. What a great place to lose my virginity. Like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah like, like that's a good novel. 0:33:31.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Uh huh. It was a fantasy. For sure. I decided to do it and I picked someone out. Yeah it was a good novel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even now part of you, you seem more pleased with yourself than appalled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I am. Maybe that bothers me but I don't, but I don't think it's so horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should think it's terrible. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Actually that's not a big thing. (inaudible at 0:34:10.9) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the two people that I've cared about the most in my life I have made love with them the first time I went out with them though. I don't know if that's strange or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Strange?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other times it was like I didn't care, but I really thought that the man might care, so I didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that you didn't sleep with him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He might..</p>

<p>CLIENT: He might, men, in my mind men are kinda Victorian in my mind, about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see.. Like you wanted to sleep with them but you didn't because you thought like that would, they wouldn't like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah that's true. Except for Drew. I didn't even go out with him. I was at a company picnic with him and I just went home, screwed him and I didn't care. The next day he left and I worked with him but I didn't care. I thought it was kinda neat. And I was telling my friends. And then he started coming around and the relationship got heavy. But he really initiated that. I think he felt guilty. 0:35:52.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. What, you sound confused and I'm not clear where the confusion is in that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something doesn't seem right to you about it or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? That he came back? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. In that whole thing there sounds like there's something that doesn't sit right with you but I'm not sure what it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I don't know. And the same thing with James. You see I worked with him last year. And I went out with him last year a few times. While I was going out with James. And I slept with him a few times. But we were like good friends. And that was ok. Except I kinda had a crush on him. And then this year he just started coming by all the time. 0:37:10.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Is it something like, I don't know how to say it. Is the question for you something like, or the place that you're puzzled something like, how come sleeping with both of them attracted them or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think actually the question is that, yeah I guess I think that is the question. Both of these things were like a lark in my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, and I probably didn't think enough of myself that I thought they would want to come back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. It's like they took you a hell of a lot more seriously than you took you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's sorta surprising. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what's that about me that after they sleep with me they want more or want to come back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's there besides me in bed that's attractive that they care about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like last year I was going out with a guy that I don't even think that I ever kissed. I might have kissed him. I went out with him a lot of times. And honestly I never knew why he went out with me. That's probably, I thought that because I wasn't sleeping with him. I'm sure of it. And I couldn't understand why he did that. I can understand, I went out with a lot of people a few times, you know. And for various reasons, never again. But this one guy, I just never understood that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. Again and again and again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Boy. What, what did he see? 0:39:32.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: For as long as I can remember that's been something that, for some reason and I don't know why, has been very important to me to be, well, I don't know exactly but, I could (inaudible at 0:40:20.4) That's all I can think of. 0:40:25.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like to really arouse and satisfy a man in bed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And actually yeah. Maybe that goes back to not having orgasms because I really didn't want to ask that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you like you have to make up for it or something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe. I'm not sure about that. But that's something that I know, like maybe that starts in high school when people talk about ways people kiss or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saying like maybe that started it for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe I felt that was all that, I'm sure that, I know that I felt that was all I had to offer. And maybe actually I still do feel that way.0:41:36.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's maybe, it's sorta like it's as far back as you can remember into puberty and maybe into now, not having much or anything to offer other than sexually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I can't remember thinking about why did Drew call me for some reason. I really don't. But I know that a lot of times now, but I blame this on having a crush on James all last year. I'll be, I'll look at him and I'll be amazed, amazed that he loves me, really. But I blame that on having a crush on him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because usually people that you have a crush on..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're so far above you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't, wait though. What do you mean you blame it on having a crush? 0:42:59.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I, I think why do you feel so amazed? And then I think oh well it's because..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not that I feel I'm so cruddy. It's that I think he's so far above me. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I still do, I don' t know. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure. I'm getting a little lost. But it sounds like, like now I guess you say even now that it's like sometimes you kinda look over at him and then you want to kinda pinch yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. That's it. That is really. Which doesn't seem all right for me at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be able to take it for granted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. 0:43:57.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of being like a kid with a new toy all the time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like it's the nicest time I've ever had with a man but I'm still worried about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In that, maybe because I think that I. I was thinking this last night and... See Tuesday night he played cards with all his boyfriends so I went out and visited my girlfriends. And I didn't really see him. And yesterday just in my mind, and I had no specific reason to, but I find I like going out with you all night. Like maybe to dinner, something. And then he said he was going to go join the Y and play basketball until 10:00. And I had very conflicting feelings because I knew that this was something that he really wanted to do very much. He'd been talking about it for a month. And the other one was I was really, I was angry and I was hurt both. Unreasonably so, I thought. 0:45:35.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was really trying not to be because I knew that he wanted to do this and I knew that he would come back at 10:00 which is still fairly early enough to do something. And what was I going to say about that? Oh, and in my reaction to that, the way I was feeling was, "Look, you're messing this up now. You're going to mess this up."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. What is it? Like look, if you express any of that feeling then the bubble's going to burst? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did express some and he was, I think he was angry for an instant. And then he asked me if he was doing wrong. If he shouldn't do it. And I had to say no it wasn't the wrong thing for him to do. And I didn't know why I was so upset. 0:46:36.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like that his reaction surprised you or that you didn't expect him to say, "Hey, am I in the wrong here?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't expect him to do that. And I thought that he would think that I was being unreasonable. Even after I said it's ok. Because I was still trying very hard not to be upset but I, I mean I, he knew that I was. And I was really, unreasonably upset. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sorta like the thing that's surprising is like you experienced the unreasonableness. He didn't. I mean he got angry. But after that it was like he wondered if there was some merit in that, in your, in the way you reacted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. I mean that it's true that it surprised me. I'm really bored. Now I'm bored with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually the thing that was making me stay upset was my feeling that I was messing this up 0:48:27.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I was beginning to. Not that that's going to do it but from then on it was going to (inaudible at 0:48:39.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like it sorta felt like the beginning of the end. How does it feel now? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like him too much today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I do still (inaudible at 0:48:57.3) today or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorta, I guess that (inaudible at 0:49:04.5 dump you (inaudible at 0:49:05.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think I'm doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like look if you're going to leave me because I'm upset then I'm not going to let you hurt me. I'm back here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not going to let you hurt me because I'm back here now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Back here now? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Back here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:49:25.5) Yeah. Like I'm not going to put myself out for you because you hurt me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't know how, how did he do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make any sense (inaudible at 0:49:42.4) I thought he hurt you by playing basketball. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I, yeah but, he.. Yeah I guess so. I don't know what. He hurt me because he wasn't going to be there. 0:50:02.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is silly. Really silly. Because actually my roommate really wanted to talk to me and it gave me two hours to talk to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so, so what you're saying is like it worked. So it worked out for the best. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're also saying, I thought like the thing, to hell with how it worked out. Because if it worked out for the worst it wouldn't matter any. He's still gone. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean gone from my life? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Gone out bouncing a ball. I don't know. I'm way far out here but it's like, you know if it hadn't worked out he wouldn't have been around to do anything about it. So that the fact that it worked out well, that's nice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I thought the anger that you felt was at being left. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. Yeah. And I blamed that on Drew at the time. And I don't know if that's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why should what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why shouldn't it be if it was? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it is. On things that he'd done. Only he would go out and say he was coming back and never come back. 0:51:27.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was your fantasy or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No that was, that was, that happened to Drew all the time. So it's got, I'm sure that this was like a learned response from him in a way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, yeah I see. I do. Sounds sorta like, so in a sense it wasn't. Oh, I see what you mean about blaming it on him. I'm sorry. I just got confused for a second. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh that's all right. Oh you were thinking James. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, when I said why wasn't it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All those short L sounds. Drew, James. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I guess that makes two of us. It sounds like for a minute that you were confused about who it was too. He was going to go out and play basketball and never come back again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I'm not really sure that that's true either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you were feeling that. Or that..</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: See he, almost everything that he does, I do with him. And maybe this is one thing he wanted to do and I couldn't do and I was just angry about that. A little spoiled. I mean I really do think.0:52:47.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you've had everything good. Maybe you, like having one thing that isn't so good, you just threw a temper tantrum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I didn't feel like a temper tantrum but maybe that's it. </p>

<p>I don't know what else I wanted to say. See all these things that I talk about just seem really aimless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aimless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not connected to me.0:54:49.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not connected to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No, no, no, not connected..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh not connected. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. They should be connected? </p>

<p>CLIENT: In my mind all these things about men, I think that they should be connected. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I mean I don't know why not either but I don't see how to figure out why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't either. Maybe because that's just me. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And everything is caused or I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about something like well, there must be some central reason for it. And if there's a central reason then I should see when I talk about these things how they all connect because there's one underlying motive or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah something like that. Maybe that's not true at all. But that's what I think that there is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Why does it seem to you like one, like there's some kind of theme that runs through all of this or something? How do you get the one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because I really think. I don't know how healthy this relationship that I have now is but it is by far the most healthy relationship that I've ever had. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that it is kinda unusual for somebody who's 26. It really is I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm. To have had like one screwed up relationship after another? 0:57:05.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It, yeah. When I was 21 I dated someone that was a real kinda mama's boy kinda. And then I found it out rather quickly. And it really, he was really kind of a confused person. And I knew it. And because, a lot because of him being like that we had a really goofy relationship. I thought. And I don't know. Hope I go out with a lot of people I don't want to go out with but really do. See right now I'm only going out with one person. I'm sure that if this were last year at this time I might even be very confused. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like being with one person only is, and this man in particular, James in particular sorta cleared your head somewhat. Like you're not as muddled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm sure that I'm going to do these same things again. I really am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This isn't the end. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is like some kind of oasis or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when this is over..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I don't want to do those things again. Some of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah there were some pretty unpleasant situations I guess. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've gone out with people I didn't want to go out with. I've slept with people I didn't want to sleep with. I've done a lot of things that I really didn't want to do. And if I wanted to do them then it would have been different. And I know I'm going to do it again. 0:59:14.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it time to stop? I have no idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's about three minutes away. Is your clock inside saying it's time to stop?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible at 0:59:37.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I have. I feel now like I felt, I believe the last time I was here. Like I feel about a lot of things that I don't want, which isn't true I'm sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want to start because I can't stop. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, sounds like there are other things you want to talk about. 1:00:13.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what they are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't want to, you don't want to let yourself focus on what they might be or something because if you start then, the image I have is you're going to walk out the door blabbering. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or wanting to. I don't want to leave like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you've opened up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I need to close up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. I was playing with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really think that all these things have to do with my self image. Not thinking a lot of myself. Which when I'm talking to you like this, I really don't believe. 1:01:42.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that it's true because it seems to really carry through not only (inaudible at 1:01:54.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Not, are you saying like when you're here talking now, you don't think badly of yourself. Is that what you meant by which I don't believe? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or in some other situations that I don't realize it, yeah. 1:02:10.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But in general that does seem to be true. The fact that you don't think highly of yourself explains a lot. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. And it's not a conscious thing that I really ever, unless I stop and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and say hey, why am I doing this? And then you can, oh it's because..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Need people to like me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's true. 1:02:41.9</p>

<p>(inaudible at 1:03:49.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 1:03:59.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I noticed the, it looks like the leaves on that tree are out more than they were yesterday because today I can't see the gate across the parking lot. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh is that right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm wondering if it's something that's blossoming that you're..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I (inaudible at 1:04:19.6) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye. See you Tuesday. 1:04:27.8</p>

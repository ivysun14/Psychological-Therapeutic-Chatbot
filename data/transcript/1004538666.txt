<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where should we start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess with Doreen's bridal shower. I think I'm better at lying to my parents than I think because we went out for lunch for my grandma's birthday yesterday — my grandma's birthday was last week— and so it was me, my parents, my grandma and Sydney, and at the end it was "Ok, see you guys on the 17<sup>th</sup>", the 17<sup>th</sup> being my concert. My mom was like, "Or the 6<sup>th</sup>", and I'm like, "I'm pretty sure I have music stuff", but I couldn't just say, "I do have music stuff and it is during the day." I mean I do have music stuff that day. I don't know what time it is yet, you know? I would probably like the afternoon to relax if I am going to have a three-hour rehearsal. Really the main thing is I don't want to go to the bridal shower and I don't think I've even gotten the invitation anyways. This way it will be short notice and it's all the way out there. I shouldn't be obligated to go to a bridal shower of someone who I don't care about and don't feel close with at all and I don't think she feels close with me at all. She's probably only inviting me because she feels like she's societally obligated to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's fairly customary to invite your potential future sister-in-law to your bridal shower.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't mean I should have to go. I'm already going to the wedding. I came up with a brilliant idea and I asked my mom and my mom was like, "You don't have to worry about a present," and I'm like "What if I got her a skein of hand-dyed yarn that I made myself", which would be something she'd really like. My mom was like "Oh, that would be really nice," and then it wouldn't look that bad that I wasn't there. My mom was like "Oh, think how do you really want to start off the relationship that way? 'She didn't even come to my bridal shower'" I wouldn't want to invite Doreen. Not that I would even want a bridal shower to begin with. If someone made one when I was getting married I'd probably refuse to go because they're stupid. Really, the only person who thinks we should be close is my mom. I feel like Doreen would be just as happy with my not being there as I would be happy with not being there. It's really only my mom who cares at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this decision about whether you go or not — what impact is this going to have on your relationship with your mom, and does that matter to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's not going to hate me forever, especially if I can get the yarn, but I think it's just her being overly concerned about how this will look and what other people think of her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What people will think of your mom? [00:03:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perhaps, yes . . . will think of me, but also will think of her, I guess. Maybe the fact that I'm not going to the bridal shower impacts how she looks, but she's the one who deemed it important that I go to Cullen and Doreen's wedding, not Cullen and Doreen, and then she's the one who's telling my brother, "You have to invite me." And I'm sure that when I get married she'll be the one who's telling him how important it is that he be there at my wedding and not him just wanting to go. I'm 99 percent sure that she would have to tell him this and if it's mutual . . . I mean it would be one thing if I knew that they liked me a lot and it was totally crushing them by my not being there. I know Cullen dislikes me as much as I dislike him and Doreen's opinion of me is probably very much based on what she has heard about me from Cullen. I'm sure Cullen has told her about how horrible a sister I am and, whatever, selfish and who knows what. It's not like Doreen isn't like super overly nice to me when we've all gotten together. It's not like she's been super mean to me. I don't think she likes me particularly, so it's really only my mom who cares, and that's really annoying. It's not like I'm his mom — I'm Cullen's sister. Yes, in theory you should have your siblings at the wedding, but siblings are estranged all the time. We can't just admit that we're estranged and have that be the way it is because our mom is holding onto this fancy outlook of her perfect family that we've never ever had to begin with. My parents were like, "What's wrong?" and I brought up the fact that we fight on family vacations and I was the only one who was willing to admit it out loud and say, "This is not OK and if we're fighting on family vacations, why should I want to subject myself to that?" This is not necessarily normal; not everybody fights on family vacations. Granted I've never really been on a family vacation with someone else's family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think really your decision needs to be based on your relationship with your mom, because it sounds like that's the thing that would be impacted by whether you choose to go or not. You need to decide whether or not that's important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A part of me wants to be able to assert myself, too. The fact that I will have to lie - you have to go to this unless you have a good reason not to - and lying about the fact that I have a good reason not to when my real good reason not to is I don't want to go, which is a perfectly good reason not to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your mind. Maybe not in your mom's.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not in my mom's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a subjective thing. There's no right or wrong there, so what's in your mind might be different than hers. She might think it's not OK to not go just because you don't want to, whereas . . . [00:07:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if you don't want to because you don't like the person and you don't have a close relationship with them . . . it's one thing if you're really close with someone and then you're just deciding, "Oh, I don't feel like going to this bridal shower for this person you really care about." If you don't care about the person anyway and the person doesn't care about you, why should you have to go? Other than this ideal that doesn't exist like really what I think it is. I really doubt Doreen has really expressed any desire to be closer to me or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not Doreen that you're concerned about, it's your mom — your mom being upset with that front not being kept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's her bridal shower. Should my mom care about what she wants? And if Doreen doesn't want me there or doesn't really care, why is my mom fighting so hard to have me go to it? [00:08:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's probably part of the picture she had in her mind when she envisioned her children's' weddings and the festivities around it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She also envisioned that Cullen would be marrying someone Jewish and that didn't happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't have control over these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm also sort of protesting. If she doesn't have control over that she shouldn't have control over whether or not I'm going to this bridal shower. The fact is also it's being thrown by her family and I thought that etiquette was that you're not supposed to throw bridal showers for close relatives, because it's sort of the whole point of a bridal shower just to get gifts. I guess these rules were made back when family was more connected and so if your sister is getting lots of gifts that impacts your financial status as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think a lot of that convention has gone out the window. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're also having it in a hotel so they're paying for this hotel room to have this bridal shower in which the point is to get more gifts. I don't know; bridal showers just make no sense to me. The fact that it's this party and you sit around opening gifts in front of everyone and that's the big event of it. That's the point of this party is to open gifts. When people have birthday parties it's not expected that you gifts, and if people do give gifts you aren't expected to open them up in front of everyone and make a big production about it because we're not all kids. You give birthday presents to people who you're really, really close to, but if you want to invite tons of friends to a birthday party, it's not really so you get tons of gifts it's because you want to celebrate that party with tons of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does the birthday party etiquette have to do with the shower etiquette? [00:10:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just saying in moderate society for the most part adults don't expect other adults to give them gifts but here is this thing where adults are . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is the expectation . . . what you're showering the person with . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . is gifts. Why is there a bridal shower and not a groom shower? The bride gets gifts. I understand baby showers because then you're having a baby and you're getting gifts for that baby. Rather, I understand baby showers for the first baby. You're getting baby clothes and all these things you need, whereas the bridal shower it's getting extra gifts on top of the fact that you're having this wedding where you're also going to get all these gifts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you're not wanting to go based on that you don't agree with the idea of the shower or that it's Doreen's shower? [00:11:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. If it were a shower of someone I cared about I didn't go to Allison's bridal shower, for example. I was invited, but that was because it was all the way out Mid West and . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it had been here would you have gone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you're really not making the decision based on your philosophical feelings about showers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I probably would have gone because I cared about Allison, not because I like any bridal shower. I would have been like "bridal showers are silly."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The decision is really being made on your feelings about Doreen because your feeling about the shower is the same, yet you would have gone to support Allison and you really don't want to go to support Doreen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't like Doreen. Aren't I allowed to not like someone and if I like someone . . . [00:11:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you're allowed to not like someone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do you have to pretend to like people? In general it's OK to pretend to like people because they're your business associates and you have to see them all the time and if you don't pretend to like them they're not going to want to do business with you or something like that but any other reason you can avoid most people. Most of the time I can avoid Doreen. I don't like the whole pretending . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This may or may not be one of those times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all the way out there anyways and I was like, "How would I even get there?" My mom's like, "Oh, maybe Sydney could give you a ride and Cullen and Sydney could hang out," and I'm not going to make Sydney drive me there. That's stupid. That's relying on someone else to do a favor. I guess maybe they would give me a ride or something but, I don't know, it's just I don't want to go. I really don't want to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's really clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have the right not to go and if I'm giving a really nice gift, something that she'd really like and something that she wouldn't be able to find in a store, isn't that enough? Why is that not enough? I'm already pretending to really like her enough to give her this really nice gift. Why do I have to go further and pretend to like her enough to come along to this shower all the way out there the week before my concert where I probably will have infinite rehearsals that night. [00:13:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does your mom know what your feelings are about Doreen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, she does. I was originally telling them about all the horrible, horrible things Doreen did when she and Aimee were at college together. She knows I don't like Doreen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's asking you still to go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like, for her, in her mind, a gift is not enough. Your presence is required to make your mom comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She did say the gift was fine if I can't go, but I guess it's in her mind. Why are her wishes more important than mine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not, but you need to make a decision about whether you go based on what impact you're comfortable having on your mom. Your wishes and your mom's wishes are equally important; but it's up to you whether you go or not and making your decision you need to take into account your mom's feelings. Does that mean that hers trump yours? No, but you need to make a decision for yourself based on the knowledge that your mom wants something different than you do, so you're weighing her feelings and yours. [00:14:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then there's also the whole whether or not I tell her the true reason, like "I'm not going because I don't want to go" versus "I'm not going because I have music," because that would impact her feelings less though I'd be lying. And part of me feels like I shouldn't have to lie because part of me feels like I shouldn't unnecessarily hurt her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's more important — taking your stance or protecting her feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are the decisions that you're making.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also like it gets her opinion of me into being less of me if "I'm just not going because I don't want to go" versus "I'm not going because I can't."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to make an unpopular decision.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd much rather not go than go and I have these two options of not going. It's the "not going because I tell my mom outright I don't want to go. I have this gift instead," or "not going because I have this legitimate reason to not go." (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a hard decision to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because I'm not very good at lying. I'm sorry that I probably would have rehearsal. I still don't know. I really don't know. It is too early to say because it's not like the time has been set for anything else either. I don't honestly know. It's very possible that we could have rehearsal from seven to nine, but like have a [schtick](ph?)[inaudible at 00:16:39] meeting in the afternoon with lunch and stuff and figure out lots of things and if that were to happen I would need to be there for that, too, because I'm sort of always instrumental in the writing of skits and stuff. I mean they could have it without me. It's more optional than rehearsal but it's not truly optional. I probably should be there for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that's happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If that's happening. I don't actually know about rehearsal because I'm also not sure whether I even am lying in the first place because it's still a couple of weeks away. We have our normal rehearsals scheduled but we don't plan extra rehearsals that far in advance. I honestly don't know. Even if we were starting things at five, it takes a while to get up there; it takes awhile to get back [00:17:45], especially if I'm dependent on other people for transportation. That would already make it probably harder for me to go and a more valid excuse for me to not go, because I need to be back in time for rehearsal, even if rehearsal doesn't directly conflict with it. Actually, I don't even know the exact time; I know the bridal shower is early afternoon, like noon or one or something like that. I don't even know when. Basically it's just coming up with excuses not to go. Also, just so you know, what about the fact that I won't be able to eat? I'm sure there will be food at the bridal shower and I'm pretty sure it will be things I'm not able to eat so I won't be getting lunch. Then if I have rehearsal in the evening I won't be getting dinner either. I kind of don't want to miss two meals in a row, but that's not necessarily a good enough reason not to go. [00:18:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are things that could all probably be worked around. If this were something you wanted to attend, you could probably find ways to navigate around those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's the difference between asserting what you think is important and what you want and creating excuses.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could be worked around but it will be annoying to work around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Focus on what the real point is here. The real point is that you don't want to go because you don't like her. It's not that you don't want to go because you have to work around meals. That's something that if you were interested in going, you are smart enough to figure out and experienced enough to figure out how you could bring something that you could eat or how to request a kosher meal or find out what they have at this hotel. There are things that you could do to figure it out if you wanted to. The decision that you really need to make is: "Are you going to be honest with your mom and assert your feelings about attending?" or "Are you going to go and appease your mother that way?" or "Are you not going to go but come up with some other reason rather than your actual reason?" [00:20:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like I'm a bad person if I don't go and do it and tell my mom that I'm doing it because I don't want to go. I'll also feel bad if I don't go and lie, but I feel like if I do go I'll be miserable. I feel that I don't have to go. I feel strongly that I shouldn't have to go. I shouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how do you reconcile "I shouldn't have to go" but feeling like a bad person for not going. Those two feelings seem to be in conflict. If you truly believe that you shouldn't have to go, what makes you a bad person for not going? Somehow I feel those things don't really match up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my mom is the one who thinks I should have to go and that's why it makes me feel like a bad person. If it were a bridal shower of a friend I'd be more likely to go, but I wouldn't even be obligated to go to a bridal shower of a friend. It's nice to go to a bridal shower of a friend; but if you RSVP'ed and tell them "no" and you're not last-minute deciding not to go, there's nothing inherently wrong with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like there's something inherently wrong with not going to a family member's? Do you feel — not your mom — I know your mom feels, but what do you feel? [00:21:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't. I don't. Yeah, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with not going. (pause) Because then, theoretically, if you were obligated to attend every thing you were invited to, that would make the world a very different or problematic place. People are not obligated to go to things. It's nice to have people come to things. Like if you have a birthday party and you try to invite tons of people and they all say no, that would suck; then if you find that out you'd change the date of it or something or just not have it. On the one hand I feel like individuals shouldn't have to go, on the other hand I feel like it is a bad thing if you have this event and then no one comes; but it's not that no one is going to come in this case. It's also worse if you say you're going to go and then don't go last minute than if you just tell them you can't go. I guess it's also whether or not you're skipping the event of someone you care about. I think it does matter whether or not you care about the person. If you have a friend who's having a party and you don't have a reason not to go, if you want to make your friend happy you should go. I guess there's the aspect of if Allison had had a bridal shower in a place that I could have gone, I would have gone to it because I wanted to make her happy; whereas I don't want to make Doreen happy. [00:23:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to make your mom happy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Not enough to want to go to this. I feel like I'm already compromising enough on the whole Doreen thing. I shouldn't have to compromise more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like your feelings are pretty clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to the wedding. Isn't that enough? That should be enough. For any reasonable person, that would be enough. For example, my cousin, is going to the bridal shower because my mom is like, "Oh, you could always hang out with your cousin" and I'm like, "OK, that's not really a helpful answer, Mom." I'd still be there when I don't want to be. In general it would be nice if I could make my mom happy, but I shouldn't have to make her happy in such a way that actually actively goes against what I believe and is not, if not harmful, at least unpleasant for me. She shouldn't be putting me in this situation beforehand. It would be one thing if she'd said, "OK, Doreen is going to have a bridal shower and would you be able to come?" and if I said, "No," then she'd just left it at that. Or if I said, "I'd really rather not," and she was like, "OK," but the fact that she's insisting on it puts me in a more difficult position that I shouldn't have to be in the first place. [00:25:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lots of "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts".</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try to think about what it would be like if the situation were reversed and I can't make a good comparison because I know Doreen is evil. Doreen doesn't know that I know that Doreen is evil, as far as I know. Doreen doesn't know that I'm friends with Aimee and that Aimee has told me about all the things that she did in college; therefore . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the important piece here is really your relationship with your mom is important to you in a way that your relationship with Doreen is not. And so it sounds like what's really guiding your decision and the conflict you feel about the potential of going is wanting your mom to respect your feelings more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like that's the piece. I hear these "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts" come into your language and they're all around really wishing your mom would respect your feelings, that it would be uncomfortable for you to go because you don't really like Doreen. You don't respect Doreen, you don't like Doreen, and you don't want to be there for those reasons' and you're upset that that's not enough for your mom to set aside her expectations and the importance she's placing on maybe the appearance of a cohesive or welcoming family. [00:26:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's the other part, because it's appearances. And that's what really bothers me. It's not because she even needs there to be — she just wants the appearance of a cohesive family. That's why she thinks it's important that I go to their wedding, because it would look bad to the rest of the family if I wasn't there without a legitimate reason, because she thinks it looks bad — not that she thinks that Cullen and Doreen will be upset. She isn't even taking their feelings into account she's taking appearances and making that the biggest priority, I think. Maybe she somewhere in her mind thinks Cullen would be disappointed if I weren't at the wedding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mom would be disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom would be disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe she's also thinking about other people, but you can leave it at what you know. She would be disappointed because it doesn't meet with her expectations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I wouldn't be going to the wedding to hurt her, I'd be not going to the wedding because I don't want to, especially because going to a wedding you're going to celebrate the fact that these two people are getting married and you're happy that these two people are getting married. Cullen's a jerk, too, so it's like they deserve each other. I'm not happy to welcome her into my family, so I'm already sort of lying in a way by being there in my pretending to be happy for them. She was also telling me at one point when I was working on these . . . [00:28:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're hexipuffs. I'm basically making hundreds of them and then I'm going to sew them all together and it's going to be this big quilted blanket. My mom is like, "Oh, you could do something like that for Cullen and Doreen," and I was like, "No way in hell." That would be a lot of work. It's going to take me years to make my own hexipuff blanket. And even if it was quicker, Cullen has denigrated my knitting before. I told her of this and that and she at least respected it. Even if Doreen might appreciate the work that goes into it Cullen would denigrate it and, therefore, I refuse to ever give Cullen anything hand knit. I guess at least she respects the fact that I shouldn't have to put in hours and hours of work to make this wonderful gift for someone; and if I'm getting something off the registry, that's enough. At the same time, she still thinks that I still do have to get a gift, or a gift has to be given in my name, which I guess would have been her original — because when she said not to worry about the gift for the bridal shower — I guess she would have gotten something else for me to give to Doreen to pretend like I was getting Doreen a gift because of the appearances. I guess it just bothers me that she cares so much about appearances in a way that I don't and I'd rather be honest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something you can be honest with her about - that it's upsetting to you that she's placing the importance of the appearance ahead of your feelings about being there? [00:30:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. I have to see. I don't know when the next time I'll talk to her is. It wasn't the place to argue with her when I was saying goodbye to all of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not a conversation to have in front of other people. This is really between you and your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know if she'll respect that or not. It's something rational to say, right? You could be completely rational to put honesty over appearances, right? I really do think it would be a completely different story if Doreen would be all excited to have me there and stuff; but because the feeling is mutual — really, really, really I think it's all in my mom. She's the one that cares about these things. She is going to care if Cullen and Doreen come to my wedding. I could invite them and give them a heads up like "my parents want you to be there but I will not be at all offended if you don't come." She would then be the one to tell them "you have to be there" like she's telling me, even though I don't care. It's just the appearance of having a close family. It's like, "What will people think if your own sister isn't at the wedding?" or something like that. It really is, "What will people think?" I guess I care less about what people think, or at least about what other people think outside of — I mean I guess I care about what my mom thinks, but I don't care about what the people she cares about think. I think she thinks it would be a huge scandal. Maybe it would be a huge scandal if I wasn't at the wedding, I don't know. But I think it would be less of a huge scandal for my mom at this bridal shower. I don't know. I don't really want it to be that; and the whole point is just to give more gifts to a person that I don't particularly like and don't particularly want to be related to in any way. [inaudible at 00:32:42] (pause) It's just she likes making me do stuff. She also then sends an e-mail. She sent me an e-mail last week and sent me another today, sent to me and Cullen, "Today is grandma's birthday, you should call her." And I'm like "I just saw her yesterday." It may be nice if I called her for her birthday but I did wish her a happy birthday yesterday and it would be one thing if we'd gone out a couple of weeks before her birthday for her birthday but it was the day before. I certainly didn't expect calls from everyone when it's my birthday. So it's, you know, she's having me do that, too. I like my grandma more than I like Doreen but I don't feel especially close to my grandma either. And that's even harder to tell my mom because it's like, "She's your grandmother — how could you not be close to her," whereas Doreen happens to be a complete stranger who happens to be marrying my brother. At this point it's not like grandma will even remember whether or not I called her on her birthday. I just hate being guilted into things and I feel like I'm being guilted into things all the time and I don't want to be guilted into things. It's really annoying that that's like all my mom uses is guilt. (pause) [00:34:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An uncomfortable position to be in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it weren't for the fact that I'm not yet able to support myself, I would feel less obligated to be nice to my family and more like, "OK, I will let myself be estranged from them. If they really want me to go to this wedding and I really don't want to go to this wedding, that will be the consequence and that's OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how does their financial support tie in for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't think they'll support me if I refuse to be part of the family and then I'd be screwed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in taking the money they're helping you out in some way, and so this would be kind of your way of helping them out to act in accordance with what they expect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Calling grandma is one thing and that doesn't take much of my time. It isn't the end of the world and if I forget to do it, I forget; but it's not like it's that hard for me to do. The bridal shower is a lot bigger than that. Really it's more of a stretch. I'm being even more fake in pretending even more having to like someone that I hate, as opposed to feeling really close to someone who often gets on my nerves. (pause) If I did have a job it's not like I would necessarily just rush of and not do anything my parents asked me to, but I would feel less inclined, less trapped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very possibly. And that's where being able to have an honest conversation with your mom find out is there really a link between their financial support and doing what would make her happy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really don't want to have that conversation right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a hard conversation to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I can avoid it, I will. I'd much rather just — it is so much easier to lie and say I have music. Or, even if I somehow could make it and music happens, which I asked about, though. When I asked about it was too early. After I heard about the bridal shower I actually did ask and they're like "we have rehearsal then we have like the week before the concert. Is there anyway we can have it in the afternoon? He was like, "Why?" and I was like, "I have a bridal shower that I don't want to go to," as opposed to a bridal shower that I don't have to go to that I don't want to have to miss rehearsal for. Moving rehearsal so I can miss the bridal shower. If the group could do it, the group could do it. If they can't, they can't. It's like one thing to ask to move rehearsal because of this thing that I have to go to and either I will go to it no matter what and either I will miss rehearsal or I can go to this earlier rehearsal versus "I'd like this rehearsal moved so I can have a great excuse not to go to something." [00:38:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've gone to a lot of work to try to arrange your life in a way that lets you avoid something. There's a consequence to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible at 00:38:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're feeling pretty stressed about it. Trying to think in your head about all the options and is it possible that this would actually conflict for you and can you arrange it to conflict for you. It's creating some anxiety for you and lying about it is going to create feelings of guilt, which you carry quite a bit of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Going is going to create feelings of resentment. There are no good options. If going were just like, "OK, I will go to this bridal shower that I kind of don't want to be at" and whatever; but it's a bridal shower that I really don't want to be at, so there's sort of a difference, I think. There is no good option that will make me happy. There is only trying to figure out which option will make me the least unhappy. Maybe going is the option that will make me the least unhappy, but I really don't want to and I really feel strongly that I shouldn't have to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems like there would be a lot of resentment then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I go? Yeah. But I really think lying might be my best option and feeling a little bit guilty about lying versus a lot of bit guilty about hurting my mom or a lot of resentment about going. [00:40:13] (pause) I am angry that she's making it into a thing that I have to go to or not just so it would be like, "Oh, it would be so nice if you went." I try not to guilt people into doing things and it's just annoying that people don't have the same consideration. I think it's [inaudible at 00:40:49].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the difference between her telling you that she wants you to go and guilting you into it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The difference is there are consequences to me not going versus if it was just like, "Oh, it would be nice — but if you don't go, that's fine." It's like she's attaching the "I will be disappointed if you're not going and you can go." She's attaching that thing as a consequence that does not need to be there. If I were going to be disappointed if someone were not going to go to something, I'd try not to let them know that and try to get over it such that I won't get mad at them for not going; but not force them to go to something they don't want to go to, because I don't want to force someone to do something they don't want to do. I think that's the difference between me and my mom. It's that my mom cares less about forcing me into something I don't want to do, which is really annoying. I don't know if this is typical behavior or if this is my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there are so many variations in parents and relationships with children that there's really no typical — there's just all kinds of relationships out there. [00:42:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. There is a range of "functional" relationships and "less-functional" and this would be on the less functional end of the spectrum, probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel like makes it less functional and what would be better functioning for you in your experience?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (A) if it weren't for the fact that I hate my brother in the first place and the fact that we don't get along anyway and I don't like Doreen. If Cullen were someone I got along with and Doreen was someone I respected, then this whole situation wouldn't arise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what feels not so functional about your relationship with your mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that she guilted me into things. That she's making her wishes more important than mine. Just not respecting the fact that I don't want to go and pushing it on me when I really should just be able to say, "I don't want to go," and have that be it. The way she was phrasing it, it sounded like it was because of Doreen's feelings, except I really knew underneath it, it was because of appearances and that she's putting appearances above my own emotional needs — or desires, at least — when appearances are stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my mind. They are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your experience is no more valid than hers. To her, the appearance means something. To you, it doesn't; but that doesn't negate her feelings. I'm not saying that hers should count more than yours, but yours can't really count more than hers, either. Her feelings count just as much as yours do. You have one outcome here and someone's feelings are going to be hurt in some way; but you're both adults now so your feelings don't get to mean more than hers, nor should they mean less.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And usually if I'm in a situation like this I do end up doing something that's sacrificing myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the fair thing is something your feelings get sacrificed and sometimes hers do. That's the balance in a relationship, and even in a functioning relationship one person's feelings don't always outweigh the others all the time. There are going to be situations where there is conflict and someone ends up compromising. Sometimes that is setting aside your own feelings and sometimes it's setting aside the other person's. [00:45:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They'd all insisted on me going and sprung this on me. I guess it's not like it's at the last minute, because I've had [inaudible at 00:45:54] but it's still like, "Oh, there's going to be this bridal shower. We're going to have it here and not just like her having a bridal shower out West," or something. If the bridal shower was out West then I wouldn't have to . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be easier, but here you are with this conundrum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well part of it is like it's still an hour away, so it's not like completely crazy of me not to want to go just on logistical reasons, it's just that they're not really legitimate logistical reasons, like it's not impossible for me to go . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like it will cost me tons of money for me to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you wanted to make this work, it wouldn't be much of a hurdle at all. It seems like a big inconvenience because you don't want to go; but if it were a good friend having a bridal shower here it would be a half-hour away, and it wouldn't be that hard to get there. Each little hurdle feels really big because you don't want to go. You have to make your decision based on what it's really about and decide how you want to let your mom know about what you're feeling, either telling her honestly what you're feeling or choosing another way of explaining your decision to her. [00:47:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would it be a really bad thing if I did end up lying and just said I have music?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't answer that. You have to decide that for yourself. It's not about good or bad — or right or wrong. It's about knowing what impact it's going to have on you, what impact it's going to have on the relationship, and making your decision that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the impact on me sort of is colored by whether or not I'm thinking this is doing something entirely wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That has to be your decision. It has to be based on your values and your morals, not on mine or somebody else's.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the one hand, I value being honest. On the other hand, I'd be dishonest by saying I have music or I'm being dishonest by pretending to be close to Doreen in going to this bridal shower; and I feel like the pretending to be close to Doreen is the bigger dishonesty than the "I have rehearsal" lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretending to who? Are you going to tell your mom that you're close to Doreen if you go? [00:48:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretending to all the people at the bridal shower who don't know that I hate Doreen, which would be everybody but my mom. Doing this in front of my mom in such a way that it looks like I don't hate Doreen, which would also take emotional energy, too. It's easier to avoid someone than to have to outright pretend to like them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really, it's a decision you have to make on your own. I can't influence your decision. I can help. I was happy to listen and kind of point out what truly to make decisions about and what things to weigh for yourself. Some of your values are in conflict here and you need to weigh that - your value about honesty and your value about hurting your mom. That's what makes it so hard. If things weren't in conflict with one other, then it would feel like a much easier decision to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I liked Doreen then it would be a lot easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. This would be much easier. We wouldn't be talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be like, "OK, I'm going to go to this bridal shower that is sort of far away," but I don't like Doreen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not the case. We do need to stop for today. We're scheduled again for next Monday. Is that OK or do you want to meet before then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's OK.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We discussed already, this summer - Timothy's (ph) living separately this summer because, maybe, he'll be able to work at the summer camp. And the guy didn't really have any positions left, except for he said, "Unless you want head up the sailing program and the tennis program. Unfortunately, my dad's a tennis pro (inaudible) so [I can't do that] (ph).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Did we talk to you about that possibility?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you talked last week about it. Yes, [you did] (ph).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [Signing up, getting applied], (ph) left him a voice mail message. And, then, I e-mailed him because, I guess, it was school break for his kids last week - their kids. So the camp's directed by this one guy named Scott, he and his wife both direct the camp pretty much. His great-grandfather started it back in 1952. I don't know if I told you any of the details about it. [00:01:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have some of the (inaudible at 00:01:12) and so forth?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I forgot what I was going to say.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. I was talking with Timothy (ph) about how to phrase it right when I was asking him in the e-mail, because it's not like ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): That's Timothy (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whether or not - you know, it's like if he had a position for both Jessica (ph) and I - that's kind of a tall order, especially this late in the season. But (inaudible) it looks like he has a position for just me, which, kind of, answers the question that we wanted to have answered anyway. I just wanted to know if we [needed to] (ph) spend some time apart (pause), which isn't easy (pause [00:02:08] to 00:02:17) but I think it's important that we still maintain the idea that we keep the option open for getting back together at the end of the summer.</p>

<p>I just know that I'm - I mean, there's something about this whole thing where it's like - okay, in terms of new ideas, it's like the summer camp is a new idea and it looks like it's just for me and I'm talking to my parents about it - at least my stepmom and my sister and my dad - I couldn't get my stepdad on the phone but, anyway - or (ph) I don't need approval from anyone. I mean I do, like, psychologically but it's also the idea that I don't need to get my stepdad's approval to do this. [00:03:12]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, you talked to him about it and he was like, (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He was lukewarm but, the fact is, if I approach him and this is actually set up, then you're not going to be bothered with me at all, all summer. And, then, at the end of the summer I'm going to have money to be able to get an apartment without having to ask for anything from you. The point is I have, after talking with them and everything, these family members, I have no doubt that I'm - I hope that I'm pretty sure that it will be a good context for me to be in because of the stuff we talked about last week - just the schedule of the place, the fact that it's an extremely sober place to be.</p>

<p>I mean, obviously, I want to be there for the kids and the campers, first and foremost, because that's my job but - [00:04:03]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [He had] to learn how to sail -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, no, I know how to sail. I mean, I've (inaudible) several summers at the (inaudible) Sailing Club out on the Cape, where I [had to] sail. But it's sort of like riding a bike. I'm sure it will be fine. The other thing is I know how to camp (ph) so this is all - these are all details right now that ...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk at 00:04:23)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And, I think, when I get up there, I'm not going to [pretend I'm a sailing instructor] (ph) (inaudible) place and they allocate resources as they need them. It's a dynamic (ph) kind of place. It doesn't really make any sense to have a professional woodworker not being involved in the woodshop.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Unless you're the only one (inaudible) -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not the point. (pause) The point is I know it will be a good context for me, right? But I'm concerned because I want you to have a good ... [00:05:11]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'll (ph) just go to Virginia. [I'll get a job] (ph) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know, I just ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's too bad my nephews (inaudible) - they'll (ph) be gone; they'll be in Europe for a whole month so - but, other than that, [I'll get to] (ph) spend time with them.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just need to know that - it couldn't be a better place for me to just get away from all the negative habits I might have. And all of the feeling alienated here and all that kind of stuff. I'll embrace the [support network] (ph) around me of people. I'll be in a position of responsibility. [And we're] talking about plugging yourself in to things where you can successful or ways - I just know that I - knock on wood, I'm hoping it will be a good context for me. And I don't know what our goals are - I mean, I know what our goals are financially and personally but I'm not really sure what our goals are as a couple but I - what I think we need is space to be able to reflect on ... [00:06:10]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean, I asked him if we weren't married would he break up with me if I cheated on him and he's like, "Yes" so -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, (inaudible)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Probably ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Probably ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): You don't know for sure.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know but there's a ...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was just a piece of paper (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I agree with you but I was also thinking about it, though. Once you get married its, sort of, - it, sort of, formalizes a bunch of stuff, which -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But maybe I wasn't thinking of it that way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know, it's just if you're just dating and you are unfaithful to your boyfriend or girlfriend, even if they're long-term and everything like that, that's an issue. And, personally, you hope that it was no different, you're right. But, then, there's just - well, I always thought that getting married was sort of a weird social and cultural objectification of love, you know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Me too. That's why I didn't really take it seriously when (ph) I should have (inaudible). [00:07:01]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: There's financial benefits, apparently. And there's social - (inaudible) it's a piece of paper, in our case, issued by the State of Virginia, where a bunch of our friends who are gay couldn't get married. There's the inconsistencies - however, when we got - the weekend we got married - the week before, our home state, gay people [were actually] (ph) allowed to get married - that week. So I was - I felt - I was, sort of, like, "Okay, well, at least where I'm from."</p>

<p>Even though my license is in Virginia, our marriage license is in Virginia. At least where I'm - where we're from, it's a universal right and [made me] (ph) feel a little better about it. I mean, that's all - these are all just philosophical ideals and stuff like that but I guess they're practical too but that's not related. I just wanted to make a little cool, historical footnote [because I'm recording] (ph).</p>

<p>(Crosstalk) [00:08:00]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): [Did you say] (ph) you're thinking about the recording? [I forgot about it.] (ph)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I just - for two seconds. I don't really care. (pause [00:08:05] to 00:08:16)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, at first, about being separated, I was like, "Well, if we're going to get divorced, I don't really want to wait a long time to (inaudible) if I do want to have a child with somebody - I don't want to hang on to this arguing, of course, but I realize I should - I would like to, at least, get the chance to just be separated for the summer; it wouldn't just be moving on (inaudible).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think when we were initially talking about it maybe our tempers were a little bit heated - a little bit - or just reactions that aren't necessarily how you actually feel. You just put out there something but - Jessica's (ph) like, "Well, you know, maybe I'll start seeing someone over the summer." And I'm like, "Well, if you're going to do that, then forget it (ph). That's not the point of what we're doing. The idea is that we're still married and we're still going to be faithful to each other over the summertime and we see where we stand in August." [00:09:10]</p>

<p>And then you immediately corrected what you thought and what you said - or changed what you said. And you're, like, "Okay, I see I should give you a few months." One thing that - I need to stop rambling. I feel like it's not fair to - in our conversations in here, sometimes, I think I have my foregone things rather than where I sit on another one, which is the way I talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST (?): (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I just end up dominating. I need to, sort of, be conscientious about [doing it] (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's certainly a dynamic between the two of you, where you're much more expressive and, Jessica (ph), you really, sort of, hang back and can be quite quiet. (pause) When you said a moment ago about if this has a chance of working out, what would working out look like for you? [00:10:06]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Us having a plan for the future and wanting to be together and not wanting to be with anyone else. But not just living like we are now. We have time apart to figure out what we could each do for our futures - what we want to do separately and then, [if they work] (ph) together. (pause [00:10:31] to 00:10:38) I mean I don't know if I'd be looking for a job here, though. I mean, I'm living if I'm living in Virginia. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would make you choose to go to Virginia?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I don't think my family - I don't have a job right now so I don't know how I would pay rent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you'd live with them?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. My dad would like me to live with him for a little while but my other sister lived with him for a little while until she found a new job. She got a good job. (chuckles) - fundraising for the sexual abuse trauma (ph) thing - nonprofit organization. (pause [00:11:19] to 00:11:23) But I also know that my family is also more discouraging of our continuing our marriage. So that's, kind of, one reason I wouldn't want to live with them because I might be convincible or encouragable (ph) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When you say you're impressionable, which I think is probably true but I think you're - I think you're ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think when I'm home and my one sister that's very annoying to me, and strong about opinions and not all - not right (ph) a lot of times, I - you know, and I'm disagreeing with her when I'm there but then, once I leave, I kind of still have the feelings that she planted (ph). [00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When we were - because we weren't together from November 2010 until the summer - last summer, in 2011. And it was like your family was telling you that you should probably divorce me because we weren't with each other that whole time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: They weren't really saying that; they were just like, "Well, don't go up there until you can - if you - if ya'll aren't going to be able to support yourselves." But then you convinced me to come home.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I thought she had a job when she was moving up. And that job didn't start for another few months.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And my mom just wanted me to be happy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Of course, and she was on her - you didn't know it at the time but about to be on her deathbed. I mean, [that she was dying]. [Those little things] (ph) she wasn't necessarily - she was just (inaudible) back, which was really weird but whatever. [00:13:10]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): She had cancer.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just I'm not necessarily encouraged by her as, sort of, related to what I was saying earlier, about how I know the context I'm in is one where I'm going to able to be contemplative and think about the big picture. Then I just - I don't want, by default, your situation is going to go on where you're just not going to - but, I mean, that's also up to you, you know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I know. I want to be in a - I don't want to be hanging out with people that are doing drugs and stuff so I'll probably just hang out with my family (ph) (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But Virginia's a bad context for us, at least you know -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Unless I'm friends with my sister's friends.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, sure.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible) - I don't know. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, at least you wouldn't be isolated. That's the problem with where we're living right now; we're isolated. And [we just] (ph) don't have anyone outside of ourselves to be with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is your hope for being separated - or separate, not necessarily separated, to sort of see if you can figure out your own way of taking care yourself and seeing if the two of you can come together after ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There's that and, also, just I want to give him some time. Because if he doesn't think he can forgive me, I just want him to be sure.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She can't get over it (inaudible) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because if he can't, then I'm not going to want to spend the rest of my life with you if you can't ...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The frustrating thing is it's not like - I feel like it's not like a conscious - it's not like it's a conscious decision by me whether or not I (ph) forgive you or whatever the - whatever that is that I need to do, right? It's like - I dream about that - about that situation most nights and it wakes me up. [00:15:20]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Have you lately?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, not the last few days but it's not ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I was just wondering because you didn't wake me up or ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The only time I wake you up is I wake up violently - some kind of horrible dream ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, I usually know but, anyway.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not violently towards her, I'm just - I just wake up like this (ph) - the point is it's not like - its not like something I'm choosing or not choosing; it's how I feel.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But we've been married for a long time and we both really love each other very much. I think we both know that. We both care about each other very much and that's not going to ever change ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just don't want us to ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ... whether we'll be together or not, you know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I won't be able to be with you if you can't forgive me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We can't live like this. [00:16:04]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - or down on myself, or whatever. You know, unfortunately, it's more than just my emotions towards you, though. It's like - it's a give and a take and I think the longer - more time, it's like the more subtle things become. But that's sort of wishing we both, sort of, just be happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thought I had about the forgiveness is there's, certainly, an individual piece of you, Michael (ph), thinking if you - figuring out if you can. But I also think that it's also a process between the two of you that I, actually, don't think has started yet really. I think it's been more about your trying to figure out if it's something that you can do. But I think the process between the two of you hasn't started. And I don't really know if it's possible if there's not also a process between the two of you. And part of that process is talking a lot about what happened and why. [00:17:09]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, sometime last week I was really upset. And it wasn't so much exactly what Michael (ph) had done, it was just something (inaudible) the feeling that - just thinking about the past and things like how I felt at certain points. And the problem I have is that - I don't know, I mean I can't change the past, I know that much, but I'm not still cheating on him and I'm not - but I don't know - he was (ph) still using drugs. I know I used (ph) drugs too, but that's why I got upset. Because Michael (ph) has said whatever I did trumps that but I can't - I'm not still doing it. [00:18:03]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's not fair to put them in a hierarchy of wrongness. It's not a fair thing to do [by me] (ph) .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that Michael (ph) doing drugs was a betrayal of you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, we all - we both do them but I don't - I mean, it's addictive so I don't really - I don't know, it makes me [feel ashamed] sometimes or I feel like a burden, I guess, if I'm getting in the way of his drug use or something.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not (inaudible) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like I'm just nagging him or something. If that's what he wants to do, that's what he's going to do.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible) slip up (inaudible) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know that's not really what you want to do but you still - but at certain times, that is really what you want to do so you go for it. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Which doesn't get me any further with anything else; it just numbs it out, which, I guess, is what I'm going for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you trying to numb?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just the feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of feelings?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Some anger and sadness and loss about my mom and everything else, too; it's not just about Jessica (ph).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But doesn't it also have to do a lot with being at work? With all those feelings you don't really have the energy for work, or something?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean, I'm sure you would just as soon be that way at home, too. (pause [00:19:37] to 00:19:44) Or is just because your drug dealer is your (ph) only friend?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know, Jessica (ph). Over the weekend, I wanted to go and use, right? I was having really suicidal fantasies.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, he wanted to go (inaudible) something. Well, on Saturday you wanted to go out there the next day. Do a bunch of drugs and hang yourself you said. By Sunday, you (inaudible) - [00:20:11]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because I did what I needed to do and I called people and talked to them.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Who? Your sister?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My sister, my stepmom, my dad. Most importantly, my friend Miles (ph), who's out West. He was working until after 11:00 - until 11:30, his time, so I didn't get him on the phone until almost 3:00 a.m. and I talked to him for two hours. (inaudible) [00:20:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When Michael (ph) is in these states where he's feeling like he wants to use and he's suicidal, what is it like for you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible) tried to give him a hug or something. (inaudible) angry or I just want to keep him from doing it. So I would rather just get all the money and hold on to it so he can't buy any drugs (inaudible) - make him take his medicine for that. [00:21:15]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, you were also - (inaudible) threatening - well, yeah, you were threatening me (ph). You were like, "If you do this tomorrow," - over the weekend. She said this on Saturday. It's like, "you do this tomorrow, I'm just going to call my Dad and have him rent me a truck and [move right] (ph) down to Virginia.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): Oh, yes, that's -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I was like, "Well, it's almost like using drugs makes it my fault for us splitting up."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, that's...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's why I'm like...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was the point, I guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - which is, really, adversarial and stupid when (ph) you look at it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But you don't want it to be...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But we were (ph) upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, are you communicating, Jessica (ph), that "I don't want to take this anymore or I can't do this anymore"?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess so, yes. Yes, I wasn't communicating that, "Oh, this makes it your fault." I wasn't - but that's just the way that it would look, I guess, [and be realized,] (ph) though. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [It is] a good incentive not to use, honestly. But it's not a fair position - the reasons why. The only effective reasons for - the only truly effective basis for sobriety, that actually has any longevity - that it can't be based on bullshit like that; it has to come from within me for the right reasons.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): Sure, you can start out like that but ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get the - I mean, what it seems like - if the shoe fits, wear it. Whatever it takes to get you through today, kind of thing. That's (ph) probably how most of the 12-steppers (ph) would look at it. But real healing has to come from way less selfish basis. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One question I had for you, Jessica (ph), in terms of your - in your equating, you've mentioned this before, your cheating on Michael (ph) with his drug use. So there's, clearly, a relationship in your mind.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it's just things that might make our marriage not be so good. (inaudible) - things that mess up our marriage, I guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I just needed to point out something, which is I'm not ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's hard for me to really equate them because it's not like his drug use is unexpected. But that still doesn't mean it's okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I'm honest with you [about it] (ph).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Generally speaking.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: After the ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: After the fact, sometimes, yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: As far as I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think it's an important - I do want to understand this and I think it's important for your relationship if you are going to go forward. That if there's aspects of Michael's (ph) behavior that was, simply, unacceptable to you, why that (ph) you choose to cheat on him rather than leave. [00:24:12]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, it's a good ...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't really...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...and this is, sort of, me having...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Maybe it's part of the fact that he had gone to rehab, I had gone to rehab, so the drug use was both our problems (ph). Maybe I'm still hoping it wouldn't be a problem. [I don't know] (ph) but just - since it made me feel bad about myself and the person I was cheating on him with did not make me feel bad about myself. Maybe that was it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bad about yourself because you used (ph) together?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: More, just, that he cared - he didn't care as much for me as he did about going to work so he could do drugs or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just need to point out - and this is my knee-jerk reaction but it's also showing I'm pointing out this is a knee-jerk reaction of mine - the point is I'm not saying this is, right now, without a healthy amount of self-awareness but - a certain hypocrisy to it because Jessica (ph) has used drugs... [00:25:24]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): [I know.] (ph)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...and what I'm doing is something that she's done...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just see it as a - its bad for our relationship that either of us using drugs and that we're just not good for...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And, also, she was doing heroin.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it's not just that he used drugs but we encouraged each other and...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure, no - it's like...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: If I was with someone that didn't use drugs, then I would be - I wouldn't be encouraged...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, it's the worst trigger ever - is us getting together and doing drugs together.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I can't totally blame him, I just - it seems like we might just be (inaudible) with each other. [00:26:00]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, she, sometimes, - you know, we do drugs and it's like she's doing them with me. Also, like more than half the time - like way more than I do them by myself but whatever. But the other thing is she was doing heroin with that guy when she was cheating on me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, but that...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, it's sort of like...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...because I thought you were doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) because you thought he was doing it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it's kind of like when - like on Wednesday when he did drugs, it just made me want to do them too but I didn't [end up doing them.] (ph)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that was part of it...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just saying this is my knee-jerk reaction; I'm like, "Well, dude, you were doing...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The first time I...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...literally, doing heroin with Joshua (ph).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The first time I saw him, whenever - I don't think you were doing heroin at that time. I didn't really know there was going to be heroin there at the house when I got there but I did it (inaudible) - [00:27:07]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Its, sort of, like - I'm just, like, "that's bullshit," you know; it's not - its true for both of us, with a certain degree of hypocrisy, that I just deal with.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. I just think we should surround ourselves with healthier people...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure, fine, Jessica (ph). You did a fantastic job of that. Sorry, it's not - I'm not trying to be adversarial (ph)...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm not saying I want to be around Joshua (ph), or whatever; I don't.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And he would choose drugs over you in a heartbeat; he's such an addict.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sure. Thanks, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, I think this is important. I've never heard you say this in this particular way, Jessica (ph), that - while maybe you have in slightly different ways - that one of the things that made you unhappy and, maybe, continued (ph) to make you unhappy in the relationship, is your feeling like Michael (ph) is prioritizing using over your relationship (inaudible)... [00:28:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I kind of just realized that last week, I guess. It was like - well, I was already upset the day that I went to my therapist. I wasn't that upset but - I know he says it wasn't - it was a mistake, or whatever, but [he liked] (ph) therapy and then - and, then, I waited for 10 minutes afterwards, for him to be there to get me because I saw the car right outside but I didn't have a key to it. And so I just felt like - I know that's just a little thing but just - and, then, the next day is when he told me he had - he had done heroin that day, also. So I was also thinking that was partially why he made me late.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It just made feel not very important to him. (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And, you know, my response is, "Well, join the club, dude."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you felt Jessica (ph) was bringing you down too? [00:29:02]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, how could I feel less important by her reactions?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You mean less important because I cheated on you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But, now, I'm trying to - I mean, I'm just identifying - I'm not trying to - I'm trying to make a distinction between what we're talking about now, identifying these patterns, and actually acting them out right now, okay? So (inaudible) I'm trying to be explorative, not accusing you or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like, on one level, you're talking about different expectations in the relationship that I haven't heard you say, Michael (ph), that it was - that you were really unhappy that Jessica (ph) was using because she wasn't prioritizing your relationship or improving your relationship [with that] (ph). I haven't heard you say, "that made me feel that way." Whereas I've heard Jessica (ph) say that a lot. [00:30:01]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I mean, when we used to try to stop taking Adderal together - this was years and years - we would stop taking it for like a month at a time, or two months maybe on one or two occasions, and every fucking time Jessica (ph) was the one that went and got her prescription and fucked us up.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, and that was always when I was in school.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: School - and she always has that excuse.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that was always before we went to rehab. And I - and we haven't done that since.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know, I...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm not making an excuse; I know I was...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I know we hadn't had the professional help that we needed to really address it in a way that - you know, we couldn't do it by ourselves and that's obvious, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles) I just didn't want to tell you when I got it because I knew it would ruin - it would make you take it too much.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, the whole time we weren't around each other - in that time period when I was going to rehab and when you were in Virginia finishing school, or whatever, I just - I missed you and you were the one thing - I just feel like you - (pause [00:31:15] to 00:31:22) I just feel like you stopped - I don't know. Maybe we just dealt with it differently.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Of us being apart?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, because then you came back and it was like you clearly didn't give a fuck. I know your mom had died and (pause [00:31:35] to 00:31:50) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you aware of the time?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, just because I want to talk about - I want to make sure we have enough time to talk about what's going on this summer and you're (ph) talking about the future tense. And I'm going to be talking to [this guy] (ph) - [00:32:04]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So we only have about a week more (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Our jobs end at the end of April. And you read that letter; our rent is paid until the end of May. My job at the camp starts around - about then.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So we'll be seeing her again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I know, but I'm going to be making arrangements with this guy and - do you have an opinion or are you not - do you not really do opinions towards us because its - I really appreciate how - I don't know. Timothy (ph) finally, at our meeting last week, asserted like, "Here's what I think," you know, "about this." (chuckles) And it took like - whatever - however many - it's been like six or eight - like a whole bunch of sessions with him for him, finally, to be like, "Okay, I'm going to not just listen and ask questions but make an assertion there." And that's interesting that hasn't happened. [00:33:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was his assertion?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That he (ph) should spend some time apart.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Maybe doing this summer thing is a good idea for us. And I don't think I was influenced by it. I was influenced by it but not - it wasn't like -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT (?): You weren't already thinking...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think he was being - I think he had - his idea was [helpful for him] (ph), not trying to - (pause [00:33:31] to 00:33:41) - or maybe he said the camp's not like [a really] (ph) good place for me to be, or something like that. I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, do you - I mean, it sounds like -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, do you have any opinion about this or it's not really something you do (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not that I don't - do or don't. I mean, I feel like I - certainly, when you first - you guys first came in, I thought that you having a little bit of space, even for a couple days at a time, was a good idea and I definitely made that... [00:34:07]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, (inaudible) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...clear. So it's not that I don't - I mean, it sounds like this is something that each of you feels would be good for you. And that's probably the best indicator.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mostly (ph) because I don't know what else we could -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, something's got to change. In (ph) talking to my stepmother, she's like, "Something's got to change."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, that's what it is, I guess, for me too. (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And a part of me is like I can't really even believe this is going on. It's just always been a -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just always been a constant in my head that Jessica (ph) and I were married and that's the way it's going to be.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But even if we were still married, [I think] (ph) something would have to change because we're not doing so well. I mean...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [If we were still married] (ph) (inaudible) whatever -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I really want to underscore, from how - from my experience so far of the two of you, one thing I've heard from - is that, Jessica (ph), you have been far more, sort of, consciously unhappy with the relationship. [00:35:10]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But not telling me anything about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm certainly not saying she's - no, that's why - you (inaudible) but, yes - no, I understand. I'm not saying that she was vocalizing this and working with you on it but that - that's very clear, that this was - there was - this situation was not working for you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And the biological clock thing is huge. I just (pause) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's more like, you know, after rehab, that's when I expected things to be better.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just not (inaudible) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know, dude. And you expect things to get better and then you cheat on me. It doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry, this is not the -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean monetarily.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [I'm just hoping I can get] (ph) a job and you're not -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know, and I moved up here because you said I had a job. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I thought you did.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles) so, anyway, even still, the job wasn't really a - it's a - I mean, I have that job now. It's not really enough, so I need to do something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do think - and, maybe this is something that you have and will continue to work with your therapist about and also we can talk about in here - its something I said earlier that seems really important, given how unhappy you were (ph) in the relationship, why you made the choice you did...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...to cheat rather than leave.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was just easier, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because it was right there in front of me; I didn't have to do anything, really, except for lie, which sucked, but - I don't know -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Another thing - its like you - I realized you make a distinction in your head between what you did last summer and what you did back in 2008 or '07, or whatever it was, but the fact is, you know, this relates to having a few more months for me to reflect on it and see how I feel really. This is not - you know, you had years... [00:37:08]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...to know about this and to lie about it and everything. And I've had what? Less than like two months.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. But I'm not going to wait years for you to figure it out. So that's why we should be separated so we have some concentrated time, I guess. I mean, we can talk.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm not asking you to wait years.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, I'm -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - give me more than a couple of months to adjust to this. It's really unfair the position you put me in.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:37:36] to 00:37:47)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think part of the choice you made was that you were really angry with him and on some level you wanted to get back at him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. I think I just wanted to feel better.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, you wanted to destroy the marriage is what you said the other day.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I said "maybe", since that would be subconsciously but I don't really know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You wanted to ruin everything. [00:38:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't say that for sure so, I don't know. (pause from [00:38:07] to 00:38:15) (sighs) It wasn't like a progressive thing that I did. It just was, you know, instant gratification kind of thing. Maybe I thought it would pass or something - our unhappiness. I don't know. Since I hadn't gotten a job yet, maybe (inaudible) - (pause [00:38:38] to 00:38:47)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just think (inaudible) anger and sadness [is something] (ph) that I've had to - it's been, sort of, visited on me. It's just - I just don't - by the people who are supposed to care about me. It's just (pause) - it just sucks. In ways I don't think you can understand too.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think you ever felt what I'm feeling; you don't get it, you can't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, I can. (inaudible) my mom - (inaudible) of me - I had my parents sign a thing saying they wanted to have me involuntarily committed at (inaudible)</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This isn't about feeling unhappy in life in general. I'm talking about this particular way I felt -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I'm just saying my family - I wanted - they were all out to get me, I felt like.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: They were doing it out of love, you know? It's like -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My sister wouldn't let me see my nephews.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's worried about her kids.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. [00:40:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not buying it, Michael (ph)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just all of the things she's saying weren't based on deceit.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I felt like they were because my other sister's the one that told her -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And here's the thing; is the person that you can talk to -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My other sister's the one that told on me after I - she acted like I was having a...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...confidential conversation with her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I mentioned - and because she saw your...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My drugs. Yes, I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...drug use sitting around.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Fine. But, Jessica (ph) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [So] I could also blame you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Jessica (ph), yes, but here's the thing. Is the one person that would reinforce the - these ways that you were feeling in reaction to your parents wanting to commit you and all that - those things, right? The person that would reinforce them - that ...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, because they didn't even tell me that...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That was Joshua (ph), dude.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...thing was coming in the mail. They just -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, but the person that you could call that would pander to your -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What are you - I didn't - I don't remember Joshua (ph) (inaudible) entering into that whole time. I don't think he was a part of that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whatever, dude.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I wasn't - [00:41:02]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You're acting really, really immature and (pause) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, because she's - she was resisting arrests (ph) and swerving all over the road and her parents were really, really worried about her, you know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right, but then we got home for months -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A month and then that thing randomly came in the mail. They didn't even tell me about it. No, no, it didn't come in the mail. A deputy officer stopped by my house and knocked on the door...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Jessica (ph), -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...and handed me this petition for my right - for me to lose all my rights...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whatever (sighs).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...as a human.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Wait, why?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because when I got arrested that day and then they brought me home. And I was like - the only thing I said was - well, I was still, kind of, out of it -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You were acting crazy, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Michael (ph), you weren't there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know I wasn't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay, so...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I couldn't get you on the phone for (inaudible) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And then - so one thing I said was, "I don't know if I need a drug rehab." I mean, I didn't get arrested for drug use. But, anyway, I was acting crazy enough where they figured either I was crazy or on something. And it was like I had taken too many Tylenol PM's and some Xanax but that had been like a day before. And I just - I just took too much because I had been fighting with my mom. And then - so, yes, all I said to my parents was like, "Well, I don't know if I need drug treatment." That's all I said. I don't - I said, "I don't think I need it." So then they freaked out and one of them went down to the courthouse to have me do it involuntarily... [00:42:33]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Her parents were doing -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...but then I did it voluntarily anyway. And I was already signed up to go to rehab and then that thing came in the mail. And I was mad, very mad. I had to go submit to a drug test, which I passed. I had to go be interviewed by the state and I passed everything so - but, before that, I was going to refuse to go (inaudible) -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When she was in Virginia I was just - I was just worried about you all the time and you were behaving really, really erratically in these different ways. [00:43:09]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not all - not the whole time -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not all the time, I don't know. But, for example, at Christmas...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was right after I found out my sister wouldn't let me see my nephews.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know, but I'm saying I just was - it was unfair for you to ignore my calls and not call me back for like a week.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I wanted to just sleep all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I, actually, think it's a really good idea that - a good thing that you're talking about this (ph) some more. I know that's really frustrating for the two of you and I'd like to talk about it more productively. We are going to need to stop.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What I wanted to talk about was what's going to happen this summer.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We tried to but there's not much to say about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and you're welcome to, if you have time later in the week, if you feel that would be helpful before you have to make a decision, I'm happy to meet with you later in the week, okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There's not [much more] (ph) to talk about. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you guys -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She said it's not important to talk about. [00:44:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - in a - so, here, - next week's the same schedule. I'm going to be out of the office in the morning on the 7th so, if you want, I can e-mail you. I'll have other times; it's just the morning of the 7th that I'm not -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that's Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's Monday, exactly. So - but, next week, we're all set. And do you have - do you have the -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't? Okay -</p>

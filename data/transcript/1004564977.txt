<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah, what uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently, just all the sudden, there has been a stomach flu virus going around my store, but nobody thought of it as a virus 'cuz everyone thought they were hung over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But once I talked to a couple other people I found out, wow, everyone else has been getting like twenty four hours of nausea too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see I assumed it was a side effect of a medication or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, I was trying to track you down to find out what more of it was. And then I found out that at least a couple people I talked to said that they were extremely nauseated, they just thought it was because they had been drinking too much. Which is kind of a weird thing to think about. [00:00:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. It was very embarrassing and very scary so sorry about that. But um, after about a day of fever and sickness, I'm doing better, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Keeping food down, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Yeah, were you just home feeling really awful through that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fever, sweating all that stuff too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. Uh, good news is that I have an interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. At Microsoft Hanover side, which is a little closer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a bit of a pain, but not that much of a pain. So, um that's good. [00:01:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm, was really hard, very very much trying not to think ahead of things. Uh, I didn't tell anybody except for my bosses who came up and actually asked me. Physically, hey why didn't you tell me? I'm like I've been out of business, I didn't have shit to tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then now apparently about a quarter of my store knows. They think I'm already moving to Hanover side. So I'm like uh, please don't make me feel anymore like I don't like to make expectations. Jinxing it per se is what just, I don't like to put expectations ahead of things. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see how that goes. Um, I think that, I think that working full time will be hard, but I think there are certain things that will, I really need from that right now. One of which is the money because the work thing is, right now, I cannot take the time off to have surgery. And if I do, if I do this, then I can be able to take a medical leave. Or get sick time off, or whatever. So that's very good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a pretty urgent surgery that you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a couple of things that I need to get done so. [00:02:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have um, a revision to a surgery I had about four years ago that I've been putting off so. So um, but I'm not really, I have to be very careful about this because I just worked there, I figure if I do this now, then by Christmas time I'll be ok to ask that to say that I have to take the time off.</p>

<p>I don't want to be like, ok now that I'm full time I'm gonna immediately take a whole lot of time off. [00:03:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Plus there's a whole lot of other things that go on so. But, I'm hoping that that will be beneficial so. But um, I am frustrated because of the fact that my workplace is kind of um, immature in that, like obviously all these other people know about this, I don't really know how or why. And on top of it like, you know, it's a lot of behavior that's extremely like the fact that, that well the fact that quite frankly micro-workers you could could think that the summer flu was just like normal from too much to drink. [00:03:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so um, I have no idea what I'm walking into over at Hanover side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In terms of who works there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, what personalities are like or whatever, but I think I'm, I think I want to trade it right now so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. You said it was largely because of this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: One person that was driving me crazy, yeah. I do know she herself has obviously gotten wind that I was displeased because instead of immediately coming up to me and being critical, two days in a row she's come up to me and, and said something somewhat positive? [00:04:25]</p>

<p>And I know that that, that's kind of a, I mean it's very calculated. She's like wow that's some spreadsheet you made. I'm like I just took the numbers and dumped them into a spreadsheet it's not like it's a big deal but thank you. I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's obviously like some sort of. She's trying to find something to say that's positive you know? It's like, if you (inaudible at 00:04:51) and it, it is comma separating it, all you have to do is stick it in. (laugh) It's just not that hard, but sure.</p>

<p>And I know that she knows that, but she's just looking for something to say. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But, um, that was good. Um, I did some offsite training too and I had a lot of good reinforcement for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, primarily in that the person who was facilitating it um, really felt like I was very helpful and I was invited to come back to help facilitate at some point which is you know, good. Because I'm feeling very worthless. So. It's nice to have my experience be appreciated here if it's by one person. So. [00:05:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. What was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it basically has to do with re, it's basically all the people who are trainers will at some point this summer will get this training. It's basically revisiting how we teach based on new models of adult learning styles. So, and, um, how we approach different things, especially when dealing with multiple people at the same time who have different learning styles. Things like that basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. [00:06:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, that's kind of uh, it's important. We sort of change things around about the way we teach in general because of that and so, who knows, but we'll see. But um, apparently I have a lot of very relevant things to say about that. I don't really remember anything specific but you know you sit in two long days; it's a lot of stuff you know. So. [00:06:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so, that's pretty much what's been going on with me. I think it's just been sort of trying to keep going you know? I'm hitting a bit of a rough patch like I said and my health has been really poor. Um, I've just had a lot, a series of things happening all at once you know? It's been some car troubles, or finally getting around to try and sell the car so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mike's been struggling a lot with his medication so it's been really rough for him. [00:07:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's been going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, they've been changing his medication a lot lately. It hasn't been working, and um, he's having a lot of side effects. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's been a, a great um, distress to him so. [00:07:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so between that and like having troubles with you know our car and you know, everything else going on. Like we found out that you know, we're having trouble with our car in the middle of nowhere, or something like that. Like yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's not very good at like, ok what I need to do is get this, this. You know, he's not very good at regrouping and picking things up. His emergency skills are not so great. [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Disturbingly enough knowing that he doesn't make enough of the chemical that you use to handle stress actually makes it a little bit easier for me to not be angry about it, does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That does make sense, why would that be disturbing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I guess the fact that, that just knowing I just find it of weird, everybody else that I've talked to said it was strange that I felt this way too. That is really shouldn't matter that I felt this way. I either get upset about it or I don't. But knowing that he has extremely, extremely low cortisol and probably had it his whole life. [00:08:44]</p>

<p>To me for some reason um, makes it less like he is not trying and more like he's just chemically not able to handle stress very well. (pause) Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it makes sense, but I guess I can imagine that in different ways and like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been finding that disturbing because everybody else I've spoken to has sort of being saying my feelings about this saying well why would, what would that change the way you feel about it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. [00:09:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking it has completely changed everything. I thought this was like a habit of not being able to assess situations and handle things at the moment. And unwillingness to do this, like as a behavior as opposed to I am missing the vital, like the vital steroid in my body that helps me be able to regroup in situations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That to me is a big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it is that many people around me are not as rational about that kind of stuff. And therefore don't understand that my reaction to it shouldn't be like, you know, my personal reactions should not be framed by something that is um... [00:09:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like for various reasons they might react as if they might have a different reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they, it's just weird that these whole over and over again, well that shouldn't have any to do with the way that you react. You know, there's a difference between slipping and dropping something and dropping something on purpose.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I, I guess, to me I find it (pause) I guess for certain things I definitely do sort of talk to certain people that I know that I trust their opinions on and sort of re-gauge my own, like I recalibrate my expectations of the world like on that. Everyone else thought it was very strange that I would feel that way. So. [00:10:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know I could see it going either way. Like on one hand I could imagine as you say that it changing your perspective on the situation. Saying like if you're trying to teach somebody with a learning disability, how to do the thing, to say first they have a learning disability, you might be more patient, or you might expect to take longer or you might you know, be more understanding when they have trouble.</p>

<p>At the same time I could imagine especially when somebody is talking about their spouse, like just being annoyed by what their spouse did for whatever reason they did it. [00:11:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So for you, I could imagine maybe, some of it has to do with, I think you like to look for reasons not to be mad or not to make other people responsible but not responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In this one, I look to look for rational explanations because otherwise it seems like an irrational... now it's true, what you're describing is absolutely true but this is something that that's. [00:11:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not the most relevant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the most relevant at this point. This is just something that like wow. He has all the training of how it's like we've, we've talked about like how fighter pilots do, uduloops in dealing with crisis and all this stuff right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something called uduloops; it has to do with assessing the situation, re: like, to figure out the moment how you're going to handle something. And it's like a loop of basically how to make decisions quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, like an algorithm or something? [00:12:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's yeah. It's algorithm, it's one of the first ones, it came out just right after WWII.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's this phrase that's used in the community for like how to, now it's used a lot more about how to reassess situations as they're changing with chaos?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, him and I have discussed these kinds of things, how to handle things in crisis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like well he's still not getting it, why? But knowing this makes it so much easier. Now I know ok, it's not that he's not doing the right things, he just, his body has you know the fight or flight response and he cannot you know mitigate that the way that other people would and be able to keep going. [00:12:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect that other people knew, I mean if you elaborated on your perspective and why you feel that way, it would make more sense to the other people you were talking to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I, not that I don't deal with a very, I have a, I have many many very intellectual friends but it seems like lately the people that I've been talking with don't have the cross, do not have this persp, they, you know how you always say the perspective... but don't have the crossover I guess maybe in their lives where they can separate out what they know and what they feel as much?</p>

<p>Because I remember discussing that um, you know with our infertility issues that this is like; this is the principle of selection in action. This is showing you like, you know that these genes should not be viable. And people get very horrified. I mean, I have talked, I have samples of more than a dozen people who have looked at me horrified. People with biological degrees saying well you know, saying this like well don't you try the IVF, maybe like think about getting a surrogate? [00:14:05]</p>

<p>I'm like, well this is showing that this isn't genetically not a good idea. There's a reason why these mechanisms, are in, you know happen. And they all look at me like I've lost my mind. Or you know, I say things like you know, that it would be um, immoral to me on my own level to keep trying to have, keep trying to get pregnant and knowing that I will miscarry most of the time. It seems to me wrong to, to</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel as though it's potentially, knowing that there's a huge percentage of this happening, that and knowing how early on um, you know nerves are developed I think that it's potentially cruel, if I love a child enough that I want to have one why would I cause said child pain and death? Over and over and over again until I get what I want potentially, maybe? [00:15:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What (inaudible at 00:15:01) and you are so likely to miscarry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well first of all my immune system tends to kill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, well what about the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, methyltrexate is used in many countries actually as a medical abortion chemical. So, it's actually the medication I take every week. [00:15:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's actually used in some countries and apparently some states in the US to give an abortion. Um when it does not, it tends to close the spinal, the the spinal cavity then starts to close. There's all kinds of problems with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in general thought your body usually miscarries well before that point because it knows that there's problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you know? I have, I have enough genetic defect in me that it is difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would guess that people are reacting in that horrified way that you've repeated for me is among them that it's just a, their sort of pathetically upset for you or on your behalf for not being able to. [00:16:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But to be able to, they, they look at me and they look as if it's kind of cold to think about that way. I said well it's the only way I can. It's the only way that I can rationally be able to look, keep my sanity and think about this like ok, the reason why this is happening is because this is a, this is a safety valve to keep something from worse happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, um, what happens if you think about it from the it just sucks angle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well then 'cuz you have to keep trying. Knowing that pulling, if you look at it from a rational point of view, then you can say ok you know what, let's just cut off this method of trying and go to something else. If it is this just sucks then it is very easy to keep getting tempted in the ok well let's try this again, let's do this cycle of this you know. [00:17:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not necessarily, I mean um,</p>

<p>CLIENT: People like miracles. They like to talk about like you see on TV people who were in their fifties who were able to get pregnant because of miracles and keep trying things. It's very easy to have hope spring anew unless you think about the fact that if you force the issue that things could be a lot worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how much what's hard is (pause) just how upsetting it is not to be able to carry a pregnancy. In other words...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. To me honestly, maybe tomorrow the story will be different. [00:17:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, it's today's version.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like for now, I think I just want children. It doesn't have to be biologically mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't actually have to be gestationally mine. Quite frankly, I, I, the cause of it actually kind of frightens me having to go through that right now because of my health. But also in general, just you know, it's not a big deal. If I somehow ran into somebody who needed, who was in trouble and was more than willing to let me adopt. No questions asked. Definitely. [00:18:19]</p>

<p>Um, knowing from the point of view and this is again one of those things where I feel like on some level I'm a little too rational about it. Knowing that, already that the probability of my children having a lot of health problems, um, and then using logic to think about statistically just randomly picking somebody else's genetics... um, the probability is, is a much better choice to pick somebody else's genetics than my own, just randomly. Than it is that. So that's not even to me, it seems like it's not even a, a, a choice you know. That's fine. [00:18:59]</p>

<p>Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, let's see, well there are two different things there. Are you that, I mean, I think I understand that and it makes sense,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, I guess the question I have is whether that even if it's the clearly better choice...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I can see why it would be. It involves a feeling of loss for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that that's one of the few things I've, I've taken care of more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it's not as much of a loss, I think I'm ok with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's just that...[00:19:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not trying to talk you into that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, trust me you can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just uh, uh, the fact that option b or option whatever, option b is the sensible one doesn't mean you don't have feelings about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you're saying you've kind of been over that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. So, and that's ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what matters much more to you is to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: A family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very much so. It's actually fine because with the stomach flu thing, before I found out what was going on, I was so glad that I did not have to go to work the next day. Not just because of how I'd be nauseated at work, but because of the fact for reasons unknown like everyplace I've ever worked, people at work seem to get really interested in people that they think might be pregnant. And nausea is usually the one. [00:20:45]</p>

<p>They're like, oh do you think you could... and I'm like no. No. You know it's like can you just leave me alone? I'm throwing me up right now. I, the last thing I need to do is play twenty questions about my fertility. So I was so glad it happened when I had the day off. I do not want to deal with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know it's all really well meaning but it's like, that's one of the few things that really really drives me up the wall. Because it usually only occurs when I'm not feeling well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that is so bothersome?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean usually when I'm not feeling well I don't want to answer questions period.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh ok. [00:21:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then people ask questions about like you know, could you be pregnant? I'm like no. And then they're like are you sure? 'cuz I can run down to CVS. No. Are you sure you are not? And that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, kind of like they want you to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They always want you to be. And occasionally I get the um, now, it's such a pity that you're, that, that, between you and your husband, that your intellect is not going to be passed down.</p>

<p>Like really? Really? Is that really a big deal? You know? [00:21:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The world has enough smart people, we just need good people. We just need good people out there you know? And who's to say that it's 100 percent genetic anyways. You know?</p>

<p>I, I just hate being drilled about my fertility at the office. So. But especially because of the fact that the people who I would think would ask questions, never do. You know like, um, there's been very limited information; everything has been things I have said to family. Like immediate family? Yep, no, never any questions. [00:22:30]</p>

<p>It's maybe obscure cousins sometimes? That are sixteen and kind of learned like appropriate questions occasionally?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But aside from that, that's about it. You know? It's always like nosy lady in the bathroom. (laugh) Or someone like that. Or little old lady that I'm teaching you know, computers and like, do you have kids? I'm like we are at the moment how to write a letter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't see the reference to this if you're like, looking at like I don't know, children's toys maybe, but not... [00:23:06]</p>

<p>But, I just really want to, you know, people settle down and start a family, it's true.</p>

<p>But I'm ok with whatever. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. Yup what matters to that...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like actually um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like there is something wrong with me because so many people feel as if I should be upset about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's like this is something I knew really really early on. I knew my parents only had one of me. They kept saying because they only needed one, but I had a feeling there was something going on anyways? And, I haven't gotten a whole lot out of my mom, but like I've got a really strong feeling that based upon stories that I've heard that it was not advisable either so. [00:23:52]</p>

<p>She's had not as strong health problems but there is definitely that. There is a lot of other things related that aren't really as relevant from the seventies to now. But I've got a feeling that this is not a, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you if you're not upset about not being able to have biological children.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was starting to wonder if like there was something wrong with me for that. Because why am I not like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds to me like a lot of it is not wanting, I mean, certainly not wanting to go through the uh, pain for yourself and for the fetus' of having a bunch of miscarriages. [00:24:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also, um, not you know in the sort of longer version of the story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not wanting to have to worry about, or watch a child suffer with the sorts of things you have. Or Mike has, with your health.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And knowing that his family has the strong depression, amongst other things going on you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah so,</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like this is a preventable tragedy. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People who were trying to just, don't, know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't live my life, it seems a lot more simple to them. You know what I mean? It seems like it's a more manageable thing. [00:25:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just feel like it's on some level that maybe I think there's something wrong with me that I'm not so attached to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you suggest like, uh, you didn't start thinking about this last week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So I've been married for, that's the other thing is, why are people so heavy 'cuz it's like I could understand a sixteen year old teenager cheerleader being like interested in people's like I've been married like mid thirties woman why is it like so scandalous to start asking questions. [00:25:54]</p>

<p>But yeah I mean, it's something for many many years we've known it's gonna be a problem. Now whether or not what I believe is the right thing is not necessarily the right thing for somebody else. I just feel like it would be terribly vain to do it this way. Because I feel like I want to do it you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I love children and I do not believe that anybody else who kept trying, that's their own decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not like their, like 'cuz it's very very hard to explain to other people that way too. It's like you know what, that's, that's their own personal... [00:26:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. (sigh). It's a, it's a hard thing though you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:26:49) kids and married, what do all women ask you about? I'm sure you get a lot of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I expected moving to Hanover that there would be like less, now mind you that's Salem out there, but even still out here, there would be less inquisitiveness, because the concept of, not that we are that but the concept of being a couple without children is not considered to be all that bizarre? But I guess not always you know? I just... [00:27:10]</p>

<p>I had different expectations about moving out here than was really true. I really honestly thought that because Hanover is supposedly so accepting of people's choices that they would be accepting of my choices too. And it seems to be that, my choice is like the one choice in the entire town that is not acceptable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What other choices do you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I have been, like you know, you saw the like the thing about the cardboard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You told me about that yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the picture of the cardboard. Yeah. Like anything, I mean everything I do seems to be wrong. Like I have been called a breeder at a grocery store, um, you know I cannot like even wear fake fur out without being yelled at. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>Like every choice that I make seems to be the wrong choice around here and it makes me very bitter. Because it's supposed to be a place that's supposed to embrace diversity and apparently whatever I am is just verboten. And it kind of makes me feel shitty at any given time.</p>

<p>'Cuz it's like, what is wrong with me that I cannot like, I, being in a place that's supposed to be like the place where you can be yourself, I can't be myself you know? You know, I, I, like, even possibly stating that I feel like it is wrong to try to keep conceiving when I know I'm gonna abort. And I've miscarried because the fact that you know, neurologically that's still killing children? Saying that by the way gets people very upset; very very upset. [00:28:46]</p>

<p>You know what? I am not a religious zealot. I haven't been to church since, well not since, it's been, more since I've been married but I can't remember. Decades maybe? Last time someone got married? I'm not a religious zealot, I do not like have any background and that, it's just who I am. And I feel like you know anything that I would love enough to want to raise and like that, I wouldn't do something potentially to.</p>

<p>And people get very upset about that one too. It's like you know what? It's not, it, I'm not making choices for you, this is my choice, you know? Other people have different feelings on it and I just get very, it seems like whatever I say is the wrong thing to say and it makes me sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. [00:29:33]</p>

<p>And it just, (pause) it is, like I said it's very frustrating being like that, being in a place where I don't feel like I fit in. A place that's supposed to be where everybody fits in you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so. I don't know. I'm just kind of stuck at being stereotyped too. You know I'm not mindlessly doing things, I think through almost every, as a matter of fact, I probably over analyze my decisions at all given times you know? [00:30:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd be willing to believe that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I made this decision based upon like doing enough research to find out when like actual nerve development happens you know? I make a lot of decisions on that kind of stuff. You know? I'm not just making like, decided that this is what someone tells me and this is wrong.</p>

<p>I've never let anyone tell me what to do in my life, including my own parents, which unfortunately they kind of encouraged. So. [00:30:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, as long as I could make up a justification for something, like within reason they were pretty good with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think it was even more than that. My impression is that they were really always have been quite supportive of the decisions that you've made, more so than just allowing you your own autonomy that they get really excited about what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well it's kind of, I had such a strange, such a strange like childhood though. Like I was not, like I had a lot of structure to things. Um even on top of that like, I wasn't allowed to go out on nights that there was school. That just wasn't allowed you know? Just period. [00:31:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not unusual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. Like all of the people I knew who were, but yet at the same time there's the dichotomy of well um, I was by myself with a couple of friends in a country that was currently undergoing a civil war when I was sixteen though too you know?</p>

<p>They didn't even know what was gonna happen. I was in The Balkans back in the 1990's, when they had the first...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you doing there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was on vacation?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, we did get, it's right across the Adriatic from Italy, we did get re-evacuated back to Italy. [00:32:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The point is though, my parents let me go off to a, and they always were like this, they were perfectly ok with me going to like Europe by myself but they didn't like the idea of me going to a bad part of town by myself, or like at night.</p>

<p>And so it seemed very chaotic, but they knew that I knew stranger, like I knew, I had a better handle on what was dangerous there than I did like at home I think? Because I grew up in lots of places like that. And I knew that like, when you don't necessarily know the language and things like that, how to pick up on other cues of how to handle things. [00:32:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you want to go to the bad part of town where you grew up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. There were places, but that part of town, what I'm saying like that was the equivalent of the Square when you're like thirteen is like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not like the bad part of town, but the part of town where you could get yourself in trouble being thirteen. That kind of thing; but I didn't really want to. But there was definitely the allure because in Cincinnati that's where all of the museums are too? [00:33:09]</p>

<p>And so what you could do is justify I need to go to the library there. Or, 'cuz it's the first public library ever is the [inaudible] library out there too. I need to go to the library, you know, or I need to go to the museum's there and then like wow, like I can also go to all these different places that you're not allowed to go to.</p>

<p>Um but, not really that much, but definitely to, it did not make sense to most of my friends, but even more so to my friends parents who were more than vocal about that. Um, about how you know, my mother had no sense. [00:33:43]</p>

<p>Sending me off into a place... they did not know, nobody knew that that revolution was going to happen. Nobody, like especially not the Serbian like military. So it's not like, you know, it was not like I spent time wandering around, I was evacuated by their hired (inaudible at 00:34:00) within twenty four hours.</p>

<p>But it makes for a very impressive story of being able to tell of being by myself in a country that is undergoing a civil war. Um, but The Balkans is a lot like Han, it's a resort town. That's all it is. And so um, but you know, they had very, very strict things for a lot of things. And they said you know what when, at some point in your life you can make these decisions but this is one of the things that are not negotiable. But most things were negotiable. You know, most things were. [00:34:31]</p>

<p>Just that, I think they knew me well enough to know that I may not be able to pick up on things as well. I mean it really; the timing was a little bit obnoxious. But for the most part you know, it wasn't that bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe this is a misunderstanding but my understanding that my impression is that what you're missing now is the kind of support that you had with them. Not so much that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At the time it seemed a little bit unfair because like other people had like parents that would just, with the justification of oh I need to go to the library, my parents were like what do you need in a library there that you can't get here? Why can't you get the book sent over? [00:35:13]</p>

<p>It was absolutely true; there was nothing that I couldn't get that couldn't get sent over. It's true. But and, yes I didn't intend to go and want to do things, but I had friends that probably would be like like ok well let's go off and like...</p>

<p>At the time it was very very absolutely fascinating to go to head shops I guess. I don't really think I've ever been in one. But I remember like oh well for lunch let's go there and then let's do something else and somehow we'd never make it back to the library sure. Um, they did, they were hard on certain things, but as long as I had a real justification for something, sure you know? [00:35:45]</p>

<p>Um, I was just talking with my parents about this just recently because at my store and many other Microsoft Store's they have these field trips to go to the Microsoft Store. And I said to my parents, I'm like I can totally see you guys going no freaking way. You go to the Microsoft Store on the weekend and you learn math during the week.</p>

<p>Like, and my parents, they agreed they're like I can totally see this. Like, why would you need to take the day off school to go to the Microsoft Store at the mall? And um, I see myself you know, you know having thought about children so much lately thinking that I'm eventually becoming just like that in terms of like you want to take a day off to go something? We're not going to do something that you can get at a mall. We're going to do something completely different. You know? And do something you can only do during the week. [00:36:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:36:38) 'cuz you're, you taking a day off math was gonna mean you weren't gonna learn the math, you know what I mean like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, like, they'd be like, ok, I remember, I remember I think it was like twelve we took a field trip to the grocery store. My parents would not let me go, they would not sign the...It was like a big thing, my parents were like you go to the grocery store every week with us, you do not need a field trip to the grocery store.</p>

<p>'Cuz we were supposed to learn like about how to like read the labels to figure out if you're making... and I understand there are people that need to learn this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if they're not taken there they're not going to learn that sometimes the box that's bigger actually isn't cheaper. [00:37:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They need to be taught that. But my parents were like no way, like you stay home. But they had no problems at all with all kinds of things like you know the things you can't do, especially during the week but also just things that were unique experiences you know?</p>

<p>But, I don't know. It just sort of a, it's sort of a weird thing right now because I facilitate these field trips at the Microsoft Store and I do have to wonder like how much like, I mean, it, it, it's not my point to make that judgment, but it is kind of a weird thing. [00:37:47]</p>

<p>What am I going to do if I work for Microsoft and I say to them, my kid doesn't have, my kid doesn't get to go to the Microsoft Store because they can go there any time. I mean do I give in just to make it so my child doesn't have to deal with like the embarrassment of it all? Or is it like a good character building experience? I don't know.</p>

<p>I remember there were certain things I was slightly mortified about but I don't, to this day I can't think of any of them off the top of my head. You know? (pause) So, but, they, (sigh) it's sort of a weird thing like I said, I really feel like, I mean maybe I'm over compensating I don't know, but I feel like I had a pretty good childhood you know? [00:38:32]</p>

<p>I mean yes there was a very strange, but knowing now who I am, I think they had a pretty good gauge over understanding me. You know? They knew exactly, exactly what was the right things for me you know? And um, you know, maybe it wasn't necessarily a bad thing to make decisions based upon that you know?</p>

<p>Like, my parents were very very strict about so many things but they also knew certain things that were very different, they let me do a lot of things that most kids wasn't allowed to do. Like, I had no bed time growing up, ever. Like, that sounds like a completely ridiculous idea, but you know, as long as I was up by a certain amount of time, and I kept myself busy and I wasn't expecting to be entertained like by a television, who cared? You know? [00:39:23]</p>

<p>They're like you need time management. Like at four years old I made those decisions and you know I made them pretty well. But you know maybe somebody else; some other kid may not be like that you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that went hand in hand with a lot of Montessori School based things though. I had a lot of free will over certain things in my life as long as I was able to; I could do what I wanted to as long as I was able to handle certain responsibilities with it. Which sounds weird to say to a four year old, but you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>But at the same time I feel like I'm very critical of my husband who was given tons of freedom and it sounds like it was pretty you know, like, to me it sounds like it was a pretty horrifying childhood. You know? [00:39:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah but it sounds like that was for other reasons. It wasn't because he was given the freedom it was horrible, it sounds like..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eh, it sounds like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't mean he was neglected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well freedom and neglect is what is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were given a lot freedom but you weren't neglected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But isn't that in the mind's eye, as to what is neglect?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean it, uh, if you had been a different kind of kid with that amount of freedom that could have been neglectful. If you were another kind of kid who really needed for someone to tell her when to go to bed. There are certainly kids like that who... [00:40:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like ninety percent of them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that. Yes exactly. You know, that would have been neglect. If your parents were dead set on not giving you a bedtime no matter who you were, I could see how that would be neglectful. But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if it was at all fitted to who you were and what worked for you, that's different. But, maybe you're right I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I don't actually we're probably not saying different things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no I think I know what you're talking about. As a person who's thinking about having children and knowing that you know, I wish I could understand more about how they made those decisions more? Maybe it's just because I don't have a kid yet. Like how to make those decisions as to what will work and what will not because I don't have any. [00:41:23]</p>

<p>But like how to, like I am so easily falling into the oh well this is what I did therefore you know as soon as we can I want to put my children into Montessori School, maybe that's not going to be the right thing for them. But I don't necessarily know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then maybe it's self doubt because I over think it, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I, I would I mean, sort of derived and then with your sense of your kid. In other words like, um you learn fairly readily what sorts of kids need more structure, more hand holding, more guidance, and what kinds of kids do better without it. [00:41:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words um, you know, kids who uh, like need that kind of external structure to feel less anxious or to be able to actually regulate their behavior. I mean as they say ninety percent of five year olds not given bed times are going to stay up until eleven o'clock eating cheetos and watching cartoons. [00:42:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, like you can, you can see that and you can see what happens the next morning and whatever (laugh).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably wouldn't miss that you know? Um, yeah. [00:42:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That just, like I said that's just one of those things that I am, I am a little worried that I'm going to follow the patterns of what was right to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not necessarily be able to make the right choices.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if that's true, then you'll get help. You know? Like, uh, the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't expect our children to be brilliant in any way and that's ok. I very truly mean it when I say it's not like overcompensating that there's enough smart people, not enough good people. [00:42:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As long as I feel like my kids have a good compass inside of them by the time they grow up I would be thrilled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see your point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? 'Cuz you know, they just, being smart is overrated. (laughter) That sounds stupid. Now mind you also I feel like, I feel like the at least my, the story of me growing up has to be over, has to be altered at some point. Because the stories of supposedly what I was able to do I think has to be completely wrong. I think they're rewriting them in their head as to what age I could do things. [00:43:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, they're revising history.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have to be. Children do not like, do not have like word recognition at eighteen months. That can't be possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean as in like letters and stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like as in like, this word means this. My dad called it iconerate, read. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, eighteen months is very young, the youngest I've heard of for that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is more like yeah between two or three.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He called it iconerate in that I didn't actually know what the letters meant. [00:44:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just recognized, like on a stop sign.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, this is the word, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's possible, there's definitely,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you know, but I think he's revising these things supposedly. He said that instead of saying words I had subjects and predicates. Like instead of like, now they weren't big ones they were like you know, like two words subject predicate but still... [00:44:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At what age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, very young. Um, that kind of thing, but I just, I have a tendency to disbelieve that, because it's like these things are too strange to believe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. We have to stop for now, but we'll talk more on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

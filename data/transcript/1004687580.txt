<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. It's a little stuffy in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd be happy to turn it down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before you sit down. It may have been me hustling to get here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning. I forgot all my medicine this morning so I had to go back and take my medicine. I forgot everything for my Wednesday closing so I had to go back up to the office just for checks and that shit. You know I sit there and I'm like, "Get everything you need," and I still forget shit. I do it just thinking too quickly. I sent the wrong check amount to my mortgage guy. I keep doing all these little fuck ups. It's starting to add up and take a toll on me because I get frustrated, stressed out and start eating unhealthful. I have an entire frig full of vegetables and I go and get sandwiches from the 24-hour convenient store. [00:01:42] I'm working on my bike right now so it will be done today and I can ride to practice instead of driving for the extra exercise. I watched Ian all day yesterday which is okay, but I just can't take two fucking days off. I'm just too busy. Jess's business is easy for her to break the day up but people e-mail me and fucking call me all day long. I'm not that busy but then I have to watch him again today from noon to three or whatever. First it was supposed to be noon to 4:45 but he's got some class and she wanted to move it up but I can't because I have to go to the fucking office. The mortgage guy is like, "Don't worry about it. Don't make a special trip," because I originally told him that I overnighted the check because I wasn't going to be in the office. Even before I realized I screwed up the check I realized I had to go to the office. He was like, "Don't come in special for this. Just wait until Wednesday." I was like, "No, I'm going to be there anyway." I feel stressed out. [00:03:59] Bored. Stressed. Lonely. I don't know why I let this stuff get to me. I requested time with the kids for the weekend and didn't wait until the weekend to do it. I was there Sunday morning. Ian and I had gone to the coffee shop. We came and were outside and Lucille was playing in her little sandbox. I was just sitting on the rocking chair on the porch flipping through stuff on my phone. I had literally been there two or three minutes. I just wanted to take a break, whatever. Drink my coffee and Jess comes up to me and is like, "Don't you want to spend time with Lucille?" [00:05:13] I was like, you know. Every opportunity she has to take some fucking dig at me or just talk down to me or criticize me. She's criticizing me. It's passive aggressive is what it is. She takes that opportunity and it fucking gets to me every time. I just want to tell her to shut the fuck up, you know? Shut the fuck up. I'm sitting here doing what I want to do. Leave me alone. If I want to go over and play with Lucille I'll go over and play with Lucille. It drives me crazy. Every time I see her it's something like that, without fail. I can't go an hour or two hours in her presence without her fucking just totally . . . and it fucking sets me off. It just really does. I get fucking livid. (pause) Are you going to say "no" now? I just threw something that you don't know. [00:07:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (long pause) [00:08:53] I don't know what gets me from day to day, what keeps me going. I don't know why I'm fucking up so much lately. It's like I can't. I send stuff out and I don't make copies of it and then I don't have a copy of it. I need copies of it, you know? I make the same fucking mistakes over and over again. Like when I fucked up sending another check out. It's like that stuff is basic shit. I shouldn't be doing that. And the way I do it, I've got a spreadsheet that it all works on the spreadsheet and then I put it from the spreadsheet to the bank account and I check that the balance is the same and the ledger as it was when I started. It should have no effect, unless I'm keeping some of the money for an escrow, and then the balance should rise by that amount. It rose and I was $300 off. It autofills with the previous transaction and I let it autofill with the last transaction, which was $3,000 less than what it was supposed to be. [00:10:35] I don't know how I let that fucking slip by me. I'm trying to do it well on Friday or Thursday or whatever so I didn't have to worry about it yesterday because I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it. I didn't want to have to worry about it over the weekend. It's Friday I did it. When I don't do things how I'm used to doing them, I fuck them up. It's like I can't . . . it's like if I had waited until yesterday I most likely wouldn't have made that mistake. I was trying to do it on Friday. I don't know why. It just gets fucked up. (pause) Now that I have to go home and take my meds, it fucking eats up all the time I had in office. [00:13:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the sense that a fair amount of this trouble you're talking about is from feeling so enraged and maybe also being a bit worried or frightened about how enraged you feel. I mean most of the things you mentioned, I think, are things that have frustrated or pissed you off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not a product of being pissed off, though, but they get me pissed off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's right. I think some of the kind of slips of mind may be a result of being pissed off. It's just hard to think straight and keep details straight when you're really, really frustrated angry. I don't mean you, I mean for anybody, but I think mostly it's the other way around. These things caused you to be very, very angry. [00:15:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm going to get pissed off when I walk into the fucking coffee shop and there's this huge fucking line and they just have one cashier. Whenever I'm in there no one is ever buying beans, except when the line is really huge; and you know when they have a person to run a register, that person is going to go sell beans. (long pause) I don't know. It's fucking crazy. [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:20) Shit I've got to do. It's just fucked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like really agitated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of it. Some of it's just, "Oh, I've got to do this" or "Oh, I've fucked this up or it's "I should have done this this weekend." I think I'm sweating. (pause) [00:20:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your frustration with some of what's going on and the pressure you feel under to do the things you need to do, with both of those it's hard to even think straight, it sounds like. It sounds like it's hard to stay with a thought for very long, that your mind gets kind of racy. I guess for managing you're kind of litanizing a bit in your head, "There's this. There's this. There's that. There's that. There's this. There's this. There's that," to the extent that it's hard to even slow down and put into words what's going through your head. (pause) [00:22:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (long pause) I don't know. I'm not sure what I want to talk about. [00:24:25] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what's going through your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just all kinds of stuff. Stuff I have to do. Stuff I'm wondering if I should tell you about. Just random stuff. It's like I asked Ian how the speech therapist was and then I realized that he wasn't stuttering anymore or stammering, whatever you want to call it. He can only have gone once or twice, so I don't know. I told him it's because he was so smart that his brain was working faster than his mouth, which may be the exact opposite. (chuckles) He's starting to speak before he's thought about what it is he wants to say. I don't know what we're going to do today. [00:26:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a nice thing to say to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try and tell him self-esteem building things. I used to tell him he was my favorite kindergartener. Yesterday I told him he was my favorite first-grader. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're being a loving father. (long pause) [00:28:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are you wondering what you should tell me about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) How much I drank this weekend. By myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I haven't decided if I'm going to tell you or not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other things you're deciding whether or not to tell me about or is that the only one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, there may be others. [00:29:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they involve either alcohol or your safety or both?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know if they involve my safety. They might. Like weeks ago I was a little tipsy and I bought a pack of cigarettes. I literally, I'm not even smoking one a day, I don't know why I bought them. When I'm home alone drinking whisky I'll smoke one on the porch, unless I smoke a cigar. Funny I don't feel bad or guilty about smoking a cigar, but for some reason a cigarette, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you smoking weed as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not recently. Maybe here or there. But not like . . . if I'm at a party or someone else has it . . . I'm not buying it or smoking it with any regularity. That's mostly because I can't afford it. (chuckles) It kind of helps me make the decision, you know. I don't know. I just feel like there should be something more. I should be feeling something more in life than I am, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, you should be. That's exactly right. You've been depressed. You've had a lot of shit happen in life that's bad. You should be feeling happier with more good things. A lot of the last few years have really sucked. While I know in some areas it's gotten really better than it was, it's still not that great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (long pause) [00:34:40] Bad news on my bike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got bad news?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's up? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't fix my bike. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the story?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's some bracket that needs to be replaced but it's seized and I can't fix it. I can't buy a new fucking bike because I can't just leave it out all year 'round. That's why this bike is so fucked up. This is just my life, you know? Everything is fucking broken. The car is broken, the bike is broken, all my relationships are broken, finances are broken, job is broken. (long pause) [00:37:55] I'm always like, "What else can go wrong?" It's like there's always something fucking else that goes wrong. Maybe I'm overlooking it but there ain't a lot that's going right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Business pick up a bit? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Temporarily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been exercising more? You have more social . . . You're right. There's a lot that's gone wrong and a lot that's going wrong. What's a bike on Craig's List—a couple of hundred bucks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. The problem is I have to fucking get a bike that I can carry upstairs because I can't spend money on a bike and then leave it outside. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your bike is important. You feel a lot better when you're riding places or can get out and ride it on the weekends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saves me money on gas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know anything is a lot of money right now, but relatively speaking for $300 . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I was going to spend to fix it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what you're looking at but I'm sure you can get something [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:42) for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't buy a bike on Craig's List because I don't know what I'm looking at. I'm sure they have them at the shop. I don't even really have time to fucking talk to new clients, you know, because I'm just fucking running around the whole time. I'm calling them in the car without being able to write anything down. I just can't do it. (pause) [00:42:48] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.

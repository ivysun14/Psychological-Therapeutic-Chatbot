<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello. Trouble a lot, I was having a kind of crappy week that really ... particularly about work. Which is kind of (inaudible 00:00:43) So I ended up taking the day off on Wednesday, maybe Tuesday. (pause) Wednesday because I was just kind of (pause) I just was really ... I don't know I was really done with the week. And I found that going to work I was just like it's not going to go well. So one of friends, Elaina, is having a book coming in like a month. I've had bad acceptance and various things and you know she's local and she's friend and I'm like you know that's cool. You know and I want to see it like already. And a friend of mine had read a review copy that she got in advance and called me because (pause) (sigh) Elaina used some material ... well the ideas from an essay I had written but hadn't acknowledged it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it's hard to like ... I think it's just carelessness. But it's also really frustrating because of the essay, I wrote it like three or four years ago I think. It was published on the group blog that she used to maintain and group publishing the same book. The (inaudible 00:02:20) said she wrote her book in the same .... And she certainly read it. So like I know she knows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This piece and I was talking about fatness and the racial uplift and sort of (pause) the politics of like presentation, trying to like set a good image.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is racial uplift?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Racial uplift, this is part of why I know she lifted my idea. (laugh) Racial uplift is sort of ... it's from like W. E. B. Dubois is in like early NAACP stuff where the idea is that like ... W.E.B. Dubois said if the talented tenth, like the upper tenth then are going to ... they will succeed and then if they succeed they will uplift everyone else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so part of that is also like very like Sydney Poiter, like you're always well dressed, you're always polite, you're always (cross talk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I was talking in this essay how about (pause) how this applies to being fat and black because I feel like ... a lot like that is presented about it is being sloppy or loud or ... and like ... so I feel this feel like internal pressure to not do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:03:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so ... and like in the review they describe what shoplift was. It was (inaudible 00:03:53) know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a few other things. And so ... in one of these books she's like talking about that except and she's like, oh you know ... and of course (inaudible 00:04:08) women in different ways for instance black women will have this issue of racial uplift and wanting to be well represented, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like I'm pretty sure Elaina didn't think of that until like I said it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my friend called me and she's like, I'm pretty sure that that's you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that, you know if you asked her she'd probably be like, Oh yeah. But there's no like ... I'm not present like ... there's nothing like acknowledgements or end notes or the anything that says like, yes, this says that, blah, blah, blah, blah. So ... it's really frustrating and upsetting and just it's one of those things where I'm like, (sigh) it's so like if I talk to her about it I'm sure she'll just be like, oh you know it was an accident, blah, blah, blah. You know it's a popular book, not an academic book, so I didn't footnote everything. Like blah, blah, blah. (pause) And I thought that my idea wasn't particularly original except for like I know that this idea came from me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she doesn't really have other black friends, among other things. So ... And since I haven't gotten ... I hadn't read the book so I feel weird being like, lovely. I've been informed that you ripped me off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:05:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know what to call it. It's not really plagiarism. She didn't lift my direct words except how she lifted the idea. And (inaudible 00:06:04) it's kind of like, I talked to my friend about that for a while and we were talking about how her must be frustrated. And she said she should know better and does know better except how she just didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she also like ... she'd also written this article ... she writes for a women's online magazine, like a fashion magazine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know one of the reasons why she had the book deal and the magazine writing gig was through her blogging and fast foods blogging and those things. Which is like a really great opportunity for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't actually want to be a professional writer or write for (inaudible 00:06:53), like the magazine, the book. So (pause) she doesn't live here, she lives in Waltham. And she'd written this piece how ... the title was, 'I Think Living in the city has made me more racist' and I think wow. That isn't that hard to tell. And so prior to publishing this she'd been kind of passing it like, oh I'm writing this article on really a kind of sensitive topic, blah. You know like she was supposed to write it ... well like I'm really working getting this right and kind of ... and I was like, oh. And so like I'd seen her tweeting about it. And so I'm like I wonder what she's writing about? And then I see this article and I was like wow. That's what you're writing about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it went up on her blog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It went up on a ... the magazine site.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>(00:07:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so with the article I think was ... what she was actually trying to talk about and completely failing at was that the city is really racially segregated, which is totally true. And she talked about how (pause) so she doesn't take public transit, she only drives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For whatever reason. So she's like yeah, I'm like all I ever see is black people every day and the city is like really racially segregated and has like an ongoing racial history. I'm like those are all like totally true statements. And then she started talking about how (pause) (inaudible 00:08:29) grew up in North Carolina which is much more racially diverse and she just doesn't see people of color at all in her life. And how ... just kind of going on about like (pause) how white the city was and how that was bad. And (pause) what I pointed out to her to make (inaudible 00:08:50) is like, have you tried use public transportation because you (inaudible) see a lot of diverse people on the bus, on the subway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's really great that you can drive to where you live kind of in ... not in burbs but a little bit in a condo complex. And you drive to the grocery store. When you worked in the city you drove like, you know ... you're helping to insulate yourself and that's you. It's true that the city is racially segregated in a lot of ways. Like all those things are true but the other big issue there was like you're choosing do to this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was relate her own choice of driving a car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like ... not just driving everywhere but also she bought a condo Waltham. Kind of like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the most racially diverse place that you could buy a condo. But like, you know whatever, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she makes all choices in her life that insulate her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like she's including in the title making claims about the affect the city has had on her when a fair amount of what she's describing has also to do with her own choices which not necessarily like bad or criticism deserving choices but they certainly bear on (inaudible 00:10:35).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's acting like that's not at all an issue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like she's like, well ... she sort of put that in I think as a this is just how everyone in the city lives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people don't have car, you know? Or least live like really in the city. And also working for yourself, kind of (inaudible 00:11:00) that. And like all these other things.</p>

<p>(00:11:02)</p>

<p>And it was just really ... overly prompted (ph) headline. It just really frustrated me like the think the thing that you're not really paying attention to is you're a white lady who keeps making a choice that surrounds you with other white people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is not something everyone else can do. Like so, a lot of people can't afford to have car or do (cross talk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No. I get that. I guess the thing that's confusing me is like (pause) I would have thought it's the way that she's blaming the city (pause) and not taking account of her own choices which are a big part of the issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the (pause) problem I guess, I don't get ... I just don't understand how like (pause) I guess what you're describing is like some of her opportunities to make the kind of choices you have come from privilege.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like money, specifically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like (pause) you know or not just even ... I mean ... yeah like the ability to being able to afford to have a condo is a huge thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And where she chose to get it and sort of where are you choosing to shop and where you like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not everyone has that option. Like (pause) if you live in the city or work in the city it's really hard to ignore ... it's really hard to be like I'm above all whiteness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>(00:12:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the city is that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like ... or if thinking you grocery shop over there. It's like ... it's just bread, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a pretty diverse part of town.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like both ... in lots of ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or lots of dimensions I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's like you know ... I often think ... it always strikes me when people get upset over the idea of like people not speaking English. I'm like, that's every day, like when I'm on the bus people just aren't speaking English all the time. Like, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't bother me, I just ... they're just doing their own thing like grocery shopping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah just sort of like (pause) pulling her (pause) she's got to blame the city for something that she has also done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also ignoring the ways in which like ... it's actually ... it's easier for her to surround herself completely with whiteness than it would be for me to completely surround myself with black people. Like even if I had to live in Mattapan, for example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like where I had a job. It's actually kind difficult to surround yourself only with your own ethnic group unless you like really ... like I just ... say I was an Asian and I was just living in China Town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I work in China Town. I shop in China Town and rarely got on the subway or bus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But otherwise you just would deal with people of other races, that's just what happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:14:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she was like not seeing that. Another thing is ... I was also curious. I was like, so you're saying that you grew up in North Carolina is really racially diverse from your point of view? Like I wonder what other students living there, like people of other ethnicities, like what did they think of the same place? It's like the whole was from her point of view but she was kind of erasing that. I mean, like these things just happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also like a teenager she couldn't drive herself everywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had to go to public ... she went to school like you know where (inaudible 00:15:08)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. She's sort of proclaiming ... (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she's proclaiming without really (pause) bother to look at it a little bit more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think about it like (pause) it makes you irresponsible.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) It makes it ... it's more than irresponsible but she's someone who feels like she has very, you know progressive, liberal credentials.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she prides herself on being someone who, you know is thoughtful about issues of race and ethnicity and all these other things. She definitely like you feel that she ... like that's a part of her identity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) that's what made it more frustrating. Because I'm like you know better. I know you know better. And you just didn't bother to think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(00:16:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (pause) it wasn't like, you know this is something that like was busted out of someone who's never heard of the idea of white privilege or ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything or like who just moved to the city and is like, wow it's really weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right she just like totally blaming it on count of like her own choices, her own privilege in a way that like (pause) seems almost intentionally naïve given what you know about her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just like ... actually how I judge naïve, incredibly fucking lazy. Like (pause) I don't even know. It's just really ridiculous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And angering?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was. You know like I live here too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) Little Italy.. And (pause) her (inaudible 00:17:33) was frustrating and made me upset was that ... so the magazine that she's writing for is basically, you know stuff like (inaudible 00:17:45) except for (inaudible 00:17:47) person. And people like myself, other people have been like, you know maybe you should to do a review an article by someone who's Asian or black or something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why don't any of your models feature diversity and ... and so I can't think she's an employee there but (pause) so she can't really like ... there's a certain amount of pressure to not be like, yeah, my workplace sucks. But (pause) like when I've talk like privately about it she's been like, yeah well you know if you want to write something then you can. Like I'd be happy to, you know pitch it for you. Like I don't want to write something. I want to read something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:18:36)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why I go read fashion sites.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's ... it's just really (pause) I don't know. I guess I feel disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of why I'm upset and angry that like it's just real disappointing to have someone do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then to have her like take my ideas is super, super frustrating. And you're like (groan).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because especially with like recent track record. I'm like, (groan).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then I decide to ... I was willing to see like ... basically to see if anyone else had written ... I was like I don't think anyone else has really written this. I remember one other article on something similar, Michele Obama's obesity campaign. So I was like Googling around and I was Googling myself and the article name and that sort of thing and then I ran across this (inaudible 00:19:45) blogger ripping me to shreds. Like and ... like constantly repeating my full name.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait about (inaudible 00:19:54) blogger ripping you to shreds?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he's (inaudible 00:20:00) who (pause) essentially kind of crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I mean that fairly literally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's this guy who ... he flies off the handle really fast and he feels like he ... he actually has said that he's a white knight come to rescue, save the ladies who do (inaudible 00:20:25) blogging. Or maybe were more like more interested things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he did that. He wrote this really creepy blog was how one of the people was going on about her body and said her thighs were like hams. And everyone was like, hey, hey, hey. Stop. And then he got really angry that people told him to stop. Because they were respectful of his ... I don't know. And he also is really angry at fashion bloggers who don't allow diet talk because he kind of hates his own body and like he tends to fixate on people (inaudible 00:21:18). Gets really upset with them. Get really angry at them and then writes obscenity filled rants and then delete them. Like that's what he's been doing for about three years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. Yeah. That's how he is then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so he ... I decided to work with (pause) there's a childhood obesity campaign which ... they sort of come off on (inaudible 00:21:43) of little kids and he was like, oh I want to work on this campaign to (pause) kind of fight these ads. The ads are basically being like ... these ads are like for fat kids and they're mocking them for being fat in a way. (pause) These kids are fat and they're so depressed about their fatness and don't you think they are pathetic for being fat. It's just weird like it's trying to get kids to lose weight through ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By shamming them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A great idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's a problem and also it's in Texas and it's really focused at (pause) lower income people who are mostly people of color in Texas. They're not exclusively. It's like this whole thing and this guy is like, yes we're going to have this image campaign saying that we stand with Texas' kids. And I don't know. And I looked, the first like fifty pictures he created were all white people. I was like, huh. So if ... I just, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Had he thought about that? Had he thought about like anything to do with this kind of thing? And he said no I'm really busy. I do this as a volunteer. Why don't you do that for me. Well first he said well of course we care about the diversity. I'm like well what have you done? And he's like, I'm busy do it for me. And I declined. I was like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't want too. And so I've been talking about this with this group of fat people of color and we were talking about how this was like frustrating. This little pattern of behavior. There are a lot of white fattest (inaudible 00:23:46) activities just thinks that fat is less acceptable prejudice a lot which is not true. And it's really racist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. I'm sorry. (cross talk)</p>

<p>(00:24:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So one thing that a lot of times you'll hear facts have been (inaudible _00:24:04) is that fat is the last acceptable prejudice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that no one would ever ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (cross talk) quite racist and ridiculous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and usually no one would ever say something like this to a black person and I'm like what do you mean? (laugh) It happened last week. So we wrote this letter, being like, you know this problem. Here are some suggestions about things we think would help with it and myself and ten other people cosigned it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Put it up online. And this guy ... he's not mentioned my name at all. We're actually talking about a larger part of when this started, he's been part of it. And mentioned past interaction I had with him. And he just lost his shit. And was like, Karen Vanderhorn is just so horrible and fixated. And Karen Vanderhorn is (inaudible 00:24:58) me. He's just going on and on about how he's so like giving and awesome. I'm horrible, horrible, horrible mean person. And then there's all these comments going on about it's true that I am in fact a horrible, horrible, mean person. And he's really obsessively repeating my full name for some reason. And part of why that was disturbing me, it's like I signed the letter with my full name, like whatever. He specifically says like I have been proud of this other (inaudible  00:25:33) blogger and not give a name. So he chooses not to name a white guy blogger in (inaudible 00:25:41). But does obsessively talk about me.</p>

<p>(00:25:47)</p>

<p>So reading that and seeing like you know forty comments all about me ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was horrible. It just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I don't know it just kind of like the ... it all just came together and I just felt ... I was just so upset and so mad and I didn't know what to do. And there's nothing really ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'm like I don't actually have to do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just like ... I didn't sleep very well. I was like sort of thinking about it and worrying. (pause) And taking the day off I just felt like really alternating between feeling like jittery and fat and mad. And then I really want to zone out from this for a while because I'm tired of feeling fat. (pause) I talked to a friend of mine and she like that's crap. I'm going to write a big blog about that crap. Blah. She writes a popular blog. And she did that and I was like thank you, that's really great. And then this guy just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Started obsessing even more about ... it was supportive, but also kind of ... like if believe the things that this guys is really obsessed ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Sort of a danger of doing something like that (pause) it's sort of (pause) yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stir things up. I mean as you say he's already stirred it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he has a habit several times where he'll work on some kind activist campaign and then shoot himself in the foot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then get really angry that people made him shoot himself in the foot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because like it's not his fault. You just ... mostly women keep on making him do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:28:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) it was great at clearing the air in a certain way because it was nice like to just openly be like this is horrible and happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think you're saying that he is completely horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He really is and it's kind of like ... part of it's ... like he's a really horrible person. Like I'm really clear on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's really obsessed maybe that there are people in Fat Acceptance deliberately excluding him and that he will get them for it. Like God only knows how. (pause) And yet he has all these supporters. Well less now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) like on his blog yes. And then like one (inaudible 00:29:05) to be like, well she went to Cambridge and works for Cambridge so obviously she's a horrible person. And I'm like that actually takes a little, like not a ton of effort but it's not like one of the first things that shows up if you were to Google my (cross talk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I went (noise) it doesn't show up on my Facebook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. (inaudible  00:29:29).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm not scarred about who I'm actually being stalked by but I mostly just like why is this horrible person being horrible? Why does anyone ever work with him and why won't he shut up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He also like ... and also that he just has (pause) I don't know. Like no shame, no (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scruples?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And part of his attack is that he wants me to apologize for slandering him. And make a formal apology. And apologize for being mean to him. (pause) Which is not something I'm going to do. It's like an insulator, I mean. It's like ... he's done that to everything I've said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which wasn't mean. And (sigh) (pause) (sigh) it's really ... it's just really exhausting. And (sigh) I decided not to ... okay I'd like to be in forward of this Fat organization and then withdrew because I was like I've just been too stressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I've been depressed and too stressed. I cannot do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt bad about it but I was like, you know? Like I decided like it was the best ... it was a good idea even if I still want to do it. And (sigh) like I chose not to get involved and think cosigning these letters were going to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. They never tell you for one thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that I can ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible  00:31:35) for another, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and actually the person that we talked about most is someone else who didn't get upset. She took the criticism probably fairly well. She freaked out privately but was overall like ... mostly she was like (inaudible  00:31:54) said I'm a bad person. Like or she's like I feel really guilty. I'm really sorry. I'm like, well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that freak out was just kind of like she felt guilty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was about it. And then she made a bunch of public statements being like, good point. Also this guy's a jerk and I sever ties with him and (pause) So like (inaudible  00:32:22) I kind of expected was from her or her followers. And she acted pretty reasonably like that is basically what I wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A and to have this like attack dog from the side (pause) it's just like really not ... it's not what I was expecting. And it just feels like (sigh) it feels so awful to have like in ... like I said in my private life like ... I am proud of like my personal life. Like I'm already really stressed at work, all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've been trying to pull back from things like, you know moderately successfully from things that (pause) involve like community service or spending a lot of time like volunteering for others.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't been totally successful about that but like I've been working on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like trying to take it easy in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And feel like let other people do things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think not put yourself out there and not ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm not the only person that has to explain. And (sigh) I don't know. I don't feel that way now but like for a while I just felt like ... I don't know, that like I couldn't escape people personally attacking me and I can't escape like (pause) sort of being pulled ... like getting pulled into ... getting pulled more than I want to into like a discussion or a debate or like ... I don't know I feel weird calling it activism because I'm like I just like go sign a letter. It wasn't ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like it was important it on a level I would class it something low.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (sigh) like now I just like, I feel worried about kind of anything I'm doing that's vaguely involved with involved with anything related at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Like are you saying you worry about people at work seeing this stuff and what you make of it and counting against you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't really care how people at work seeing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the thing that worries me so that like ... it makes me like ... I think I'd like to think that doing this (inaudible 00:35:07) like I'm working the door for a friend of mine who's is doing a benefit reading.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm also helping someone else with a Plus size (inaudible (00:35:23) blog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like they're pretty bounded. I'm like all right. You know one and then a weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I feel like I don't want to do those either. I just feel like, okay what is the next I think small thing that I'm going to do that's going to end up like taking over in ways I didn't want it to or being really negative or just being this like (pause) I guess I feel like ... I feel worried about doing anything. I feel like it's just going to end up being this negative emotionally draining crap as opposed to like giving up three hours on anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:36:07)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other thing, which is a part of what this guy has been going on about, is how mean I was to him and how I misrepresented him. And all his friends are like, she was so horrible to you. And I kind of ... like part of me is like, that wasn't ... that was actually their play. I could show you horrible. But I really don't want to because I know that that would death spiral.</p>

<p>(Laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I might suppose that you have mixed feelings about wanting to. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A part of me is like, oh I will ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you like to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I actually didn't get that far into that part. Just last night I was complaining to a friend. I'm like, oh. And she said you know like you weren't even mean. I was like, good point. Oh and part of me, I want to say really horrible things. Like I would say really horrible things about him being fat and unattractive. But that's actually really shamming. But he is really unattractive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, Mm. Like he's bitching about me being an armchair activist but all those videos he ever shows of himself are him sitting in like a Lazy Boy recliner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like Mm-hm, armchair activist. I don't know. I mean it's like I think he has a really small penis, which again is not like ... it's not really nice. You shouldn't insult penis size. But like that's all I'm thinking.</p>

<p>(laugh)</p>

<p>Like it's ... you know I'm like ... or just sort of like you're really, clearly unsatisfied in your marriage or you're really ... like do you have a job? Like what are you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like I volunteered unpaid time for three whole months. I was like, do you think I'm getting paid? I'm not getting paid. P.S. I've done this more than three whole months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:37:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like he also was ripping into a friend of mine who published a book about unacceptance. The friend of mine who he was blogging on, she publishes books.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like you haven't done anything at all. And she was like, oh really. That book that was not good?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or just like you know start tearing apart his writing because his writing isn't very good and you know, mock his videos because I'm naw you're kind of fucking dude. He's like Colonel Sanders goatee. And I'm like I could go on forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know that like a personal attack would be ... like it really would be a death spiral.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then he'd be, oh I can come in.</p>

<p>(00:39:12)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you think about it how far do you let yourself go in thinking about it? I mean, in other words (pause) I can see like practically why wouldn't want to do it. But what I'm curious about like how much you start to feel bad or like there's no point in thinking about it that way, like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me is to give out more actually (pause) like I imagine him like this sort of reaction of me like, oh, oh shit. Like when someone does really devastating insults. And the person that's being insulted just like has this sort of this look of horror or like, oh I thought I was good at being insulting. Like I thought I hit you with something you'd just like really got into a knife fight and I (inaudible _00:40:05).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And where the other person like is just really completely shut down and like anything they try to do makes them look even stupider and you're just like (sigh) like that's what I think about is that kind of like (pause) when you've really hit someone they just kind of stand there and they're like, ugh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like yes, yes you've nothing to say, goodbye. And ... because that's what I actually want is the like (pause) it's like not only did I insult you, you realize you suck and everyone around you has noticed that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like in my head I kind of like got to take things ... like I have to go slink off somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also with things like that, like any further complaining just makes them look worse. You're like, oh, m-mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now you look even more petty than you were before. And that's really where I go more than like thinking of insults.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) Sounds like it helps.</p>

<p>(00:41:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. (pause) I mean the part that's like ... I'm actually not like that good at like coming up and being insulting. I drop the hat. Like I've way too much politeness ingrained. (pause) But I do admire people who can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's almost like, oh I just ... (pause) I guess one of the things that I think that I'm like, you know what he wrote about me was actually insulting and mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what I hate is I'm like, you've no perception that what you said was insulting and mean. Like you and your friends are like, no that's just truth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's just a horrible person. (pause) And it's also like ... another thing that always comes up is like if, you know, if you just said it more nicely then I would have listened to your complaints about racism but you just didn't say it nicely enough. Like your tone was very aggressive and hostile. And one of things that ... I think it's something like you know like I know there's sort of no point to ... there's no way you can do it. And (pause) there's this blogger's video, whose like, I was looking forward to saying that actions racist as opposed to you, like you, sir aren't racist. Like that thing you did. And probably what's frustrating is the letter was all about this is things that were done. But what he insists I said was that I said he was racist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which actually nobody (inaudible 00:43:16) as that. (pause) And what pressures me is when people are going to be like, oh well you know ... let me phrase this. What usually will happen, I got to discuss this with people, friends of mine who are white. They'll be like, well but you know you catch more flies with honey and you know did you think about how that might make him feel and well ... and like all these things I'm just like (pause) like you make sure to discuss that his actions were racist not him and blah, blah. And I'm like you know I do know about rhetorical techniques and I do know all those things and it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>(00:44:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they also think like because myself and the people all put a lot of effort into sort of ... (pause) make relatively neutral (inaudible _00:44:15) you know like it's a relatively formal letter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like, open letter. And I'm just like we could have just like written obscenities for two pages and that would have apparently ... like I feel like that would have said the exact same thing. (pause) Which is just (sigh) like I don't ... I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well ... (pause) Seems like (pause) sort of being dramatic or careful or catching flies with honey (pause) are all well and good if like you're point ultimately is to try to be responded to in a certain way. But I mean what you'd really like to do now anyway ... again like do it. But like you're thinking about hitting back and this satisfaction of like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's not just hitting back, it's that moment of like why did I bother?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Why should I bother taking the trouble to be careful ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like be decent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it didn't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's like I ... we were going to write like a respectful letter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, we're respectful we should get respect back but it blew up. And like frankly we don't want to just be like you all sucky about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, like (pause) because it's not just this one guy like screaming obscenities and be angry. It's that there are frankly a lot of other people who are like lees overt about it and they're not saying like that I'm horrible person. But they are talking about how this was so aggressive and hostile, on, on, on. I'm like ... especially when did you even read what was written? Like it seems like you stopped ... I don't know like two sentences in and read some entirely different thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what is frustrating is I know that I'll weird him out like if I write something ... like there's only so much I can control. But he can't control someone to respond.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's infuriating when people are completely overlooking the effort that you've made and it also puts them in a very bad light.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the other thing they said they're making you responsible for their own like ... like well I would've been nice if you had phrased it differently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't have to be racist if you'd only been more polite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like I didn't like ... I'm not making you do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. They're just (inaudible 00:47:39) on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's this very weird like ... I would care about racism except that this letter makes me not want to because it hurt my feelings. I'm like well ... I mean that was a really important value.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also how is this my fault?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see. (pause) We're going to stop for now. (pause)</p>

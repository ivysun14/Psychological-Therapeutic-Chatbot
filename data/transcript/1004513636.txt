<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's been mysteriously shutting off occasionally, that's not good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) I tried to kill myself yesterday. (pause) I had a terrible meeting with my advisor in which she was legitimately frustrated with my lack of progress and she said that she had been waiting on this particular batch of simulations from me for six weeks and that it should have been only about a week's worth of work, which is correct. And I just (sigh) (pause) I was so tired of fucking up and you know every step of my career I've said, you know, "Okay maybe this last thing I worked on, you know, senior thesis or this project for this research lab in Germany or this project for my boss at Celluon or these classes I was taking while I was also working fulltime."</p>

<p>(00:01:07)</p>

<p>Like I've screwed up big projects and gotten behind and doing a half-assed job but you know it will be different next time because I'm getting better and I'm getting healthier and I'm taking my antidepressants and nothing has gotten better. I'm still fucking up in the same way and making the same mistakes I was making ten years ago. And I just (sigh) (pause). And so I got home and I pulled out all of mine and Dave's medications. I had some Oxycodone leftover from the miscarriage two years ago and I had some trazodone leftover my previous prescriber thought that that would help me with my sleeping problems before we switched me to Ambien and Dave had some Wellbutrin and I just ... I counted what I had and looked up the LD-50 dosage for all of them and then started looking up drug interactions trying to see what would have the worst (pause) interaction and (pause) and then I got scared and called Dave and asked him to come home.</p>

<p>(00:02:24)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And surrendered all of the drugs to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was really close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it was. (pause) You must be so scared.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Scared and angry with myself (pause) for putting myself in this situation. If I'd just, you know stopped fucking around and done the work then I wouldn't feel so miserable now and this wouldn't be an issue and (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>(00:03:20)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are ... I don't know yet what they are but there are very good reasons you've had such a hard time working and (pause) why you consistently can't get done what you need to get done. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't feel like good reasons to me. (pause) (sigh)</p>

<p>(00:04:19)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I guess not. I don't think we really know what they are to tell you the truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, part of me feels like (pause) none of the work that I'm being asked to do is outside my capabilities. It's not like I don't know how to do it and sure there are technical challenges but they're all things that I have the intellectual capacity to overcome. So if I'm not getting it done (pause) I feel like any explanation would just be excuse making for malingering. (pause) And it's not like I'm being asked to haul like one-hundred-fifty pound boxes, which is actually something I cannot do. It's like this is all stuff that I can do. (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>(00:05:37)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know it's stuff that's like within your capabilities to do. (pause) I think you sort of characteristically dismiss it as malingering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that you tend to dismiss a lot about your emotional life especially when it's getting in the way of your doing the things you (pause) you should be doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:06:45)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever got that close before? How recently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sometimes when I was an undergrad, so nine years ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. What happened then?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was one of the volunteers for the co-op I was living at and the co-op was a good three miles away from main campus and so we had a big fifteen passenger van that ... it was a house chore you know. Some people's house chores were cooking dinner and some people's was bathroom cleaning and mine was driving people to and from campus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:08:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I just took the van one night on a personal errand and was driving around looking for something big and heavy to drive into that wouldn't hurt other people. Something like a concrete wall or something instead of ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know didn't want ... yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what triggered it then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't remember. I just (pause) everything about undergrad is just this fuzzy blur in my mind. I can't ... I just remember being miserable the entire time and feeling stupid and worthless and don't know what was the (pause) the most urgent trigger for that. (pause) But then I realized that if I crashed the house's van it would cost the house like a good 30 grand to replace it and that wasn't fair to my housemates so I brought it home.</p>

<p>(00:09:18)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have the impression at all that you want to be in the hospital. Do you want to be in the hospital?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have you felt since?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ashamed, mostly.</p>

<p>(00:10:19)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I just (pause) all things considered my life isn't that bad, right? I mean (pause) my husband earns more than enough money that I don't have to worry about financial security and I could probably get a job even with a crappy thesis or even dropping it back down to a project or even not graduating. I could still probably find a job that will pay my bills and it's not like I'm being (pause) abused or homeless or any of the significant problems that some of my friends have. I just (pause) I don't know. (pause) Wanting to kill myself seems like a really childish, immature reaction.</p>

<p>(00:11:38)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This kind of (pause) intense like self-hatred and self-criticism (pause) is an exceedingly painful significant, potentially deadly thing. (pause) When people kill themselves it's not unusual (pause) it's for reasons like this rather than because of other kinds of stresses you're talking about. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can hear my dad's voice in my head saying, "You know, what the hell do you have to be depressed about? You have everything." (sigh) Like there's no reason for me to be this depressed, there's not. I (pause)</p>

<p>(00:13:18)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that means that this is just about weakness of character or is that the other alternative? (pause) Are we talking about weakness such as like laziness, obstinacy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Laziness mostly.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the laziness particularly focused on work projects and particularly on projects you already think are kind of worthless?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:14:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just work and not just projects that I think that are worthless. I've got some personal projects that I just haven't touched in ages and ages. Some of which collaborating with other people on and I just completely dropped the ball and (pause) and I can describe examples of context you'd give would be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like my main point is (pause) people that are lazy are generally having a better time. You know, like you're sitting miserable, unable to get out of bed or miserable in your office playing mind sweep or trying to get yourself to work. Like if this were just laziness you'd be off seeing a movie. You'd be reading some book and enjoying it. You'd be like ... you'd be having a better time. You might feel bad about yourself, feel like you're lazy (pause) this would be more fun if you were just lazy.</p>

<p>(00:15:58) (pause) Does it seem otherwise to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:16:59)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here's an alternative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying that I know that this is true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're enormously sick and tired of doing stupid projects for people who in no way really seem to give a shit about you or who in any number of ways thrown you under the bus. (pause) Putting your time, energy, effort, and talent into doing things that are going to benefit them. (pause) And maybe you're curious about (pause) always being expected to do that for those sort of people. And there's some part of you, which is mostly unconscious which is just incredibly dug in around this, you know? The same way that a kid who like sits there and refuses to like get up and get out of the house to go somewhere they don't want to go can be. And (pause) maybe it's a lot more like that.</p>

<p>(00:19:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. (pause) I don't know. (pause) It's just that (pause) whatever my advisors failings and you know I could enumerate them for quite some time before I ran out?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not doing the thesis is only going to hurt me. Right? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:20:11)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if I would say only going to hurt you but it is certainly going to hurt you a lot more than it's going to hurt anybody else. I would certainly agree with that.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'm probably more angry at myself for wasting my time, talent, and energy than at anybody else because (sigh) I took the first offer that the assistant advisor I could get my hands on. I didn't even try to shop around for a project that didn't suck. That's on me. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:21:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I'm pretty clear that you're like far angrier at yourself than at anybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it absolutely seems that way to me as well. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm getting the impression that you're getting very frustrated with this conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Or maybe I'm projecting, I don't know. I can only imagine that it must be frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No. (pause) I'm sort of feeling over the last couple of minutes like (pause) I'm (pause) probably haven't been (pause) I don't know how else to say this. I'm probably not speaking to the part of you that's (pause) most absorbed with what's happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm trying to think about how I might do that. (pause) Yeah, I mean I have a little bit feeling like I'm kind of missing the boat.</p>

<p>(00:23:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not your fault. (pause) I mean maybe that's really the most important thing here is like how terribly angry and disappointed you were with yourself ... I mean you're not today but like yesterday as you were (pause) deciding to end your life and (pause) I think you're also feeling sad and frightened by how far you were wanting to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those things seem closer to kind of what's going on and where you're at. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:25:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are thinking about those things in particular?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think right now in the last few minutes (pause) (sigh) I've been, I don't know beating myself up for not being stronger and also thinking that (pause) (sigh) somehow this is really unfair to you and the professional consequences for you of a patient of yours offs herself under your care and what that (pause) and when you decided to take me on as a patient you didn't know things were this dire and this part of me that says, "You know, Jesus Christ interfering. Could have given the guy fair warning or something."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:26:09)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling about like (pause) you feeling like you've been very unfair to me? (pause) And you're wishing you were stronger, in what way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) I wish I could just get my fucking work done. (Emotional) I mean everyday millions of people manage to go to work and do jobs that they don't like and do them, you know at least minimally competently. Like what the hell is wrong with me that I can't?</p>

<p>(00:27:21)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what you are feeling is mostly laziness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you wish you had more discipline?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not laziness. Laziness isn't the right word but just (pause) (sigh) more like a childishness of you know I don't want to and you can't make me and (sigh) (pause) I mean I'm not eight anymore. It's long past time for me to learn that you have to do things you don't want to do if you want to get paid and be able to, you know pay your rent as a grownup. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see you feel like those are lessons you at some important level haven't learned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you're sort of (pause) you know if you know better at some level that you're kind of reacting like a obstinate, oppositional your own kid who doesn't want to do her own work or something. (pause) And so you're like well that kid and kind of fed up, exasperated parent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's about right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is really sick and tired of dealing with that kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess also the parent part probably feels helpless?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean that would be not being able to get (pause) yourself into gear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:29:54)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) can you identify at all what the other part? (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean with the stubborn (inaudible_00:30:17)? I think that's the problem that I identify with it too much. I mean if I didn't I would just (pause) buckle down and get my stuff done and then feel better and (sigh) (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are things like from that perspective? Like to me you talk mostly from the point of view of the parent part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like (pause) "What's the matter with me? Why can't I do this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm lazy. I'm stubborn. I should know better. These are more the kinds of things the parent would say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:31:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's this other part that like doesn't want to do the work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't want any part of it. Wants to play games. Wants to shut down the efforts of other people around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such is the parent part and this is your advisor. But you don't (pause) and we both know that's there I think. But you don't often speak from that point of view.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I don't normally hear you say things like, "I don't want to talk to you about that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) I want to make my advisor totally helpless to get anything out of me. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess (pause) I guess that part of me would say that (pause) I've done all this work for the last, you know thirty years and (pause) even when I'm on the top of my game and doing my best work it's still not genius level work. It's not award winning work. And so what's the fucking point because (pause) (sigh). Now my parents and my high school and middle school and elementary school teachers expected me to be great and even at my best I'm good but not great. And so, (pause) if there's no reward what's the point, right? (pause) Like why do this boring, drudging work that's just (sigh) irritating and frustrating and boring on a project that's ultimately pointless? (pause) Right? Like (pause) I don't know. I felt it's childish because, you know do the work so you can get paid, so you can pay you're rent and like I don't know pay for pony riding lessons or something fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laugh) I think I understand.</p>

<p>(00:33:58)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm frustrated that I might think so childish. Because I mean (sigh) (pause). I think all (inaudible_00:34:18) freshman ... you know the big fish in a small pond in your high school and you come to Harvard and everyone is as hard as you are. And most people have a rough time with that their freshman year and struggle a lot emotionally and psychologically. And then most people get over it and realize that, you know being average at Harvard is really not the worst thing in the world or even being below average at Harvard is not the worst thing in the world. And just get over it and go on to have a productive lives. But I feel like I'm still stuck in that, you know (pause) well if I can't be the best I'm not even going to try mentality and that's just so childish and irrational and it's (pause) (sigh) antithetical to what my church teaches about the value of human beings and (sigh) (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So here's a corny (pause) very psychologist thing to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I actually happen, maybe just because I'm a psychologist and maybe it's true. The ones who get over it ... I mean first of all (pause) at least in my experience of talking to such freshman like (pause) whatever. My point really is the ones who have any easier time with it are the ones who were like also loved for being something else than their intellect through their lives. I don't know that you were.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I definitely wasn't.</p>

<p>(00:36:11)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's kind of like the (inaudible_ 00:36:43).</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wondering if disappointing my parents was a lot to live with it or not having been valued? I'm not sure what the antecedent of that was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure, sorry. (pause) Yeah not having been like loved or cared about (pause) or something other than ... I think what you're telling me I like a promise of being great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I don't think it was for being smart.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not. I mean if it was my dad wouldn't have shit all over my research ambitions would he? (pause) I hear what you're saying but there's a part of me that's bringing it back around to, "Well you're not a child anymore and you are loved now." I mean I have Dave and Mark and Trish who all love me very much and you know part of me is saying just get over it my parent's sucked. Get over it. I know they sucked.</p>

<p>(00:38:37)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's upsetting you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) (slight crying) I don't even know what's upsetting me now. (sigh)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the things you said were like get over it and you know that your parents sucked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seems like (pause) those are both things that you are upset about but it sounds like at the moment it's more the former ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How sort of stuck you feel or aren't able to get over how your parents were in this way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. (pause) Yeah, I just (pause) (sigh) the horrible thing is they thought they were doing what was best for me, right? Like (pause) I'm sure they're one hundred percent sincere in their belief that they loved me and did what was best for me. It's just that they, they suck at it and (sigh) (pause) Like if they had just been (sigh) (pause) if they had just been like movie villian type cruel and evil it would be easier to deal with I think.</p>

<p>(00:41:03)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe not, I don't know but. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see how this complicates things that they weren't. I guess you can tell (pause) in a totally counterproductive way they thought they had your best interests at heart. Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the thing that you've made very clear to me and that perhaps I'm (pause) not making a clear sense of it is (pause) how exasperated you with yourself for not being able to get past this and then do differently and be reasonable. You know like, "Fine." All you got to do is ... I mean you could probably be working four hours a day on your thesis stuff and then go ride ponies the rest of the afternoon and things would be fine. Or if not fine ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Far better than they are now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Far better. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would be delighted if I could consistently put in four solid hours of work a day between now and thesis deadline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that would (sigh) that would solve most of my academic problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I don't know why I can't because like four hours a day. Four hours. (pause) I spend more time than that writing angry comments on Facebook about how Rush Limbaugh is an idiot.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. I don't know your political aims.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not that different from that. (Laughter)</p>

<p>(00:43:11)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have any of my Rush Limbaugh paraphernalia in my office. I guess that's probably good. (Laughing) Yeah. (pause) Like how can you not even be getting yourself to do that much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's frustrating and upsetting and I'm just so angry at myself and tired of being angry at myself. I just want no one to be angry at me. (pause) But then like I say that and it circles immediately back around to, "Well no one would be angry at you if you didn't give them a reason to you fuck-up." (pause) I don't know how to interrupt that so I can just focus and get things done.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So (pause) on one side you're terribly angry and frustrated with how little work you're doing and on the other side you recognize or there's a probably I guess this is a third part really; recognizes that that's actually an often counterproductive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like you kind of like want to say, "Okay. Hold off on that just so we can work and think and then like (pause) you know?" I'm sort of picturing that as like the family therapist, you know comes into the book? Okay. Stop being angry; say something nice to the kid. He'll do a little bit of his homework and then everybody wins.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:45:20)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that doesn't work either. (pause) Like you're so enraged about it that you can't even think of what it would be like to not be angry at yourself. You immediately turn around and hit yourself over the head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it just like keeps going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Breaking it down like that seems like the classical psychoanalytical definition of super ego and ego going on, right? Like that whole (inaudible_ 00:46:06) stereotype here.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) I think there are some things that putting it like that leaves out. I mean I think I got the jest of what your thing is. I know about the (inaudible_ 00:46:48) you're afraid too. But (pause) maybe doesn't quite explain why the parent part is so harsh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can't let up at all. And why ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think the answer to that is that the parent place in my head models itself after my actual parents who were really harsh and never let up and never excepted anything less than the best. (pause) (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you just sort of took that in also.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I remember in sixth and there was a geography bee which is run almost exactly like a spelling bee but with geography and I won in my classroom and then I won my school and then I won my city and then I won my county.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And was going to state and my parents grounded me from the time I won county until the state tournament thing. I wasn't allowed to play outside. I wasn't allowed to knit. I wasn't allowed free library books. I was only allowed to study for the bee. I just (sigh) and of course I tried to find a way around it. I you know played 'Where in the World is Carmen Santiago' obsessively. Like staying up long past my bedtime, days on end because I managed to convince my parents that it was educational. And so I would just sit there staring at the computer screen because I wasn't allowed to do anything else. It was just ... who the hell punishes an eleven-year-old for winning? Like just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's incredibly fucked up. And it's also every bit as shortsighted as the way you're describing you are with yourself. I think I see what you mean when you talk about really taking that in and in that even if all they cared about was your winning the state, which is fucked up, like they would have done far better to let you play for some amount of time each day so that you would have the ... you would be happier and you have the kind of emotional resources to be able to devote to your studying.</p>

<p>(00:49:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what you kind of have trouble doing too with yourself now.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still remember the question that got me eliminated from the state tournament.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What continent is the largest continent on earth and spans three hemispheres? And portions of it are covered with ice year around. The answer was Antarctica. But I choked and panicked and Africa also covers three hemispheres and at the top of the mountain, like at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro has ice year around and you know there are penguins who live in South Africa so I answered Africa. And everyone in the room just stared at me like I was a fucking moron. And you know I remember my mom just put her head in her hands and covered her face as if she was ashamed of me and just slinked back off the stage into the audience in shame. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:50:40)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must have been awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. I also remember the question, which got me knocked out of the state math competition. And I also remember the question that cost me a perfect 1600 on the</p>

<p>SAT. It was after I got my score back. I paid for the question answer service that gave me the questions, my answers, and the current answers to every problem on the entire fucking test. And to this day, like the SAT ... God that was fifteen years ago. The geography bee was twenty years ago and I can still tell you exactly ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the question that I got wrong was. (pause) Also, one chemistry and one (inaudible_ 00:51:23) exam I can tell you what I did wrong for that one also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At least that one wasn't a simple rote memorization question answer exam. It was a lab setup where (pause) the question was to determine the sugar concentration in flat Seven-up. And I tried (pause) again I panicked. I choked. And there was a lab bench with, you know twenty different pieces of equipment setup and I saw the titration stage and I was like, "I know, I'll titrate it." Which you know is stupid because sugar is a hydrocarbon, it's neither acidic nor a base. So, titration won't actually give you any reasonable information. The correct methodology was, you know measure the fucking density of the drink and then (pause) I don't know mess up five or six sugar water solutions and measure the density and interpolate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(00:52:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But no I needed to titrate it because no ... (pause) that was fourteen years ago and I'm still mad at myself because that was a freaking mistake. (pause) (sigh) At least for that one my parents weren't watching me fuck up.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must have been constantly crushed by these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still are but, certainly were. (pause) We're going to have to stop in a couple of minutes. But I'm going to check on a few things. For our meeting tomorrow ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you'll be all right till tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:53:47)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any like interaction with your advisor? Sounds like that's ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meeting with her on Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what time. She hasn't set it yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right. (pause) Anything else before we stop for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Keep well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Leave?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

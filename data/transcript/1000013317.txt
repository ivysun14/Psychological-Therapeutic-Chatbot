<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[beginning at 0:01:21.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean, this room is, the key stuck (ph) in the other room. And then, well, somebody taught me, well, I did, actually I tried to open a window.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's too hot down here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me try or no, I can turn off the heater.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't know about how to go. I'm sorry we're, it's everything nice. Can you go on with laser (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Can you? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, well, the last time I left here feeling like I wanted to bawl in the elevator, that whole feeling of liking and loving and trying to figure it out. And it just, I guess I just, well, I was close to my father but we never caused or admitted that there was closeness. And I wonder if all this is necessary? (chuckling) I mean, these days the way to bring up children is to give them...let them express themselves completely, talk to them, in guiding them and showing them unlimited love and complete acceptance, and that wasn't like that in different societies. Like I'm sure it wasn't that way in Russia in 1930. I guess it depends on what are the things you have to deal with in reality...like getting bread or revolting against the Czar, (both chuckling) you know you're busy so you don't have time to coddle your kids. So I guess my father never learned how to do that but I think my brother did. He has two kids and I can see, he loves them, and they're married now but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of a father was he? Your brother, when he, when the kids were smaller?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, his wife and I were not on speaking terms so I don't know. (chuckling) We had a falling out, a bad, stupid thing, and so I didn't see his kids grow up, but then we got back together again and I could see that...his kids loved him and there's a lot of feeling. It's, I guess the only thing that my dad could do was...he'd, I'd see him come home from work, coming down the street, and I'd be playing outside with the other street urchins and...I'd run over to him to get a nickle, so and he would give me a nickle, so I thought that was a...like a token of his love. Because a nickle, I mean like this, he was making like $27.00 a week. So... [0:04:40.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was a good amount of money.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I don't know, do all, I mean. Do all societies get screwed up if the kids are not loved? (chuckling) Or is it like the ideal society will evolve when every child is given...unlimited love and they grow up to be perfectly happy and adjusted people and to love themselves and to love everybody else, that there will be no more wars? And it's good but meanwhile, back at the ranch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, back at the ranch, I mean what I was wondering is, is this more like, are you wondering, is there something wrong with you and did you get enough love or didn't you? Or do you really like to sort of complain about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Well, I guess I didn't get enough. I know I didn't get what I see kids getting today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you get as much as other kids who were kids and...People your age did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, because times were different...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I think you're right...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so there was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the times were different but I wonder if...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but it still isn't right...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what you got, you know that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't how, how my friends were dealt with at home, my little friends, you know. I think there was a lot of, the tendency was more to disciplinarian kind of treatments, because we had one friend, one of many siblings, whose father was a Department of Sanitation worker, and now he took his job seriously enough to make sure us kids would keep the street clean. (both chuckling) When it was his time off and everyone is sitting on the stoop outdoors...he was the guy that made sure that we didn't litter. So I guess he treated his kids that way, but still, their kids flourished anyway, because I know some of those kids who are now grown up and they have families, and they adore their grandchildren and...Somehow they learned that, "Hey, having babies and lavishing love on them is what you do." So I imagine that's what they did. (chuckling) But I got the wrong signals somewhere, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like they got something that you didn't get? [0:07:19.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I felt that a lot growing up, that I was just not figuring out things the way they have figured out things. And they just seemed to go along in developing along lines that... made for a happy home life. They didn't get up, have complications in thought and...didn't question things, and they just grew up, got married and had a family. And this is what you do to be happy in this world, you grow up, you do what people do on the way growing up and you have a family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that bugs the shit out of me. (chuckling) Like Lena Horn (ph) was on TV yesterday, and she had some sort of life. And she spoke about her parents; they were divorced when she was little. And I got the impression that the last thing in the world she would care about is a family, because she was cabaret singing, she was in Hollywood. The reason for that was that she had to earn a living. It was the depression and she had to work in the Cotton Club and then from that came singing jobs in Hollywood, which didn't treat her too well because she was a black trying to be white and...how they did. And she talked about the musicians and the famous people that she knew as being her family and understanding her, and she clicked with a lot of musicians. And then, of course, somewhere along the way she discovered her roots. So then she had to sing in a black style with this anger and everything. And then the last thing was her children and her great grandchildren, that's her big, I guess when you're old and there's nothing left you zero in on that or...that's all you have left so that's the important thing. But all during her life, I'm sure she could care less, she had two children from an early marriage, and her separated husband took the boy and she took the girl. And all through her life you don't see such concern with children, hers, and what her daughter did, who knows what kind of life she had. But then at the very end she's talking to the audience and doing the fund raisers (chuckling) and saying how great it is, that her whole life now is her children and her great grand children. So I don't know, people, they're not true to themselves. I don't know what, how you would say this but it just irks me that after all that business she went through, this is a big deal. But if she didn't have a career in her life, I'm sure she wouldn't be happy just raising her children, which she didn't do, she didn't raise her daughter. What am I talking about? (chuckling) [0:10:44.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is something about your father again, your...</p>

<p>PATIENT: The concentration on progeny as being the goal of your life, the end-all and the be-all of life. And no matter how many people say, "Oh, I've got to put a career first." They all wind up with lavishing love and attention on a child, like my nephew, Todd's sister's oldest boy. We used to have nice chats. We were on a nice wavelength; every time...we'd go and talk. And at first he was little and we used to look up words in dictionaries and all kinds of little stupid things, like give him haircuts. And so he grew up and I said, "I'm never going to have a kid, a child. This world is awful." You know, I didn't tell him his world is awful and he probably thought of himself, "This is a terrible world." And he said that more than once. And now, so he got married, well, he was going with a girl, she got pregnant and then they got married. They got married with the little boy and their little offspring attending the ceremony. And I've never seen a person so enamored of a child, this Robert.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I mean, he's, changes diapers, he's careful that the kid doesn't get hurt, he's careful about his training, his upbringing, who he's with. Oh, and he's just, the kid is smothered by both parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that that is such a crime?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a turncoat. He's a turncoat. (chuckling) I don't know. I guess there's something about having a child that just makes that makes you go bananas. And it's like a miracle that's irresistible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And no matter how you fight it, it will win. It will win. It's nature; it's Mother Nature and her trick. (chuckling) It's, she's got to have everything producing and reproducing because that's what life is about for nature. But all she cares about is seeds going all over the place...like these puffy seeds and the coconuts that fall down and go on the ocean. And she, and this, and the ova, millions of ova and millions of sperm, well, not too many ovas, just a lot of sperm, and this is all that life cares about, itself. Life wants to sustain itself. And I guess since we're part of the pool, since we're a part of nature's production, we got that...set into our instinctive, I guess it's instinctive we have it built in. And since it is built in you can't do anything about it, people make a big fuss about it and say how wonderful it is. And they have christenings and they have birthday parties and... [0:14:03.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did believe them and it's not really that long ago? You think these are just rationalizings and they've done it anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it's not all fun. Well, I have to believe my nephew. Although I wonder if he sees any drawbacks...what he sees as having, what did he have to give up to get this other thing that he loves so much, this life with his son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if you feel you've missed out on something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't know what it is, I'm annoyed at people when they flaunt it. And Mother's Day, they have to say, "Happy Mother's Day," to me, I'm not a mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this was in the locker room and there was another woman there whose not a mother, she said, "I'm not a mother!" But I don't think she's as upset about it as I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, "Why do I make this so special?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me, I wonder what makes it not upsetting for her? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it's all this ambivalence. Ambivalence, I'm ambivalent about everything. You know, do I want to clean house? Do I want to invite people? Do I want to have parties? And do I want to interact more? Do I want to adopt a kid? You know, if I want this I could adopt a kid, but I'm too lazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you speak about it with great energy, about children and people who have them and how you feel about it and... [0:16:17.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little anger, too. I'm angry with them for living the good life. For being...having a complete life and having a direction. Well, I know that when you have a kid, children come first, so you don't have to worry about what else to do with your life. You have to raise that child, period, and everything revolves around that, plus now they, women, work also. (chuckling) But that revolves around...the kid coming home and you have to feed them and picking them up from the babysitters and all that other stuff. I don't envy what women do today, doing...all that large amount of work and doing everything. I forgot where I started, what I was talking about. Oh...well, I mean life is sort of simplified as far as making decisions. You move where the good schools are. And...that's why the woman at the 'Y', the 'Y' where I go has some daycare stuff going on and there's always mothers with their little babies. A baby, getting them undressed to raise, to go into the pool with him. There's a mother/baby pool session. And then all the other women stop and they pooh-pooh...and they look at babies, their children. I guess I'm jealous you know. I don't want to direct, yeah, I think we've discovered that somewhere in the past that...I want to be the child who gets all that attention. And when I see it given to these other children, I'm not happy about that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You [inaudible at 0:18:32.8]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think what happens, what happened when I was six years old, when my mother had twins.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're both boys?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A boy and a girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, a boy and a girl [inaudible at 0:18:47.6]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they got a lot of attention...double carriage, she's wheeling this double carriage down the avenue and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that's a showstopper. (chuckling) And so where did I come in? I used to be the only one and I was the one that got something, some kind of attention, and then I had to share it with those two adorable things and I was pushed to the background.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little hard to compete with them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. So I don't know. But what do you do as you mature and become an adult...do you just hold onto these stupid old feelings? Because they have no place now. Well, yeah, they were just transferred to the woman in the locker room, (chuckling) since I don't hate my brother and sister anymore, (chuckling) because I used to wish them dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. What I did was, I would imagine if they were dead...I could imagine some accident. I was, "Supposed they died?" And see that way I wouldn't be accused of wishing them dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You didn't kill them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like go around, a round about way of getting rid of them, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When did you feel that? Was it when you were ten?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was young, yeah, yeah, young. And I'd have to take them to the playground...put on their little swimsuits and they'd go into the showers, and I sort of liked doing that. I was a caretaker kind of person. (chuckling) And I guess since these were so invaluable, these two little creatures, and everybody adored them, I had a nice position taking care of these...I had a position of trust. And so in a way, I guess that's where the ambivalence comes in, in a way I was pushed out of the picture and in a way, I was given added status. So now I don't know where the hell I am. Yeah, so you grow up and you get older and, you still have these residual feelings that get in the way. Well, what do they get in the way of? I mean I just get my hackles up a little when I see the mothers coming in and I see everybody fussing. But I just say to myself, "Just...go about your business and ignore all this." [0:21:45.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you started off with this conversation by talking about love, and how last week you were very upset because you been feeling, having feelings of love and then you talked about children. And I think like it was connected with a bigger issue of, I don't know, I remember something about can you open up your heart and really love someone with all of your heart?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, right, I didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to do that? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I was thinking that the idea of children was connected with that, it was something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it means?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It means that you have to give yourself completely to them, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know, I just, I was, as I'm following your train of thought I was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you don't know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...wondering...how it's connected. Initially you're talking about love and then you're talking of the children.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like with last time we were talking about, oh, that if you do give yourself over completely to this feeling of love and then it's taken away, you're very hurt by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe I had some love for my parents and then it was taken away when the twins came and I was hurt there. Then I was hurt when my father died and I didn't want to take part in what was going on around me, so I took pictures. I was 14.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You took pictures?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of him in the coffin.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did anyone say anything about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And then I took pictures of my mother when she was home, looking sad and my sister next to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not usual, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (chuckling) No. Well, I was taking pictures. I wanted to be a photographer and I had...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:23:53.8]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...a little camera and I was taking a lot of pictures, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. What was it like when he died? I mean was your mother; did she talk to you about it, let alone talk about how you felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was completely like, I don't know, an untouched subject. I don't remember any kind of discussion. A telegram came in the middle of the night. He was at the hospital and the telegram said he died. Like there was a telegram and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so she felt bad. But he had been ill, so...if someone is ill and death is impending or pending, imminent, okay, you sort of steel yourself for it. But then my mother and father always seemed to be arguing and I never thought of them as a loving couple. I didn't see love between those, the two of them. And I remember thinking, "I don't ever want to get married because this is what marriage is." This is what I thought marriage was, a lot of friction. And... [0:25:06.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They argued a lot?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They argued a lot. She liked to go out. He was 10 years older. She liked to go out and she joined a local club, a local Russian club, and he never went out, he stayed home. And so I think they didn't get married for love, they got married so she could come to the United States.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I think that's what happened. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't see much love in your home?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But I knew my father, his attitude toward the three of us was a warm one, so I knew that...there was something coming from there even though he didn't express anything specifically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What must you have felt when he died?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I try not to feel anything. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you tried to avoid feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you want to avoid something, which you were trying to avoid something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I could cry about it now. But do you ever finish crying about the things in your past? I mean you kick in these little, old feelings kick in and there it is. Does that ever disappear? Or would it have disappeared if I dealt with it then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what are you doing right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling of how I felt, because that's just how I feel, when he died, still sad. But I didn't want to cry then. (emotional)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I just let myself cry one night while I was in bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it like crying for him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The same feeling I had when I find myself like near you, it's like love is sadness. So I don't want to indulge in it. I don't want to feel love. And of course it just makes, it doesn't feel joyful, it feels sad, it's a loss. Or it's or it could very likely be a loss. I guess I have enough lessons in that and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I feel like you're moving away from it. I mean I'm wondering first of all about the feeling, the initial feeling you had but it's like it's hard to even get to that because you move away from it so quickly. [0:28:13.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I started crying would I move toward it? If I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I see that...you get annoyed that you're feeling this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, so I'm sort of at a loss to know...well, what should I do with it? Should I not get annoyed? How do other people act? Or how do you want me to deal with this? What direction do you want me to go? Or how should I handle this to suit you or to suit me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To suit me. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or to suit me even...what to do with this feeling?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I just, I keep seeing how you don't like to feel this, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you seem to feel the sadness, you get very annoyed with yourself that you're still feeling this...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...after all these years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I want to just wash it away, put it under the rug and forget about it, which I guess I have, and then in my mind...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what kind of thoughts does the real, the wish to put it away, not to feel it, what is that feeling like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels like that I haven't grown up and I am like tied into old, childish lessons that haven't advanced. And I guess I compare myself with others. I'm feeling, "Oh, others are not thinking, feeling this and other people have developed and moved on and are living useful lives." So I get annoyed that I'm not like others...this ideal, I ideal others who are successful, emotionally successful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you feel like other people don't have these kinds of...feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I'm just so comparing myself with others and I'm thinking if anybody knew they would say, "Oh, how stupid you are." I would be criticized for harboring these kinds of old ideas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you expect that people would criticize you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should've gotten over it already it seems? [0:31:04.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Like I guess, and I'm thinking of the people in my family, like my sister. I can't talk to anybody in my family about anything. (chuckling) Todd's sister, my brother, we used to be close when we were kids but no anymore. I can't talk to him about anything. And we don't see each other very much. [silence from 0:31:33.6 to 0:31:48.2] So if I find myself feeling love, I squash it because it feels very sad. Then I'm annoyed for having to squash it. Or am I annoyed for feeling love in the first place, (chuckling) because it's connected with this awful feeling?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Are you annoyed at having to squash it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or annoyed at feeling it? Because that's different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Am I annoyed if, that I feel sad and that's ruining the love feeling?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so sad of you to say that love is sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [non verbal, yes]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to be connected so quickly and deeply...it instantly...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...makes you feel sadness....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...when you feel love.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like the sadness is ironic. I don't know how to describe it, so. If I could describe it and get the right words...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...a lightbulb will go on in my head, and then I'll have solved that problem? What's the problem here then? (chuckling) That love should not be sadness or should it? I don't know. That's not a well and philosophical question. Some people must be embarrassed when they feel love. That's another way I would feel...like here's this positive feeling and, it's like it's stepping out of yourself to somebody else and that's like almost an imposition on that somebody else and it's embarrassing... [0:34:21.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it an imposition?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...to show any signs of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it an imposition on me, for me to show signs of love when you cry? Or when you have feelings...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a cause for me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, maybe you, that along with the feeling and the demonstration is the expectation that it's got to, that you want something from the other person. [overlapping voices at 0:34:51.5]...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not a one-way thing. And I think that's what happened to me with this boyfriend that I had. Right after all these, my father died and all that, these other lessons, then I had this fellow that I wanted to marry and, which surprises me because I thought...I was a tomboy and I was prudent, not prudent, a prude (chuckling) and...I didn't like make-up. So anyhow, in college I met this guy and, well, I really liked him a lot and I wanted to marry him, and he didn't want to and so he went his way but after dating for a long time. And then even when I was married to Todd, I used to have lunch dates with this other fellow. So he was still like, I don't know, interested in a casual way. And then I don't know, for many years after marrying Todd, I would think about all the nice times we had on dates and going here and going there and it was just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning you and this first guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He would be always on my mind and I would recall my life with him. (blowing nose) So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really were in love with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess you would say so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Well, yeah, I guess I would say so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think of him [in a carnal way?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. [I don't think so.] (ph) I think to me, I don't know. He's been engaged other times and he had a reputation of breaking engagements. And, I don't know what his problem was. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you tell him you wanted to marry him? [0:37:21.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must have really hurt that he didn't want you...saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because we dated a long time and I thought he liked me. So for a long time I didn't let that go, and I dwelt on all of the love feelings that were involved with...riding the ferry and going to movies and, riding on the train to visit some friends of his in Boston.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how you remember it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have all of these things...tucked away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it's fading now...I'm getting a little smarter than I used to be, now. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How smarter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How smarter? Well, you can't keep remembering everything that hurts or that you don't have anymore. But it used to feel a whole lot, tragic inside...and I feel crushed by it and...really longing for things that I'll not have from him or...longing for a repetition of these wonderful times we had...so I just forget about it. So, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We, I was thinking about how it felt to have feelings for me, to have stirred up feelings of love for me. You talked about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe you liked me too much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you said you began to think too, not that there's semi (ph) confusion as you have feelings for me, that I should be reciprocating, but like, I mean, the thought is embarrassing do you think, uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, first there's the sadness, to see, to feel that I have a positive feeling for someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's not the same feeling that I have for any of the people in my gym class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this is like an intimate experience, (chuckling) so it's got to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it is an intimate experience. (both chuckling) [0:40:07.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's got to be, the feeling has to be more intense and in keeping with the fact that I'm sharing all this stuff, although you're not sharing anything with me, you're just, thankfully, the recipient of all these inside bits of me, of myself that I'm trying to get out and rearrange. So, I'm very grateful that you're open to all that I have to say. Although the feeling from last time was because we were having a good time. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the good time made me feel, "Hey...we're having a good time. I like this girl." And then, since the feeling, since that liking was more intense than just an average person liking someone somewhere else, then it, that old, the love thing kicked in...the sadness kicked in. And then, the embarrassment and the expecting something, well, that's like sort of the next step and I don't want to impose myself and expect anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's more like a part trying to be avoided something or part of rejecting with that whole experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it? Because it seems like what happens is...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you feel like and then immediately you start rejecting, like avoiding...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...moving away from it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I justify it by saying, "Oh, I don't want to, I don't want this love feeling to be any kind of an imposition on you." I don't know, I'm not quite sure about that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm not sure either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, and that's so hard. So the question is why? (chuckling) Why can't I like you without having this sad feeling kicking in from, I guess my past...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...my past learning about love? (big sigh)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, have you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't figure it out. (chuckling) I don't know what that means in my brain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Well, it means you have a condition that.] (ph) [0:43:02.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That never is? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just think that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or is there sometimes, give me an easy explanation. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know one. Would it help if I were to give you one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, make it a choice question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean you see other people with similar problems, and maybe they've figured out something, but it doesn't work that. It wouldn't work if I didn't figure it out myself somehow...come to some sort of knowledge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think it's not just about...understanding. "Oh, well, this is what happened...'a' led to 'b' and 'b' led to 'c' and that's what's happened. I mean, I think that it's not just about understanding...why things are the way they are but also, really understanding what it is you're feeling and what you do with those feelings you have that are important in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be difficult to get at. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's what we're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what you're still struggling with I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because when you talk about...love and children and not having had children, in some way it's not having...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in some ways having a wrecked (ph) thought, like...maybe you didn't have children and you sort of weren't acknowledged yourself and didn't have love to give them, and all of these things [were in connection.] (ph) If one is not [inaudible at 0:44:59.7]... to you as love and affection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I love my cat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's the same. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have two cats. One is not so loveable. I tolerate one I love the other. [I sort of love him.] (ph) Well, I guess the only way to get at this is to keep talking. (chuckling) Or to keep feeling, to keep looking inside and I don't know why I can't. It just seems like a lot and I sort of hit a blank wall and I want to rest my brain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I feel like we've kind of hit a blank wall. We're out of time. Next week we just kind of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah, I think this, these feelings too, that this is all in the past.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, is there any homework you could give me? (both chuckling) Because it seems once a week...I go on the subway and I write down in my notebook what we did and then I come, when I come here I read the notebook and sort of refresh my mind, what we were talking about. And in between, I wasn't thinking about you very much, in between this last session and this session, and I was sort of feeling guilty that I didn't think more about you and that I was into my own things, whatever they were, not being very important. I have a feeling I'm downplaying all that, too. I'm just downplaying everything I do. Okay. (chuckling) So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'll see you next time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So no homework?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and actually I wanted to talk to you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I forgot about [inaudible at 0:47:02.0]... I'm sorry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I meant actually to start with this. I'm going to be on vacation over Christmas, over that time. So we'll meet next week...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but I'll actually be away for two weeks, which one is Christmas Eve and one is New Year's Eve...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...there goes...those Tuesdays (ph) days.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the 24th, if you planned on being, is there 30 or 31 days in December?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, 30 days has September, blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think there are 31. Yeah, I know. Okay, so the 31 is...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because I need to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I, that's a nice idea, taking a Christmas break from everything. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah, go to Colorado? (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to Vermont actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh! [0:47:48.6]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 7.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just thought that it was, you know, other people change roles, too. They don't know that they do it, is, you know, it isn't as clear to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's my whole problem. Couple points I wanted, before I go into a friend...I was talking about a close, well, the circle of friends that I've been hanging around with. In fact, he had (inaudible). Before, do that, and I could clear up, finish up physics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in order to...well, I tried to figure out what my motivation would be in physics and to see how that fits into this little mold I have of myself, of pleasing other people. And I come up with two entirely different analyses of it. The first is to may be fit the mold, I go through the following (inaudible). When I was in high school, there was, you know, there was no one particular field. I'd just sort of take everything and I did fairly well in everything, and then we had the Scholastic Achievement Tests. And I was in a brand new high school, and well, I got a perfect score on math, and that was, "Hail to the big whoop tee doo," because I was the first one in our high school. Well, big deal. Well, anyhow, that was sort of math. Because here's our buddy, mathematician.</p>

<p>And I rode with that as a burden, sort of, my entire senior year. Jokes were made about it, and things like that. And so I just assumed that I was going to go into math. Well, when I got to college, just assuming I am going to be a mathematician, and I went to my advisor who was a mathematician, and I said, "What else do I have to take?" And he said, he included physics as one of the courses I could take. Well, after about a year, I started drifting from math into physics. It wasn't that far off and so I was meeting everybody's expectations, everybody knew I was going to school to be a mathematician. And then the Lord has a strange way of letting you drift away from any major and after my junior year, I spent a year in Europe and I came back and really didn't have any major. Although the closest thing approximating it was physics.</p>

<p>And it was then that I actually, if anyone said, "When did you decide?" I haven't decided. I was forced to. And there was no real thought in it. It was just assumed. Because when I was a freshman and a sophomore, that was sort of where I was. And so I would say that by and large, if I wanted to analyze it to make it fit into everything else, it ends up that I just did it to meet everyone else's expectations. It was not my decision at all. I went away to school to be a mathematician or a physicist, which I don't think is that much different in a layman's eye. And that's what I ended up being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, you came out that way?</p>

<p>[0:03:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so it's not right. It's there, there it fits fine. Now, that isn't so bad, I don't' think. I mean, I had math, I mean, I had student physics professors who ended up being physicists because it was the shortest line in freshman registration. So, there are all sorts of reasons. Well, now that's...that would mean if that's true, if everything else that I just did, then clearly, I should drop out right now. Why even go through with the test, but even to prove it to myself, if you went through that, then go through the test. Now, the analysis that is different from that, is when I was at the (inaudible), it's a liberal arts college, I had to take, you know, social sciences, and I had taken other things, and I would have to admit that there was nothing that I took, and I took, general (inaudible), although we can't very well say, though, from 100 level course, whether or not I want to go to that, but I can't really say that there was anything that really fired me up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe the art and art history work, but more as a dilatant, I think, starting a life long mission, so I don't really think that there was anything that I wanted to get into much more deeply than sort of a life perusal to appreciate the principles thereof, and say, "Well, that's kind of nice." So, I can with some comfort, come to the conclusion that it was my decision. Now, if that's the case, why would our last session go the way it was? Why was I so down in physics? Well, I don't think it's a fair assessment to say, "Well, I fell about it now, considering the last six months I'm going through." I mean, I've got this horrible, heavy thing that American education has put over my head called the big test, qualifying (inaudible), and it's not a real fair assessment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, so those are the two analyses. Now, the second one, if we go back to last time's tapes and we say, "Well, I'm going to come up with something that will make me comfortable. You know, I'm going to stay in physics..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Well, there it is. I came up with it. I want to (inaudible) up there." So, I don't know whether I did come up with it or whether it's true. But at any rate, it's clear, as I told you the last time, that I'm going to go through with it. I'm going to finish the next two years, I'm pretty sure, for whatever reasons they may be and I think I'm going to get my degree. Well, I like to think, it's the latter analysis. But, I think, really, the next two years will tell, or the year and a half that it takes me, because that's really the fun in physics, doing the research, you know. Without having to worry about teaching the course, or if you're a professor, worrying about tenure, you know, your first few years, or getting a publication in. Really, when you're working on a dissertation, most people don't care if it's done, they like it to be done in a couple years. But I'm going to wait and see before I make any judgment on physics to see if I'm discoursing my career plans to fit this mold that I've got, of pleasing other people, of not pleasing myself, or whether, indeed, it is my field.</p>

<p>[0:06:24.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. You're going to see if you enjoy the (inaudible) spot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Now, does that sound like I just went home and thought for a week to come up with a comfortable decision and came up with one, or do you really think that's the case?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you see, that's the problem. I really never know what I think because I've never really thought for myself. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a damn good answer, you know, I can really live comfortably with it, if I really want to deep down believe it. But, it's so hard to tell, because as I said, I don't think I've ever really had, sure, I've had feelings of my own, but I don't think I ever really come up with major decisions like (inaudible) decisions of my own. Well, that's where it lies there. Maybe it might come up again. I just wanted to set it straight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Acknowledge it. The other thing, I also made an analysis last week, or developed it over the weeks, of...that I am really attracted to a girl because she's my inferior and she's around me, and because she's around me, then, I can feel superior to her then, or I accept her as a challenge and it does my ego good to win her over. I just want to point out, as a good scientist that there's not enough data to make any good (inaudible) inference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are only a few cases.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would say yeah. The only time, and (inaudible) withdraw anything that occurred before I was like 19 or 20, because number one, I've changed so much since then, and number two, I was immature, and I think there was a lot different motives involved. So, that being the fact, I can tell you what happened in all, let's say, two or three times I've been infatuated since then. But I can't say, "Well, I do it because of this." I might be able to say in one particular case, why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so those are a few things I wanted to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think a couple times I decided to get back with the people I made contact with quite frequently, and (inaudible). The...well, I'll just see tell you how it happened. I moved down the (inaudible) and turns out the people across the (inaudible), are four girls living there, three of whom were single, three of whom there was no attraction, as far as I'm concerned, whatsoever. They just were too different. They were nice girls, but there was never anything there. They were fairly quiet little school teachers. One or two I've met sometime in the mall, but they were...so we became shallow friends. Subsequently, by the way, one of my roommates, the one that moved in with (inaudible) is now marrying one, and the other one turned out to be Laura, the girl I talked to you about. Laura was, at that time, engaged to the boy in (inaudible) of her building, who has subsequently become, I would say, over the past two years, the person with whom I had the closest contact. Not the deepest, but the most often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most frequent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, most frequent. The deepest is clearly (inaudible). Now, I tried to think about how I interact with these people and how it fits in with the me, and I think it boils down to pretty much to a mistake, because the relationships actually failed. I never really sat down and talked to Rich about important things. I mean, we've talked about, I've given (inaudible), because Laura (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The deepest things we talk about are political issues, and we're pretty much flat on the same lines, so that it seems to me as though it's another protection, (inaudible) I think. I don't want people to get inside me. And it was clear with these people that there would be no probing. Not to say they're not the probing types, it's just that our relationship never developed to that extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just the way your relationship was set up...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could see there wasn't going to be that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Now, the other problem is the affection problem, and that's really strange. That's strange, indeed. Rich was a (inaudible) before this. And Laura was fixing any meals and we'd do everything together. It was really great because we enjoyed each other's company, and enjoyed (inaudible), partly she got on my nerves, and partly because of this, thinking about why and everything. And she definitely made advances during that time, most the time when she was drunk, but that's beside the point, and I completely turned away. Now, why I knew this relationship with the group, I don't know, other than it's a comfortable interaction and I don't have to worry about any pretenses, because of the proximity of the relationship, there are no fences built. They know how I act and how I behave. But they don't really know anything very much about me.</p>

<p>[0:12:12.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why is that affection there between the two of us? I don't know, it sort of fills a void in part of my life, and the standard joke is the that...well, outside of the joke of Ted, that I horribly perpetrated, is the fact that I'll never meet any girls in physics and I'll probably never have any dates. Laura's gone through that time and time and time again. And not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's kind of a joke of saying, "Well..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like, for instance, we'll go out to a dinner or show and something, the group of us, five (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the standard little part of the thing is that Laura and Rich are going to bed together, and well, Wes is going home with Chrissie, you know? (inaudible) well (inaudible). And so that's basically the...but why...I don't see the...you know, not like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's a real comfortable...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's a real comfortable thing, it has been. And now I look at it and, well, before I Look at it now, it seems to me that it was comfortable because it wasn't deep and the people were generally compatible. Of course, the circle goes beyond that, because they're the ones that (inaudible) most significant brother and the brother, Carl is living there now. And (inaudible), beside the point, beside the point. It was comfortable, it was non-probing, and it was a compatible relationship that protected me from having anyone know me, much less myself. Now, the few times I was...I guess fixed up by Laura, she would find some girl she had been working with or had some friend, it was really tense. And that's the problem I came here with, I would say, meeting a new person, even though I was with the old comfortable, old shoe people. Zap, it hit, there I was behaving very consciously again, worrying about every word, worrying about how this person was looking with me, even though I was with the old, comfortable people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Subsequent to, I think, my talk with Ted, she got to go...she doesn't like Laura at all, it's understandable. I'm trying to figure out...well, I look at Laura and I see really glaring faults. I mean, she's really very egocentric. No matter what comes into the conversation she's always worried about herself. Maybe it's just that I found an identity with her, maybe I'm egocentric, too, and that's why it's, that's why I'd be comfortable with her. But the last couple of times, I've been with Rich and Laura, I don't want to say a friction, but there's been an interaction that wasn't there before, because I see things that I didn't see before. And I'm no longer...well, I'm still comfortable, in other words, I can interact comfortably but I sit back and I look and I see the things I didn't see before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you see the rough things that you didn't notice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't bother you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and, funny you should mention that. I was talking to the other roommate that I have, John, he is probably, of my friends, the least likely, well, yeah, all across the board, behaviorally, he's very quiet and he sits in his room and reads a lot and I don't, I get out and...well, and he's also probably quite a bit to the right in his political views, and I'm quite a bit to the left, well, in some fantasy, to the left these days. I'm a regular old student.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Regular old student.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we had a talk the other day, and he mentioned, I didn't go real deeply into things. I've lived with him two years, and yet he doesn't really, he knows how I behave, that (inaudible). But anyhow, I mentioned some of the basic thoughts I've been having, and his basic contention is there either has to be some line that provides all the oil that smoothes out all the roughnesses that help people interact. The same analogy you just gave. And he said the whole world couldn't behave without the oil, and my contention is, of course, it's a bad analogy, because who else could? I mean, it could be 100 percent honest. There would be a real problem in the transition era when the people that are used to hearing false compliments wouldn't hear them anymore. But nevertheless, I think that the world could be...could exist through the roughness. But now, the point is, why didn't I see them before, the roughnesses? I guess I just didn't want to. It was nice enjoying when I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More smooth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. So, why even, you know, why rock the boat at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you didn't think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it sounds like, I think you're saying, is you're very comfortable in this part of the interaction with this group, but now I'm changing, or I'm feeling ready for other things, too. To have something else, to move out of that kind of smooth, (inaudible) or just smooth.</p>

<p>[0:18:16.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, that could be the case, that I no longer will enjoy the shell, I think. Or it could also be the case that I'll still have it in my life, but not with this type of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, the major glaring fault that Laura has, I think, is probably my major fault, that I immediately covered, I think, in most instances. I feign modesty whenever anyone brings up a challenge. If it does crop up in a conversation at a party, at first I'll deny it, because I know eventually, I'll go back to the person I heard it from and re-confirm it. And then it should (inaudible), I hope. So, I'm really an egocentric, very conceited, but I haven't been any better than Laura. So, maybe I saw this in Laura, that's why I identified with her. Said, "Oh, that's my kind of person." So, it might not be the case that I never will have this really smooth relationship with certain people, but it might be that I'll have it with different people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different groups?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you can't be really deep with everyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't walk up to everyone and give them your philosophy of life. That ain't going to work, but you know, it's (inaudible), yeah, they'll develop, other relationships that I (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it also sounds like now that you have different feelings about your own ego type thing, it makes you have different feelings about Laura.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And about that whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible), self-hate, I think. That's what brought me in here, disliking myself. And I think now that I'm seeing in her the things in me that I dislike. I think I'm...as I said, I think I'm very conceited, and you put that conceit right there. I don't know if it is or not. I know when I was at college, with a guy that I...he's really a great guy, lot of fun, he dropped out. Every now and then, you'd think he was just a goofball, but he'd come up with some major insights, and one particular time, he was also, he was also (inaudible) that didn't study and that was drinking a lot. One particular time, he was just about passing out on the floor of the dormitory, and we had been close, so I decided to help him.</p>

<p>And I was helping him up putting him in bed. And he said, "Get away from me, you..." and he called me, I'm trying to remember the words exactly, something like, "egotistical, self-centered son-of-a-bitch." It was like, wow, the first thing he said about me. And then I started probably thinking about it, and began covering up that. So, people wouldn't notice it, wouldn't be as clear. And I think I've done a reasonable job, although every now and then it crops up. I forget myself and I say something that's clearly trying to steer the conversation to me, because I'm the one the conversation should be about. I don't know if that's so bad. I guess, if I'm...the problem is if I've got this trait, is it good to keep it repressed, or should I try and get rid of it. I don't know. It's hard to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, ever since I was little, my parents reinforced it. Everything that I've done well, they've reinforced and encouraged me in it, and showed me to other people and said, "Wow, look at this first grade great little clay model he made. Isn't that tremendous?" and things like that. So, it's probably deep in there. It's a good thing to have him...I can't get rid of it. But then, too, it might be what it's all about. The reason why I'm here, is probably ego.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. So, you mean, if it's that, then you might want to not just to hide it, but to do (inaudible) with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or...I'm wondering how it would fit in. Making the premise, just by the way, I don't know...do you notice any of my thinking being different than most people's, as far as like, applying it to a scientific method type thinking?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've noticed that, too, but I seem to have been doing that with this, which, although I do ramble at times, every time I try to synthesize, I end up with, well, a reasonable approach. Well, anyhow, now I lost my train of thought. Oh, assuming that the basic number one problem is...reverts back to ego, and that is really what is there, that I'm just as conceited as hell, let's see if we can, let's take the (inaudible), (inaudible). If it is ego, then I would only...if I were completely egocentric, I would only worry then, about, yeah, sure, I would only enjoy it if people thought well of me. I would only want people to think well of me. Therefore, I would do things that would make them think well of me.</p>

<p>And yeah, that's...On the other hand, if I were...if it weren't ego that were the driving force, you see, it's hard here. Because it could be just the opposite. It could be to the point that I...I'm sort of not egocentric, but I don't know what the word is, but I'm only centered around them. Which are either exact opposites or exactly the same, I'm not sure which. You see, I have no real ego, I have only what other people see. So, therefore, I'm really earning their opinion, not my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>[0:24:36.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could care less what I think of me, it's only what they think of me, therefore, I do only what they like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, them (inaudible) their way. Is there a word for it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Other-centered, other-centric.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I can't come up with a contradiction, either, when you said this. They're either both the same, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All you're saying is that in your own life, you've seen both of them at times?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not so much feeling both of them, it's...you see, my feelings and my...prior to this, my feelings and my drives all seem to be pretty much the same. Now, my actions, I shouldn't' say my feelings. Now, what the drives are is the problem. Why do I feel that way, why do I act that way? Now, if I feel and act that way because I am egocentric, then I do it because I only want myself to look good. On the other hand, if I do it because of other centric, well, then I do it because I want them to be pleased with me and therefore, they will be comfortable. One way, I can make myself out to be a complete ass, the other way I can make myself out to be one of the greatest oil in all of society.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. I see. Oh, I see. So, part of the question is who are you basically trying to make comfortable and happy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is what you're asking, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could very well be both, you see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I've developed to the point where I'm only happy when other people are happy with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If that is indeed the case...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But other people are happy with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When they're happy or when they're happy with what you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, happy with what I do, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the same old number one, going back. That is only, I think, two times in my life, except for shallow encounters. I mean, one time things, when I get mad at someone or just don't give a damn about what's going to happen to someone, (inaudible), except for two times. One of those times is now with my roommate. I'm going away, there was no interaction, and one time, there was a girl in high school that I just gave up on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you mentioned that, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, isn't that amazing, by the way, that you can live with a guy, and you come up with two, three weeks now? I've never seen a more complete conflict of personalities in my entire life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if we should go into it or not, because I don't know. I think...I don't know if there's anything to reflect on here. Well, I'll think a minute, and (inaudible) we'll drop it. When Bob moved out, we got to talking about a new roommate, and he said, "Well, there's a guy in the lab, (inaudible), have him come in. So, on fourth of July last, we went...no, 1970...what year? �71, �69, the fourth of July, we went to the fireworks display at McIntire Field with him, and I got to see him and he got to see me, and fine, you know, great, let's have him in.</p>

<p>So, in September of �69, he moved in. The first couple of times I saw him he was worried about how dirty the place was. "Well, let's clean it up." And great, I'm really happy about this, because I had always been the instigator in cleaning. My personal habits were always a little bit better. Not that I'm saying good, bad, or indifferent. But I happened to be (inaudible) than the others. So, I thought, well, there's someone on my end, and we'll have a cleaner apartment, and they worked about once or twice, and then I began to notice a competition between the two of us. I was, well, with the other people, I was, with the (inaudible) think it sort of made me a kingpin for a while, in that other group, and he now is a new entry, and he was sort of becoming the Renaissance man of the group, he was well-read and he knew everything about everything and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was a kingpin in his own way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think there was probably a competition there. He, in his quiet way, was trying to impress the group with his erudition and overall worldliness, and I pretty much was assumed to be, well, there was certainly no athletic connotation, there was sort of like another part of my personality. The competition or the...yeah, I was considered probably the most educated of that whole group because I was not just the physicist, you see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other people were high school teachers and things like that, and they were in graduate school. But the three of us, Bob, Steve and I, we were the physicists. But I went beyond that, because I had a liberal education and if discussion ever turned to art or anthropology or something, I could say something.</p>

<p>[0:30:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you had a place in the group?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, well, I was a real...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a real ego boost to be in the group. Okay? But now came Mike and there was a tremendous competition there in the group, and it kind of deteriorated to the point where we really didn't say anything good about each other, when the two of us were interacting. And then, oh, the smallest little things would occur. I would see...something would rub him the wrong way and I'd just try...it used to rub me wrong. I mean, little tiny things. Leaving spoons on the drain board, after you wash the dishes, face up, they're going to get a puddle in them. And he hates puddles on spoons. Things like, unbelievable that people can do that, but it's just sort of like, isn't that bad? It would sort of escalate, you know, and more and more and more. And now it's just, wow, it's just unbelievable. We just simply don't interact anymore. And it all, I think, boiled down to a competition thing. And, oh, Ted's statement that I surround myself with inferiors, and the things that I do, seem to be born out, that I was superior in this group, and I certainly, there were certainly other groups I could have been, lived with, and been around, but this was the group I chose, because there was no challenge there, and I guess Mike represented a challenge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. To knock you out of your place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, subsequently, he's fallen from the group pretty much. I mean, he doesn't interact with the rest of us anymore at all. But that could very well be his nature. He's very quiet. He doesn't interact much. I don't think there's much to be gleaned from it, other than the fact that this just sort of fits in, I mean, you know, I mean, I'm egocentric. I surround myself with inferiors, and he was not an inferior. He came into the group and therefore, he was...there was a conflict there and I won.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So, he's...fits in as an example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there's a real problem here, you know that? That is the fact that I've got everything figured out, you know, well, okay, I'm (inaudible) in my ego, I interact with people just please them, I'm going to let physics go because...I mean, all these things that I've got figured out, and now I'm just coming up with these answers to fit in. I don't know that that's the way to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. To what? To...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, it's one of two things. It's either that on a very...the analysis that I've made so far is just (inaudible) analysis that I came up with, and it's pleasing to me to have something settled on, and I'm not worried yet about what we're going to do about it, because I'm still talking about it, still hashing it through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm coming up with more examples to reinforce that this is the case. Or the case as it is that I've made some, you know, there's been some divine inspiration, and I have, "Ah..." come up with the answer, and this is what it is, and everything is lo and behold, fitting neatly into place. I don't know how to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not knowing which of those two it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so it's clear what we do. We find another person and I try and bring out everything I can, as honestly as I can without trying to fit him into the mold. I think (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think (inaudible). Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know who to bring up. You see, there's one problem, anybody that's close to me now, I've already talked about it. And anyone close to me in the past, is past, and has changed so much. Okay, let's take Lobe. Lobe. Okay, now I'm trying to give you just the facts. Okay? I'm not going to shape him at all, to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I came here after (inaudible), and I think I've mentioned him before, you probably don't remember him. Everyone calls him by his last name, I don't know why, Lobe. When I came here to New York, I lived in a business dormitory, because I came in the summer, and that was a cheap to live, and Lobe went to (inaudible) with me and he was like an overlap between B(inaudible) and New York. When I came here I was pretty super straight. Well, it was �68, and I was just for McCarthy because everyone else was, and I really hadn't thought about much. I had been reading the New York Times in college, and (inaudible) working my experience in math.</p>

<p>And I came here, and Lobe was like the completely resident weirdo, the hippy at B(inaudible). That was really strange, he was like second in his class, academically. He has really...skill for excellence and you got to give him credit for that. I mean, he's...like he's study from Monday through Friday, straight through. And like Saturday, he'd start drinking and smoking and he'd come out of it Monday morning. But he never did anything but ace tests. Well, anyhow, so he was kind of the radical student, a real student. Okay. So, I'm not...by the way, I've been relating Lobe, I missed some of the facts. They might not pertain at all. That last little bit might not pertain at all.</p>

<p>So, anyway, so I came here, and I lived with him. There were like two of us on the floor and John John was the third one, I mentioned him before. So, the whole building was, it was real quiet intimate relationship and he got to know about me, and how I interacted. We were on the same fraternity, which wasn't a fraternity, but that's a standard word for it, fraternity, and we hadn't really been close, and now we were close because there was no one else around, really. It must have been like five or six people in the whole dorm, and we were eating together and everything. And I was really studying back then.</p>

<p>Soon as I'm in New York, I study hard at the beginning and I slack off in the middle, now I'm back into the study group, that's my (inaudible) cycle. And back then he was kind of impressed with this, and he was studying quite a bit, too, and we didn't do much except that, and eat dinner and things, and he got me...he was the guiding force that started me into...well, I started smoking with him, I grew the beard, the long hair, all that kind of thing. And he sort of took me to the opposite end of the spectrum that I'd been in at B(inaudible). Comfortably, though. And I enjoyed it. I...well, one thing I've noticed with smoking, at least, with most of my friends, is there's sort of a time when you do that and you really get excited. I'm talking about grass and hash. And then you turn into, well, I've noticed a lot of my friends, people I smoked with for a few months, who, like everything. They buy the strobes, and the headphones and the strange music and they're burning incense and all this weird stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do the whole bit, and (inaudible) wow.</p>

<p>[0:37:44.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything, everything, you know, and they really enjoy it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And frequently, too, but then you sort of know and you get back in...you know, maybe every other weekend or just for 2001 when it comes to town or whatever the case may be. And that year with Lobe was the wild year. And I was really comfortable with him. There was a time, after we lived together for quite a while, that once in a while a trait of his personality got to me, and that was the fact that he never did a favor for anyone, that he never expected one from anyone in return. If he gave you a pencil, the smallest little stub of a pencil because you were short once, he would expect one back sometime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if he loaned you a match, he would expect...which is neither here nor there, you know, but he remembers all these little favors that he might be forced to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that bugged you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it finally got on my nerves. But I look back on it now. It's certainly not a bad character trait, because he never expected, the old, I don't know if you remember, the old first principle approach, but if everyone acted that way, it would be fine. You know, if everyone would agree to that. But I wasn't at the time. I would do a favor for someone and then he...eventually, it would wash, and then I'd get one back. I didn't track. So, there was a little conflict there after we had lived together a year (inaudible) something like that. But basically, we got along very well. The depth of our relationship was...it was deep only in the sense that we were close together so often, like, that first summer, for instance, all the time, that he could glean a lot about my character from that. Now, with Rich and Laura, I'm close to them, too, but not nearly as close...they're living in a different building.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't see them every day, every waking moment. We would eat three meals a day together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so just by virtue of that, you knew...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and the only time I wasn't with him, I was with physics. So, Steve got to know me. As a matter of fact, did I mention...remember, two sessions ago, I told you that it was Steve that told me the girl who tried to commit suicide?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I do remember that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's (inaudible). And that was in (inaudible), you sure that's what you want to do. And I think that's what started the physics discussion, because he realized the fact that I didn't see, and probably before I realized it, certainly before I realized it. And I think he might have mentioned it back then, but then that was a perception I didn't want to hear it. I didn't want to believe it. And so he probably...he probably saw him in me a little bit. Just by the way I interacted and one of his lines, a week ago, now, was, "Are you sure physics are what you want to do because you react better with people, certainly than you do with physics?" Or numbers, equations. No, I wanted to draw a conclusion. I'm going to have to watch that. What else can I tell you about Steve? I think that's about it. I'm sorry, I can't tell you. There isn't anything deeper, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But those are the basic facts?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But that was a while ago, and I don't know that...there isn't much insight with Steve, but I bring him up because I'm looking for another person to see if it's the same mold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, now, there it's out. I don't think I made any conclusions, did I? Now, I've got to draw them, let's see. It's certainly not the case that I saw him as my inferior, that I surrounded myself with Steve. However, I don't think that there was much choice when I came here. I, well, yeah, there was a choice. I could either move into the dormitory where I knew actually no one, and it would cost $50 more than it would in this business dormitory, or I would move into that one, which is, I think, (inaudible) was important to me. And there was someone I knew, that knew his way around, he'd been here a year, he was a year ahead of me. He'd been here a year so he knew his way around, so I don't think the decision ever really came, and so I said, "All right, there are sometimes, here's an inferior, I want to live with him so I feel good." As a matter of fact, he's clearly a superior. His academic excellence is something I can't hold a candle to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that inferior theory doesn't hold up here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, that's not, I think it can be not because it was a decision made my...I don't think there was any other decision to make.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually, looking at it, it was much better, going into a new place, it was better to have someone laid the groundwork.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but it also sounds like in that case, you didn't go out of your way to surround yourself with inferior...you kept, you stuck with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: However...however, come into New York, being completely ignorant of who would be here. Might...I don't know, but I might have had a fear of surrounding myself with superiors, (inaudible) with physicists.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's so long ago, I don't know what the motivating force was. But I don't think that that was much of it in my (inaudible), I think the important thing was, as I said, little, every day things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, now, did I do things to please Steve? I clearly changed. That was my big metamorphosis, living in that dormitory right away. I became...I have since sort of stepped back a little bit in a more comfortable role. But I was way far out there. And under his influence, (inaudible) certainly not anyone else in the dorm, we were really looked in to that. I mean, we (inaudible) average business, he lost (inaudible) for Jack. But that certainly wasn't with Steve. Steve had long red hair down to his shoulders, and it was really weird, saw in the resume because he had a picture that came from his college graduation. By the way, when he graduated from college, he again, had the hair down to his shoulders and had the beard. And he had it shaved off and it was in the front page of the paper.</p>

<p>The (inaudible), he never even know that, because, a big deal, the one time in four years that he shaved. Subsequently, he was drafted, so he doesn't look that way anymore, but anyhow, did I go that way to please him? I don't know. I don't know. No, I don't think so. Oh, it's so hard to say, though. There was a pressure at B(inaudible), to go the grass route and do...live a little grubbier than usual, and (inaudible). I think it's healthy, then, once you go through that stage. I think college is wonderful, because it gives you a chance, you're not socially responsible, really. You can do anything you want in four years, or (inaudible), that. But it's good in that sense. And I rejected the opportunity, then. I don't know why. Maybe it didn't really present itself as much as it did here. But I didn't...I mean, I went to the...the conservative, yeah, conservative clean-cut student that was really not rebelling in any sense of the word, and then when I came here, under his influence, did I find a place with him, I don't know. It could have been the case. Once I (inaudible) to him.</p>

<p>[0:46:11.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, all right, let's, it either was or it wasn't or it was somewhere in between. So, let's talk about either it was or it wasn't. If it was the case that I was influenced only by him in order to please him, yeah, I did pretty good. Pretty good job of it. I developed his habits, his interests, his outlook, you know, pretty close. There were very few major differences. And now, if it's not the case, but it was sort of evolving, and (inaudible) should or it does go through. (inaudible) comfortably. And then that could have been the case, too. It was a real dead end street. I don't think we're going to get any answers there. Which says something, too, because it says that maybe I'm only pulling out relationships that I can glean something from that fit. That fit, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're choosing the benefits that you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it also sounds like that one thing that comes out of this is that, at least, if that theory is true, that you do things to please everyone, it isn't clearly true in this case. It's not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's probably more complex than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you see the thing is, I'm not here because I interact with everyone in a certain way, and I want you to help me with that. I'm here because of something that's happening to me, if it happens with only one person. If I'm lying to one person, it's a problem, it bothers me. So, just because I have someone that doesn't fit into...that might be the right conclusion, it doesn't mean it's not a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see. Well, in that case, all you have to do is find one person that it's a problem with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because then you don't have any (inaudible) to (inaudible). You see, there's a problem with more than one person. I mean, it's happened any number of times with...especially with new people. When I really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's what I think. I'm getting a little confused because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No idea. I'm trying to collect statistics to see if this theory is true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But on the other hand, you're saying if it's only true with one person, then it's still a problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good point. Very good point. Right. Okay. Now, the...okay...how about that? That's true. I never thought of that. You really caught me there. Yeah, I got...if there are people with which it didn't happen, that's significant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Oh, well, all right, I'll give myself some good (inaudible) when I go through the other people I can go through. There aren't that many. I mean, what can I say? Now, wait a minute, these are people I'm close to I'm worried about and the people that are...that isn't what I came here initially with. I came here with the problem with interacting with people that didn't know me well, and putting up a fa�ade.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I really should go through those people. I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it you're concerned about? If you want to change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's not true, either, because you see, you never develop any deep relationship. You see, here's the problem, if you start a relationship with a lie, it's harder than hell to get back to the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, the problem that confronts me is one of...that I came here with is one of the new people. I run into new people a lot, so therefore, I don't develop a deep relationship, because lies are short-lived, so eventually, they'll do you in. So, I haven't developed any deep relationships because I never get past the first date, honestly. The relationships that I have with people are built on lies, or are so shallow they haven't gotten to the truth/lie state.</p>

<p>[0:50:41.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, is what you're saying, I'm not sure, what you want to do now, is to try to figure out how to do that first stage but do it honestly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's pretty much it. See, the...yeah, if I could just begin to interact with people honestly, just, you know, know myself that that's it, then I think that the depth of other relationships would come. It's almost, I just have to have a complete cleaning out, though, really. I don't think there's going to be any great loss for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by cleaning out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think my contacts with people are just going to have to be...the people I know, everything is built up on lies and pretenses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying. You're saying, "The people I already know, I want to...like, we've built up things on a dishonest level, and I want to change that."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's either that or just to realize that that may be hopeless. I don't think I'll ever have a great relationship, now that I look at it, with Laura and (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just can't. If I were to go to them now, and just talk completely honestly, they would think that that was the dishonesty and that everything in the past was honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They would think that? Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I were to go to them with a new me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They wouldn't believe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, they wouldn't believe it. If they knew I was coming here and having deep discussions about myself, they'd be amazed. They think I only...I think that they think that I don't even look into things like that and it wouldn't bother me. Wouldn't bother me. They think that I probably am as shallow as our relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, what I've mentioned now has been giving me thought, but what...oh, well, at any rate, what I'd like to do is, clean house. To begin relationships honestly, rather...the only honest relationships I think I have are ones that just are forced into honesty by proximity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is a fair indictment against me. I would like to have a relationship that would develop honestly and would be probably be just...if you compared it with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying your tendency is, if it's a new relationship and it's not proximity, to distance? To make it dishonest. And the only way you have an honest relationship is when it also happens to be closed in, living together, things like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it seems to be the case. Yeah, a good example of this is, you know, high school and college. You...there's so many people around you. Well, a high school is several hundred. A college class is what? Four or five hundred. You're rubbing elbows so much that when you eventually do make a deeper relationship the honesty is pretty much there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when you come here, a large university that you can get lost in, the minute a relationship is developed, you can be dishonest, because there is no elbow rubbing. There aren't faces you see again and again. You can walk down the midway and see a set of completely different faces. A completely different set of people, so that...well, no, wait a minute. I think I lied just about as much as they want. As I do here. So, maybe that proximity thing doesn't fit. You know, I think I was pretty much na�ve and immature back then, ill-defined, kind of. Bouncing around from one (inaudible) to another. Of course, that's the whole point here, isn't it, that I know at times I don't know what I am. Well, I'd settle on the image of protecting what you want to see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop.</p>

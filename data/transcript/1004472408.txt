<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Had to get the winter stuff out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's cold right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Officially cold. I'm going to think like I was just here. Oh, sorry. It was a very eventful weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So surprising. What I learned after I left here on Friday that my dad had ... he's been living in Georgia. I guess he was on a bender and flew himself, his sister; my aunt who hasn't really been involved ... she had setup a rehab program in Georgia for him; he just had to show up. Everything was paid for; he just had to get himself there. Um, he went to rehab over the summer for the first time and then I think two weeks later he was drinking again. Um, but she set it for him and he on his bender drove himself instead to the airport and flew back up to Massachusetts and went to detox in Plymouth. It's good that he went to detox. That's better than nothing. But it was the whole going to Massachusetts thing, he's trying to get back to Manomet, which is where we own the property that he lives on with his buddies who he mostly drinks and does drugs with.</p>

<p>[00:02:10]</p>

<p>I think that was what was going on. So it was a little bit like ... I don't know. My reaction to it was just ... I was almost just pissed, I don't know why. My grandfather end of his life was in and out of rehab just twenty something rehabs the last fifteen years of his life. I feel like, "Okay, this is just what we're going to do now. This is just ..." And so, I don't know for some reason my reaction wasn't one of relief or ... it was just kind of like, "Uh." What's the point? So ... you know and I ... well I was like, "I don't want to see him. I don't want my brothers to tell him that I'm up there. I don't want to see him."</p>

<p>[00:03:00]</p>

<p>When he went into rehab over the summer it was a really hard experience. He was ... he couldn't be sedated. They were pumping him full of so many drugs but he has such a high tolerance they couldn't sedate him. He was, you know being physically violent to the staff, he was a danger to himself. You know they had him in the padded room. They took all his shoelaces he was just a mess. And you know it was just one thing everyday that was really emotionally draining for me. And um, then he finally got out and I had this idea that I've never seen him sober before and so I never seen him sober. Never after ... never drying out. Never, you know twenty days sober or anything like that. And so I thought I had all these ideas that when I did see him he would be more like ... even though he was terrible when I was kid there was still something there. He was still charming. He's still ... he was fun. He was crazy. But there was something there that was ... you know was charming, I guess.</p>

<p>[00:04:20]</p>

<p>And I thought, "Well maybe he'll be more like that guy. Maybe I'll see him and he'll be more like that." And I ... after he was done with his treatment ... or not done with his treatment but done with the inpatient portion, I was, I was nervous but kind of excited to see him. So I took a bus up to Massachusetts and my brothers and I went up to the camp he was staying at and he was an asshole. (Chuckle) He was just a total asshole. We, my brothers and I, you know cooked this whole dinner for the whole family. He's sitting on the couch watching TV, watching a South Park movie. Which is fine. He really likes the movies. (Laughter)</p>

<p>[00:05:00]</p>

<p>But I had gotten ... you know he has nothing else to do he has no hobbies. So I got him all these books. He likes history so I got him all these books about World War II and you know and wars that I know he's interested in and brought them up to him and he rolled his eyes at me and said he doesn't read reading is for idiots. So ... (laughter), okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is fine. It was just all these things. We sit down to have this dinner, my two brothers, my dad and I, and my dad takes his plate, marches over to the couch and sits in front of the couch. And so my brothers are kind of ... whatever then. If that's where he wants to be, he's going to be there. And during our meal and we're trying to have a conversation he just keeps turning up the South Park movie louder. (Laughter) trying to drowned us out. It was like, "You got to be kidding me." And it was just this horrible experience of this isn't the drugs, this isn't the alcohol, this is him. This is who he is fundamentally and he isn't capable of being anything else.</p>

<p>[00:06:03]</p>

<p>And it was a really hard realization. Because I could blame it on the drugs and alcohol for my whole life. But ... and I always said things like, he just wasn't capable of being a good dad. He just sort of never has been a dad. And I always said that, but I think deeper down I thought if he had been sober he could have. But I don't think so anymore. And for some reason, even though I've been saying it it's really hard to actually see it. So with him going to detox ... when he started drinking again I just expected it. And then quite a few just like ... why? What are you doing? I don't care. I don't want to be involved. I once called after that, you know he was ... later on that same night he asked me for a thousand dollars. He asked you know he complains that no one was helping him. No one was supporting him. And I said, "I can be your support. And I know I want to be here for you. I care about you and ..." He just went on and on about his mom and his siblings and they support him. I said, "Well you have three kids. We're all here to show you, right now, that we support you and we're proud of the changes you're making."</p>

<p>[00:07:19]</p>

<p>And I called him everyday for the next two weeks without an answer. And then I started calling him twice a week, then just once a week. And I haven't talked to him since that day. And um, I stopped calling eventually and it felt so much better. Every time I called I knew he wouldn't answer, but for some reason it was still upsetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And stopped calling him and it felt great. (Chuckle) And I feel guilty about it, but ... I don't know what else to do. I just ... he doesn't want my support. He wants ... what he wants is to say how no one is supporting him.</p>

<p>[00:08:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He wants to feel like a victim.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But he'll take my brothers calls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry he'll take your brother's?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Calls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of hurts my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, he relates to my brothers more. Uh, well he'll take one ... my brother John's calls. The one who always ... who is just like my dad. Even though he won't say it. But um ... and they lived together in Manomet for a little while. And they would party together. So when my brother moved out of my mom's house when my step-dad came, my brother went to live with my dad and they would party together. So ... and so I think ... in my family it's a lot of, "Your worse off than me." So my grandma and my dad, all their fights are always you're a worse alcoholic than me, you drink more than me, you're worse because of this, this, and this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:09:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (inaudible 00:09:08) that and I think that they're still calling her back, my dad and my brother. So I don't know. I don't know. I just don't really want to talk to him anymore. And I went ... I didn't talk to him for a few years when I was living in California. I would see him at Christmas. That was the one time of year ... I think it was for like three years maybe that I didn't talk to him except for on Christmas I would see him. And it was great for me. It was really good for me to do that. Uh, at least I think it was. I felt great during that time just about my ... I felt better about myself. I mean you know it was probably a combination of things. I was probably living by myself and being completely away ... it was probably a lot of things.</p>

<p>[00:10:05]</p>

<p>But the not talking to him was a very good thing for me. I just have guilt now about doing it because I feel like he probably doesn't have much time left. You know he's had the stroke; he's heavily using drugs and alcohol. He just keeps getting worse and worse. He's about to run out of money and so he keeps saying things to my grandmother and my aunts and uncles like "You don't actually expect me work are you?" Which the thing is he isn't even qualified to work. (Chuckle) His right hand doesn't ... after the stroke he can't use his right hand at all. And he uh ... he hasn't worked in fifteen years. And um, is just kind of a grouch. So I don't who (chuckle) who would hire him, anyway. So, he's doing all that.</p>

<p>[00:11:01]</p>

<p>But outside of that it was my youngest brothers birthday who isn't my dad's son, it's my mom's and my step-dad's son. Just when I went up to (inaudible_00:11:14) on Saturday ... uh, I had talked on Friday about my brother kind of proud of himself (inaudible_00:11:21).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know that when he's stressed he drinks a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your older brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The older one. He's younger than me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. The older of the two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Thomas. Um, and so, I said, you know I talked him on Friday. "You know I'll call you when I get in." Because usually like right when I get in he comes over to my mom's or I go over to his house or something. And I called. I got to my mom's and they were getting ready to go ... they were going to go bowling. Because they both like bowling. And then go and have dinner at my mom's house. So I was texting him a few times, no response. I thought, "You've got, you know, he's hung over, whatever." But then it's one in the afternoon, two in the afternoon. They go bowling without him. It's four in the afternoon; I'm calling him like ... okay, now he's just started drinking again. Because this is how the timeline goes.</p>

<p>[00:12:18]</p>

<p>And I'm not hearing from him. My mom is calling him, he's not answering. My other brother is calling him, he's not answering. We're all texting him. Nothing. So you know we sit down and have dinner, we still don't know. So we have dinner without him and we have presents without him, it's 9:30 at night and we haven't heard from him all day. So, I just get start to get worried. He drinks and drives all the time. He's past out on his front apartment lawn before, wasted. He just does things that make me nervous. That he could have hurt himself. And so I text his girlfriend and she says ... she was at but she had seen him and he was at home and he was sleeping. And to that ... I felt good about that. And I got a chance to talk to her a little bit and let her know that we've had ... she brought up to me that they were breaking up. And I said, "You know we ..." I was happy to let her know that ... they've been together for six years so I let her know that we all understood and supported her and ... because I thought like my mom didn't have that when she left my dad. Not just saying, but I wanted her to know that we understood. She watched my youngest brother all summer. She was really involved with the family. And that was good to kind of ... I felt like I wanted closure with that. I don't know why. (Chuckle) (00:13:37) Just because I think she was such a part of our life. But, um, I know we never heard from him the whole day. And it was really upsetting to me ... you know my mom was upset about it and obviously my brother ... Mmm. He just doesn't ... he had never done that before where he had completely blown off a family function. And um, it was scary because I was scared for his safety at the time but scary because it was just an indicator of how far his drinking has gotten.</p>

<p>[00:14:19]</p>

<p>My bus was yesterday at eleven in the morning and my brother Fred, the eighteen year old, was driving me to the bus and I said, "We have to stop. I have ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fred is your younger brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not your half brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I only have one half brother, the baby, the ten year old.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I said, "You know we have to stop. I can't get on the bus and not go visit, at least see him." I need to just ... because I never heard back from his girlfriend after she said, "I'm going to go home. When I get home from work I'll let you know." I never heard back from her. And that would have been easy. And so we went over to his apartment in the morning before I got on the bus. And she was there and I just stormed into the apartment and he was laying face down in his mattress with all the shades drawn just like our dad.</p>

<p>[00:15:06]</p>

<p>You know our dad goes on these benders and he just wants to be locked in a dark room by himself and drink into oblivion. And it was like looking at my dad. And I um ... he wouldn't even roll over. I said, "Good you're alive." And he just growled at me and I said, I told him I was pissed and I said if I text you and I tell you that I'm scared about your well being you have to text me back. It's not okay. (Crying slightly) And he just growled and I said sorry to his girlfriend for storming in that way because its her home I shouldn't be storming ... (crying) we just left. I just wanted to make sure he was breathing and I could see him and I did. And it was really upsetting. So anyway ...</p>

<p>[00:16:08]</p>

<p>He's just so more far-gone than my dad was at that age and it's depressing. And now I'm worried about the both of them. I go back and forth with all of these things. I don't want to abandon him like my dad (inaudible_00:16:32). And my dad was just alone. I know he felt isolated and lonely. But, I don't want to keep up this relationship where I just kind emotionally take care of him all the time. He's in a really bad place and every time I let me talk to me for an hour and a half I feel like all I'm doing is letting him make excuses. I don't know. And so he texted me yesterday that he was feeling really bad all day, (inaudible_00:17:10) off. And like, you know I just said like, "This is a new low for you. You haven't ever done anything like this. Your spiraling and I love you. It's just too hard to watch." And he, you know classified it as dramatic as he always does. Anything that I say that ... it's always too dramatic. He doesn't know why I'm being so dramatic.</p>

<p>[00:17:32]</p>

<p>And I said, "If the roles were reversed and you and I had plans and all day long I didn't return a single call or text and you had known that I'd been drinking, you would be concerned also. He was like, "You're right. I should have this, that, and another thing." I said, "I think you need to go see somebody. I think you need to get some sort of help." And he just said, "Your anger now is a little much to take." And I just asked him if he would consider going to talk to somebody because he was clearly having a hard time. And he said he would think about it. But I obviously can't make him do it. He just needs to make some sort of change and he needs to be ... he just ... he just going down the exact same path as our dad.</p>

<p>[0018:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems like there's something profound with being like that. He's just carrying on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're aware of your ... like your father repeating what your grandfather did and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And his dad before that. And his mother too. It's just, it's the longest ... you know ... and dad's brothers are ... brother and sister aren't any different. Well they are different. They drink too much but they still manage to have these lives. They ... my brother is really close to my uncle, my dad's brother. And my uncle is a drinker. But he really loves his family. He loves his wife he loves his kids. And so he drinks too much when he's out with his buddies, but he holds it together for his family.</p>

<p>[00:19:10]</p>

<p>And so even though it's clear to me that he has a drinking problem, my brother doesn't see it, which is fine he doesn't. But he ... like thinks ... when they get together they just drink. You know and he thinks like, "Uncle Jimmy is like doing great. He's got all these, you know ..." He's also a trust fund kid, though. So, it's like monopoly money. Yeah he can buy all these buildings and look successful because he still has a 100 thousand dollars a year coming in from the company. So it doesn't matter, you know what he is. He's probably for all we know he could be losing money. But in my brother's eyes he's this great guy who does all these great things and it's like, "How do you not see through this cloud of ...?" I think he has to see it this way. But it's just infuriating.</p>

<p>[00:20:07]</p>

<p>So I just ... we've have gotten to a place after the Thanksgiving thing where things are back to normal and we're talking more regularly and we're in like a better place with our relationship. His ... he himself wasn't much better but our relationship was a little better and now it's just ... I don't even really care about the fact that our relationship isn't in a good place. I just ... I mean I do care about it obviously. If it means him doing something. If means him making a change. I can handle him being mad at me because I'm the only who's going to say something to him. I don't know. I think I was saying to my mom, "I just wish he would, you know like get some sort of help." And she said, "You know if I say it he's never going to listen to me." And it's true. He would never take that from my mom. And he would never listen to my brother and he's certainly not going to listen to now his ex-girlfriend or any of his buddies. His buddies drink way more than he does and ... or maybe not more but as much.</p>

<p>[00:21:22]</p>

<p>They don't ... they all ... why would they want him to get sober? Or not even sober. (Sniffling) I just want him to stop doing this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you like desperately want to get through to him, desperately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. Its kind of one of the main things I'm focused on right now. I plan all these different like ways of being able to get through to him. If I don't talk to him. If I get on his really, really, really, really good side and then I'm very honest with him ... I find a place for him. If I find someone for him to go ... you know it's like I know that I can't do that. I know that I can't do the steps for him. But ...</p>

<p>[00:22:21]</p>

<p>Just the idea of him following the same path of our dad devastates me. He, you know now he's going to have a month off? Him and his girlfriend are about to breakup. They just feel like this is either, this is either the perfect time for him to turn things around or a time when he's just going to ... that spiral is just going to go, go, go.</p>

<p>[00:23:00]</p>

<p>So, I'm pretty worried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Anyway ... (Sigh) I guess I just need to let him figure it out. There's nothing that I can do. But I was once proud myself, my mom and I were cute ... you know my brother likes to get in little digs when he's been drinking about stuff that he's mad about that's happened with my mom. And it is hard. He does a lot to a lot about stuff and we all do about you know, "Why'd you stay with her, dad?" And then when our dad left, "Why did you start dating so quickly, immediately? And then move someone in within a year." You know we have a lot of like, "Why did that happen?" Why did this happen? And for me I just kind of keep it to myself. There's, you know there's no ... nothing is going to be gained by it. It's not going to change. Can't change the past.</p>

<p>[00:24:27]</p>

<p>But he likes to get digs in when he's been drinking. And so she takes it as it's his problem because that's when it happens when he's drinking. And she started to talk about it yesterday morning. She said, "You know I was thinking about it and Caleb didn't move in right away. It was eight months after your dad left, eight months." And what I was thinking was, yeah, he was your third boyfriend and eight months isn't that long for a new guy to move into our house. And even if it is eight months if you see your kids are having a hard time with it, why do let it go? But it just ... he said to her, that I didn't want to talk about it and I didn't really want to there mostly because my step-dad was in the garage and I was leaving for the bus in twenty minutes. And I felt like ... I was proud of myself for the fact that I ... normally I would have said something kind like, "Well mom ..." And I would have said something but I just didn't go there with her. And even though I was crying about it in the moment I do think that it could be something useful ... I think that something does need to be said about the fact that we are still kind of upset about how it all happened. And I think that part of John's anger that he still holds inside is because he feels like our mom choice other men over us constantly.</p>

<p>[00:26:00]</p>

<p>And I feel like he is really. And I'm angry about it. And so I think that does need to maybe said at some point, I guess. But maybe not. I don't know. I can't decide what's really going to be gained by it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that she doesn't really understand how it felt. She thinks that we've got everything we had wanted. We got a family, we got some guy to take care of us. So what would we be mad about? She always likes to say that she deserved to be happy too. And we don't know what she went through. But I don't really think she knows what we went through. It's very different to be a kid in that situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very different to know that you have no control over the circumstances.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I don't think she quite grasped that. And even, you know outside of all that you just don't know what it's like to be a child of divorce and so you can say all you want but how you don't think it's that hard. But it certainly not easy and it's not something that you can relate to. I get very upset when she says that.</p>

<p>[00:27:16]</p>

<p>When she says she doesn't know; we're all complaining. (Laughter) Of course you don't know. You shouldn't know and I don't know what you're complaining about. But I do know that I wouldn't have kept my kids in that situation. I do know that I wouldn't have dragged them into this new situation so quickly. And clearly all have a hard time with it. I think we're all still ... even ten years later ... and that's the thing. It's like it's been ten years. We need to move on. We need to get over it. And I think the thing that ... I keep saying things like, "Just grow up. It was ten years ago. You've got to get over it already." But I do think that maybe I just need to explain her what it is that ... because eight months just isn't a long time in that situation.</p>

<p>[00:28:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like so much a part of who you are to like just desperately want to get through to people and like give them a wakeup call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah, why do I do that? (Chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wake up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But who am I to tell people to ... it's not my ... But I don't know any better than anybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what gives me this authority? Why am I in this position of telling people what I think they need to see? Like why do ... it's not ... maybe I don't know any better than they do. Maybe it's ... it's not my ... Why do I think that that's my job to tell everybody what to do? Or not even what to do, what to like think and ... you know I'm really starting to think it's just like a superiority complex. I think, "Get off your high horse." Sometimes I just think that I'm like running around telling everybody like, you are an idiot because you drink too much. You're an idiot because you ... I don't' actually think their idiots. But like this is the problem here. This is the problem here. This is problem here. And it's like, "That's not my job."</p>

<p>[00:29:34]</p>

<p>And maybe I don't know any better than anybody else. But it is ... I mean outside of that it is something that I do feel all the time. Why isn't anybody ...? Why are you seeing this? Why aren't you seeing this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel really mixed about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you feel like, like who else is going to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you feel sort of guilty for feeling like, "Oh, are you (inaudible_00:30:15) people for seeing things or for telling people how they should be."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That's exactly how I feel. I always ... but at the time ... and then I go back and then I'm like, "But you're not the only one that thinks that." So like with my brother it's like, it's not just me, it's my whole family. It's his girlfriend. It's you know my husband, everybody else in the situation sees those things too. It's like I have to justify it. It's like, "Okay well if everybody else thinks it too, then it has to be ... it's not just me. Has to be true." No one else is going to do it. I'm going to do it. Like I can't let this keep going on.</p>

<p>[00:31:08]</p>

<p>You know and the stuff with my mom. It's like it took me a while to get there to realize why I had all these like ... the thing with my mom is harder because when she first got to together with Caleb, I was really excited about them getting together. But I was acting out, really acting out. I was in a really bad place. I didn't understand why and it's taken me a few years. And as Caleb acts more and more like an asshole I get kind of ... but to them I'm like, "Okay, but it's not just me, it's also my brother, my other brother ..." You know like a lot of other people are seeing the same thing too, but that has to be right too. And like, you know it's not okay if just I think it.</p>

<p>[00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes that not okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cause ... I don't know. I've never really felt like my voice was very valid, I guess. I don't think I've ever really had a lot of self-esteem or a lot of confidence, so. Maybe that's where that probably comes from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that a confident person would probably be just assured that what they're feeling was pretty right on. But I think that, you know just didn't grow up feeling that way. So I think that I question a lot of my feelings. I do question a lot of my feelings. (Chuckle) Qualify them a lot. You know (inaudible_00:32:59) fit in.</p>

<p>[00:33:00]</p>

<p>[Sniffling) Which I would really like to work on. (Chuckle) So I don't know. I also really resent the role of being the 'One'. And it's always, you know it's always subtle things. Katie, John's girlfriend saying to me, "You're the only one he talks to." My mom saying, "He's not going to listen to me. You're the only one he's going to listen to." My other brother and sister talking about our parents saying if you don't say it, no one else is going to say it. And even though I know that, you know it is beneficial sometimes, they kind of resent that role. I'm getting to a place where I say, "Can't somebody else just do it? I don't ..." I'm getting very frustrated with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also not willing to just not let anybody say anything. You know my mom's now ignoring my brother? She's just not talking to him. And my brother Fred ... John will apologize to Fred and Fred will say, "It's alright, man. Like don't worry about it."</p>

<p>[00:34:24]</p>

<p>And maybe I should just say, "It's all right, man. Don't worry about it." But then I just get too scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scared that what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he would just go ... that we all validate that it is okay and that that gives him permission to keep going with this behavior. And to keep spiraling out of control. I feel like, "No it's not okay. It's not okay that this is getting worse. It's not okay that you did this."</p>

<p>[00:35:16]</p>

<p>(Slight crying) But that doesn't really seem to work either. It just ... you know then we don't really talk much for a couple of weeks. I guess at the end of the day he knows how I'm feeling. And that's what I gain from it. I guess, you know I can be ... I can say I'm being honest with my family, for the most part. And that's something that I value. So when it doesn't happen in my family there's not a lot of honesty, there's a lot of talking behind closed doors and nobody saying things to each other's faces. I guess I can say that things that I am thinking and feeling I'm saying to you, you're going to know it.</p>

<p>[00:36:09]</p>

<p>Whether, I guess, whether or not they're totally right, it's how I feel. I guess I need to stop being so concerned with whether or not it's true. Well I should be concerned with that, but whether or not everybody else thinks it true. Because that is usually what bothers me my feeling that everybody ... like apparently my grandmother's boyfriend of twenty years has cancer and she won't say the word cancer. I just found out. And nobody knows how he's being treated. He was diagnosed over the summer. I just found out last week. Because nobody talks about anything and it drives me up a wall. And I am the opposite person. I tell everybody everything. (Chuckle)</p>

<p>[00:37:04]</p>

<p>So I guess it's not necessarily a bad thing. I just don't know how to help him. (Sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it seems like you feel there's got to be a way if you only figure it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know there's a way. (Laughter) I if I just keep obsessing over it. And then I feel like, like if I was there. It is hard for me to in these situations to be really removed. Like it is frustrating. If I was just there. If you could just come over to my house. If you could just spend time with me. If I could watch him. Which is ridiculous because he is a grown man. (Laughter)</p>

<p>[00:38:00]</p>

<p>I don't know. Maybe I need to detach a little bit from him. He and I had a really hard ... we went through a really hard phase where we didn't talk. He grew up with my dad. Like at the age of ... he remembers like at the age 8, dad being like, "(inaudible_00:38:20) a little bitch. We got to get her." And saying things like that to him. And we were pinned against each other a lot. We went through years where we hated ... I mean were vicious. We would hit each other with bats and do terrible things to each other. And we came out the other end of it. But I think because we went through that phase of hating each other, now we really cling to each other. And so I think that ... but I don't think that's necessarily the best thing all the time. I think sometimes we rely on each other too much. So I think maybe I do need to take a step back. I don't need to be talking to him everyday. I don't need to be talking to him, you know?</p>

<p>[00:39:03]</p>

<p>Maybe I do allow him to ... I don't know. I think I allow him to validate or I validate his choices a lot. I don't ... Even ... if they're usually not even about drinking. It's usually like ... I don't know what it is. Anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Hopefully he changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My other brother and I ... (Chuckle) had a lot of fun together though. So that's nice. Fred is six years younger than me. So growing up he was always so much younger. He was such a baby. But he and I are much more similar. You know our, um, I don't know. He's eighteen now so all of a sudden he's had all these adult opinions and feelings and it's been very interesting to see him kind of grow up and he ... the kid I really enjoy spending time with. We like the same music and we like go out to the same movies and books and things like. So it's been fun spending time with him and getting to know him on more of an adult level.</p>

<p>[00:40:37]</p>

<p>And really it makes me feel like I'm not dealing with this John thing totally on my own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know that he gets frustrated too. The two of them spend a lot of time together. Fred doesn't drink. I think now that he's in college he'll have a beer at a party or something like that. But he hates getting drunk. And so ... and I know that really bothers John. (Chuckle) He'll say like, "I just don't understand." Well I guess you don't have to understand why he doesn't. I kind of ... I understand. I don't' relate. I like get into trouble. (Laughter) I understand why he wouldn't. It's really scary for him. Anyway. (Sigh) It's kind of all I've got.</p>

<p>[00:41:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel tired?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm exhausted. Very tired. Tim and I fell asleep at like ten o'clock last night and slept till seven. It was great. But I feel very emotionally exhausted. I feel like I could sleep forever. I feel that all the time. I actually just realized, I haven't been eating meat; this is totally separate. (Laughter) I haven't been eating meat since this summer. Because I was just reading all this stuff about whatever. And uh, and then I was talking to my girlfriend whose son is anemic and they wanted him to take iron pills and she was talking about supplementing with red meat. I realized that I have been ... my doctor told me I was anemic last year and then I stopped eating meat and like wasn't being very conscious about my intake of iron. (Chuckle) I don't take the iron pills because they freak me out.</p>

<p>[00:42:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What freaks you out about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm paranoid psycho. So I read that if you take too much iron it can kill you. I was like, "Okay. The negative side effects of me not having enough iron are me being tired, you know the dizziness and the whatever." Which I don't like. But the negative side is me having too much iron is me dying. (Laughter) I'm not taking the iron. I'll just eat a lot of spinach and I'll ... and then I totally forgot about the anemia and just stopped eating meat. But so when I was talking to my friend I said, "Oh yeah I should start being more conscious of my ..." Because I was getting really dizzy. And like I would have to put the baby down because I felt like I was going to faint if I ... so I wasn't being very conscious about taking care of myself. I really would like to go to the doctor and get tested again. But I don't have insurance.</p>

<p>[00:43:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ever find out more about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're driving me up a wall. I e-mailed them last week and she said they're still processing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. This is with the ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is with (inaudible_00:43:52)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. This is through the state.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Why can't you get on your husband's insurance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my husband is lazy and forgetful. He ... I keep asking him to do it, then he goes out of town or he goes ... you know now he has finals. So, I should remind him again, but. I keep reminding him and he says, "I'll do it first thing in the morning." And then he doesn't. And then I remind him again a few days later and then he doesn't. I guess I could just call.</p>

<p>[00:44:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's what I should do today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He may have to do something to get you on the policy. But you can find out what needs to be done</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, exactly. So yeah we need to take care of that. We have a lot of things that we need to take care of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like you're ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: We put a lot of stuff on the back burner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your health is pretty important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you want to talk about ... because I know ... well actually the Monday after Christmas is a holiday.</p>

<p>[00:45:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm taking that off. But the Monday after New years I'm going to be here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh that's great. I'll be here too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Great. And I don't ... if you'd like that week the 26th, I'm happy to see if we can find another time to meet. Are you going to be around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll be around later in the week on Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I ... You know I should have something later that week so we ... I can even e-mail you some options.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be great, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Great. But next week we're good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. (Yawn)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I had sent you my e-mail address?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, you did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I just wanted to let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. You're very good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. I'll see you then.</p>

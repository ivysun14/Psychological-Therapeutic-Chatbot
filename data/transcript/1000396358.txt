<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence, occasional sniffing) I'm finding it hard to start
and I guess it's because I, I feel I don't want to.  Well, it might be that
and it might be — the thing that occurred to me first is, uhm, something
that I haven't wanted to think about, and something else just occurred to
me about it now.  Uhm, (sigh) I, I'm just wondering at the timing of it,
because it, it's uh regarding MSCZ and my making love last night.  And,
uhm, I guess before I just didn't want to think about it.  But then, I
don't know, I, I wondered just now, I guess, if I didn't time it so it
happened the night before I started coming back to you as sort of a "I
don't need you" kind of thing, or something like that.</p>

<p>I thought of it differently at the time because it was more that one
or two nights had gone by where MSCZ had, uhm, kind of indirectly,
indicated he wanted to make love and I hadn't responded to it, and, so, but
he hadn't asked directly.  And, uhm, it, it was typical of many times
where, after several nights of that, I would finally decide, well I really
couldn't, in effect, refuse him again.  Or, uhm — (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, but there, well, there was something that was bothering
me at the time.  And then, today there was something else that bothered me
about thinking about it, that hadn't so much bothered me at the time.  But
at the time I think I was being bothered by, uhm, well, just the whole
thing of my becoming involved or not and my deciding whether I was going to
be involved or not, so that even if I became involved, it still wasn't,
really.  Or, I don't know, it was — in a way it seemed like it was almost
the same as deciding not to be and, uhm, that it didn't seem to involve
feeling differently about MSCZ, really.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You're being obscure about it.  What happened? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that's part of what I don't want to think about, I guess, tod—,
that I found I didn't want to think about today, because (sigh) uhm, I
don't know, since, I guess, since I decided already that if he wanted to
make love last night I would, it happened differently than sometimes.  In
fact, it hasn't happened this way for a long time.  It w—, I mean, I don't
know, it seems the best way to describe it is, it was more leisurely, and,
uhm, MSCZ wanted to — well, I mean, here I am putting it that it was all
his responsibility of what he wanted to do, too.</p>

<p>But, uhm, (sigh) he, we were just lying there, nude, sort of looking
at each other and, uhm, caressing each other and, I think I was lying there
thinking, I want him to do whatever will arouse me and also thinking, do I
want to be aroused, am I going to make that type of decision.  Uhm, but
feeling very uninvolved with him.  And, I, I don't know, it just seemed
like it went on for a long time that way.  And, uhm, (sigh) and then
eventually he wanted me to get on top this time, which sometimes he doesn't
want to do, because I guess he figured that's the way I prefer it, and if
there was any chance of my having an orgasm he wanted it that way.  But he
didn't want me to masturbate at all before he came inside.  And, I don't
know, my attitude was I didn't want to have what kind of an orgasm I have
if I masturbate, because I know it upsets him, and anyway it's not a good
solution.  At least it doesn't seem to be because it does sort of, it's just a continuation of kind of leaving him out of the whole thing in a way. 
Or, I don't know, it's, I mean he's there but —</p>

<p>But anyway, so, uhm, when I put him inside, then nothing happened.  I,
it was like cutting, well again, cutting off my feeling, feeling any
response or — well it wasn't exactly — seems like I might have for a
while and then, and he was kind of passive.  But then he became more and
more, (sigh) uhm, doing things, eh moving and being, I don't know, sort of
active on his own, not just letting me do what I wanted.  And, uhm, that
was when my feeling changed, when he stopped being passive and, I don't
know, was taking a lead or being more aggressive or, I don't know how to
describe it exactly, but, and it just seems like it's part of, (sigh) well,
my not responding to him, and being unable to.</p>

<p>The part I didn't want to think about today, though, was lying there,
(sigh) nude, looking at each other —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Wh, — </p>

<p>PATIENT:  — and sort of caressing each other.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why not?  What, what uh, what specifically do you want to not think
about? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, pause) Well, I don't know, it just seems like I feel too
vulnerable when I think about it, because being nude and, and, more than
that, lying in such an open way, uhm not holding MSCZ tightly to me which I
know sometimes I feel is the only way I can do it, it just seemed like I
was more vulnerable to, well, I'm not sure.  (Pause, sigh) Well all I can
think of is the feeling of, even when I was lying there nude, I had to make
myself relax enough so I didn't sort of keep my legs tightly close
together.  And, so I suppose it's the combination of MSCZ's handling my
genitals or looking at them or, I don't know, just having them exposed, I
guess.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, in, uhm, I just was remembering that, when it turned out —
because MSCZ certainly took the initiative on starting making love in this
way, uhm, I thought he might have something in mind, which maybe he did,
but he realized he couldn't ask me to do it.  And I was afraid he was going
to ask me and I, well, I, I just had a very strong reaction against it,
which might mean in a way I really would like to try it, I don't know.  But
anyway it's something that was on my mind at the time and that is, uhm,
he's always wanted me to have, put his penis in my mouth while he — I
don't know the term — but anyway uh masturbates me with his tongue.  And,
that's something I've just never been able to, uhm, stand thinking about,
you know.  I suppose I am curious but, it seems like just lying there
looking at each other we came close to that, and I don't know whether
that's why that bothers me.  But I wasn't really looking at him either.  He
was looking at me, but, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What you — </p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting) And I felt very hard.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   — Yeah, what were you really not looking at? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I suppose his penis but, uhm, but then it seems to sort of take
on being very hard and, and blocking MSCZ out completely almost.  (Pause,
sigh) Well, I mean, I suppose it's his penis in a way but it seems like
it's more an angry feeling now than, that I guess his penis would remind me
of.</p>

<p>(5-minute silence) (sigh) I don't know, after thinking that about
feeling angry at MSCZ, I, I, I don't even know exactly what I've been
thinking except I don't think it's been very important.  I know I thought
about, uhm, a meeting that the block association is finally having tonight
which they originally had planned last week.  And, uhm, I don't know, some
things I'd been doing at home and that FSO's had to keep out of, and, I, I
don't know, just a variety of things like that, that —</p>

<p>Oh, and something else just occurred to me that, because I was fi,
finding I, I mean I remember parts of last week, but uhm, (sigh) I just now
remembered that on Friday I'd been feeling awful and, uhm, feeling that I
was doing it to myself.  And it just occurred to me, because, uhm, one of
the things I was thinking about, I guess too, was the ushers changing at
our place on Saturday and, uhm, my having cleaned on Friday and then the
place was really a wreck by the time they left on Saturday.  And there was
food all over the place because we had a brunch and there was stuff spilled
and so forth.</p>

<p>And, but the thing I'm really thinking of is that I got through the
wedding but during the reception I began to feel — I'd felt sort of the
same way, a little bit better I guess, on Saturday morning and then,
through the reception, I began to really feel terrible.  And finally when
we came home that evening, I had a fever and was, at that point, going
through, I suppose, feeling very cold and then later I went through feeling
very hot.  But uhm, I wasn't able to go to the ballet that night, which is
what I was thinking I wanted to.  And then i, it turned out probably — I
don't know whether we could have anyway.  But FYR, who was trying to get
tickets, called up the person who was trying to get them and told them just
to try to get one for MSCZ, and he did go.</p>

<p>And I think I enjoyed being home alone and feeling very much MSCZ must
be concerned, which he was.  And I don't really know whether I was really
— I mean I did have a fever for a while but by Sunday it was gone.  At
least I felt better.  I didn't feel like I had a fever.  And I didn't feel
great on Sunday but I felt alright and then by Monday I was fine.  And,
well I don't know, I guess I'm still suspicious that somehow I did it to
myself.</p>

<p>Well, Sunday we had, we had originally planned to get together with
MSCZ's parents and then we weren't able to do what we'd planned, and so we
went out to his parents' house for dinner.  And, uhm, (sigh) I mean that
was another one of the things I was feeling, I can't be sick because this is something that we have to do.  And, so even though it occurred to both
of us that I didn't have to go — I could have stayed home — I did go. 
And yet I think I felt like a martyr, going, and felt MSCZ had to
appreciate my going and of course he didn't, because — I mean I didn't
get, get into such a big thing because I was kind of aware of it, but, uhm,
my attitude was feeling put upon, I think, and that I was sick, still. 
(Silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, and then I, I began to think about when, on Monday morning, one
of the things I did was to go to SY's to get some wallpaper and it turned
out they were having a sale, which I hadn't known.  And I don't think I
would have gone if I had, because it just is too confusing.  I mean, and
they were having a sale specifically on wallpaper.  And, uhm, but anyway
FSO had been very good going, but when we got there and it was so filled
with people and confusing and there was nobody to wait on you, uhm, FSO,
after a while began to get, she was just getting tired anyway, I suppose. 
And, uhm, there just seemed to be problems mounting up.  And I got really
mad at her at one point because I was frustrated over not being able to get
done quickly what I'd wanted to do.  And it was the usual kind of scene at,
at a SY's sale.</p>

<p>And, uhm, and then I was just thinking today of something FTPZ said
about, well, she was talking about punishing MVE recently and then his
having had quite a reaction to the punishment.  I don't think she did very
much.  I'm sure I hit FSO more, harder than she hit MVE.  But it was
something to do with spanking his hand when he'd done something.  And then
he woke up very early in the morning the next morning screaming, and he
wanted to go to wherever, I guess it was in his high chair.  And, uhm, he
was clearly thinking about what had happened.  And she said something about
she didn't want to teach him anything through fear, or that, uhm, well
something about fear.  And, and then I guess now I was just thinking about
either something I've read or something MSCZ and I have talked about and
how much the element of fear is important (stomach rumble) or isn't good in
bringing up a child.  And I, I think whatever it was that we were talking
about or I'd read had to do with the fact there should be some fear. 
(Pause, stomach rumble, sigh)</p>

<p>Because then the next thing I think about is FTPZ changing MVE's
diapers and the fact he's different because he has a penis.  And, uhm, I
don't know, thinking about it as if it would make changing diapers very
different and wondering how she can do it, I guess.  I suppose maybe
because she has to look at it, I don't know.  (Pause, stomach rumble)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So you come back indirectly to where you left off with MSCZ, when
you first fell silent. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Yeah, well, I think when I think about the diapers too, which I
suppose, my feeling mad at MSCZ is essentially the same thing.  I mean, I
know it is because I've talked about it before, but I hadn't thought of it
that, quite that way earlier.  But when I was thinking about FTPZ's
changing MVE's diapers, too, it seems to me if I carry on imagining it then
I imagine that what must be hard for her is the temptation to, well,emasculate him.  And I think I think of it more as sort of rubbing out his
penis — it's a small thing then — and, uhm, not cutting it off so much as
just sort of rubbing it away or, anyway, taking it away from him, getting
rid of it.  (Stomach rumble) And I suppose this angry feeling at MSCZ is,
well, it's sort of like getting rid of him, period, and, because he has a
penis.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Sniff) How, w,w, what, uhm, do you mean when you say rub out MVE's
penis?  H, how?  What concretely were you thinking of? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I guess I was thinking of — because when sometimes I change FSO,
uhm, I use just a little baby lotion to, I suppose, counteract any urine
that's staying on her body, and so I'm wiping it off.  I try to wipe it off
well, because I don't know how good it is I use it at all.  And, uhm, so I
think I was thinking of FTPZ doing that, which she does.  I know she uses
it after he's had a bowel movement, so that could be then anyway, or just
anyway associating cleaning off his bottom when he's needing to have his
pa—, uh diapers changed.  And, I don't know, somehow when doing that just
— or even just sort of taking it and pulling it off.  Or, uhm, and I don't
know, it just seems like for a baby or even MVE now — he's ha—, I mean,
he's a little boy now, I guess — but, when, when they're so little and
their penises are so little, it just seems like it would be so easy just to
get, take it off.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence, occasional stomach rumbles) Now I, I don't know if
I thought something before this but I'm, I'm clearly again getting off,
because I was just thinking of something else that occurred to me today,
uhm, because this is the last time I'll see FHA BBJ's mother before the
fall.  And by the time I see her again I guess I'll be working, so we were
sort of vaguely talking about anything we might try to do next year.  And,
uhm, (stomach rumble) I'm trying to think what I was specifically thinking
of, but anyway it was just sort of wondering, I guess, how things will work
out.</p>

<p>And, and then I started thinking about the little girl in our
building, not the one I've mentioned before, but one who's older than FSO,
whose mother had indicated interest in getting the two together.  And it
happened once on a very bad time for me because we were getting ready to go
to PTN.  And we were leaving early I think or, uhm, anyway she called late
in the morning and, and indicated she wanted them to get together right
away if it were possible.  And then her, she had her baby(c)sitter bring up
her daughter and the baby(c)sitter stayed.  But, uhm, I guess I was just
thinking of the fact I haven't done anything about getting them together
again.  And that now they've probably gone away for the summer.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and I guess uh, because I was thinking of the fact I'd gotten
off things again and what w—, I was thinking (sigh) when I veered off
again.  It wasn't (sigh), uhm, so hard to think about something like
emasculating MVE as it was the, the feeling of probably, in effect, wanting to emasculate MSCZ.  But the way to do it, the way I was thinking
particularly right now was by killing him.  It's as if there were no, be no other way.</p>

<p>And then again I think of joan tunney and then that, I guess that led
me to think about, uhm, joan tunney's brother who recently — the paper
carried some small article about he and his wife either separating or
getting divorced, I can't remember.  And, uhm, then there was an article in
yesterday's paper that I hadn't come across until this morning.  I was just
leafing through it before I threw it out.  And, uhm, there was an article
on different wives of politicians and, of course, martha mitchell comes to
my mind too.  And, uhm, I don't know, I, even then I was thinking that I
had more of an interest in the whole thing, I mean, wives of politicians —
I didn't finish it I guess — who were separated or divorced from their
husbands.  And the article was on, because of the life being a politician
requires.  But, uhm, I was interested, I guess, because I was wondering how
these women, what they were and how they readjusted or what had happened
and, uhm, feeling very much, I think, when I read it I — or else I wanted
to feel it — either I was looking for it or else I seem to take everything
to mean this — that they were all emasculating kind of women.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So were you thinking of killing MSCZ, last night? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, not last night directly, but I think by, uhm — instead I was, I
don't know, I mean, I knew he was there, but I was somehow blocking him out
of my mind, which seems to be a way of killing him, I suppose.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well I don't, I don't know how I made this jump but, uhm, (sniff) I
started thinking about, uhm, I th, think first, borrowing — well I guess I
thought back to w, when I was getting the wallpaper and FSO was so terrible
and I understood that part of it was just because she was tired and it was
a very confusing place.  And then I, I guess I started thinking about
wishing that I had borrowed a little fold-up stroller that the BFM's have. 
And then that led me to think I wondered if they were taking it with them
this summer.  They're going away this Friday.  And, uhm, if they weren't —
whether or not — I was thinking o, of whether or not I wanted to even ask
FNI if I could borrow it because there are a number of things I want to do,
although I don't think stores will be as bad again and, well FSO was tired
after Sunday, which is often true, so that (sigh) it was a bad time to have
gone.</p>

<p>But anyway I was toying with that idea and then it, then I just
started thinking about uhm, that I hung some of the wallpaper yesterday and
FNI came over to help me because I've, never have done it before.  And so
she was essentially showing me how and helped me in one place where it was
particularly awkward.  But I think I left off — I mean I, maybe I'm
creating this (analyst sniff) now but, given what I was thinking before —
but I think I left off thinking of cutting the wallpaper where it has to be
trimmed and I haven't done it yet.</p>

<p>And yesterday, uhm, she came to do it, uhm, very late yesterday
afternoon, because that was the only time she could come.  And I had to get
ready to go out by 6:00 last night, so that it was very tight and we were
in a hurry.  And then the first one we put didn't — I guess we didn't soak
it long enough or — anyway, it didn't seem to stick as well and then the others stuck better.  But I th—, all the time we were out last night I
kept worrying about it falling down.  And I was sure when we got home it
would all have fallen down.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and then I think of, uhm, a place, well, a place that FNI had —
she was doing some of the cutting first, to show me.  And, uhm, uh to get a
piece up, some cutting had to be done immediately while it was wet and
almost hanging free, so that it was very difficult to do that.  And she cut
wrong in one place and we patched it up and it looks ok.  It isn't as good
as I'd like.  And then she had talked about another place, using tape or
something because she said it would be so hard to get the wallpaper in
there.  And so I was thinking of that and thinking I could cover up where
it was cut improperly.  But then I began really just thinking about how
hard it would be to cut a strip of wallpaper to go in the place that needs
it, and that FNI thought would be too difficult, and, I don't know, then,
that we'd used something that MSCZ thought would do yesterday for cutting,
but it wasn't — the blade kept wobbling — so I bought something else
today, and just thinking about that.  I mean, it's this, uhm, I guess — I
don't know exactly what you call them — anyway, one-edged razor, only it
has a — it isn't quite what I'd wanted to get.  It, it's similar to what I
had except it seems to be a little bit firmer.  And, uhm, (analyst sniff) I
don't know, it just seems like I want to think about cutting things other
than MSCZ's (chuckle) penis.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, you started this all by saying you didn't really
want to think about what happened between you and him last night.  And, and
you made the point that what really troubled you was feeling that you're
lying there and you had to keep your legs together and you couldn't look at
him.  You didn't want to and you were angry with him.  And it all seems to
add up to what, again, what would equalize you would be if you could cut
off his penis and he would look like you.  And then you would be equal. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) Yeah, uh uhm, something else just occurred to me that I don't
know if I've ever th—, really thought before.  But I suppose eh having
these feelings of what I'd like to do to him — I mean, I've sometimes
wondered why I have such a strong reaction to his touching me or not
keeping my legs close together and things like that and eh feeling so
vulnerable and, uhm, I suppose it's because I'm, because I'm so busy
thinking of, or not thinking, but that it's really on my mind, what I'd
like to do to him.  I must sus, suppose he has equally hurtful ideas toward
me, or he would if he knew what I was thinking.  I mean, it couldn't be
equal, but somehow I had this feeling he w—, might hurt me, somehow.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, what came to my mind, because I've always hated his putting his
finger in my vagina, is hurt me the way the stick hurt me.  Or, I don't
know, I guess it's part of the added, uh, mm it's almost like I'm thinking,
to make a new hole in me which would hurt, since there shouldn't be one
there, or uhm, (sigh) it's al—, well, it's as if — I know I thought this
once before, I don't, but I think of it more "as if", now, than directly
thinking it, but of — uhm, feeling that my vagina is, I don't know, sort of punishment anyway for, I guess it would be ideas I have about trying to
get a penis.  (Pause, sigh)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Sniff) Well, our time's up.</p>

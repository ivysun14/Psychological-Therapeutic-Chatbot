<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hi recorder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so what is new, if anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh wait, you have the recorder on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I already told him about the vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Last time?  Oh, on the phone.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When did I talk to you about her, on the phone, yes.  So, that, that was, um, anything, do anything like that since?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We chatted about it.  We chatted why I was mad and why she had no right to get mad at me back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're going to have to do this more often.  No, actually there are times you've been this quiet, but not, not like [INAUDIBLE] I think.  You've never been this quiet before when you're in a talking mood.  And your [INAUDIBLE] 652 up and downs per minute.  So, anyway.  Um, all right.  So basically you kind of processed on that thing with the vacuum.  Two Cs or two Us.  Two Cs right, vacuum, V A C C U M or V A C U U M.  No, V A C C U M.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's two Us.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I would have said two Ms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because we were, I was talking [INAUDIBLE] and we kept on just spelling it, so we just about—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have no clue.  Two Cs I would say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two Cs probably.  It looks better.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you suppose somebody going to be listening [INAUDIBLE] what the?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  Well, [INAUDIBLE] and you know what good because at least it's not like a regular boring session [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, her be boring.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I mean you're very smart and you're very good, but I don't think even you could fake being boring.  That would just be too hard given who you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hold on.  Stop banging.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My baby girl right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what happens when they do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You bang back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These guys kill themselves.  They jump off the wall.  I had to stick them down with sticky stuff, some of them.  Anyway, never mind.  Remember when no chairs were on this wall for a while.  [INAUDIBLE] that thing weighs like 70 pounds, [NAME OTHER] walks up there, I worry about him, he would kill me.  It's his pitching arm that like could hit me right there and that would be the end.  Thank you.  You must be here now.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  It's nice.  I don't have to act, um, oh, I can act normal for like a brief 15 minutes.  I don't have to like necessarily be on my best behavior, you know, like I sometimes am.  Do you believe that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to say [INAUDIBLE] that would have been so wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, but I'm never on my best behavior, so forget it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My wife.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She came in my office about a year ago.  She looked around and you know what she said, you're never retiring because not one piece of this blank is coming in the house.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I said okay.  All right, anyway, your mood's been okay the last month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have 4 [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll have to see when I retire.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if grandma doesn't want those eggs that she has, I'm keeping them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She doesn't remember what she has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you take them now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She already did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only took 2, 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did I tell you about what I have, the newest egg that I have?  An ostridge egg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know you can eat those?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I did for a lot of days.  It was freaking huge.  Did you ever see them?  I mean they're like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two dozen, it's the equivalent of 2 dozen eggs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Packed it, stuffed it in a suitcase, took it on the plane.  So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Don't do it, [PATIENT NAME].  Don't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why are you wearing a glove and goggles?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She loves the gloves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are those goggles, no?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's an Anime symbol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her name is Mist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	M I S S.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	T.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, Mist.  Oh, you write on your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've never seen you, have I seen you, I don't think you wear headbands, do you?  No.  You have a nice head for a headband.  It's like kind of round and symmetrical.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never mind.  I don't even want to know where you were going.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, let's not go there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We had to talk about them earlier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seeing how long I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There we go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're serious here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, they're too big for your age.  They're, you, they're you.  I mean you're you and whatever you have is what you are.  I mean it's not like, I mean what are you measuring yourself against, um, I mean how do you measure yourself against—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All my girlfriends are fat, they make fun of me for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, oh, well I don't know, some people develop earlier than others and people never get very big.  You know, people do it just different, you know.  I mean okay, but I was not talking about them.  I was talking using the singular.  I'm talking about your headband and your head.  So, now if you want to know if your head is big for your age, your brain it's like it's, your head is barely big enough to contain your gigantic all powerful thinking brain with all that intelligence in there that you only sometimes choose to use, right, or you can't figure out how to get past certain things that would enable you to use it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is a far stretch to get this topic onto something useful, but I mean you happen to be very smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, but, uh, last year's bunch of, um, teachers wouldn't necessarily be able to know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some of them perhaps, but some of them would not.  I mean I don't, maybe they do, but I would think mostly it would be hard for someone to tell.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who was the prickiest teacher you had?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I don't know.  I had a 6th grade teacher who was nasty, screamed all the time.  We used to call her [INAUDIBLE].  I mean literally she was mean, screamed.  One time I was feeling very sick and it's like here's the nurse's office and then here's kindergarten and then here's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th grade all this long corridor, 3 of each grade and then right here is the bathroom men's and women's, and I told her I was sick, I wanted to go to the nurse.  She said no, go to the bathroom first, and I said well I don't, you know, she was yelling at me.  So I walked out of the door and I turned right and walked past our lockers and I threw up in my hands and I turned around and I walked back.  I said maybe I should go to the bathroom first.  So I walked back past the lockers right in front of the door, I looked at her, I looked at [INAUDIBLE] and I threw up all in the doorway.  She came running out screaming and yelling at me.  It was pretty funny, but I mean she just, it was like she went berserk.  I told you [INAUDIBLE].  So that, she was probably, um, boy did I aggravate her good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You pissed her off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I did.  Well she was pissed off anyway.  So, you know, I think perhaps—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I might have contributed to, to what.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I came up with a new name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For that part of why.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Later.  Write it down.  Don't tell anybody.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not, it's not bad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a cute name.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bedonkadunk.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Fine, whatever, be quiet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good.  You're going to have seconds.  That was good.  So, but I felt very accomplished because perhaps I shortened her life by a minute or two by aggravating her extra.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know if you eat broccoli, you live longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You live longer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You like live longer by 12 seconds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For each piece of broccoli?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How big of a piece?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just one little piece.  That's why I don't eat it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Hmm.  Okay, 12 seconds longer than what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Than when you die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you live 12 seconds longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So when I die I can think back and said oh, I would have died 1,200 seconds ago, but I had, uh, 100 pieces of broccoli.  Okay, anyway.  All right, I digress.  How's your, any new or worse depression or anxiety?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Don't.  I've been feeling a little bit pissed, and a little bit angry and I've been waking up in my sleep crying because I keep on having these dreams [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, have you talked about them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't tell her I woke up crying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you told her about the dreams?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Didn't tell her what, didn't tell her what they were about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Um, did it make you feel less angry when you talked about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean that may be, that may not be necessarily a bad sign.  It may be good, but you're kind of, you know when you're even more upset or angry and what's causing it perhaps or what's triggering it and you can talk about it.  Um, so what's really important is garra.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Garra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  You know your name?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Garra?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's something different than Garra.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so anyway, so it's not worse per se, but and the anxiety, agitated, restless, panic, um, from sleeping worse.  Yeah because of this, the waking up with the dreams?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, falling asleep's okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Usually, yeah, it's just getting her to stay asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  No worse irritability, aggressive, angry, violent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Anger a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little bit.  Um, you did, you said that already.  So, related to the dreams or not always?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think it's because it's a lack of sleep and, you know, she's getting irritable because she's not sleeping well, and I mean you know how it gets when your—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're sleep deprived, you're just pissy, but no amount of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And since I'm normally pissy, it's like 2 times worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, acting on dangerous impulses, extreme increase in activity, talking more than usual, changes in mood or behavior?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well see I'm talking unusual.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bedongadunk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a funny name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Suicidal thoughts, actions [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was bleeding there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, keep an eye out for these things.  Tell me if you see any of them, [INAUDIBLE] and what are we going to do about the sleep.  I mean it sounds like the, the depression and stuff is, you know, sometimes it gets a little more, sometimes a little less.  It's still there overall.  Um, you know, I'm glad to see, you know, you can kind of get past it for periods of time and be kind of goofy like you normally are when you're in an okay mood where someone brings out the best in you.  Or just don't, don't laugh.  Um, all right, now my, I mean, at this point, we are, you're just doing 1 Clonidine, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I mean do you want to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, we need—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need Clonidine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we need some—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Strattera.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Of those too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, Strattera.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I wrote it down on the, on the little yellow sticky I gave you last week or last time.  Do you remember that yellow sticky I gave you?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I remember it, but I don't know what I, I don't think, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, a hippo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I think I wrote, well this is what I wrote, which was, I wrote that I gave you Abilify.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you had a little, a little over a month maybe of Clonidine.  You had 3 months of Paxil and the Strattera I gave you some samples.  So I think you may need the Clonidine soon.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right and then the Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Strattera.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's right.  Okay, so how are we doing with the Strattera?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're starting the 40 tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right, now what did they do with, my, you're not going to be here anyway [INAUDIBLE] talk with you, or maybe 2 weeks this time.  Is this the last week?  How many times did I call you, once?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, then it's probably 2 weeks that you're coming back.  All right, so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We come back on the 9th.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, let's do, um, let's, let's go to 1 and a half or 2 Clonidine.  When she gets better we can go back down if we want.  I just wrote this 1 to 2.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All done?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Forty, should we do, how many 40s did I give you, 1?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You gave me 1 bottle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, the 9th—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think there's only 7 in a bottle, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So, 5, 6, 7, 14.  So we'll give you another bottle.  They were here yesterday.  Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Question.  Is that [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is it what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's neither.  That's general, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not that much an expert.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] maybe.  It's not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, the one next to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, that one?  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me just, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Isn't he the one that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hi, can, can you give, um, [PATIENT NAME] or [NAME OTHER] 1 bottle of 40 Strattera when they come out?</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks, bye.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that thing still on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll turn it off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to say something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bye bye sucker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: The more people I talk to, everybody seems to be in therapy. That's like my age, you know; older. I got to not talk to people on the team, you know the younger folks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My buddy, he sees a licensed mental health worker. And he gets in his car, and he drives literally around the back of his building and goes to see his therapist. It's like he won't walk two minutes. It's a one-minute drive, but a two-minute walk. You can keep those if you want to; you can toss them. I don't care. I don't need those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, the only other thing I was going to bring up is I'm working with them hoping they will charge you your deductible because as I was out of network from June 1 to July 5, they ordinarily would charge you for the deductible. They might also charge you a higher copay if I'm out of network, but the recordings will take care of that. I'm trying to make sure it's just the deductible. Do you know what your deductible is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: $25 now. But I don't know what the out-of-network deductible is. Oh, the deductible. It's $2,000.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I think what; I mean what I'm generally seeing is that they don't charge deductibles when I'm in-network, and do when I'm out. In other words...that's not always true. Like if your deductible is $2,000 whatever, then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They never challenge you against the deductible when I was in the HMO. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. So I don't know if that was with the PPO, but I fuss with them quite a bit telling them it's not fair of them to charge you the deductible because my being out of network was their mistake which you shouldn't have to pay for. But I have not yet heard the final word from them on that. [inaudible 02:26]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I'm supposed to keeping them or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I can't imagine [inaudible 02:39]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I toss them anyways, yeah. It's just a rare occurrence that I actually open that up and read it. I still have a lot of unopened mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you may want to open those other ones because it's possible there will be checks. More likely it will just tell you owe the deductible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I have any other Blue Cross. Here's my mail in general. I like to use my debit card and I got declined, and you know, I took one off, you know. The next time I went to use it, I got declined at Starbuck's. I got an iced coffee, sandwich. My business account was in the negative, and my other bank account had $6 in it and it was $9, and I get declined again. So I call them up and I'm like what the fuck. And they're like, "Oh, we detected some fraudulent activity on your account, so we had sent you a new card." I was like, "Well when did you send me the new card." They're like, "Three weeks ago." I'm like I should check my mail. And sure enough, they're in my mail with the new card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't keep up with this world. I really can't. It's too complicated. Everything is so...you can't let anything go. It just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is totally irrelevant, but you know what they should do with mail? It occurs to me that...because these kind of problems don't happen as much with e-mail because e-mail has a subject line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They should put a window in a letter so it can have a subject line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can see whether it is worth opening or not. I mean that's what you do with e-mail. I bet that's partly why the same thing doesn't happen as often with e-mail. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I've read from—I don't know if that's where I got this information, but you should be as detailed in your subject line as possible and then the actual, you know, gist of the e-mail really needs to be in the subject line and not in the body of the e-mail. So any who. [Sighs] I'm wiped. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, one other quick comment, I am planning to go out of network for Blue Cross beginning January 1st. [inaudible 05:10] and for other reasons, I'm very sick of dealing with them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that affects me in some positive way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the only way it will affect you is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: My deductible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your deductible and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll be rolling in the money by January. Business will have just skyrocketed by then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I figured. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they'll send checks to you. That's the other thing that will change. But I'll keep submitting claims. You don't have to do that...and the higher copays won't matter because [inaudible 05:46]. That's all I've got. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't have to accept this, but it just gets more difficult every day. It just really does. Yesterday wasn't a bad day, really. I was in court and the tenant never showed up, so I basically sat around for an hour and a half. I got paid. I don't charge travel time to, you know; if the court's there and I'm here, you know, they have the opportunity to hire an attorney there. You know, why charge? I just feel like they were referred to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were referred and [inaudible 06:31].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know. So I don't charge the...and plus, it's Thursday and I'm in that area anyway for E&G, so there's really not much to charge. But the property manager went to the apartment to see if the tenant was still there. He answered the door and he was like, "Oh, I didn't know about any court date." Which means there will be future billings. I guess I'll probably try and have the default removed. But we'll see. It would be nice if there were more billings, you know. I need to make some money. I've got another closing coming. And ultimately another landlord/tenant situation from a realtor. </p>

<p>Last night I got home from...I went to the Café and I'm just like standing all out on my deck and just how painful it would have been if I jumped and I probably wouldn't have killed myself; that I probably would have just messed myself up really badly. And if I ever did try and kill myself, it would be an—I didn't even talk about this before—in a non-violent fashion. It's not like I'm a sissy for pain; I used to play rugby. I've gotten soft over the years. You probably, you know, can relate to that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Getting soft over the years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like when you were 20, there was, you know, things that probably wouldn't have bothered you as much as now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 08:33].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to the festival this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so you're going to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really shouldn't go, but; money, you know. It's too late. I bought the ticket. And I like the people there, they're nice folks. They're a little crunchy. And maybe I can help use Harriet. Use her to figure out some way to hook myself up with Barbara, who I did sit next to last night at dinner. Very nice conversation. </p>

<p>So I don't know. I just really don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm responding that way, I know you don't know what she thinks about you or where to go, but and maybe I'm making too much of this, but it seems to me like during your conversation, like opposed to kind of sitting over somewhere else or sitting next to her and not being able to say anything and then just like I don't know what's going on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I also think when it came kind of to round two of margaritas, I don't think she was going to order one; I ordered before her. It looked like she knew that she [inaudible 10:50]. I was about to say, well, you want to hang out with me you won't be. I don't know; it drives me crazy sometimes. Other times it's, you know, kind of what keeps me going. I don't know. </p>

<p>Thought I cared a little bit yesterday. Just, you know, Jess has no; she just has no concern or thought of my relationship with the kids. You know, it's like I pick up Ian at camp, go the playground and play for a little bit, and she picks up Lucille. I was supposed to pick up Lucille, but she got out early and I didn't want to drive all the way over to and back. </p>

<p>So I go home and so we're there at home and immediately, you know, instead of just having me hang out and play with the kids for a little while, she throws them in the back. You know because Ian says, bug spray and sun block and all this shit all over him. You know it's like, can you wait 20 minutes, 30 minutes, a half hour, you know. Just like, I don't know if...I told you last Friday when she came to drop Ian off, my landlord, was outside and she just left Ian with my landlord and didn't call me to come down, so I didn't get a chance to see Lucille. That mean she probably would have cried or whatever, but it's just like I'd like to see my kid. You know, and I texted her. I was like why did you do that for? She was like, "Oh, I wasn't thinking." And then she just does this over and over again. And then she'll drop hints that I don't spend enough time with the kids, you know. I just; I can't win, really, you know. </p>

<p>I do these closings and there are always these little things they want you to do afterwards and I'm like just a total pain in the ass. </p>

<p>Ian is doing some skit at camp today, like at noon. I really don't want to go, but I already said I'd go. </p>

<p>My tenant sent me an e-mail that he dropped June's rent in the mail. He sends another e-mail—I know I haven't brought this up because we've been behind in rent, but there's a rat infestation outside. And it's like, you know, they did all this...they do all this construction work in the city and it just sends the rats everywhere. There are these fucking rats everywhere. Every time I go there you see at least two rats. It's like there's nothing you can do. You can't exterminate rats that live outside. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they're not in the building?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but they're like under the deck, you know, under the porch. He's like they're literally running across our feet as we come in. So I forwarded it on to the property manager and the trustees and haven't heard back. They're gone at the end of August and then I somehow have got to find $1,400 a month I don't have to pay rent. It's just incredibly discouraging. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I don't know what to do about business cards or, you know, I just...I could write this off, you know, I just...it's just I'm going to be miserable like this for the rest of my life? Is there some point that some change is going to happen that, you know? Right now I don't see it getting better any time soon. </p>

<p>And even when I do things that are enjoyable, it just doesn't last long, you know. As soon as I got home last night, I was just completely and totally depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even after having a good time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just like, I'm like; I'm resigned to, actually I'm never going to do anything proactive to ask Barbara out. I'm just; even if I did, I've convinced myself that it's just, you know, it will blow up in my face. I really just...so little control over so many things in my life. It's like I should be exercising more. I should be doing Yoga. Should be doing some kind of workout for my body. It's like I don't ride my bike and run. I just don't do enough. Which I know would help me. I'm sleep deprived. </p>

<p>The apartment has become a complete and utter shithole. There's shit everywhere. Mail everywhere. [inaudible 21:37] bags everywhere. I just can't deal with it. It's so much I can't deal with it. Just...I don't know how other people do it. I really don't. It's nothing new. That was one of Jess's biggest complaints about me is that I didn't help clean up the house. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I feel like I partly understand it and I partly don't. So let me layout what I understand and maybe that will help to clarify what I don't or maybe you'll have some thoughts. </p>

<p>I think with a lot of the—this does not explain or cover everything, but a fair number of things in your life are sort of like your arrangement with you and Jess and the kids that we were talking about. [inaudible 25:46] before where you kind of don't want to be or...it's not that you don't want to be, it's that you can't bear to be sort of responsible for having a regular schedule with your kids. And but the price it causes you to pay is to, you know, put Jess in the position of being the boss about the kids and to make yourself subject to her kind of criticism and being difficult and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>But it kind of feels like the only deal you can make because it feels like it would really be too much or too overwhelming to have a kind of regular arrangement around taking care of the kids. And I guess when I'm hearing things like exercising or asking Barbara out, it's a little like that. They're sort of what clearly, I think, feels to you like a responsible thing to do which you feel pretty overwhelmed by and kind of resigned to not being able to do, but for which you pay the price of knowing you're not going to get what you want—you know whether it's time with the kids when you want to see them, or a date with Barbara, or being in better shape or whatever, and so, like I said, [inaudible 28:12] paranoid with things like that and I think you get kind of understandably angry both with yourself and with other people of the world in general. Or [inaudible 28:28] you to get what you want, and part of that is also the view of the way that you can only handle so much, or you can sort of do so much to get what you want.</p>

<p>The question that leaves in mind is well, so then what makes it so hard for you to get up on the bike more often or spend more time with the kids or ask Barbara out. You know like what is it that makes sort of doing the "responsible" thing so overwhelming, right? That's the question. And I think I can understand some things about that such as you tend, I think, in interactions with other people, usually to kind of have this glib experience of yourself in the other person where you're the irresponsible one and they're the responsible one. I think a lot of times, or they're kind of unattainable; they kind of have something that you can't have or could never have or responsible in a way that you could never be. Like, in other words, like this same dynamic plays out, I think, in how you can feel in your relationships with other people as well as in terms of getting tasks done, if that makes sense. </p>

<p>Yeah, and I think the; I think there's something very important going on with how it is sort of basically so difficult and so overwhelming so often to do the things that you know are sort of the more responsible thing to do. You actually really want to do. I mean I; you want to be exercising. You want to go ask Barbara out. You want to, I think, have mixed feelings about her, but it's a little part you also want to be able to handle things like this more. </p>

<p>And I guess, yeah; it seems to me like the main thing I'm wondering, and that we've probably both been wondering about is what makes that so overwhelming and you know like there are some partial answers. You know like with the kids, we know literally that they can be incredibly frustrating and a lot of work and difficult and like you get to the point where it just feels like too fucking much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's a sense of boredom there as well. I don't get anything from really hanging out with them, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you know, obviously a lot of people find their kids that—I mean we're talking about something that's a matter of degree; you know it's not as though other people completely different. Sometimes people have fun when they're hanging out with their kids. But it's unclear what makes this harder for you. And yeah, I mean I think the [inaudible 33:36] the way you had with Jess where—this is true in some areas of relationships but not in others. Clearly, with things like money, especially with that. Like you are the one who are much more on top of that and she really could not at all. But I think there are also a lot of things like with the kids where she's kind of the one who is more on top of it and you sort of see that, but also see a lot of then, kind of control and authority and make yourself subject to her. And she becomes kind of the responsible one and you the irresponsible one. And I think that's kind of an easier deal in some ways, but I think it's incredibly frustrating in other ways. And I guess part of it seems important is that is that's what you're really not in it together which I think is probably a lot of what drives this in the first place is this sense of like sort of not being in things together with the people around you so much as, you know, in some other kind of relation to them. </p>

<p>In other words, I guess I suspect that's part of what's driving why it's so hard to step up and do these things in the way that you want to do them is the way that you feel. And I think in some ways, have probably often felt in your life, very much alone and very much like you're not in it together with somebody else and part of something that is going to help to motivate you; you know make you feel good enough to be able to do what you need to do. </p>

<p>I think there are also ways that inaudible 36:12] of these things put out in here as well. But we'll talk about those the next time or something, but I guess I would imagine sort of the [inaudible 36:26] problem; something to do with that; feeling separate, feeling subject to feeling like you're not a part of the people around you in your life and what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure what all that means. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like I'm not being clear on what I'm saying or you're not sure what the implications are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. I mean I kind of get the gist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like I just lack, you know, supportive relationships that would allow me to be me. You know Jess was always bitter about practice and even my work, you know. Can't you get home earlier? I was just...it didn't matter what I did she was going to be pissed off anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now. I do think there is more of this to talk about in the way of respect for the couple. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [100 right] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Ah, I don't know. I'm just sort of discombobulated today. Um, I talked to Jeff last week about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Sort of, you know, what sort of things we talk about as derby (ph), and he thought it was sort of strange that I tend to [chuckles] start out each session where — talking about how work is going, and he said it was sort of like how kids come home from school and tell their [chuckles] parents what homework they have. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something. [Chuckles] Um, [chuckles] so, yeah, I don't know if — if that's what I'm doing when I do that. [Chuckles] I wonder. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I remember when I, you know, first told my mom I was going to go to therapy, and she was like, "Oh, so you're getting sort of an accountability partner? You know, like if work partners updates to you every week?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I told her, like, "No." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "That's me." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but on some level, I kind of do that anyway, even though I don't think of the — as it serving that purpose. [Chuckles] Um, but I didn't really realize that until Jeff told me that he does no such thing. [Chuckles] Um, I don't know — what content do people usually talk about the most?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Silence for 18 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, [clears throat] [pauses for 22 seconds], um, [pauses for 14 seconds], I guess I would say people talk at whatever pace they can, about whatever matters most. Um, you know, [talk is work] (ph) in relationships. Uh, often, history comes up, in other words, like past relationships, family stuff, like that, childhood stuff. Um, [pauses] you didn't quite ask this, but for you, um, [pauses] I have an impression that therapy is — maybe, you — it gets — consciously or probably more unconsciously - scary in that [pauses], in a way, you're pretty careful and pretty attentive to how much in the ways in which you talk about, um, [pauses] sort of bad and scary things that have happened to you, on picking up the traumatic stuff and also of some of the more psychotic-type stuff. Um, [pauses] those things, I think, um, relate a lot to how you're feeling, how you're doing, what's going on for you, but I think are also very hard to talk about. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [pauses] yeah. Hmm. [Pauses] And yet, at times, it is even hard for me to figure out exactly what is the most scary about all of it, um, because there seem to be different reasons why I don't talk about it as openly. Um, [sighs]... [00:05:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I can think of a few reasons, um — I don't know; maybe this isn't any different from what you have in mind, but what I'm thinking of are [pauses] - you worry about not being "got," I think or understood in what you're talking about, or seeing it as coming from some strange place, something like that; told friends, [if I may] (ph) that there's something very much the matter with you; um, [pauses] or, I guess in some other way that I'm less clear about, being very vulnerable and endangered in the process of talking about things that are, um, so charged and so scary. [00:07:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think those are all reasons that — that resonate. Um, and it is strange — like the fear of doing — feeling vulnerable is present during bad weeks, but then when I'm having good weeks, I have this other fear that the things I've done, they aren't really that bad, and that all of the issues I've been having totally aren't justified, and that if I talk more about them, it'll become apparent that they're not so bad, and that I'm just weak and lazy. [Chuckles] [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it seems like, by not talking about them, I avoid some risk of exposure as being really just like a weak, lazy person. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Um, not that I expect this to fix that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But I don't think so. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think that's what's going on here. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is still always nice to hear [chuckles] that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because, yeah, I don't think that's what it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, I've noticed that fear coming up a lot in relation to the group. Um, [pauses] and it — it wasn't as bad up until the meeting when I got, like, shut down for giving details; like, that really just changed the whole experience for me, basically (ph). [00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think of that meeting — like, I had started to find out a little bit more about what the other people had experienced, and I really did feel like my experiences were bad, and my feelings (ph) thought they weren't (ph) sort of justified. Um, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were and they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs with relief] Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was very true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It — it is hard to keep sight of that. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is something that I — that I realize and then quickly forget, and then realize and quickly forget. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't seem to keep it in my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I listened (ph) to great meetings after that one. I've been really emotionally disconnected during group. [00:10:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And most of the other women are sort of clearly emotionally present, and will get teary and will get upset. It sort of makes me feel really alienated that I feel nothing, [chuckles] and frustrated that I really did feel something very strongly at that one meeting. And I was more sort of emotionally vulnerable in the meetings before, too; like, I definitely had more of a range of reactions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Main concepts were sort of sinking in, whereas, now, they just go to this purely logical place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and being so emotionally detached sort of makes me feel like I don't belong there. And — and then in different meetings, you know, they talk about dissociation as, you know, one possible reaction to various topics, so it is not like there is some flaw in the literature we read. But, you know... [00:11:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] ...It is just like something that I tend to feel [chuckles] despite, like, dissociation being addressed. Because it — I think I'm, by far, the most — well, at least in terms of the group itself and what happens in that circle, like, I'm the most dissociated person now. [Chuckles] Um, you know, other people may be much more dissociated in their daily lives...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat] Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, um, [pauses] — yeah, I feel sort of self-conscious about talking in the gr — I mean, I do talk in the group because, sometimes, there will be, like, silences, and I — I do generally have things to say, so I can say them to fill a silence. [00:12:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it is not like idea content is lacking. But I often feel self-conscious afterward because, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you talk easily about things that have happened to you, and I think it must have felt like a risk to say what you're going to say on that day, in such a way that, when they — not just told you to stop but kind of, um, shamed you a bit — is how it sounded to me, or at least felt like they were shaming you a bit...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt like it. I mean, she didn't, like, say anything that, but she just reminded me of the rules, which was like probably meant to not shame me and just feel like, you know, "We just have these ground rules; that's why I'm stopping you." But since I'm [chuckles] self-conscious about breaking rules, like, that didn't make it better, I guess, [chuckles]... [00:13:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, even though it was intended to do so. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, my sense is like that really stung, and you just — and so it was like you haven't recovered in the group...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or have kind of decided that you don't want to be there emotionally in the way you had been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then their team meeting was after that. I think it was more like conscious, like I really need to test the waters and watch what I say. And — so then it became sort of engrained and natural in a way that is uncomfortable for me. Um [pauses], and it seems like things sort of slip below the surface so easily, like I just can't get at them anymore. And it was like that — that process of, you know, watching what I was saying and... [00:14:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And so it quickly became something that wasn't conscious anymore; it was something that just happened whether I wanted it to or not. And it is hard when you just have no idea how to get at something anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:14:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like now, sort of in comparison to the other women, I feel sort of like [chuckles] emotionally retarded. And I feel self-conscious, like they must think it is silly that I spin my wheels analyzing things so much, and have made such pathetic progress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>[Silence for 11 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] uh, [pauses for 40 seconds] I, uh — I wonder if you'd rather feel pathetic in that way and emotionally retarded — as much as those things suck — uh, than feel so scared. [00:16:46]</p>

<p>[Silence for 15 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:17:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess feeling scared doesn't really seem like an option because I just don't feel like I have the right to feel that way. Um, [pauses] and it is strange because, when I think about what kind of progress — like what my progress would actually look like, and what kind of progress the other women are trying to make — um, there are definitely people who have expressed desires to be sort of happy and well-adjusted, and social again. Um, and they're working to move up, sort of, toward that goal, [shifts in chair] and that's not my goal. I'm sort of caught between the feeling like I shouldn't just sort of come to terms with it and go back to the way I saw the world beforehand, um, which is what some people — I mean, I don't think anyone is trying to say that it doesn't affect their world view. Like, don't try and deny that that has impacted you, but... [00:18:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But they want to sort of like step into their old lives again in a way that I don't. Not — I mean, not that all of them do, but, um, [pauses] — and — and I think I'm sort of talking about what I actually want. [Pauses for 18 seconds] Um, I mean, I was thinking this week, um — I actually got, after my group on Monday, this girl and I both happened to be going to Dunkin Donuts, to wait for our rides to pick us up. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're not supposed to talk outside of group for more than, like, five minutes or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So it was sort of like against the rule, but the next meeting is my last meeting since I'll be going to the writing camp after that — or, so, you know, in two weeks, it'll be my last meeting; Memorial Day, you know, is canceled. But — so it didn't seem like that bad to get coffee with [chuckles] someone from the group, even though we're not supposed to. [Shifts in chair] And it was just really nice talking to her. And then her friend came and sat with us, and I enjoyed talking to them and just hearing about their lives and sort of commenting on them, and having them seem to appreciate that. And I sort of realized that, um, I'm terrified of getting negative feedback from people, but just on the basic level of the conversation, there's a lot of little positive feedback you can get... [00:20:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...When people aren't saying nice things to you and, specifically affirming you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But when you say something that seems applicable or helpful or real...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You sort of see your perspective being appreciated...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And you get to appreciate someone else's. And, um, I think sort of isolating myself with my own perspective is safe in that I sort of know it [is a stretch] (ph) [chuckles] for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I also do tend to be sort of negative toward myself, and that's not... [00:21:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see that once or twice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, and there will be periods when I'll go through a stretch of sort of being in sympathy with myself, and the negativity won't be as bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But last week was definitely very negative. [Chuckles] Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean, like, the last week since we've talked, or do you mean the week before that that we talked about...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I mean, definitely since we talked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the next few days before we last met, I was just sort of upset about that conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that's what I was going for. [00:21:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in chair] Um, and I think there is just, like, general unhappiness that then somehow got directed at myself, at some point and hasn't really lifted. Um, and so the first time in months, after getting coffee with this girl, it actually seems like it might be nice to be a little more social, [chuckles] because I've just been so negative toward myself in the last few days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you been thinking and feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well, I [pauses] — I was — I agreed to edit some other people's stuff for work, but I really didn't like their writing, and I thought it was missing a lot of things that should be in there... [00:23:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Shifts in chair]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I didn't think there was a good, logical flow from sentence to sentence. Um, so I had problems - just pretty much everything their problems were about these other chapters, so I decided to rewrite them, and I got...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...One of them on time and then got an extension. And there was one big chapter about writing in the social sciences, which is going to be longer, and then there were two shorter ones about points of rhetoric.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I was determined to be quick with the social sciences chapter because the person who wrote that at least organized it well, so I was just going to smooth out the sentences, add a few things, move on. But I obsessed over it, and I turned it from a 1,300-word thing to over 4,000 words, and added so much, and just changed the structure. And I don't think one sentence remains from the original [chuckles] writer. [00:24:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was supposed to just, you know, fix it a little [chuckles].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I knew it took longer than it should have because of sort of obsessing about the research and just feeling really insecure, like, "Oh, God, have I got this right," because there are such different protocols. Um, [pauses] and I, uh — I didn't get to the other two things by the deadlines, and they were de-assigned, which really freaked me out because I didn't know that could happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to ask for another extension for those two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:24:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just — I don't know — really upset me to have them taken away without my permission or [chuckles] knowledge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] and, I mean — so I was, like - I was upset with myself for obsessing over something and those two, and then for handling it terribly, and having this bad outcome. And I still haven't gotten in touch with my boss to talk about it. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs] Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and one of them — I have all this stuff in a Word document, but I have one — I have one paragraph that I haven't written and another [slaps surface] that I need to work on, and I've just been having a terrible time doing it. And I got a bunch of new assignments, and I don't understand them. I think I may have missed the e-mail that explained them, so [slaps surface] I really need to [shrugs] communicate with my boss about this. And [slaps surface], you know, I've just been so depressed about it, um, because I still do sort of rely on the job as something to make me feel functional and healthy. And, you know, I — I've definitely — I'm still improving in that I can be productive more regularly and predictably, but... [00:26:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But every time I fail in relation to it, it is just so upsetting. [Chuckles] Um, [pauses] and, yesterday, I just — I couldn't do anything because I was so depressed. Um, it just seemed like it wasn't even worth trying, um, because I think I had been feeling sort of bad already. I mean, I went to the group, and then I just felt even worse. It feels like in addition to not being functional and basically, like, retarded and making so - so much slower progress than everyone else. Um, [taps surface] I'm really starting to feel bad about everything about myself. Um... [00:27:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what did you do? I mean, are there ways you take it out on yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, I mean, now, like, I try to do work and fail. And sometimes — I mean, I did write a long thing in my journal, but I could have spent more time reading and writing, and actually doing things that I could do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Shifts in chair]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I spent a little too much time failing to do my freelance work, and, you know, that's [speaking of] (ph), like, nothing and feeling just as bad as I felt before I started trying and failing. [00:28:05] [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I didn't even handle it well yesterday. Because some days, when I'm being totally irrational, I have at least been able to write a lot of personal stuff and get myself to a better place...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I didn't even do that yesterday. I only wrote 1,600 words, and it wasn't enough. [Pauses] And I didn't read anything yesterday. Um, I was also upset because, on the weekend, Jeff sort of upset me. Um... [becomes emotional]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How? What happened? [00:28:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've been sort of complaining to him about how, given the way I do freelance work, I have kind of an overwhelming amount.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are, um — and I had applied to that writing thing for next summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are two things that have June first deadlines, like a couple of cash prizes, but it seems like and I might as well put something out there because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't think many people know about them. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, I mean, there are, like, four pieces of writing that I would sort of like to get written by June first, for these various deadlines, but the school stuff still remains. Um, so I was complaining to him about how I was just overwhelmed because I had so many things to write.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. Which school stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — I just have to finish up those papers on...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:29:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and Jeff's been encouraging me just to e-mail the school without doing that — um, necessarily, just to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Find out where I stand and to make sure I don't miss some bureaucratic deadline that would make my life more difficult than it already is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which maybe I should do, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a bit hard to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah. Um, [pauses] and we were at a dinner, and Jeff got sort of frustrated with me and said that it seems like I was just finding — like, making work for myself and finding things to do, and that unless I decided to work on the school stuff, it wasn't just going to happen, like I was going to have to actively make time and work on it. And — but I was, like, "Well, but, you know, I have so much — so many work assignments right now." And he said, "Well, yeah, but this is a bigger priority. It is more important. You have to actually prioritize and not just do lots of work all the time." [00:31:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, I mean, that's a very reasonable, true thing, but he said it with some frustration in his voice, and it seemed like he didn't think I was trying hard enough. And I don't think that is what he actually thought; I think he just was frustrated that I was being so irrational and not prioritizing at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Shifts in chair]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I just got really upset, and I couldn't talk, and I couldn't look at him. And I felt self-conscious and like I must look crazy to the other people in the restaurant, which is a bad feeling. Um, [pauses] I don't like it when these things seem to be visible. And I had been sort of sick the whole week leading up to that. Um, [pauses] and when I got home, I was just too exhausted and upset to do anything, so I was just like powerfully, drainingly upset. Um, and I got a new cold, [chuckles] like sick again [chuckles]. [00:32:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>[Silence for 45 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess these are the things that have helped keep you going. Um, and the feeling more recently, as you said, in being able to be productive and so forth and, mostly, it seems to be things with Jeff. [00:33:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] Yeah, it just — I can't imagine my life without him. [Slaps surface] I've come to just rely on him completely, like socially. [Pauses] Um....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, it sounds, I think, from what you've told me, mostly, that has been a very good thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, almost always, like, he is very supportive and understanding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is rare that he gets — like, expresses frustration with me like that. Um — and after that, I was thinking about how it — like it would be nice to be in contact with more people. So, you know, inevitably, he is going to be insensitive occasionally; everyone is. [Chuckles] Um, and so that's just a lot of pressure when that happens, and I don't have other people I can contact. Um, and I had felt a little bit rejected, too, because after the thing with Katie and Kimberly being insensitive... [00:35:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....I had e-mailed Michelle just like a few sentences, complaining about it, and she didn't e-mail back...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which is unusual. Like, you know, usually, if one of you sends an e-mail, the other one gets in touch quickly. Um, and my friend Morgan e-mailed me and hadn't been in touch for a while, and I — about like dietary things, and I talked about what she talked about and then also mentioned what had happened with Katie and Kimberly, how it was upsetting. [00:36:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she didn't write back to that e-mail. And, usually, with Morgan — it is like, with me and Morgan, it is the same thing, but, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, I mean, a lot of times, you don't keep in touch with people, or the e-mails trail off but, with me and Morgan, when something gets started, it usually gets finished.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I sort of felt like I had brought up something that was difficult to comment on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Shifts in chair] Oh, I thought you were just going to say difficult, but yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, and I've definitely been in positions where I've gotten an e-mail of something, and I — that I just didn't know what to say about, and — I mean, in one case, I didn't respond, and so one of the things I just feel the worst about in the past — I mean, these e-mails weren't on that level... [00:37:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, I mean, I know what it is like, like to just have no idea what to say and feel terrible about not knowing what to say and freeze.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so I'm not mad at them, but I sort of wish it weren't something that people didn't know what to say about... [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that weren't intimidated by or, uh, [pauses] — I'm assuming, on the one hand, it is weird and awful, but, on the other hand, it would be nice to be able to talk about it a little more openly. [00:37:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Pauses] [Shifts in chair] Um, [pauses for 16 seconds] now that I put it in the e-mail, but is it that hard a thing to know what to say about? Like, um, I know [being hard and] (ph) and how that could have been upsetting, and, um, were you also as uncomfortable and alienated, and interested in getting the hell out of there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, I mean — I mean, in the e-mail I sent to Michelle, like, I think it would have been pretty easy to respond to, because the focus was on, like, "people suck." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, I feel like anyone can always agree with that, then. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh. [00:38:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and the one to Morgan — it was a little bit more like out of place, and I probably should have phrased it a little differently. Like, I think it was sort of disconcerting. Gah. It was just this sentence, short paragraph, in between the paragraphs of the other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, formally, it was weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just makes me wish I hadn't put that paragraph in and [chuckles] [let it slide] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] and Sue has really been making an effort to be a good friend and to be there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has that helped?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I stayed away from the apartment for, like, five days [chuckles] 'cause I knew she was stressed out, and I was just so fragile that I was afraid...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs] [00:39:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Any wrong thing said could be sort of catastrophic. But she actually called me last night, and we had a — you know — a good conversation, um, which made me feel bad for staying away for five days. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I — you know — I think we've sort of both been there for each other. We were both stressed. It is just hard for me to take that risk sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Yeah, it is a risk. I mean, you don't know what you're going to get. I mean, uh, like I guess with Michelle and — I don't remember the other one's name...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean Morgan?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Morgan — like, I wouldn't imagine you felt like you were taking such a big risk in reaching out to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is just always hard to know, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think I probably underestimated how sort of disconcerting that topic is, maybe. I don't know. [00:41:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I think they were consciously totally freaked out, but, [pauses] you know, something about that gave them pause...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And they've been unable to communicate back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 28 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. All of it in combination has made it sort of hard to [share about] (ph) about anything, really, from last week. Um, especially, I think, when Jeff sort of [claimed that the feeling for] (ph) a lower priority, and that I was ignoring the thing that was a higher priority. Um... [00:42:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine, I mean, that Jeff saying that certainly exacerbated it, but I imagine that, at some level, you feel a lot of pressure to deal with a lot of very overwhelming, dangerous things all the time: school, mental health stuff, social stuff . Like, I guess I could imagine that — I mean, probably at some point every day, you've sort of given yourself a hard time about getting in touch with people at school... [00:43:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...For, like, going on a while now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it is always not like just in the back of my mind, but it is always in this very visible place in my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it is very rare that I manage to feel that I've gotten away from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would imagine it weighs very heavily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may not be obvious to people around, but, uh, yeah, I would think it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:43:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that, uh, [sighs] [pauses] it is a similar — like, I'm picturing it — you know, you were kind of very obviously in this struggle last year, trying to write for school, and being too worried and inhibited. And, like, there were very clear signs of a struggle there. I mean, like it was all over the — I mean, that was what you [were in] (ph) most of the time. I could imagine there's a way in which things aren't that different, actually, now. I mean, you're not engaged in that same kind of sit-at-the-desk-and-try-to-write-something-and-struggle kind of thing like you were then, but in terms of dealing with things you know matter, and feeling a lot of pressure around that and yet a lot of fear and inhibition at the same time, I could imagine that stuff weighs on you a lot, and you feel bad about it and struggle with it a lot. [00:45:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it is the same experience as sitting and being unable to connect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, this happens every week, still. I may be able to move [from them better] (ph), but that is still like a fear that is present. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should actually put [it on the side] (ph). We need to stop...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...For now. Was there something else you wanted to add, or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and [shifts in chair] remind me again — um, let me make sure I have that written down. When do you start at the...? [00:46:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I leave on the fifth...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So on the morning of the fifth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this means that, um, we're on for next week, uh, which is the thirtieth, and then not the week after that. OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK [exhaling], well, I will see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

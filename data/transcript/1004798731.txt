<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't remember the last time I was all dressed up for here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a closing today. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). Good. That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having my wife sign three documents and I've got to go to the place and then I've got an appointment with my psychiatrist, who is up there too. So I'm just going to be wandering around for a couple of hours wasting my day. But what can you do? Supposed to pick up Ian (ph) from school today, but closings take precedence today. </p>

<p>So you're running on time as usual. I mean you jinxed yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I said I was going to be more on time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you said you had been running on time, which I disagreed with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you haven't been on time since.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). To prove your point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm going to shut this. Do you want me to...do you want the shades up? (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't the darkness add to the depressive...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). I don't know. I was reading the Reader's Digest Jokes Almanac. I'm a joking [inaudible [00:01:51]. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:01:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually printed some pretty off color, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the Reader's Digest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the Reader's Digest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No kidding. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, um, why does the Easter Bunny hide all her eggs? She doesn't want people to know she's screwing a chicken. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>[00:02:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The word "screwing" was actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I was surprised. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They had some stuff from, quotes from comedians where they had, you know, put a bunch of symbols where a bad word would be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know. I had practice again last night. Just tired. Pissy weekends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was yesterday in terms of the Monday start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't that bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, um, I don't feel...I don't know if it's because I have a closing; that kind of relaxes me a little bit, you know. But I don't feel pressure to...I don't know. Usually I feel pressure of all this work I need to do. I just didn't feel it yesterday. I don't know why. Went in to the office briefly. Did a little bit of work. Came home. Did a little bit of work. But I've got to go back to the office. I really shouldn't, but Jess is being such a pain in the ass about the office, I mean I don't want to ask to use it if I don't have to. So I'm going to drive up and printing out a closing packet and put it together. And driving back, you know. So but I just...I don't know. She doesn't...she doesn't want me using the office. Why should I, you know? So...(Pause). </p>

<p>[00:04:19]</p>

<p>So I have to be back by 1:00, so hopefully it won't be too late. It won't take me long to hopefully print out the documents, get the packages together. And I might even get some other work done while I'm there. </p>

<p>Picked up a seller rep from Jess. Jess wants me to do a title examination for her. So she still sends me work my way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jess, the wife Jess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. I'm not surprised that she's sending you work; I just wouldn't have imagined she would have a title for you to investigate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, she has a client who there are some funky things that went on with the trust, so she just wants to know what the state of the title is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I don't know; I kind of suggested. I said it's hard for me to look at these trusts and know what's going on without looking at the full title, so why not just make myself an extra $175 and do the title. But one of the things that had dropped off of my calendar was Wednesday, I've got a training from 10 a.m.—2 p.m. which was the day I was anticipating doing work. Now I've got this training and I've got two titles which were done, but I've got to put them together. I also realize that my nurse's appointment to get my B12 shot was another appointment that fell off of my calendar. It sucks. What if something really important, you know? I guess I remember the really important stuff, but it's just weird. Some stuff didn't fall off; other stuff did fall off. So I need to make a new appointment for the B12 shot. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:06:57]</p>

<p>I had a brew off on Saturday. Watched football yesterday. Not yesterday, Sunday. Probably why I'm in a little better mood because all my fantasy football teams won. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They haven't been doing as well. (Pause). But in one week, I'm 1 in 3. I've scored more points than anyone else over the course of the four games. Just every...I have the most points scored against me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I finally got the highest score this week. So I made it so no one can beat me. So $25. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. How many people are in the league?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that moved me all the way up to fifth place. So, we're in the playoffs. We're at the season...the season ended today. I have a good team. (Yawning). They do okay. (Making squealing noise). Scratch the back of my throat. I'm still having a lot of post nasal drip, but haven't thrown up the past couple of days. More because my landlord can hear me dry heaving. So I'm kind of suppressing it a little bit. From before, I was happy to get the stuff out of me so I wouldn't be as nauseous. A little nauseous right now, but haven't been anywhere near as nauseous from the Prozac as I have been. So that seems to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>[00:09:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless she upgrades me again today to a higher dosage, then that'll come back I'm sure. (Pause). It would be nice if she could drop off something like the Wellbutrin. I'm down to only a couple of medications at night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: She only wants me down to take like two to three meds. [inaudible [00:09:52] and the Prozac. Maybe the Clonopin. I don't know. (Making squeaking noise). I always wonder what that sounds like to other people. Is that shocking? (Making squeaking noise).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's an unusual noise, but it isn't shocking or...(Pause). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got my new [inaudible [00:10:22]. It doesn't really cover the front though. Like it was a little full like that. I don't think it was, I don't know. (Pause). </p>

<p>I went and test drove Subarus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. How was that?</p>

<p>[00:10:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, I like; I like the Outback. And I didn't really query my dad about this totally, but it seems like he's going to put me on a payment plan. So it's not like I'm going to have to make the whole payment myself, but something I can afford. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So like he'd buy the car and then you'd pay whenever you want or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he pays the, you know, so...he still wants me to test drive the Hondas and the Toyotas and the Kias. So I've got to figure out a time to do that. Maybe I'll try and go on Friday. I don't know. I want to say weekends are big in car buying. I don't know all three day weekends seem t be, you know. But we have in their [inaudible [00:11:41] clearance sales. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Laughs]. Will you get a new car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'll probably get the Outback, which is such an upgrade. And the air conditioning works, the radio works, no check engine light.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs). All these new fangled features.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the gas mileage is not a huge improvement, but age-wise of the car, it will be a huge improvement. I'm sure I'm getting poor gas mileage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not just the age, and you know, and the [inaudible [00:12:14] of my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that'll help out a little bit. It will be enough to offset making the payment now. But you know, it'll help. (Pause). And I'll be higher up in the Outback than in the Legacy, which is down low.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I mean in terms of where you actually sit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I've just got to go through the awkward ritual of negotiating the price. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know somebody who bought a car not long ago who got online and was able to find forums where people talked about price they got at different dealerships around town. So like, and I think she said that—I don't remember the name of the forums, but I can find out if you want. But it was helpful because there were a few dealerships where people were consistently getting the lowest prices and you kind of knew what those were walking in. So rather than having to go to a few different places and make offers and see what happens. She could like go to just...</p>

<p>[00:13:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would it be wrong of me to just go to the closest dealership because that's the closest and easiest and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do whatever you want. I'm just...not forcing you to decide. I'm not trying to push you to do something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like they all have one option package on them though, which I really don't want to pay for an option package. But...(pause). I don't know if my dad's going to be putting any money down on it or what; what the deal is, you know. But...(pause). Cars.com has a pretty comprehensive site with prices and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Invoice prices and manufacturer's suggested retail prices and...I just hate the whole back and forth, well how much do you want to pay and so forth. Ten thousand dollars. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So one thing I really don't do a lot of in my job is negotiating. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I do occasionally at settlements, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that much. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Makes squealing noise). Pretty itchy. (Pause) Must be a worn spot from all the dripping. I don't know why I just got those bad allergies. (Pause). So I didn't see the kids at all this weekend. I've not seen them today. I'm trying to see them at some point. Tomorrow if I can get in the office and get a little work done. Hopefully this seminar will end a little early. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the training?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For my title company. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They just have these seminars a couple times a year and I just go. I always kind of pick up something I'm doing wrong, you know. Which is sometimes a little, you know...makes me nervous. I know I screwed that up a couple of times. (Pause). </p>

<p>[00:16:41] </p>

<p>I went to my concert on Friday night. [inaudible [00:17:12].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: A friend of mine was in town, so a whole bunch of people got together beforehand, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. The one who lived in your apartment complex. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (Pause). I've been sleeping a lot. Falling asleep on the couch early. (Pause). I had a series of nights where I wasn't getting a lot of sleep just from practice, the concerts. I woke up for soccer, which was cancelled. But once I was up I couldn't go back to sleep on Saturday morning. And um, same thing. I wake up Saturday night...(pause). I got home at a decent hour, like 10:00/10:30, fell right asleep on the couch. Sunday, fell asleep like at 8:30/9:00 last night. (Pause). Be nice to have just a relaxing weekend, but it's football. It's not going to happen. (Pause). Have a game on Sunday. It's a late game too. Four o'clock game. (Pause). It'll probably leave me with a panicking Monday. I'll be tired. I don't know, I mean, I have some stuff to do, but I should be finishing it all this week. (Pause). Got a new title. I'm wondering if it's my guy Harry or his boss, his feeling that Harry isn't sending me enough deals. Kind of got that sense from him. (Pause). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Harry felt like he wasn't sending you enough deals?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Harry's boss.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Harry's boss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Harry's boss felt that Harry wasn't sending me enough business. He sent me one of his deals because Harry didn't mention his deal. Though I haven't seen Harry in a couple of weeks. He wasn't at E&G. I was at E&G the week before. It's weird showing up to E&G and just being a regular member sitting out in the crowd. I don't know. I'm still going to have the same worry level, you know, about everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you need to do with E&G?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're in good hands. The new President, she's got her act together. I wish she would send me more closing business. Sends me way more landlord/tenant business which isn't a huge money maker. A lot of complaining. (Pause). Probably what I should have done last night was gone to the office, Jess's office, and printed everything out when she wasn't there. I kind of...I don't know. Just to check on my own. I'm expecting some checks. Deposit those. (Pause.)</p>

<p>[00:22:28]</p>

<p>I'll be sitting around the house doing nothing if I was...had done everything that I [inaudible [00:22:44].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This at least keeps me busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe the Prozac is starting to work. I've been on it for three weeks now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That could be. You're also describing a bunch of good things that are happening, you know. Closings, a lot of business, the car, good stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm taking a little quarter of a tank pill of Abilify.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how much that helps, but she says it increases the Prozac or one of the other drugs or I don't know. It's really bizarre. The other drugs they had me on were counteracting each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just a little bit. I feel like it's so much wasted time, you know, that I...why didn't the other doctor kind of pick up on these interactions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then again, why are all these other psychiatrists prescribing these things, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It must be pretty frustrating at this point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole medicine thing is frustrating. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like hit or miss, you know. You've just got to keep trying stuff and then you...the assumption here is that this is going to work, you know. And in the past, it's just like they're trying stuff and I don't feel like the medicine was really working anymore. Maybe it worked for a period of time, but it just, you know, it seemed to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could be it desensitized or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I wasn't quite as angry as I had been, but you know, for a large degree I was still depressed and lonely and anxious and you know, all that. Which this doctor was surprised... I mean with the amount of Wellbutrin I was on. She was like, "You shouldn't be depressed." </p>

<p>[00:25:43] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was kind of frustrating. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about this? How have you been feeling about whether this is helping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends on the day. (Pause). Well today, like today, it just kind of makes me anxious because I, you know I've got stuff to do today, you know. Sort of anxious about getting everything done and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like something that's taking up time when you could be getting other things done. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But there are other things that I feel like, you know, there are things I feel like I want to talk to someone about; you know, whether they're just, you know, depression or not depression. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause). Like when Barbara asked me if I had season tickets. I didn't know whether to really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs). I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that. So. (Sighs). (Pause). </p>

<p>[00:28:00]</p>

<p>I wonder how long it is. Probably an hour. I've got to give myself time for traffic. This woman's got to pick up her kids, so if I miss her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. At least I can do it during the day. I have practice at night. I'm satisfied with practice. I missed it yesterday. (Pause). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How come what? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You missed yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just tired. It was easy to blow off, so I did, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are you...I mean I guess you're just probably where you're anxious about getting done. You're worried that you won't have enough time to drive up there or print out the closing packet, drive down to the office, deal with the traffic on the way, and get there before she's got to go pick up her kids. </p>

<p>[00:29:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause). I'm assuming hitting traffic I should be in before 11. But I've got to basically, it gives me, you know, a half hour of time to really kind of throw this together, which is about all I'll need. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, everything's got to go right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a lot of driving. I probably should have just called Jess, but I guess there's still a chance to call her after the appointment and see if she's in the office. She never answers her phone. If she's not in the office, she probably won't mind me using it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That'll save me a bit of money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah that could...your car, you drive both ways, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. About an hour and a half. (Pause). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you've been getting some to sign the stuff, does that mean it doesn't close today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that would be a problem. She's leaving town is the issue. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know when she's leaving town. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But um, (pause)...I should have plenty of time, but you never know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you can use the computer in one of the offices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once I had a printer. I don't have to use a printer at home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's a long document?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you've got to print out both. It's all letter and legal and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be like millions of dollars to print out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause). Be like 70—80 pages. I guess I could print it downstairs, but I never thought of that. Do they have legal, can they print legal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. (Pause). </p>

<p>[00:32:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do they charge you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something over $.50 a page. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although you have to make more than one copy. You can print one and use the copier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Man, that's going to be hefty. (Pause). I'll try Jess and if she doesn't answer, I'll just go to the office and do it. (Pause). Kind of part of the annoyance of these things is like, you know, I don't have a lot of them, but whenever I have them it's like anxiety just to get them, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To make everything happen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wonder why...is it usually circumstantial that you can't get this stuff done in advance or is it you're not there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't get the docs until like 5 o'clock yesterday. I wasn't going to wait in the office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right, I know, you had mentioned you were in the office last night, but I didn't realize that was also kind of figured you'd get the documents and just print out and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I left the office about 2 o'clock and definitely thinking I'll...so I'll get the docs. And actually made the right decision, but I just got lazy and should have called Jess and told her I was going to use the office and put it together last night, but I just didn't do it. I wasn't able to wake up and get dressed, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause). So I imagine that it does help to be a little bit better, you know, to have something to keep you going as well as far as being able to be kind of motivated in the morning to get what you need to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well yesterday I had trouble motivating, but I have to have to do something, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To usually pull it together. Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:35:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm all caffeinated and ready to go. (Pause). But they're always like this, you know, where it's like days in advance we know about the closing. It's scheduled. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you talked about this a bunch of times. Yeah. I mean you haven't referred to the pattern of it, but you've referred to the instances where it's sort of a scramble to get everything together because you don't get the things you need until the last minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would be one thing if I had multiple, if I was juggling multiple closings, that would be understandable. But I'm not. It's just one fucking closing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, if you don't get the stuff until the last minute, it doesn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:36:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess it's a pretty...it's a stressful aspect of doing closings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, always waiting for documents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was less stressful waiting for documents when you just get used to it consistently week after week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now, it's like every couple of weeks, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:36:40] said in the same way? (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I'm going to do for an hour and a half. I guess I can go to Starbuck's and try and get some work done, but...(pause). It's always packed in Starbuck's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of students, you know, are in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I see you have about an hour and a half to fill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:38:15]</p>

<p>Any idea what you'd want to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Take a nap. (Pause). I don't know. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will it be just boring or will you be anxious or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll be bored. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just going to see the psychiatrist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it's the time between getting the guy to sign and seeing her. It's not before trying to go to sign?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause). I have some work I can do, but I don't know if I'll have the Internet access to zip it out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't you have to pay for Internet access in Starbuck's?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:39:21]</p>

<p>The assumption is that nothing, there will be no technical hiccups. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's always some technological hiccup that gets me upset. Whether it's printing or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ugh. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But hopefully that won't happen. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but I guess that's the sources of worrying are...it's not like being in traffic.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just sitting there, and (pause) my back was sore before. (pause) I forgot to take my Advil this morning, and then some guy hits me from behind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very hard, but enough to jolt the car and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - scratched up my bumper a little bit. He didn't even bother getting out of his car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like (pause) there's just so much chaos out there for part of this graduation. Try and mow a few of those people down. (chuckling) Reminds me of all these -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get extra points for these, don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Especially if they're carrying one of those signs. It just reminds me of all the achievements I've had in my life, you know? (pause) How far it's gotten me. (pause) [00:01:01]</p>

<p>I forgot the cord to charge my phone, so I have to go back home before I go to the office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to use mine?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I need it for the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I've got someone coming in at four, four-thirty. I've got a closing tomorrow. The seller is signing tonight, or at least their attorney is. (pause) So I have two cords, and they're both at the house, I'm pretty sure. Actually, I usually put one in the computer bag, but didn't. (pause)</p>

<p>So Jess's driving me nuts. If she worked as hard as she did at lowering expenses on increasing her income, I mean, she'd be so busy she wouldn't know what to do. And the latest is, she's switching to the Commonwealth, she wants to switch to the poor people health insurance, it's like 200 bucks a month. You don't take it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a lot of other doctors do. So she's like, "Why don't you take the savings and direct pay your doctor?" And I'm like, it would still be more than paying my premium now. So it's actually cheaper if I pay the individual than pay half of the family. But I don't know if I can sign up for one month, because she can't sign up until July 1st, and mine renews June 1st, and I don't know if I can sign up for family for one month and then switch it to individual the next month, or if she's going to have to go a month without insurance. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing in that regard, so that you know, is that it is likely that sometime between September and December...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't go a day without something happening. Go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will stop taking the Blue Cross HMO. So if you're switching anyway... These days, the PPOs don't tend to cost (pause) much more, and I will take that. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought you stopped taking the Blue Cross HMO already.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you have the Blue Cross HMO, don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, but I thought you were doing some sort of exception, or you didn't want to get on their network, or... I don't remember what was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I've made noises about getting off of it before, this time I'm pretty sure. And I'm happy to have them grandfather you as long as I can if you want to do it that way, and wait to switch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if I can switch midstream, that's what I'm trying to find out, is if I have to switch June 1st. You know? Which doesn't make sense. I mean... I don't know, I think June 1st is just when I started.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends. Do you have a direct pay, or do you have a small group?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Small group. You know, part of the chamber.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don't know how it works for that. I've done small group myself, and I think I could pretty much switch whenever I wanted because it was a small business. But if you're part of the chamber I'm not sure how that works, whether there are specific open enrollment periods. One way or another, we will make this work. This is not - there is no way you will wind up (pause) not being able to come in, because of this change. [00:05:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want something to go easy in my life, you know? It's like, maybe things are going easy that I just don't recognize? But there really aren't. It's like, even these closings nowadays, it's like, you've got to get the HUD approved, and they all have different mechanisms for getting the HUD approved, and I sent the HUD in last night and I'm literally in waiting mode. You know, I sent in... it pisses me off, I sent in an updated title commitment with how the borrowers want their names. And they don't - you know, the guy wants "Josh K. G. Bailey, Jr." And they just do "Josh Bailey". And I know they can make the change because they added the wife, she wasn't originally on the title. And they added the wife and they did her right, but they didn't do him right. And I'm like, "Is this something that you can do easily?" And they're like, "Yeah, it's just going to take a while." So you know, I'm a slave to other people's competence or incompetence. The seller's got to - it's a relocation company, so they've got to approve the HUD, so I've got to rush and get everything done so they can approve it in time, and now I've got the lender who wants to approve the HUD, which I'm sure (pause) you know, they have different numbers than I have for my fees, so I'm sure they're going to not like the way I did it, even though the way I did it is the way it's supposed to be done. [00:07:03]</p>

<p>But I've had lenders before who didn't like the way I did it. Because they're clerks, and they don't know any better. I mean, these people, they're told to do it one way, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Without really knowing what they're doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not like these people really have a knowledge of the rules and how they apply, they just say, "Oh, it's got to match this." And it's a checklist form. And occasionally... And then, when you do it the way the last time they wanted you to do it, you do it that way, and you get a person who knows how to do it, and they're like, "Don't do it that way. Do it this way, which is the right way." Well, I didn't do it that way because the last time I dealt with that lender... You know? It's unnerving. [00:08:03]</p>

<p>I got this condo up in fucking Amherst. It's like they think - first of all, the people tell me they're buying for cash a place down in on the Cape, either the deal fell apart or they're just not using me because they found another attorney to use. Because they were supposed to be the 23rd, which was yesterday, right? So they sent me an e-mail saying - because basically, I'm collecting condo fees from someone they haven't collected from for two years, and they're foreclosing on their property and the woman files bankruptcy, stops the foreclosure. And every year they throw a party on the Fourth of July with 60 people just all over the place. And "Is there anything we can do to stop them from doing that? You know, it's unfair, they're going to use all the water." They're just talking about - they can hear everyone doing their laundry. Because the condo pays for water. And it's just like, hold a special meeting, give two days notice to all the trustees (pause) make a rule that you can't have more than so many people in the common areas, and then when they have 60 people show up give them notice of the rule, and when they show up violating the rule, you call the cops and have the cops disperse everybody based on a trespass. Is it that hard? It's like, go and amend the condo docs. Just come up with a fucking rule. You can't have 60 people in the common area. And the cops are going to show up, and they're going to see 60 people. You know, they're probably exaggerating. It's probably 20 people, you know? (pause) [00:09:52]</p>

<p>I'm not keeping track of this stuff to bill them, but I should. All these fucking crazy phone calls I get from them. (pause)</p>

<p>Jess texts me the other day. She's like, "Can you pick up Ian from school on Wednesday?" And I said yeah. And the next text was, "I'm supposed to go to town but I may not go." So I put it in my schedule. I don't hear anything from her. So I show up at the school at 2:30 and I'm driving around looking for a parking spot, and there's Jess. I'm like, "I thought you wanted me to pick him up." She's like, "No, I never asked you to pick him up." That's what she said, she never asked me. So I forwarded her the text where she asked me. She said, "Yeah, I asked you, but I said I may not do it, and I didn't do it." And I said, "But you didn't tell me that you may not do it." And then I'm picking up Ian, and I don't know what information he has, but I go, "Were you surprised?" and he goes, "No, because Mom said either you or her were going to pick me up." And I should have known something was awry when five minutes to 2:30 I didn't get a text from her saying, "Did you remember to pick him up?" (pause) [00:11:36]</p>

<p>She's driving me fucking crazy. The health insurance is going up and she's just, "I'm not paying it." I'm like, "Well, okay, I'll pay the difference then." You know, it's like, we need fucking health insurance. (pause)</p>

<p>And she didn't even check if my primary care - I think she checked my specialist, who I haven't seen in two years. (pause) I'm sure my primary care takes it, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (pause) [00:12:19]</p>

<p>At least I'm going to have a good June, which will help me slightly get caught up on some bills. My dad's leaving -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rehab? Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - rehab today, so he's going to look at his finances and send me some money. (pause) And this closing is helpful, on tomorrow. I'll make about 1800 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Assuming I can get everything approved. Because I've got to get the HUD approved before the sellers' attorney shows up at four o' clock. So it's like I'm under the gun, you know? I got E&G today. So they'll send me the corrections during E&G, and I've got to wait until after E&G to send them back. If the only corrections are on the third page, that's fine because I know I can get that signed. But if they're on the first and second page, I don't know what the fuck. (pause) [00:13:34]</p>

<p>I think it's easier if I upload the closing docs to their system. It's like, "Well, first I've got to scan it, and then I've got to upload it, and I've still got to overnight you the note. And I've still got to record the mortgage. And I've still got to make a copy for the broker. Why is that easier for me? It's actually more work. Saves me a little bit of money in copy fees, but you know... it's not exorbitant. Still got to pay the overnight fee. (pause)</p>

<p>My mom's coming into town Saturday. She's coming in Saturday at 11, she's leaving at like three o'clock on Sunday. She can't take a day off to see her fucking grandchildren, but she'll go to these bar mitzvahs for third cousins. She's always taking time off and going places, and she can't take a Friday off to come up and spend a little bit of extra time with her grandkids. She's literally there less than 48 hours. (pause) A little over. A little under. A little over. (pause) [00:14:58]</p>

<p>I go to a barbecue every Memorial Day on the Sunday of Memorial Day, I'm dragging her along. Jess's going to drop the kids off and go study at some or go do some work at the library, so pick the kids up. (pause) And I just want to get shitfaced. But I really can't, because I've got to drive my mom home. (pause) So I'm just going to eat an excessive amount of food. (pause)</p>

<p>I'm trying to say funny, witty things to that woman Barbara.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your leader?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know. Probably. It's an ultimate party, mostly ultimate people will be there. Except for my mom. Which is good, because my mom will be there to watch the kids, or at least Lucille. Hopefully Lucille takes to my mom, because there will be other kids that Ian will play with and I won't have to watch Ian. And I don't mind walking around with Lucille. (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know if I've ever told you about the Texas Tommy. Have I ever told you about the Texas Tommies? They're going to have Texas Tommies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's like a lot of meat involved, from what I remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's a hot dog sliced, with a pickle in it, wrapped in bacon, and one version - the way this version was to deep fry them and then put them on the grill, or put them on the grill and then deep fry them. Last yeah he had one pound hot dogs. So I don't know - last year, I only had a half, and I got mocked for only eating a half. I think I might have eaten two halves at different periods of time, but this year I will eat a whole one. These are the folks that invited me over Monday. My friend Mosby invited me over Tuesday for striper, but there's this guy who - I actually used to subscribe to his service - a trader, hedge fund kind of guy. He works with Mosby, and I just didn't want to be around all of that, just them talking about it, just... (pause) [00:17:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they work together doing trades of commodities, and that's all they would be talking about, so I just didn't want to be around it. I used to do a lot of that but now that I'm broke, I can't do any trading or anything like that so I just didn't want to be around it. So I missed out on the striper. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's striper?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Striped bass. It's a fish that's prevalent in New England. (pause) It's very good. It's very good. (pause) It's not to be confused with Chilean Sea Bass, that's a different type of fish. That, I think is grouper. But they don't like to call it grouper, because it sounds disgusting. (pause) There's a lot of fish that they call it a different name to make it sound fancy. Like Mahi Mahi, it's dolphin. People are like, "I don't want to be eating Flipper," even though it's dolphin fish, it's not dolphin mammal. But the Hawaiians call it mahi mahi, so now everyone calls it mahi mahi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why do they call it a dolphin fish if it's not a dolphin?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it's just - dolphin fish is the name of it. I'm not sure how fish got their names. (pause) [00:20:11]</p>

<p>So I was at Handball practice today, and I was going to bring all my stuff with me, change, and drive straight to Handball practice. But driving is a pain in the ass. And I figured, I'll be late to practice, I'll ride my bike. I need to get my bike ride in. And then I'll run around at practice and ride my bike home, go to the bar, whatever, you know. Try and say funny, witty things to Barbara. (pause) I don't try, I just naturally say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) It's a gift?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a gift. Don't you think so?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm your most amusing patient, you have to admit that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Absolutely. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I could only get Cameron to come four days a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cameron, if you switched to the Blue Cross PPO you could come four days a week. (pause) Get your analysis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking if I can't switch in the middle of the stream, just going individual and telling Jess, "You're on your own for a month." You know? You're on your own. I don't know what to tell you, but I'm not signing up for family. Because you don't want it, we're not going to pay for it. So you're on your own for a month. The kids get sick, suck it up, pay for it. You'll still be saving money. Unless you get in a car accident or something like that, then you're fucked. (pause) [00:22:07]</p>

<p>I don't think they gave me the PPO as an option, really. Is there a deductible with PPO?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depends. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. Everybody's just so damn expensive, you know? It's like I can't... (pause) I want to use my old fax line, so I'm doing backflips to get the company to release it, and they're not going to install a new number until June 14th. What? You know, when I bought the service you were able to come out three days later. Now, when it's a change in number I've got to wait three weeks? Four weeks? Three weeks? (pause) [00:23:23]</p>

<p>I've got my summary judgment motion next Thursday. I haven't really even looked at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So today is sort of one of those "everybody else is an asshole" days, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they are. Why is that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Apparently I'm just another asshole, so I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have I said anything that would suggest you're an asshole?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or are you projecting?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What did I say that would suggest you're an asshole? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, everybody is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but did I say something that would specifically -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did lecture me on fish like I was an idiot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I wasn't lecturing you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Oh, really? I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't lecturing. I was informing. You didn't know that Chilean Sea Bass was grouper. Or one of those - some other fish, I think it's grouper, but I was actually shocked when they offered - I was at the Harbor Hotel, and the specialty was grouper. (pause) Maybe Chilean Sea Bass has fallen out of favor. I think because it doesn't sound local. It doesn't sound fresh. It's from Chile. (pause) Chile, I think, is the way you have to say it. [00:25:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how you say it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And people get very sensitive if you say "chili", and not Chile. Even though they don't speak Spanish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. A lot of people go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm. I'm thinking of Peru, forget it, never mind. If you say "Peru", no one goes "Peh-ru."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It's only Chile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you say Cuba, they don't say, "No, it's 'koo-ba'." You know? Mexico, Me-hi-co... (pause)</p>

<p>I've got to figure out a way to get out of here, I think I've got to take [inaudible] to get out of here, to avoid all the smart people, and their families. (pause)</p>

<p>I would think that would be the one part of teaching that I would find kind of grinding, is having to show up for these graduations. Maybe some of them like it, but it's just, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Guests are probably pretty annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's warm out, you're in a dress, you just have to sit there... If you have this speaker, you do that, that would be one thing, but to literally just sit there and... (pause) [00:27:09]</p>

<p>I think I drove by, it was the educational school. It was Ed. B, which I assume is a Bachelor's in Education, and then there's Ed. M, which I assume is a Master's in Education. On those little signs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it was a B. E. D.?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ed. B.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. We don't have a Bachelor's in Education, I don't think. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you're the asshole. You'd know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Or not, maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You didn't detect the sarcasm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. No, that didn't register with me. I never really had a class on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's this pillow on my couch that Buddy used to curl up on, and out of the corner of my eye I always think it's Buddy. I should move the pillow. But then I like to have that pillow when I like to lay down and play poker. I'll have a pillow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's probably something that indicates.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's worse when I see him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think he's there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my bag I used for when I bike? I don't know what those are called. Biker bags, bike bags... That bag, yeah. I'll hit it with my foot in the middle of the night and think that it's Buddy. I think I should take it off the bed. Most people don't keep things in the bed when they sleep. But I'm a slob. There's still food in his bowl. Cat litter's everywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has it been without him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lonely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to get fat because I'm not going on any walks. Technically I could go on walks without him. Probably actually get more exercise, because he always had to stop and sniff at something. Stop and poop and pee.</p>

<p>I was telling - there was this guy on my street who used to have two Rottweilers, he put one down a couple months ago and has one who's in rehab. He takes swimming. But he loved Buddy. He'd only seen Buddy like three or four times and just loved him. Just would sit there and love him and hug him and just... So I told him last night, and he's just like, "Ah, God, that's awful! Ah." He took it really hard. He'll have another dog before he comes. And he was asking me if I was going to get another dog, and I said, "Well, they usually find me."</p>

<p>When I was a kid I always wanted a dog, and I got a Doberman that stayed at my dad's. One of the people who worked in his office had puppies, so I got to pick one out. And I picked the runt, so we called her Tiny. And then Bull came with Jess, Ollie my parents couldn't take care of so they sent her up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of dogs were Bull and Ollie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bull was a pit bull, Ollie was an English bulldog. So an odd couple, but they got along great. And then Buddy, you know, I was his last hope before getting put to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he was a year and a half, and we were his fourth owners.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: People just took him and couldn't keep him, yeah. You know, whether it was their landlord wouldn't allow him - the last one was the landlord wouldn't allow him, or they kept him chained up outside and he had all these sores and he was scrawny, and they weren't taking good care of him and the landlord was like, "You've got to get rid of that dog." And I'm sure he was sad and barked all day. The only dog I ever had that saw a door and wanted to go in it. You know, most dogs want to go out. He wants to go in, because he was so used to being outside. When we went to get - Jess thought we were just going to see him, but I knew we were going to pick him up. So... I kind of forget about all the times he was a pain in the ass. They called yesterday to say his ashes are ready. I'm not really ready to pick them up. Plus I owe them money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if he's also the asshole because he left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not his fault. I'm the one that pulled the trigger. Aren't I the asshole? That's like the best line from any movie. You know what I'm talking about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like Jack Nicholson, but I don't know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he was in, I can't remember, Tom Cruise was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, "A Few Good Men"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was Jack or a prosecutor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Jack Nicholson was on the stand. And I can't remember what Tom Cruise said, but Jack Nicholson said, "Well, aren't I the asshole?" (chuckling) Like they wrote the line for him, you know? The only thing I remember from the whole movie. [00:33:45]</p>

<p>That's about as good a Jack Nicholson as I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's that old, I'm an asshole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From what I said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Everyone else is an asshole. (pause) I don't think Barbara's an asshole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet. (chuckling) Give her time. (pause) I don't know, I just can't, but I don't know, what she would get out of me. I'm older, and I'm all doped up on medication, I'm in therapy, I'm a slob.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you overlooking your many fine qualities?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, let's tick those off. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can close a loan pretty good. (chuckles) But unless she buys a house, that doesn't really help me. (pause) You gonna help out, or...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do better than that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm funny. I do a wicked good Jack Nicholson. "Here's Johnny!" Oh, that I'm digging. (pause) Occasionally I'm a good father.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Occasionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm stumped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)</p>

<p>Maybe you need to work on that, you could probably add some more if you thought about it. [00:36:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Guh, not homework. (pause) I used to be really good at Galaga, but I haven't played in so long. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, smart? Pretty smart?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. I don't tend to use it to my advantage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I know what I said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've done a lot of stupid things. I can be smart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I don't know, you could be a good friend to people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. I can con people pretty well, convince them that something's true that's obviously completely not. (pause) I don't know how that wouldn't get to me in life, but that's fine.</p>

<p>My favorite of all time that I used to do was in college to mostly innocent young college freshmen, and I would tell them there was an article in the USA Today and I took a poll, and that most people prefer the taste of non-dolphin tuna - this was the thing at the time, dolphin-safe tuna - people prefer the taste of non-dolphin safe tuna over dolphin-safe tuna. And they were like, "Really?" And I was just like (scoffs). You know, the difference is one's... they use certain things, so that would affect the taste of the fish. (chuckling)</p>

<p>You know, my whole life no one's ever called me on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never. And I've used it dozens of times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would say nine out of ten people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Try it!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next time you're at a party, try it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that would make everyone an idiot in addition to being an asshole.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) No, they're just... gullible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you just have to kind of think about that one, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it's like telling someone "gullible" is not in the dictionary, so they go and they look it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) They find "gullible", they read it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that one I've heard of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jess told Ian at some point - that if they wait a year, they can get a dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A golden retriever. I told you about the e-mail where she offered to move into my apartment? So I sent her an e-mail last night asking if the rents had come in from [inaudible] so I could pay my rent. "Hey." (pause)</p>

<p>She still wants to fucking move to that street, you know? It's fucking ridiculous. It's a one bedroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's your place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And yeah, she couches everything in "what's best for the kids." You know? That's all that matters, what's best for the kids. She hasn't tried to find an apartment, she hasn't looked for an apartment, she hasn't done anything. She just sees that apartments are 1500 dollars - you know, well, mine's only 1400 dollars, just to say that Curtis wants her and the kids to move in. You know? (pause) It's like, it's my fucking apartment. (pause) [00:41:41]</p>

<p>At some point I'm going to have to be the asshole, and tell her to go fuck herself. You know? I got to draw the line somewhere. It's a one bedroom, you know? Where are the kids going to sleep? There's a dining room and a living room with no doors, which works for when Ian sleeps over, but it's basically a room I don't use which has dog stuff and puke on a futon mattress that I need to throw out. And it's garbage day yesterday. It just drives me fucking crazy. It's like, I've got one thing that's working for me, a landlord I know who doesn't get upset when I don't pay him, and... (pause) the Handball people, so if I have people over from Handball or party or whatever, they invite me over just... ride bikes home from the pub with Curtis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just fucking drives me nuts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've gotta go now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, I'm skating now. Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Enjoy the long weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You working on Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope.</p>

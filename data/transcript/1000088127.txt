<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Session 18. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Man, I'm tired.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Me too.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: You work all day?

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yeah. I had three occupants last night. Did you work all day?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, I was around. I could have come tomorrow because my friend decided to change his mind and meet today. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: So you've moved today already, huh?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: No, I didn't know it. He didn't tell me. So he didn't do it himself, and I walked downtown past his house and there's a rent-a-truck in his front yard and, "What's going on?" Should be gone by the time he's back. 

</p><p>I had a really beautiful time Sunday night. I decided that I was going to try and see what hitchhiking was like, and so I started walking through Long Island, mailed the letter, and then walked out the other end of town. And I was going to see the (inaudible at 2:24) the (gonya) (ph) at Central Park and (Greenwich village) (ph), and so I just started sticking out my thumb, walked backwards for about half a mile. Couple a thousand cars must have passed and then finally somebody decided to pick me up. So he took about... I'd say about three or four miles, then dropped off, and then I got another ride after I walked about another half mile, and then another ride for about another two miles. And then I walked the rest of the way, because nobody picked me up. That was in the afternoon too. It was light. And altogether it's about... I don't know, I'd say at least 10 or 12 miles there from my house to the hospital, and I was kind of getting achy when I got there.

</p><p>So when we got there, we messed around for a while. Then we went in this restaurant... by then there were three of us. Sheila and one of her girlfriends come along with us. And so we went in this restaurant and we ordered one of these all you can eat dinners; just one because that's all the money we had, and the waitress looked at us kind of funny and just brought it out. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Too funny.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And then on our way back, it was about evening time. I should have gone home. I walked all the way back from the park. I got a ride for about three miles to the island. These two girls were stopped at a light and I was walking past the light and they said, "You want a ride?", and I went, "Why didn't you pick up back there a 100 yards when I saw you?", because it was a really long light, and "Yeah sure, I want a ride". So they give me a ride. I was kind of surprised they picked me up. Most people are scared.  I was doing the Long Island. In fact, I was in Long Island. I mean, some guy picked me up and took me the last mile and a half to my house to where... So I figure I walked a total of about 15 or 16 miles. [4:46]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But you enjoyed it?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: The whole thing.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I just... this rock in my hand you know, because just coming out of Long Island when I was leaving, some guy tried to hit me. So I picked up a rock, you know, and I carry this rock because if anybody tried to hit me then I'd just put it through their windshield, so I could identify the car later. You can't cover up a broken windshield very easy, and it would be kind of like revenge, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Um hm. You could get back at him. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And I had this rock. Just kept squeezing it to keep my hands warm. It was about 45 outside, and it builds up your (hands) (ph) too. People they just... they drive by and they honk. Now you're nowhere near the road, but they honk. There's this one guy. He was really out of it. I walk on the sidewalk in my neighborhood and he... he's driving by and I... all I do was turn around. I didn't even put my thumb out. And he looks at me and he puts his finger to the side of his temple, you know, like you're nuts, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Like maybe loony, yeah. Yeah.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And I... I just broke out laughing. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Laughter.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It was so funny. People are so... I despise them. I was just... I was laughing at them really. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You were kind of making fun of them to yourself you mean? [6:18]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, the way they act is so insane. Like I was almost to the hospital, just about a mile to go. I was getting pretty tired, and this woman and her husband - she was driving. They were old. - came down off the toll way and they... they were stopped, looking at this map. And so I was walking by, you know, because they hadn't picked me up when they went by me. And I said, "Can I help you, huh? Are you lost? Need some help? I know the area a little bit around here, you know.", and this old man wouldn't even open the window. And his wife looks at him and says, "Open the window for that young man.", and he opened it about a half inch, you know. And I said, "Oh, where you going?", you know, and he says, "Berkeley", and I thought, "Oh, no, there isn't no town named Berkeley around the north side that I know of. And I was going to get wise and say, "California, no.", but I said, "Well, look on the... on the index of towns there because I can't help you.", and I just kept walking. People are so messed up. 

</p><p>I heard President Nixon talk about his silent majority. There is a silent majority. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: [Look at us.] (ph)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: They're all mixed up. Me too. I mean, one car out of 10,000 that passed me picked me up. I didn't count them, but if I did it'd get unaccountable.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But I guess you did probably because you were curious to see what would happen.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Because that...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What kind of people you'd meet.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Like I mean, I had a theory that only nice people going to pick you up, because as long as I've been driving and picked up people, I only found nice people that I picked up, you know. They're the only ones that have the guts to stick out their thumb, and I guess it works the other way too. The only people that pick you up are the nice ones that have the guts to [have conflict] (ph). [8:39]

</p><p>Of course, it works different if you're a girl. Like when Josie hitchhikes, you know, she never knows who she's going to get, you know. There are all kinds of weirdoes. She's also been gang banged a couple times.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Who's Josie?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: My friend in the hospital. She somehow manages to get out of it. Jumps out of the cars while they're still moving. Just says, "I'm getting out.", and opens the door. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And gets out. (laughs)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And sometimes she's already at the stop sign and doing things like that, you know. When a guy sees that's going to happen, he usually stops. She says, "Thanks for the ride.", and kicks the door closed. The guy gets so mad and she starts swearing at him. I don't know, you equated that (car) (ph) to getting around. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You kind of admire her way of doing things?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Not really. I admire her for having the courage of hitchhiking, yeah. She just worries too much; very, very intolerant towards people even her friends. Like when she sits there talking with other people that were in the hospital while I was in there, like she'll sit there... really it's kind of biting, cutting, the way she talks about some people, you know, and then she'll look at me, "Now isn't that true?" And I have to... I can't say yes, even though if it is true, you know, because I didn't see it that way. I have to kind of rephrase it, you know, because I don't like to be cutting about people. [10:36]

</p><p>I think she was telling this other girl about how ugly this girl in the hospital was while I was in there, how ugly she was. And Josie said, "Wasn't she ugly?", and I says, "Well". I just said, "Well", you know, and then the other girl she was asking says, "She wasn't very pretty was she?", and I said, "No". She said, "That's very diplomatic of you".

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But... and you have to be careful that you don't...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I don't like to cut down people, because really it doesn't help anybody. 

</p><p>I was mowing my grandmother's lawn yesterday, and that's a major accomplishment because it was about a foot high.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yeah, wow. (laughs)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Because it hadn't been... it's a small... I mean, you know, so it wasn't like...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: With a hand mower?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, it's a push mower, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: That you push, yeah.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's a mower. It has a motor on it.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Oh, fine.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: No, and I wouldn't have attempted it with the other. (chuckles) But I... I could kind of mechanic when I did it, you know, and I had started thinking about how violent everything is.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What surrounds you.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I read something in the... in the paper about how the whole American system is based on conflict, you know. Don't seem so simplistic.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Seems very true to you and yet very crazy is what you're saying here.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And I... like I always think back over the past, like this school or places that I have been, restaurants or something, where someone's always playing the hard guy, you know. And... whenever I'm in a place like that; when someone else is in a place like that that is violent, I can always imagine some kind of a meeting between us, a confrontation of some kind, and before I always thought, "Well, if that happens, [12:51] you know, I'm just going to flatten them, no sweat. And yesterday I thought, you know, "How dumb that is.", you know. Now I think I would say, "Oh, you stupid, violent people.", and walk around... walk... turn around and walk away.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What is that feeling? It's just senseless and that you don't have to be caught up in that?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's kind of a... kind of like I'm above it, you know. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Above it, separate from it, and...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And I want no part of it, you know. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And... and better than the people who are in that... that part of it?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Oh, the people that are in it I kind of pity. Maybe because I was part of that, you know. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And you pity the part of you that was in that too?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, because I know what's it like to have to... it's really not being hot; it's just fear, you know, and that's... that's the part of it that I pity them. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But so are you saying that now, if you were in that situation, you would be free of that fear?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Because partly it's... I have no desire to impress anybody really. [14:25]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: No desire to show somebody how strong you can be, or how violent, or something?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I'm just there. (chuckles) 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: That... from the way you're talking, that shows that you want to bring it out that you can be above it. It gives you a releasing feeling, or like you're freer that way, or... or just what?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, kind of. I kind of don't have to worry with a big guy following you on the expressway that's going to start ramming you or something, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (chuckles)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It... I just... I don't know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Doesn't matter.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's just less living. When I was walking to neighborhood, the Island police stopped me there every night for a... a routine field investigation, and I was standing there at 10:00 at night shivering, and they're going through their routine field investigation for a half an hour. Have to check my complete record; see if I'm wanted anywhere and see if I'm a draft evader; check my draft status. Well, I guess they must have had it all on their... on their computers. I knew they were on the radio, you know. So he just... he goes back and forth to the radio about four or five times and stands there talking to them. That's why he...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: What a waste of time, a whole hour. (chuckles)

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Seems like ridiculous to you, huh?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. It was kind of scary at the time.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Scary at the time?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I thought, "Oh, no, you know, I'm going to get busted for something.", because if they want to bust you, they can bust you for something and that's just what I need right now. [16:38]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And you were afraid if they had it in for you, they would find something on you?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, they don't have to have it in... they don't have to find anything to have it in for you, you know. I had really nothing on me except my empty wallet.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But you felt very vulnerable to what might happen if they did it?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, yeah, I mean... a policeman has a very free rein on a society, especially now. Well, maybe not especially now, but it sure seems that way to me. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Did you feel like a pawn in that _______________?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, kind of like, you know... he could have picked me up for anything. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (crosstalk)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: He could have said he saw me hitchhiking when I wasn't. I was walking then, because I knew nobody was going to pick me up because there wasn't any lighter than that, and there was no cars. (chuckles) He could get me for vagrancy I bet, because I didn't have enough money on me. That wouldn't be hard to prove.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Like you wouldn't have to do anything.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, you're just walking through. Because I've driven through that town before.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What... what is that a feeling of the great riskiness of that or what?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: That's kind of like here's your public defender supposed to be helping you out. All he does is detain you. Once you're free, he sends you on your way walking. He doesn't even take you to the city lines. [18:13]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Sort of a mild bitterness that that's kind of the way it happens?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Because I... I've been picked up in the neighborhood before for... one time... I had one taillight out. I had four taillights on the car. I had one out. They picked me up for that, and then the other time my license plate was dirty. They didn't like that. (chuckles)

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (laughs) Seriously, they picked you up for that?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Seriously... I'm serious, they did. It's ridiculous, but Long Island is... it's known for that kind of thing now. That... it's almost as if they have nothing else to do, and on top of it when they stopped me, they had a backup car, an unmarked one, come out and sit there for about 15 minutes. And then he left and another squad car pulled up. So I'm sitting there with two squad cars, and then when the second squad car pulled up, the guy pulled... turned on the blinkers on the top. So here's this big... big thing with the... with the blinkers going on, and then you look for the main road and I'm standing there with my hands over my head, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying. It was really weird.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It sounds like you was going through all this and you're frightened by it and almost amused by it all at the same time.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Ridiculous. It's amazing how... how they can get away with that kind of thing. (chuckles)

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You don't think it's funny anymore?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And I had to be... I had to be home by 11:30, you know, and I figured, "Well, I'm going to end up walking and there's no way". You know, I didn't know if I was going to make it or not, because I wasn't walking very fast by then. Maybe they thought I was stoned, because I wasn't walking very fast. They asked me where I came from. I said, "The City. I knew it was a risk if I walked". "Where you going?" "The Island". "How you going to get there?" "I'm going to walk". "I don't believe you". (chuckles) 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It sounds like you...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: "Go put your cap on again" [I think he said] (ph).

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It sounds like the way you talk, sounds like you weren't... I don't know, almost like you weren't in it, like it could have been a movie going on or...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I didn't... I... yeah, I believed it.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: I mean, like you believed it.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's just I didn't really care. [20:27]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah. You were indifferent to... in a way to it; to what was going on.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I... I... I knew that they couldn't... even if they did keep me legally after my curfew, then it wasn't my fault and I wouldn't get screwed for it, and I had nothing to hide, so I just went along and played their games. Now if I would have had something to lose, like if I would have been carrying something that I shouldn't have. Like I was thinking of carrying this pipe, you know, in my belt loops where they wouldn't find it. They would have found it, you know, and then I would have really had it. At the time, I was carrying a rockedy [jam pack] (ph). That didn't go over too good. They didn't see it though I guess. That's amazing. The guy... he frisked me twice, and then he sits there and he goes back on his radio and he has me standing in front of the car, and I just politely dropped the rocks, you know. I could have knocked him out while he was bending over or something. It's really weird how dumb the policemen are.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It's... it's a very strange feeling to be in that situation and have them not notice that and...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, it's really. It's... it is playing a game, in that the policemen themselves make it a game. Nobody else does. They just kind of...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It sounds like them playing it somehow causes you to play it too. So you're both playing a game. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Well, really, you see if they was doing what they're supposed to be doing, like running around and nailing people speeding, and stopping bank robberies, and that such... sort of thing. No, they're picking up people off the streets, because they have nothing left to do. And I said, "Are you done with me? [It's a really hot night.] (ph)" I said, "There's all kinds of things to do. And then they can afford to send two squad cars; my neighborhood only has five squad cars, and one of them is not in use at any time, which means that's half their force tied up with me doing nothing. So... [22:25]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Seems pretty ludicrous to you, pretty funny. [Think fast] (ph)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: (chuckles) The crowning thing; after the whole thing is over, the cop says, "Well, I guess you're okay.", and I says, "That's nice. Now can I keep going now, or can you give me a ride to the... to the line now?", and I... I didn't ask. I didn't have the guts to ask them. I [just turned around] (ph). I didn't think I'd get it anyway. "Bye guys". So I just started walking and the cop says, "Oh, good luck on your court.", and I said, "Oh, brother". (chuckles) I was about to turn around and really lay into him, you know, just start yelling at him or something. I couldn't...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It made you really angry that... what was it? That he was taking it that lightly?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Well, he... he detains me this whole time. I'm standing there freezing. He won't even let me sit in his squad car. They have things in the back of the squad car where you... they can sit... where you can sit now. I mean, there's no handles on the insides of the doors and so, you know, you can't get away. You can't do anything because you're in the back. But no, no. Nice warm squad car, but I was standing out there in front of his headlights so he can watch me, and then he has the nerve to wish me good luck, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: So you were pretty angry when you left there and pretty disgusted?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Kind of glad it was over though.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Um hm. Relieved.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And then I wondered about, "What am I going to ask them?" to play the games of fencing with the police. They didn't act that bad though. They're a lot better than a girl. You have to do something to get them to stop you. I said that how many doing hitchhiking are going to do it to (Coney Island) (ph) the other way, completely opposite direction. [24:44]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You aren't going to try this again?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Not that way. (chuckles) I might start in Brighton and go up to Coney Island, but I doubt it. I've been walking around Long Island a lot lately, you know. Seen a lot of people that I never saw before. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: So, you're noticing things that you hadn't noticed before now?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Um. Seemed pretty nice. I used to... for the least little thing and I'd go downtown and drive my car, like if I need a quart of milk, or I got to mail a letter, got to get some gas, you know. I used this... I... I always looked forward to this drive downtown, you know. I don't drive downtown anymore. I walk. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And you choose to walk now.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And [I pull that night thing] (ph). Some of the streets are pretty boring though.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Was it more peaceful? 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And more interesting things to see with?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and I'm not polluting the air, (chuckles) and I'm not wasting on gasoline either. I've been running on this tank of gasoline for almost a week and I figure I have at least two or three days left on it, you know, which is nice. [26:07]

</p><p>Called my girl last night. The money I saved [for not] (ph) _______________.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: I see. I see. That was your... that was what you were saving for?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: No, but you know, I'm... I'm generally conserving money right now.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: I see.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Permits the one thing that I can... I've spent a little bit on is keeping in touch with her. I mean, I was pretty mad at the beginning, because I told her in a letter the week before that I was going to call her at 10:30 last night or 10:00, you know. So I called at ten to and nobody was there. Called at five to; it was busy. Called at 10:00; nobody was there. Called at five after; it was busy. So (chuckles) nobody's there, then it's busy. Nobody's there, then it's busy. I mean, ten minutes either side of when I was supposed to call, you know. So about 12 after I called and she picks it up and she says, "Hi", you know, and I said, "Hi, Jess. Where were you?", you know. And she said, "I've... I've been sitting here for the past half hour waiting for your call". I guess the... the lines are getting crossed up, because then they have a party line on top of it, and she failed to inform the other people on the party line that she was expecting a call. So anyway, finally got through, and then... then it was pretty nice. I hadn't talked to her for about a week.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But it was good to hear from her _______________.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It was kind of discouraging a little bit, because just the fact that I was talking to her kind of rubbed it in because she was there and I was here.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Um hm, and the fact that you had to talk to her over the telephone too?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I almost started crying. [28:14]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Just thinking about her being gone there?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And how much you miss her?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. That's what I told her. I said, "I miss you a whole lot.", and she said, "I missed you too". I think she misses me more than I miss her, because there's so much... it's kind of like an insecurity of this, you know, what far away from home means, not really knowing too many people. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But it sounds like you miss her pretty much too, um hm.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I wish I didn't have these idiotic travel _______________.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: They keep you from seeing her.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Um hm. And sometimes I think that maybe I should get used to it. Good possibility of this happening for a long time. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It really is. Fear of flying; it's going to be here for a long time too.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Just kind of... I don't know, just kind of accept it. Not like it's something that, "Oh, I have to do this.", you know. It's just kind of taking it, you know. It still hurts a little bit to think about it.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It hurts. I guess it leaves kind of a hole in your life with her going?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Um hm, and to know that maybe I'm not going to see her for a long, long time.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It's like a long time stretching out. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I just wonder how she would ever get up to Fargo, North Dakota? That's what I think about

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It seems pretty far I know, doesn't it?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: _______________

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Need someone to speak to, you know. [30:50]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It's really, really hard to think... thinking about a separation.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's lonely, but it's not really too hard, so I just kind of keep myself busy doing things, you know. I don't think about it, then it's not hard at all really, because I'm all caught up in what I'm doing, you know. But then sometimes at night I think... I kind of dream about what it would be like to take a camping trip or something with her, you know.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It's only when you stop being busy that it really feels bad?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: When you think about the things you could be doing together.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Think about some of the beautiful places that I've seen that I'd like to go with her.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You'd like to share with her. [32:09]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I don't think she's ever been camping. I think she'd like it. I think she'd like it a lot. And when I start thinking about that, that's when it hurts because that's... like that's even farther away than even just seeing that.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And it's so long before you can do those kind of things. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: My idea of a camping trip with her would be in Canada. I'd really like that. Well, you drive for 80, 90 miles on a gravel road, and then you come to the end of the road and you just park there and you start walking. (crosstalk)

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (crosstalk) stuff?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. We've done a lot of canoeing, so I [wouldn't think it'd hurt] (ph). Because I really... I like the towns, the country up there. I used to go up there all the time. Not that far, but to - what is it? Toronto? No.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But it's beautiful, like it's wild country up there...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: ...and you can just imagine...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Very few people too. That would be... that would be really nice to be alone with her with no fathers; nobody looking over your shoulder.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You could do just what you like.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Nobody putting the spotlight on you when you're parked at night. Like with some people are afraid to be with another person for a long time, you know, because they think, you know, "Well, it's going to start going bad.", and usually it does, you know. But I don't think that would happen. I think it would get better. I think it would.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And you're not worried about that at all?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Uh huh. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Wow. The two of you would grow closer if you spent more time together? [34:57]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: You see, I think part of it is like we would be completely free to express anything we wanted to each other. But like that's always kind of a hang-up, because whenever we... just being with each other, you know. There's always somebody else around, and that kind of bothers her sometime and sometimes it kind of bugs me.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You're never really alone together.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. It's like there's always somebody there, like it's a party or something, you know. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: There's somebody there (crosstalk)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Or a show. Yeah. You're always waiting for somebody to walk in. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And you can never be totally relaxed and say and do just what you two want to.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Uh huh. I read an article today in a... one of these outdoor magazines, you know. Like these guys took a... they drove up to this place. It cost them about $50 a piece, just their expenses. They parked on this road and took their canoe on this lake; went to the other end of the lake; foraged; went to the other end of another lake. I mean, they just took two weeks, and they only saw three people the whole time they were there, and that was when, you know, they came back.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Wouldn't that be great?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Just... not for a long time; just for a little while. [36:38]

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Kind of what I'm hearing is there's... that it's such a luxury to get away by yourself somewhere?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Um hm. (inaudible at 36:50) really there. Nobody makes you pay to live. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And then here, you're always having to pay for things, but out there you...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: You don't have money to do that. You're either in debt or in jail. There if you don't... if you do have money, it doesn't matter. It's not going to help you. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And... and that's something it sounds like that would make you feel more secure because you don't have that much, and it also sounds like you like that idea.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I kind of like that [you talk permissive] (ph). I enjoyed it, because that's what you want.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Um hm. What you really want is something for nothing; something you don't have to pay for. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: You got to pay for a fishing license. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (chuckles) I... I also am hearing it like there aren't that many things in your life that you've ever felt you've had without paying for them.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: No, there's not. Whatever I got and didn't have to pay for was usually what I didn't want, and then whatever I really needed, I usually ended up paying double for or more than I thought was... you know, after I had it, I thought, "That was what I wanted". It wasn't worth half as much money.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It sounds like it's almost hard for you even to imagine what it would be like to get something without having to really pay... pay over for it.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Like right now, I'm... I'm trying to work out a deal where I trade this... this engine I have that has a cracked bracket, but it has all brand new racing parts in it, and I've had it for about a year and a half now. It's never been run or anything, so all the parts are in perfect condition, and they're all very good quality materials that are in it. There's nothing really slipshod about it, and if I can sell that engine to this guy, I know another guy that has a rebuilt transmission that he will give me for virtually nothing. So I may end up selling something that's useless to me and getting something that I can use, then maybe a little money on top of that. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Wouldn't that be really good [if you set this one up] (ph)...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: ...to gain something?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: If it works, or if... if I could work some kind of a trade deal. I know what... what would happen I think but... I have... I have something that someone else wants, and I want something that someone else has, and I just hope it works out. [40:14]

</p><p>I think part of it is too that... like working with cars and stuff, I end up with all these exotic speed equipment cars, which are really useless for what I want to build, you know, and it's really good stuff but I can't use any of it.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Uh huh. It'd be good for somebody, but not you.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's worthless to me. I don't know. I don't want to... if I possibly can, I think I'm going to try and buy a truck; not buy, but trade my car for a truck, you know, an old camper, or a van, or something like that, because I have an engine sitting in the garage. I have two engines right now. One I'm going to use some day, and the other one I'm going to throw out if nobody buys it. 

</p><p>I have an engine for... that'll fit in the truck. I have a transmission for it. They're both in good shape, and if I have to, I'll replace the whole drive line because I have that too. Like I said, I have all these oddball... these useless... I have all these useless parts that are no good to me right now, but if I had a truck...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: If you had a truck, they'd be right.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: ...I'd just put them in. It wouldn't even have to be running because it would be after I had time, and it wouldn't cost me hardly anything, and I would have a much nicer vehicle, more suited to my need. Like my car is nice and all, but it's too small.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You want something bigger to ride around in?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I... yeah. It's just that there's no room in it. Like, you know, I would like to have a vehicle that I can live in for now. That would really be good.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Would you take it camping?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. But you can't do that with a car. (chuckles) Well, you can I suppose but...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It's hard.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Like right now I can flip bucket seats, fold down, and the whole car's like a bed, you know, on the inside. It's nice, but then you think, "Now where... where you going to eat?" 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Pull out the glove compartment. (laughs)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty small. Now a truck would be much better for that, and I'm glad I'm not worried about that. I'm not going to have the chance to go camping for a long time. [43:38]

I'm going to try and find some books this week to read.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Because you're interested in reading now you mean, or what?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I'm devouring everything in the house. It's mostly junk, so I said that I better find something that would really stimulate me before I get bored. I'm Pan. I'm tuning on the piano too, like kind of [an accomplished player] (ph).

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It _______________?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Just like I make up my... most pop songs are basic rhythm pattern, and I just started inventing my own patterns. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: I was thinking, you know, I don't think I have any books you'd be interested in, but you'd be... you know, you'd be... you'd be welcome to borrow a book if you found something you wanted to read, but I don't have much except psychology text books. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I don't mind those.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Well, you can take a look if you're interested. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I've read a lot of psychology books. Those are them?

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Um hm. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I've always wondered how many books those were. It never occurred to me that you... you could read before you were buying them.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: They were (right) (ph).

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. You did that too. I don't know. I've been wanting to... to get a book on the [transactional neurosis] (ph). Kind of new. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Yeah. I don't have any books on that. 

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Except it's too expensive. They haven't put it on paperback yet, so we can just wait awhile. It's kind of inter... I read a couple of books that were like that. I mean, they were kind of hard to understand, because they're a little bit different than the... the regular... than regular... most schools of psychology now. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: I don't know which... you mean the (Eric Burn) (ph) book. Is that what you're talking about?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: I was reading that, yeah. This is by a guy named Harris. It's called "I'm Okay, You're Okay". There's this guy on the radio on it... on his talk show. He's always pushing this book, you know, and for no... see they had that author on one day, and the author's really brave, you know, I think. He really has... I think he has a good idea in... in the book and I would like to get the book, but not for five-and-a-half dollars.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: (laughs)

</p><p>RESPONDENT: But hey, it was... it's a lot like Burn... there's some other guy wrote a book like that too. I can't remember, but I read it. Oh, well. And I wanted to read "Push Comes to Shove" too. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: What's that "Push Comes to Show"?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, shove. It's by...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: "Push Comes to Shove" (laughs).

</p><p>RESPONDENT: It's... it's about campus violence.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Oh, never heard of it. [46:40]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: There's a... the cover... it's really wild. This Harvard student wrote it, and on the front cover there's pic... there's little symbols of hands, you know, human hands. And the first symbol is the peace symbol, and then... I forget what the second symbol is, you know. It's not that important though. About half-way through, it turns into a clenched fist, you know. Then down at the bottom it's... it has a - what do you call it? I don't know what you call it? It's just the middle finger sticking up, you know, like f**k you. "Push Comes to Shove", you know. [Glad you vote for] (ph) traditional hand signals. I mean, I want to... I want to read that. I mean, I think I'm always getting involved in what's going on in the world now more than I was. Maybe it's that talk show that's affecting me or something because... like I never... everybody talks about the Kent State Massacre and all that. I never knew what was going on, and I didn't really care. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: All of a sudden you're getting aware of what's going on. Interesting.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And, yeah. Last week I read an article in the "Newsweek" about how it was true, you know, and it was the National Guard that shot, you know. They not only shot four people and killed them, but they wounded 11 others, and it kind... it really shook me up, you know. I said, "Oh, God, where have I been?", you know. "What's going on here?" People are getting killed and I don't even know about it.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: And here I am sitting in the corner without noticing and not knowing.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And it's listening to that... to that talk show. They really bring a lot of stuff in, and the people that call in are very intelligent. Like they're... they not [48:33] only have something to say to the moderator, but they... they have information to give out to the people. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But you suddenly seem more interested in worrying about it, or you were caught up by the issue.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Maybe it's just to keep myself from getting bored again. It is interesting the way that... that he puts things, you know. Like his... his (class) (ph) is very much like mine. Maybe it's mine. I think so. But you know, he continually can see through the propaganda that people put out now, both radical propaganda and conservative propaganda if there is such a thing. I mean, he's always pointing out how... how really assuming the people... the labels people put on each other are. There's... there's so much that goes with a label, you know, that the label is useless. It's not... I don't know what... how to... to describe it. It's kind of insights in... real good insights into...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Perceptive...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: ...in cutting through things.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: He can cut through things and separate it and get some of the basic pointers say, "Well, what are you guys fighting about?", you know. "You should be talking about this point instead of fighting with all these stupid words.", you know. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Cut through the... all those words to the real issues behind them.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And at... at first... the first time I listened to that I didn't believe that... that was going on and then I raved, you know, "Not in my campus.", but, you know, I couldn't believe it, you know. So I listened to the whole show, two hours, and I... I'm amazed by it all. This... this is phenomenal. I hope this guy... I wonder if they only put... usually when you get something like that, they only put the guy on once or twice and then (inaudible). This guy he's every day. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Who is this guy? [50:58]

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Stan Dale. [Two little names] (ph) and he shouldn't be on any of them.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: All day.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: He was saying about how in California on this one radio show it's 24 hours continuous talk, and they have five or six different moderators on it, and they mix them up, you know, hawks and doves, and radicals and conservatives and revolutionaries, and the whole bit. And they mix them all up, and it comes out perfect. There's... there's... they never run out of people to talk to. There's always somebody on that line. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: You know, you're talking about listening to this (inaudible) saying anything. Looks like you can really get turned on about intellectual issues, and ideas, and like that really...

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Uh huh. Especially when the... when they... when they put it so clear, you know. And then some of the people that call in are really... they're not clear at all, and it's kind of a... a contrast, you know, because then... then I... then I put my brain to work and figure it out what the... what the guy who's calling in is really saying...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: But... and you really enjoy being active.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And so... Yeah. And then...

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Putting your brain to work, yes.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And then Stan Dale comes on, you know, and I listen to him and most the stuff he says makes pretty good sense. You don't have to stop and figure it out. It's right there. It's obvious. And I don't know... there's... there's a real attraction there. Maybe... maybe it's because there's somebody else figuring it out... it out too, you know. It's just besides me. Right. It makes me feel like, you know, I'm not alone in that. There's somebody else alive in this world with feelings... (chuckles)

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Actually it's kind of a link between you and that other person.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Connection.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: And then on top of it most of the people that call in are really just about as bright, and it gives you a whole new outlook, you know. Like people aren't really as stupid as you think they are.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Makes you feel optimistic?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Maybe the silent majority is, but... because the people that call in aren't silenced. What do you call them? 

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: The vocal minority.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. That walking really wore me out. It's that I had cramps in my legs, you know. I ate something, which was a mistake and it just felt like lead. It wouldn't digest. It just kind of flapped in there and I'm just like... [he woke up the next morning] (ph) and... and the cramps were gone (inaudible) instead. He's gone away mad.] (ph) I'm really dragging.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Ready for another danger?

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Well, that's... that's two (inaudible) you can have. They're adventures in a short period of time.

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: Short-term adventures. It's about time to stop.

</p><p>RESPONDENT: Um hm. When is our next meeting?

</p><p>INTERVIEWER: How is...

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: File 222-115 (ph)- Session No. 4, January 19, 1975 (ph) (laughter) [inaudible until 0:00:44.9]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Are we taping over another session there?

</p><p>THERAPIST: No, that was on the other track, that thing where you... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I see, that's what that little dude there is.

</p><p>THERAPIST: This little thing here is for tracks.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I see.

</p><p>THERAPIST: This, is to make it go forth and back.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'll stick with Sony, never find my way around a Bell (ph).

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: (yawning) Well I'm still not working.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Why? Is that a snafu in the hiring?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is. They hired me, I went down and filled out all the papers and I was supposed to start work at some place way out south.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Really (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: And then they, come to find out, that the guy that I was going to replace really hasn't left the job, he was on leave of absence. So I said, "Well I'll go to one of the places up north and get rid of one of the guys that's a democrat and they put [inaudible at 0:01:40.8]... in. (chuckling) So they transferred him somewhere else and then they're going to put me in there when they get rid of him. But as of yet I haven't heard any word on it. They've been putting it off three days at a time, putting it off steadily since January 1st.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's got to be a government job, nobody else could handle something like that.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are you not getting paid at all?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not at all. I finally got a check today, the last check from my own job that's now three weeks overdue and I have four bounced checks waiting on me that I have to pay charges on.

</p><p>SPEAKER(?): Drop.

</p><p>PATIENT: So I'll try and scarf that up today and run it down to the bank before anything else comes bouncing out of it.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Let me check something out with you. The other day when we were finished, I had a distinct feeling of you, I don't know if you remember what you talked about, but you were telling me about the time that you were taken to the hospital and Jessica and a friend of hers took you out. And you were telling me about this and something that you had discovered about wanting to go back and then to go back to [inaudible at 0:03:01.7]... that you were in the hospital and you're, like you're planning something that seemed important. And I, you said something as you walked out the door like, "Its very interesting and some people have gotten into it." And I have a distinct feeling that you felt cut off and that... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, no. No, not cut off in the least. It's like, I couldn't even remember it very well now because I trip (ph) into that stuff just all the time. But it's like I had felt when I left that I had said it fairly clearly. Usually when I get into that I'm stoned and it's just kind of a fun thing to rap on. If it doesn't upset people, why then it's fun to rap on because it does have a lot of freaky little twists in it. But I felt as I left, I looked back on it and said, "Well that almost made sense, considering I was straight." And I mean, considering I could be more critical of it, it still almost made sense to me, it probably didn't you. But anyway, I was thinking that maybe that's why people actually can find some sense to it sometimes. It may actually have a structure to it. To me it very, it's just an absolutely crazy thing that I like to talk about.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like a spin-off or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It was just kind of a thought (ph) in the air and... 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Okay. I guess then that touches off, like the other feeling I had, which I guess I apply (ph) more hope (ph) or are concerned about. - I just flipped myself in the eye.

</p><p>PATIENT: Hope you don't have contacts.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I do, that's it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, God.

</p><p>THERAPIST: We're all right though. But I guess the thing that bothered me was, I wondered if you felt at all like tolerated or like, I was just sitting here listening to you spin-off this thing that kind of sounds weird and I hadn't gotten into it and I wasn't interested at all or some kind of thing like that. And I think it was what... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...you said about, "...some people get into it..." or "...some people find it interesting...", that kind of concerned me.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no. To tell you the truth, I thought of that after I left. I thought, "Wow! No doubt that probably struck the wrong way." That wasn't what I meant by it. It was, well like I said, I couldn't explain it myself then, I was still just rapping. I don't know how I got into that rap. I had not slept the night before and I thought (ph) that I'd come in here and just kind of sit in a daze like we did the time before. And as a matter of fact, when I woke up that morning, I had a little bottle of crystalline methedrine that I was going to snort some up before I came down, I figured that would get me going if anything did. But I just said, "Well I feel awake enough for at least an hour session." And it turned out I was. And I was just kind of speed rapping and I even mentally speed rapped to myself all the way home on the same kind of subjects. No, there was no cutoff of it because when I get into that kind of thing, I could talk to a wall almost as well as to a person. It's talking to myself as much as anything because I just like to go back through it. I'm always finding something knew to go, "Wow! Look at this." Just something like that, it's fun, interesting, confusing. [0:06:15.6]

</p><p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like you've, from where you were, like you were really sort of surprised that you had that much energy in a way and also, very surprised that it made that much sense (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I was, I was real happy with it. I think that was probably one of the best sessions we've had. I don't know what insight it came to but I enjoyed it, as many as [anyone can.] (ph) [0:06:36.8] I don't know, it's kind of like they said, I think it was [inaudible]... I just love to rap anyway. And something (ph), I don't know how you grade it but something's, whether it be me or other people, but something like that, is the kind of thing that they'll get wrapped up in. (yawning) Lord. [blank audio from 0:07:13.6 to 0:07:44.5] I kind of surprised myself yesterday. I think it was yesterday. It was such an absolutely nothing day that at the end of it I went to sleep very happy and contented. I was surprised that it didn't get me down. I got up at eleven, because I knew I didn't have a job yet, and I guess it was about 11:30, live down in the basement, and I came upstairs and took a shower. Went downstairs and didn't have any mail. It's been about two weeks now since I've gotten any mail. Ate lunch, went back upstairs and called my old job and found out I didn't have my check yet. Called my new job and was told that it had been put off at least another day. And I kind of said, "Well to hell with it." And I started to write a letter and fell asleep, after sleeping until 11:30. So I went back downstairs and started reading a book and fell asleep again. Woke up at 5:30 when they called for dinner and went upstairs to eat dinner. And I remembered that, that night I was going to go see Cannonball [inaudible at 0:08:52.8]... The only thing in a week's time there that was worth being awake for. Then I found out that the guy that was supposed to get the tickets for us had only got tickets for himself, after he had promised us all and even told us that he had gotten these tickets. So I figured that I'd have to wait until my friend came home from work, since he was the only one that had money, and then he and I would skip over and we wouldn't get as good of tickets and we wouldn't get the student discount but we'd get to see it. But he didn't make it home until eleven o'clock. (yawning) There was supposed to be a kilo come through, that blew it. So we just sat around just doing absolutely nothing all night long. And for [somebody turned out of it,] (ph) [0:09:33.0] it didn't seem to bother me at all. I was, looking back on it I was, even at the time, I was saying, "Wow! I'm not depressed. It's not heeding the medicating effect on me." And I don't know why. (chuckling) I wish I knew what defense it was I had and canceled any of that effecting me, but for some reason or another, it just didn't seem to bother me at all.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you concede (ph) that as well, that it had to be a defense. It wasn't any kind of positive, due to any positive [inaudible at 0:10:10.1].. or whatever you want to call it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well there certainly, there wasn't anything that I could point at that can counter having all of the, absolutely [inaudible at 0:10:20.2]... nothings happen. I mean, they weren't even [inaudible]... by anything. The only thing that was enjoyable the entire day was maybe eating my meals, which I don't do very often. And I went over and rapped with my brother that evening and had a good time. It's not often Mark and I, we seem to be quite different and usually, the way we get along best is to not see each other very much, but we do really enjoy it when we can. We seem to get into the right negative talk. But other than that it was just absolutely nothing all night long, all day long. I suppose the sleeping made it that much more (chuckling) [inaudible at 0:10:59.5]... If you've got to do nothing that's sure a good way to do it. For about, since almost January 1st, up until about three days ago, I was feeling quite sick. Well not violently ill but I had a low-grade fever, some swollen glands in my throat that made me sore and just pretty achy and I couldn't think straight for two weeks. And it's like after a while, a low-grade fever, I just kind of get into this buzz that's this kind of daze, that I know my thoughts aren't working right, I know I don't have a memory and all this, but it just doesn't seem to click in that I should. It's just that it's not there, not that it should be. And in the last few days I seemed to have gotten over it for the main part and my heads cleared up. And I think I'm just kind of having fun (ph) getting [inaudible at 0:11:59.5]... the idea of working again.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, wow! I mean it's strange, I sit here and how do I feel like talking when I'm here? I feel like, I don't know whether that's what I'm supposed to do or whether that's because I feel like I'm supposed to or not, but, well I just feel like I ought to rap something out. And it's kind of strange, I'll just kind of go through whatever happens to come into my mind and the, "That I could say something about and that I couldn't." Because maybe I don't, I'd never stop to say anything about it or maybe I didn't understand it well enough at the time. Like I really don't even know what I'm saying right now, except it just struck me as strange. I was sitting here looking out the window and several things sliced through and I kind of categorized them as which would be good to talk about, which I could and which I couldn't.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're suddenly aware you're doing it, you're not really sure why one falls into one category and... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...one falls into the other category.

</p><p>PATIENT: I have no idea of how I rate them, I just know that some I could say something about and some I couldn't. I don't know whether it's even because some I wouldn't want to say something about. I haven't come across one of those yet, but that will be interesting. (chuckling)

</p><p>THERAPIST: So you're saying, "Well I'm not aware of keeping anything back but there's really something about some of these things that are not worth mentioning or it's not..."

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It's I just, I don't know what it is that's not worth it, because some of the things I say, I well, I don't rate them but I don't doubt some of the things I say don't seem to make much sense anyway. But like some nonsensical things mean more to me [then it's not sensical things.] (ph) [0:14:03.2]

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like almost that simple a fact, it's no big rating scale for each one... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...you're talking about.

</p><p>PATIENT: Wow! That's some of the first, best sunshine I've seen in weeks.

</p><p>THERAPIST: That's why you put on the power? Oh, yeah. That's the power, it's neat. In a summer storm that thing turns green... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why?

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...it's great. Just the way the light goes... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh.

</p><p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 0:14:43.0]... on it. Like that power against the summer storm sky, when there's a tornado around somewhere, is... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, that'd be out of sight. Do you have tornados here very often?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Have you ever had one in the city?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Out of sight! I mean, that's not cool for the people but that is sure weird.

</p><p>THERAPIST: [Not that close here, about 80 to 100,000, there are quite over like 30 in Halstead (ph) that I can.] (ph) [0:14:59.5]

</p><p>PATIENT: When I was a kid back in Idaho, spring and late summer used to be really fascinating, because I can remember years when we'd go for three and four weeks straight and if not every day, every other day, we'd have tornado warnings.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And at least twice a week there'd be one sighted [inaudible at 0:15:28.1]... it was just so fascinating. We used to get, and we never did go to any shelters or anything but it got to be fun, because the people that did, we'd go over and talk to them and if you wanted a part you went over to the shelter because there was always one there, whoever had, had a basement. It was always fun to go out and run around, see if you could make it to a neighbor's house to get somebody's book or somebody's record or something and make it back without getting beat to death by the hail stones. (chuckling) [blank audio from 0:15:54.8 to 0:17:17.8] I was talking with Mark last night and through the course of the conversation we got into family history. And he mentioned that he could remember, well my dad was, I don't remember where he was, I think he was in the service. I know he was in Europe when Mark was born. Mark was about two years old and he remembered living, when he and mom lived in the basement of some cousin's, well aunt and uncle's house, mom's sister's, and he was about two years old, couldn't have been much older than that. And it kind of surprised me because I mentioned, I don't think I have any memories that I could place before I was about three or four. And he asked me, "What do you remember, the math (ph) emotionally?" And it kind of surprised me because I've thought often that memories that I have before, even as late as high school, always seem to be from me and the world (ph), it's two different things and I lived in me and I looked out at the world. And starting at, it came on kind of gradually and then snapped on me just after I graduated from high school, a kind of different position of me and the world, looking at me as functioning in it and being part of it. And he said, "What kind of a state do you remember being in, in some of your earliest childhood memories?" And I couldn't really explain because I don't remember them, the real emotions then, maybe just kind of a blandness and a taking for granted of security and everything else. Not that I felt security, it was just something that was there and had always been. I'm just wondering if that was anywhere near normal? Do people normally grow up, do they grow up as themselves first and then grow up as themselves in the world? I wouldn't expect there'd be an answer. It's just something to ponder for the main part.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well I feel that you're trying to hook into that in some way. I was really thinking about...more thinking about, first of all experience, rather than psychological theory because I must say, an expert on child development I ain't, in any way, and I'm not sure I know why (ph). [0:20:14.1]

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay, I found something else interesting. As was obvious with what I was saying about those acid trips, now those are the most crucial experiences to me to this effect. Mark went through something extremely similar to this when he was 13 and he was scared shitless and probably quite insane, although I wasn't old enough to know it being only eight or nine myself, 13. No, I'm five years younger than him at any rate.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But we were talking about people that doubt the existence of reality or doubt the reality of the reality that's put in front of them. And I've often wondered, I know of several people that are like that. That have had experiences like that and maybe that still experience some, a little bit of, maybe it's there, maybe it isn't. And I had always thought that everyone, at one point or another, came to that point, where they had boiled everything else down, like people with the [inaudible at 0:21:22.3]... with the systematic doubt - I think therefore I am. I always kind of figured that, at one point or another, everybody went through that. And as I started talking with Mark about that, my friend Jim was there, and he mentioned that nothing like that had ever occurred to him. He'd always taken it for granted, it was real, it has to be, it's there. And Mark mentioned that, yeah, probably 90 percent of the people had never really learn - you never can learn - never doubt or try to doubt the reality of what's around them. And I just kind of wondered what it was that would trip a person into that? Like what kind of an experience it would take? I couldn't find any similarities between what tripped Mark into that and what would trip me into that. And I have great doubt it's hereditary. (chuckling)

</p><p>THERAPIST: But you're saying, what are the, there has to be something that you and Mark share that made you voice that concern or made you get to that kind of ultimate question?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wonder if it's a point of looking out from a certain philosophical point or is it more of a theological question that a person would have in them? Or just what is it that gives you wise to that experience?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it could maybe come from several different points. I know a person right now that [inaudible at 0:23:01.7]... I think I mentioned him before, Matt (ph)?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: That is super withdrawn and that's kind of the thing that's bothering him. He seems to feel that, well I won't voice this for him because no one's even talked to him in the last four or five months, except for one person.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And from what he said and from Matt's actions and from what I knew of Matt before, it seems that Matt has kind of decided that, if the world is real it doesn't make sense and it doesn't have any goal or promise, and most likely it's not real and therefore, he's forced to live a very painful joke.

</p><p>THERAPIST: [Yeah, that's kind of why I'm worried.] (ph) [0:23:43.6]

</p><p>PATIENT: And I've known people to at least temporarily accept that kind of thing and it seems to bum them out, but I mean, they eventually get over it or are, I don't know, accept it with some kind of philosophical outcome. And Matt has, for quite a few months now, he's become radically different. He used to be very extroverted. He had fun with us. He went out and did things. He was very nice to people, always very cautious and aware of the relationship between people. And had mentioned several times how he's always trying not to upset or kind of give anybody hassles. And now days it seems that even friendships and people around him are so unreal or so mean, thus that he doesn't care about it anymore. He lives in isolation. You say hi to him on the street, most likely he'll either give you the bird or he'll say, "Fuck you." Or something like that or he won't pay any attention to you at all, which is any three, it's just a toss up.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I have a morbid curiosity and a great fear that whatever it is that's bothering him, whatever that's made him accept this kind of an outlook could become permanent, which I would consider insane. I have admitted for years that I'm crazy, on the basis that I'm so much different from everybody else. I think everybody's crazy. But craziness to me is when it's uncomfortable, when you can't accept it. And that's what Matt seems to be doing. And I don't know whether it upsets me for his sake or for my sake, but it does, to see him that way.

</p><p>THERAPIST: And you're saying, you don't know whether you're empathizing with him or whether you're reacting because there's something about Matt that makes you actively uncomfortable in yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Now if... 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute, let me ask you something. When you were talking about being a kid, being a little one, and the way things looked to you. Are you hooking that up with this kind of philosophical stance or this kind of...?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No, I hadn't at the time, but it is a good idea.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well I don't know if it's a good idea or not, I just wondered if that [overlapping voices at 0:26:19.1]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I've never looked at the human relation, I mean, it could be interesting but, now I suppose they would connect very closely. I used to think, I used to look back on that kind of condition as something that I cherished, that I would... 

</p><p>THERAPIST: The doubting (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, the childhood thing of just being tricked into, whatever you're doing, do to yourself. Everything you do is yourself. A child especially, is one of the most open person I've ever know. If they want to say something, they say it, they don't, they don't. And they're taught that the hassles that eventually will come to them, they're taught that they can't say things, that they can't do things, that they shouldn't be themselves in certain situations. And whenever I used to see somebody that would strike me as being, they were completely, seemingly carefree and just plain. I used to describe them as a four or five year old kid, and it was like complimenting them. But I've begun to wonder also, if a person has something inherently in them, well what it would be is, I wonder if there is any game in learning what we learn, by supposedly maturing, by learning not to be ourselves or by learning to be in control of ourselves and be able to put ourselves in a submissive position.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's almost like there's so much to pay, you're wondering what's the good of it or what's... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...is there any good to it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And it's kind of like, wow! Now see this, is the first time I've gone to this and that you tripped me up on that, that's really fun. But if like, Matt has decided that maybe just being himself is the only thing that's worth it anyway, since nothing is real, and since it's painful, the world has been painful to him, why then he's also bitter against it. So he has no qualms about letting them know he's bitter, so he has no qualms about walking up to someone who has been his friend and saying, "Fuck you! Go away." It's like he's got the worst of both. He's open as a child and yet he is bitter, he might have the bitterness of the person that has learned to be submissive to himself.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's like, when a child is open you see him taking in experiences and reacting openly to them and there is something good about the course of that. Well Matt's open all right but what he takes in makes him spew out acid... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...and these things, because what he takes in hurts him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It's like a kid doesn't doubt the reality around him, yet it may be painful to him. Like he may not dig it but he knows it's real. Whereas, Matt is open to it but also has these philosophies that [are logical to the child in him.] (ph) [overlapping voices at 0:29:28.0]...

</p><p>THERAPIST: So it's like all the time he knows he not really taking in anything real or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like there's a terrible urgency (ph) to it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like it's a very painful joke to him. Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: And why not spew out 'fuck you' to people when you were [actually attacking them.] (ph) [0:29:40.6] But it hurts you some way to watch him but you're not sure why, but it's [overlapping voices]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well in several different points it's, I mean, to me there is a parallel between Matt and between people who have messed themselves up with acid, that don't recover from it. Now I've heard scare stories of that for so long and I've never seen a case of it. I've seen an awful lot of freaks and I've known of an awful lot of [dope to be,] (ph) and then I freaked out several times myself. But I've never known any people to be messed up. In the last couple of months I've found of two cases of death (ph), where I don't know them myself but Jim knew one kid that, if you described him to me, sounded like me when I'm really stoned out. The guy would talk and he couldn't seem to understand what was going on. And he was always going (making noise), "Oh gosh, is that right? I mean, did I do something wrong?" And another guy told me, another kid that had really blown his cookies, and for some nine months afterward was virtually a vegetable. I can look on bad (ph) experience as like that and think that, now that it's over I can look back and learn from them, can use them, manipulate them, find some meaning to them, do whatever I want with them. That they're kind of like some, a toy from my mind, something to dwell on. But the fact that I might, the fear and the terror that was involved in them, seemed to fade faster than everything else. And I know that, right afterward I know I can look back and look back at it safely. For some reason or another the fear just doesn't come through to me like I experienced it. It scares me to death, the idea of freaking out, but looking on it doesn't bother me at all. But the idea of permanently being in that condition just scares me shitless. I'd never considered it as a likelihood for... 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...not even like the possibility before. In just the same way, I always figured that if a person kept their shit together and tried to be aware of what was going on around them, it's not likely they'd end up in Matt's position. And yet, it's just that kind of thing that seems to have freaked Matt out. He tried to be aware and he came across certain things that just didn't match up. Now I'm afraid that Matt, maybe I'm still right, because Matt seems to have [went the wrong.] (ph) [0:32:26.1] And he's given up on people and he's given up on reality.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Matt's is the staying kind of thing (ph) you're saying?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Now I have come across situations like Matt's but I usually manage to get through them. I get very depressed, I'm very upset, I'm very much in doubt of everything. But eventually I'll find something, things will start improving again and I'll get out of it. But I had, looking at Matt also, just like the fact that a bad trip might be permanent, I'm thinking one of those impressions could actually snap you to the point where you don't bother to try and come back.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like, it sounds like you have seen both the drug thing and whatever doubts and depressions that are similar to Matt's, that those have, having had limits for you. Like you went in, they were pretty awful, but somehow you always got out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: And you could look back and you really felt out of them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: But now you hear of two people and you see Matt who pretty much has had the limit and that frightens you. Like maybe those limits are not, "Maybe they're not something I can trust or..."

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think a good way to put it would be that, I've always looked at that kind of thing as, my mind would be ultimately stronger than whatever it was that was after it or whatever was [happening stopped.] (ph) [0:33:53.9] I even found it useful to have freaked out once. I mean, to have freaked out once, I have found it useful on occasion. To get very stoned and become scared and I could always say, "Wow! You'll come out of it. It doesn't matter what happens anyway." But, or even to have something very bad happen, I always, I can always say, "Well it's bad. You can understand how it's happened and it doesn't have to affect you quite that way." But it's this, just before Christmas, when I had a very bad time with some LSD. I remember thinking that, "Here I am again." That's the first thought that hit me. I think I told you about I already did the nitrous oxide, took a big hit of the nitrous. Passed out just (making noise) momentarily and stood up, knowing exactly where I was. I mean, right where my head was. I stood up and I said, "My God, do you know what I've just done?" And what I meant was I'd just freaked out. I realized it and I knew the state that my mind was in. Although I didn't even know what it was, it was scaring me. It took me a few more seconds to figure out what it was that had occurred to me there that seemed so terrible to me. But it was true, having freaked out before, that I was able to handle that one so much easier. It was a terrible time. It was like a real strong battle of strength. Which was stronger, the fear that I felt or that my mind might be able to hold it? And it was a constant battle for so many hours, because the only thing I had up my sleeve, so we say, was sooner or later the acid had to wear off. And it's a good thing I wasn't terribly stoned on acid then or I might have blown my cookies. But I just waited and tried to forget what it was that was scaring me. And I knew that sooner or later the acid would wear off and there is a point like it, at a peak. You'll rush and you'll peak and at that point, it's almost like a (making noise) snap of the fingers, you can feel things start going downhill. Your thoughts will start coming together, things will start making more sense and be more sedate you know about. And when that point (making noise) kind of hit me, I remember having a great feeling of triumph like, "Yes, my mind was stronger than what had scared me." But I've often taken that granted in my straight moments and had doubts but had a little bit of faith, when I'm really stoned out, except for that one time when I really didn't know what was going on at all. (chuckling) But conceive occasions where a person's mind isn't that strong, I was not used to. I really wasn't even aware of. And I wonder, is that a basic fault of people or of them? In other words, am I susceptible just as they are? Is there anything I could do for them, because maybe I'm not susceptible? Could they in turn, do the same thing to me, because they could enlighten me to the same thing that's blown them? [0:37:21.2]

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like much more personal than saying the situation has limits. It's like saying, "I've always been right with my mind and we've taken it on and gotten out of it..." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: "...and I don't know what..." It's really like saying, "It's one thing I'm frightened by seeing these people." It's like, "I don't know what it means for this to happen to people. Does it just happen to..." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: "...some?"

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: "Do I have to worry about me now? I've never worried about me before." I mean maybe in that risk way that you'd be when you're, well when you're driving your car fast you don't know if it'll take the corner or something. But you always know if you do it right it will, you can feel it hold.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: And you've always felt that you will hold.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. (chuckling) I don't know how I could put it much better than that. It's, I just don't really know whether that, I can find meaning of myself in that. There's two angles to that though. It's like both, I don't know what it means about me to me. And also, people mean an awful lot to me. I mean, Matt is a good friend of mine. I don't know whether there's anything I could do for him, because I have had experiences like that and been able to get over them. I really don't know whether these experiences that are worthwhile to me are worth a damn to anyone else, maybe they're useless. I intend sometime to try and talk to Matt but I really don't know how, because he's completely closed, doesn't want to talk to me. The other night, the few times that I've been around Matt, what he said was, "You're just so cryptic it doesn't make sense." It's, I always thought he was just being crazy, being... At first I thought it was rather obnoxious that some... We have a game of double-talk that we use to say, where you would say short phrases. "It's blue only on Tuesday. That's okay take it easy, they're under three feet tall." Things like that. And the idea was to, every person would say something in turn or just in communion, whenever somebody felt like something. The idea was to make it as smoothly unattached to what was said before. If somebody mentioned time and a color, you would have had to, you couldn't use time, color or something like that. Well Matt's comments struck me exactly that way and I thought, how...that's a fun game when you're stoned sometimes, for a short amount of time, but it's such a ridiculous way to be all the time. When even especially, when I try and be quite reasonable about him. But in a functional question like, "Is there mail today?" He would say something that didn't make sense to me. Well the other night, we happened to be up quite late, when we were all stoned out and down in the kitchen making toast and munchie food, and he came in and began talking to us. And I don't know whether tonight, that night, was if it was because it made sense to me and he was being less cryptical, though he was being less cryptic and therefore, I could understand him, but it was still quite cryptic. But it made sense and it made some very, very subtle, in-depth remarks as to a situation around us. And it was like he had a very, very wireless (ph) humor to the whole thing. I can't remember much [from then on] (ph), except that he took a can that was setting there on the floor and I am positive, I mean this, is my guess, but I'm positive in my guess, that he had it planned, the entire thing, the entire essence of what he knew was going to happen. He knew it was going to happen and he knew if he would be able to [inaudible at 0:41:18.2]... Took the can and set it on the floor and stood on top of it, while Jim and I were making some toast. Jim turned around and looked right into his chest. And Jim's as tall as Matt, so it's kind of freaky when he looked down and he said, "Oh God, I can." So I thought, "You've grown a foot and a half when you were floating off the floors." And things like that. Matt said, "Actually, you imagined the can. I am floating." And he stepped down and he picked up the can and I said, "Did I imagine the pineapples that I just ate out of it?" And he said, "Probably, check your stomach." Then he crumpled the can and he says, "It's not very strong, you really should strengthen your imagination." And he walked out. And I remember what it was, because Jim and I had been, Jim had been rapping on some sex experiences that [he'd been through] (ph) [0:42:07.8], it was just really [inaudible]... really, it was ridiculous. I mean, it's not even important. And I don't think Matt believed it at all. He thought it was just a very poor taste bar room story that was told. I knew it was real and the other guy there didn't care whether it was real or not anyway, it was funny to listen to. But I think that was Matt's comment on what had been going on before. I don't think Jim ever made the connection. Jim just thought it was very comical that he should be able to crumple the can and make the comment about the imagination.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well if you've got some kind of insight into how Matt's mind works or something or how Matt sees things, then it's... 

</p><p>PATIENT: [I wouldn't know.] (ph) [0:42:46.5]

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Me. But I'm sure that, that's what it was all about. Matt was making a comment on the conversation we were having 10 minutes before and that was his way of doing it.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know why he did that. I don't know whether he was saying that, you should make your stories better, you should... I'm not sure why it was he said that, but I am sure of the connection. A friend that talked to me not long ago, who is quite sensitive to such things and isn't unlikely to say it, but it was the first time I had ever heard him say something quite that strong. He is that one person that's managed to talk with Matt at all in the last four or five months, and he had scared him to death, it just really upset him. And he said he's the only person he's every talked with that he actually thought was a mystic. He could, Matt would voice the emotions that were being caused in the back of this guy's mind by the procedure of the conversation and he would do it quite consistently. And at one point Matt said something that just caused this guy to tremble in terror, at the idea of what must be going through Matt's mind.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And Matt said, "Yeah, I'm scared too." And the guy finally just, he started crying and then just kind of broke down and he left after that. But like I said, it's almost a curiosity. I don't know but whether Matt may find something good in all this. Because...I know it's very painful for him to find it anyway, whether he finds good or not.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like there's something that was made good for you, in just the bit that you understood, that connection that you made or that connection... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...that you got it. But that's what I meant by insight. Like you saw something that made his way [more than just...] (ph) [0:45:03.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like, I will listen quite closely from there on and it's very likely that his comments won't seem so cryptic. Many of them I probably won't understand because I know that his mind is, just must be working a million miles a second, because he seems to be so far in, under, above and behind and passed everything, in everything that he does, that I probably won't be able to catch up with much of it, but I'm sure I'll understand more of it than I did in the past, merely because I thought he was, I didn't pay attention to everything.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I wondered if that frightened you to understand that or to get that from (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did. For my shortcomings it did, not for Matt's, because I still don't understand him anyway, but I... 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think of what a fool I have been, because maybe Matt's been asking something of me, asking for help. Maybe Matt's been trying to communicate and we've all been taking it for granted that he couldn't or that he didn't, want to I mean. And I feel that maybe I've lost the responsibility of just being a friend to Matt. Mostly, it just left me in absolute amazement though. I hadn't understood at all that Matt made sense and it really amazed me that, and to understand that Matt not only made sense, but he made sense far beyond what we normally do in our conversations, I mean normal people, supposed normal people.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Sometimes that normal feeling thing, Matt seems so otherworldly, he's, you said he's in front of, in back of, all over the place from where we are, but suddenly you sense that he has, he was hooked into a live, additional dimension, to what you guys are doing or to...the way he sees you as a live dimension, to... I'm not sure, that's over intellectual I think.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well he could be one of two ways. Matt strikes me as either being free of the boundaries that we are or Matt, through his looking at the world from a completely different standpoint, looks at it, not from ours but from up, he's in the same thing but looking, I mean, it's like we're here doing our thing and he's here doing his, with us here, looking at us. He's working with us but not being part of us. Either way, it's like he has a vantage point of difference from all of us.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like a qualitative difference, it's not just he's a little farther back or a little up closer to it than his sidekicks (ph). He really can, he really does these things [that are] (ph)... [0:48:19.0]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I'm almost positive of that. And it's, I don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like that, which is what amazes me. Not that I think I have experienced everything but it amazes me that, that's why it amazed me, that's what I mean more. That I should understand it or it should make any sense to me.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Because it seems so very... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: ...alien to anything you've been in?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, right. Normally, I come across someone that seems to be fouled up in some way or another and I empathize with them. I can experience (ph) at least at one point or another, I can remember that I felt kind of like that and maybe if I take it a little farther, that's where they are or they're almost like I was at one point or another.

</p><p>THERAPIST: You're always continued (ph) with them in some way. There's some... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can make a connection, but Matt is the first person that I've run into that seems to be just (making noise). I don't know that he's gone completely passed me or whether he has just gone to another point that I've never been to. But he seems to be in a, I mean, he was just completely alien position of looking at life from where I've been. Which is what has me in such a complete confusion about him. I don't know. I know he's scared. He's said that much to Ross. I think he's quite worried, quite upset, frustrated, despondent. The strange part is that Matt always seemed to be the one person that would be least likely to have something like that happen to him. Or maybe most likely for the same purpose, I have never considered that. I look back on what's happened to me as having made me stronger, to be able to take another brutal blow. If something like what has happened before happens to me again, I usually look at it in a way of, it's happened before so I'll be able to handle it easier. But maybe that isn't true. Because I look at Matt and that he comes from a very strict Mormon background. When he came to USC he came here on a Presidential scholarship and never so much as touched a cigarette. And he became quite familiar with all the vices and glories and devices known around at USC and he seemed to have just accepted them as a different life that he didn't know before, so he's learning it now. And I always figured, well anybody that could change himself that much must be pretty solid. [0:51:18.4] But I almost wonder if maybe, having to accept more on top of that is finally what bothered him. I found out that it was during a trip that we took last October, that he first began to be upset. It's when the first ideas or maybe destructions of ideas occurred to him, that led to what's bothering him now. I didn't know at the time. I don't think anybody did. I found this out through Jack Larkin (ph). I vaguely remember that night. And we were all laughing and joking about how crazy we were. And it was like a joke.

</p><p>THERAPIST: That sounds like you're saying, he was or that it's like, this, is like an inference or a generalization for what you're saying, is that Matt is still on the way to changing a lot of things about himself. And sometimes along that road things get shaken too much and that Matt got taken over by something or like, Matt didn't stay, like Matt got shuttled (ph) off on another track or something. I'm no really sure about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's like I was thinking of, like an exercise. You'd take so much exercise and it will build you up, you'll be stronger for it. Well it's like exercising your mind, with hassles and with conflicts. If you can overcome them your mind will be stronger for it. Exercise for the exerting of its own powers. Well it's like I always kind of took that for granted, except that maybe in Matt's case, there is an amount of power to be exerted and he used up so much of it and then couldn't handle whatever came along. That's, I'm not sure just whether that has any real connection or not. It's, that came up because I merely used to think that Matt was very, a stable person. To be able to take all of the changes that he had in stride, made him appear to me as very stable. [0:53:44.2]

</p><p>THERAPIST: You were kind of wondering like, what was it that could make things too much for him to manage. That made him not be able to take them in and rework them himself, getting thrown by them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I do know there's a difference, that what he was changing before with things in his life, and that seems to be quite different from trying to change your concept of reality and non reality. And maybe he hadn't gotten into that before and that's why it threw him.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like it's a very different matter to change, well I'll call it the [gold box] (ph) [inaudible at 0:54:35.7]... for saying anything like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I mean to, it's very different to try and do that as it kind of changes back to whether or not you smoke and drink or... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Your social basis into, yeah, there is. The one you can manipulate, one you can allow yourself to change, you can't (ph). He could have very well stayed a very strict Mormon even then. That was his choice. But this, is like something that's beyond his choice.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's like I'm leasing something rather than changing it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Very good, yes. That's why it used to scare him (ph), well that's why it scares me so bad or has, the two times that I've freaked out over that kind of thing. It's like it's completely beyond me. It's like the control of my mind, is something that my mind can't control. It's there or it isn't and I have no choice in it. And I think that's kind of to the point that, I mean, it's very likely he wasn't able to accept that part of it. He could change himself very well but the fact that he can't change an existence is really uptight on him.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, we'll quit.

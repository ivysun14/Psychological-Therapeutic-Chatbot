<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. I'm on kind of a research high. Really interesting work. Impossible deadlines. Kind of convinced that I'm going to be able to do it. There is an 80 percent chance that 9:00 tonight I'll be utterly convinced that I can't do it. (sigh). Such a sucker. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds good, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really good. Yeah. And it's nice to get paid. But. So I'm kind of afraid they're going to try and like, this morning (unintelligible) had been trying to put together a kind of outline with what I've actually done to have something to give to the professor that I'm working for when we meet (inaudible) Then, I have to see if I can figure out how to convert the PDF files that (inaudible) sent me of his dissertation because that was the only thing he had on his computer before he left for 10 days. (laughs) And two DOC files that don't go nuts on me so that I don't lose work. So but, yeah, it's been good. Really didn't want to get up this morning. Really haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last two days. That's really going to bite me in the end if I'm not careful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well the night before last I had to get up early for a plane, and then last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must have left early to get back here by 11. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I got up like 5:00 our time. And went to bed at like midnight or 1:00. And last night, I got like seven hours of sleep, but I really (inaudible) don't seem to be enough (inaudible) I'm realizing I'm a nine hours sort of person. Which I really don't like. So I'm enjoying working for the first time in a long time. And finding myself in exactly the same pattern that often ends in mayhem and destruction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>[00:02:47 ]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So I'm a little anxious about that. It's like, it's just like every semester I get up to a point where I spend most of the time really enjoying myself. But part of it is kind of the excitement of doing something a little bit more than you're capable of or maybe a lot more than you think you're capable of. More than any reasonable person should ask. So, then, I crash and burn often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean like, after you sort of crunch at the deadline, get there, you drop? Or</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, usually like, as the deadline approaches, I start to get really really anxious and feel really badly about myself. Because I've set myself an impossible task. Then if I can't do that, then, what's wrong with me? But, I don't get any better at setting more reasonable expectations. This one is a little bit not my fault. But a lot of it is like, the professor is not going to care if I only give him five hours instead of 10-15. But I care. He is not putting pressure on me to have this report done by today. But I wanted it done by today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, yeah. So. (pause) It's just so much fun.</p>

<p>[00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So much fun?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it usually ends poorly. Or often, I perpetuate this idea of myself as I have to do, I have to be constantly topping myself or I have to be constantly topping what other people expect of me. You know, like, when I was in college and decided to be an English major in my last year. And every single student that I talked to who was an English major was like, "That is the worst idea I've ever heard. There is no way that is going to work." And it was impossible for me not to see that as a dare. And it worked. And it was really fun. (laughs) I don't know how much of that is good and how much of it is bad. (pause) I'm enjoying it for now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing that it reminds me of is, I wonder if it's a kind of another facet of this sort of uh, (pause) fantasy of omnipotence.</p>

<p>[00:07:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you're probably exactly right (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By to, sort of the amount of control you sometimes imagine you have over or should have over your emotional life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah, going out of town for five days is no excuse not to work a full week. (laughs) (pause). The problem is that there's some extent and it's very difficult for me to tell what extent because I kind of both think I'm better than everybody else, I think I'm worse than everybody else. But there's some extent to which it is true that I can do more than other people. Or many other people. So yes, it's really hard to know where to draw that line. Especially as finding the thing that I'm really good at, you know, it's the way I feel good about myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you're putting it, it's as though it winds up like, I may misunderstand, but it's like, what most people can do what you can do being omnipotent. You know, like</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:09:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not doubting the first comparison. I just don't think, (unintelligible) instance of the kind of fantasy in action right there where it's, because of your talents and how hard you can work and how much you can do, you can start to BELIEVE that you could kind of do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really don't, I don't like the pride that I take in that. Like I feel badly about that. I try. Like I said, I think I'm better than everybody else, I also think I'm worse than everybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That bothers me. Like I don't</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't feel good. I mean, maybe it does in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just don't like being that person. (pause) Yeah. But it's like as (pause) you know, when I have a project to work on, it's harder than I think I can do, I'm successful at it, I feel really good about myself for a short period of time. And then I kind of (inaudible) suck me into the next one. That and actually liking what I do. But (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least, (pause) I don't think that any of this is something that one can think oneself out of, but it seems to me one of the unfortunate things about it is that in a sense, it actually sort of robs you of more of lasting pride in things you've done, in a way. Why NOT feel good about having worked really hard and pulled something off that was very hard, that few people could have pulled off. You know what I mean? Like</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just feel like (overtalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overtalk) feel good in a way that you feel kind of exaggerated, I can see how that's a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, It feels like grandiosity to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I guess what I'm saying is, (inaudible) seems to rob you of something more genuinely and kind of lastingly good, that's what I mean. The problem isn't that you should â€” what you shouldn't feel good about it, because that's grandiose, it's that you don't know (inaudible) grandiose makes it kind of mixed</p>

<p>CLIENT: It brings false (inaudible overtalk) Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:12:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the best part of it is the time I'm actually working on it. Because then I just forget about myself entirely and I don't even bother with that. I guess that's not an issue. I (inaudible). It's just that, (pause) yeah, making things come together. (long pause) I really like copy editing. It's weird. But I just feel like God (laughs), like making this perfect. And then of course, it gets published and either one of the copy editors of the actual journal will change "effect" to "affect" and make it wrong and it drives me nuts. Or I see something that I missed and that drives me nuts. But regardless, I really like it. It's good to be able to get out of my own head for awhile. And be able to do that for awhile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, I bet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, that was my morning (laughs), and my afternoon (laughs) and my evening. (inaudible) (pause) I've been thinking a lot about our conversation yesterday. I don't have anything, I don't know that I've gotten any further or have anything to say. But it seemed important to me, anyway. Seems like the kind of question that my impulse is going to be to intellectually distance myself from it. And like, say well, I can figure this out. Which is good and bad.</p>

<p>[00:15:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question we finished with right at the end, you mean? To do with like, the sort of effect of (inaudible) reaction on someone else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, I mean I'm having a hard time formulating anything. Like thinking about it in any way other than the abstract right now, which I'm not sure is helpful. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible). Abstract or otherwise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The question for me is, I mean the point or the purpose of all of this, working at relationships and looking at the way people process emotions is so that it will be better. So that we can take better care of each other. So we can hurt each other less. (inaudible). So I just don't know how to get there, you know? I guess I don't know how to get from understanding to change. I really want Bryan to have a future in which he doesn't treat his wife the way he treated me. Both because that will mean that his wife is happier and that will mean that he is happier. But I don't know how that would happen for him. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:18:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been thinking about the way, I guess (inaudible) most people whom I really love who have really hurt me, I'm thinking about my mom right now, like I feel like I do understand what her life is like, to a pretty large extent. I feel so sorry for her. Like it's awful. She's so scared all the time and she doesn't know how to be close to people and she doesn't know how to trust people. And I just, I have so much compassion for her, but it doesn't mean that she doesn't hurt me. And so I'll always, I'm in this situation where I have to either shut down on some level or get hurt. And I don't know how to get past that.</p>

<p>[00:20:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean about having to shut down or get hurt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to make it so that what she says doesn't matter to me very much. I have to find a way to be okay with the fact that every time we have a conversation it's 85 percent her talking about herself. And that she says mean things at random and I can't predict them. And I have to either be on guard against that or just get, have my feelings hurt badly. I have to not expect that she's going to be an emotional support for me. Because she doesn't know how. (pause) But that doesn't seem very fair to her on some level. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:22:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You talk about it in a way that I think makes it, on the one hand, so clear how hurtful it is, but always as someone who is not someone being hurt but someone who's trying to figure out what to do about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh? Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sort of has the flavor of what like (inaudible) called like turning things passive into something active where describing ways in which your mother is terribly hurtful to you. You know, 85 percent of the conversation is about her, you can't rely on her, she says things that hurt, she's not there, she hasn't been there. You know, like, any daughter is going to be terribly hurt by that. But the way you talk about it is, and so what am I going to do about what she is doing to me so it doesn't hurt me so much. Like, (inaudible) having to do with how it does hurt, or how is has hurt or how that has affected you. But how you can arrange things so it won't.</p>

<p>[00:25:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I've spent a lot of time feeling sorry for myself. And being hurt or feeling hurt but I don't like that in myself. I recognize that (laughs) it's probably not that healthy but,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's not that healthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To just (pause) really not like myself when I'm acknowledging how much I get hurt, I don't know if that makes sense. Like I have more self pitying conversations in my head but I always kind of despise myself at the end of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right which you are now pathologizing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am. (laughs) Fact! (laughs) But I mean, so when I'm with my mom, I feel like my choices are I can stop having a relationship with her, I can (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does it hurt?</p>

<p>[00:27:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. A lot of the time, not so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me when it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't, it hurts when she does it again. Or it hurts when somebody else does something similar. There have been a lot of people in my life who have tried to be a mom for me. And that's really wonderful and that's also really sucky in some ways. And I'm pretty guarded about that. And yeah, it's like, you know, it's a (inaudible) in some ways. She says, (inaudible) drops a bitchy comment into the conversation. Usually not bitchy about me directly but it's like if she's THAT judgmental about other people, I don't like her. Or if she's that judgmental of other people, how is she going to judge me? And, you know or like, gloating over the fact that she had a new job and I did not, sort of thing. And it's immediately my entire history of everything that has hurt me that's she has done in the past is summed in this one moment. Yeah, and it just feels like overwhelming betrayal. But I know she's going to do it. You know. (pause) And when we go months without talking, I just don't think about her. I really don't. We haven't had a close relationship, we haven't talked on a regular basis or been together on a regular basis since I was a young teenager. I don't need her. Yeah. If she dropped out of my life, I would still be as whole of a person. But she needs me and I need to be the kind of person who takes care of my family. So. I don't know that that actually answers the question. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:31:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel really stupid when she hurts me. It's like because I know her. And so I, half of me really wants to wait around and hope that she'll change. And I'm sucker. I'm always ready to believe that she is changing and that things are going to be different and that we can find a better way of relating. And so I just feel like a fool when she just like catches me in the same place that has already bruised one more time. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:33:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are the ways that what I do, hurt her, what hurts her that it is, has something to do with me, but a lot to do with the rest of her life. So like, I think I really hurt her when I don't call her more often. But. (big sigh) I feel bad about that and that I don't feel bad enough about it to call her more often (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of the like a balance point between being hurt by her and being there for, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She REALLY wants to be a support for me in my depression. And I cannot talk to her except on good days. I just can't (inaudible) (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I mean I just want an] (not sure about that) understanding her better helps me in that on the cognitive level, at least I know it's not about me. I know it's not my fault. But on the conscious level, (inaudible) matter for very much, so. (laughs) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this is part of what makes it so scary to lean on people. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't consciously find it scary to lean on people. At least not, you know, MY people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But (pause), I think maybe indications of your sort of wariness about it, and how you do like even as we were talking earlier, maybe these things are connected. Like talking about, talking with me about what goes on with your mom in terms of what you can do about to prevent it. Or how you have to be able to handle it. Or things like that. Which relate to your sort of being active, being, (pause) sort of trying to be in control of your emotional life more so than focusing on the other side of it. Which I guess how you were to say more so about how difficult it is, how hurtful, how impossible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause) I guess I'm careful of the ways in which I ask for help. Although I don't usually think of it in those terms. (inaudible)</p>

<p>[00:38:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you're very careful and worried about the way that you use other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want to suck them down. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. People are so kind to me and I find that astonishing every single time. I don't want to breathe on it because maybe it will go away. Yeah. Just, people are just incredibly kind. (long pause) Being that you can't, I don't want to ask for that. I mean I do, (inaudible) my people. But that's, I know that they know that I would do anything for them. And so I feel okay asking from them. But, you know (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:42:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, the last year or so has been, I feel like I've been living in a nightmare. Not so much for the last few days, you know, riding out a little bit. But part of it is I just don' t know what to, I feel pretty certain that there's no way that other people are going to be where I am and I don't want them to. And I don't know what to ask for. I don't know (inaudible) (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine one part of this is that you really want a mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I do. But I don't, I want a mom 20 years ago. (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's some part of you that wants a mom that doesn't know anything about time, but I know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs). Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm aware that you don't actually want a middle-aged woman to move into your apartment, do laundry (inaudible)</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overtalk) in that sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was so funny. I was at, when I was at James' parents in April, I got food poisoning. And James' mom brought me a bucket. If you need to puke, here's a bucket. Nobody's ever done that. What a great idea! (laughs) So yeah, yeah, But I don't really know what that looks like. That way of being taken care of. I don't, I don't, yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>(talking about scheduling)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That's a nice shirt.  Did you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Dye that or you bought it that way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I bought it like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't you used to do things like that?  Where you like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I never tie dyed, no.  I made candles.  That was fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd love to do that again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you wanted to come alone.  What's going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I just, you know, I never really come alone besides that one time and I enjoyed being with you by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I just thought, you know, and [NAME OTHER], I could tell he was a little bit upset because he thought that I was just going to come and talk about him, but, you know, I don't even have to talk about him at all because I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, he was here alone, you know, last week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I wanted him to come alone with you because I enjoyed being alone with you.  I, I thought just that one on one and, and not having the other person there to always be reflecting on you.  I, I just, I find it more calming, not that I find anything wrong with him, but I just, I think, um, especially after him coming by himself, he really, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did he tell you what we talked about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he did say that, um, that you're treating me for bipolar depression.  Um, my question is, um, is that something that you just treat somebody for without, like you, you just, that's what you, you know, have come to conclude as my, what kind of depression that I suffer from?  Is that what it is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Based on your response to different medicines, you know, because of the Depakote, I thought that was it.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the other concern that I had was the mood swings -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the way [NAME OTHER] described them.  He said when you're, like, around him or in a certain environment at home you present one way -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, like, when you're out with your friends or your girlfriends -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or sometimes even with your daughter, you present a totally different way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, do you see that too?  I mean, he was saying, for example, that [NAME OTHER] made the statement that, "Well, mom is a lot more fun when she goes out with me alone than when she is home."  I don't know, do, do you see that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just kind of think that [NAME OTHER] might let her hair down a little bit too when dad is not around.  I'm not, and I'm, I might be the same way.  You know, [NAME OTHER] runs a pretty tight ship and I just think sometimes when we get out and he is not around -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm not saying that I'm like goofy or anything.  I'm just saying that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Freer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just more relaxed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More relaxed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think this last year, I really had a great year.  I didn't feel I suffered as far as like, you know, I understand that the bipolar is, it's like this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, with your ups and downs and in 2007 I could say maybe at one point I remember feeling, um, where I didn't really want to do a lot.  I didn't want to socialize and I didn't want to get out there and, and, you know, it was more, I wanted to be, you know, or that depression where you don't really want to deal with the public.  You just kind of want to be by yourself.  Well, I didn't feel I had that at all last year.  I felt, you know, I felt really good.  I mean, when my mom passed in October I was at peace with it.  I even thought about going to the cemetery and just sitting there by myself.  I've never done that before, you know, and no one ever said anything on that day.  He, he didn't say, "Oh, how was your day?"  Or, my dad even.  We didn't even say anything and, and that was okay, because to me, you know, everybody deals with it in their own way.  And then one of the times that I came with [NAME OTHER] and afterwards I was thinking to myself, you know, [NAME OTHER] always says that I really, I, I really wasn't that close to my mother when she was alive and then I was thinking about it and I was thinking, I wonder if I feel some kind of guilt because I wasn't closer to her when she was alive and now it's, like, too late.  And I see [NAME OTHER] and his mom and their relationship and I told him, I'm jealous that you have your mother.  And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you, what do you think made it difficult for you to be close to her when she was alive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm, I don't think it was difficult.  I just don't think we were ever raised to be real dependent of her, even from the time I was [NAME OTHER]'s age, my daughter, [AGE].  She taught us to be so independent of her, like you take care of, um, everything and you only ask for what you need.  I never shared any of my personal feelings with her.  I never talked about fights with [NAME OTHER] about, with her.  I never talked about fights with my girlfriends.  Um, her and my dad would argue and they would just argue and they'd never talk to us about it or explain to us why they had differences of opinions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You just accepted everything and you moved on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think our generation is much more open.  Um, my kids talk to me and I'm teaching [NAME OTHER] to be very independent too and [NAME OTHER] says sometimes he thinks I'm too hard on her, but I guess that was just because the way I was raised.  And, you know, I said, it was strange because I said how, in some ways it was like, how did I think of, like God was almost preparing me, because I was so young when she died, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Brings tears?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you miss her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [CRYING].  You just, you just think of all these things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you, do you miss her or do you miss what didn't happen?  You know that closeness that you would've liked that you never will have a chance to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I miss her the most, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And with [NAME OTHER], trying to explain that to him, he thinks you're depressed.  I'm not depressed about not having my mom anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't depress me.  There's a spot in my heart and I wish he would learn, you know, that life is so short.  It's so valuable and his mom, she used to be my best friend and I said to him yesterday I said to him, I said, "This year with mom having the lu, uh, lung cancer and him working," I said, "Those are my 2 best friends."  I said, "They weren't around very much."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said, it wasn't like I was depressed about it.  I might have been sad because my life changed so much this last year, but it was okay.  It like, it didn't like make me want to pull the covers over my head and hibernate.  I have so much to be thankful for and grateful for.  It's just, he lately, he just, I feel like, remember I told you how I feel like a bird in a cage and everybody is looking at you.  [CRYING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's very, you know, he said last week that my girlfriend called him and said that she was concerned because she thought I was real hyper.  Well, I had lunch with her on a Wednesday morning and I said to her, I said, "You know, I understand you talked to [NAME OTHER] last week."  Well, she told me that [NAME OTHER] called her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, I, I thought he did and, and he goes, "She called me.  Don't put me in the middle of this."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you don't know who called who then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really care.  He got so defensive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This was all -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did she really tell him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just told him that she thought I, well, [NAME OTHER], and [NAME OTHER] and I went out for Christmas after, this was a couple weeks ago, and we hadn't seen each other for months.  We'd get together and we exchange gifts and I might've been a little bit hyper just because I was trying to fit a lot of fun in like a short period of time and, you know, [NAME OTHER] she's on the other scope right now.  She's like, wants to move to California, so she's in a hibernation zone right now.  She's our other good friend and, and there's [NAME OTHER] who I'm very close to.  She's, like, almost like a sister.  She's the one who called [NAME OTHER] I guess.  She just felt that I wasn't myself.  She felt like I had a lot of, uh, hyperness going, like and I said, "You know what, [NAME OTHER]?"  I said, "That's totally fine."  I said, "But why didn't you tell me?"  I said, If we're good friends, why didn't you come to me and say, Hey, are you okay?  Is there something I could do to help you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you got too much on your plate right now?  But instead, I find out that she calls him when he's already got enough on his plate to worry about.  So, he's like, "It isn't me."  He's like, "I'm not the only one.  Everyone around you that loves you sees a difference."  My mom, his mom, my sister, my dad, so I talked to my sister and I talked to my dad and I said to both of them, I said, I said to my dad first, I said, "Dad, you live with me.  If you see something wrong with me, if you really feel that I'm suffering, say something to me.  I'd love to, to, to talk to you if you think that I'm suffering."  I said, "I'm not."  I said, "I'm feeling really good."  I said, "Besides the fact that my husband works seven days a week, I have three kids, three dogs, and my father that lives with me."  I didn't say that last thing, but I said, "I, I feel like I really managed everything this holiday."  And he said, "Well, I never said anything to [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] asked me."  And I said, "Well, that's fine."  I said, "But if you do see me struggling, tell me before it could escalate into something because then I can call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I could go in and say, 'Hey, everybody's noticing I'm a little bit more on edge.  Maybe I should increase.'"  And he said, "Oh, okay.  Well, I'll do that from now on."  He's like, "But I never go to [NAME OTHER]."  Because he sees the anger that [NAME OTHER] is carrying on his shoulders right now.  He saw the way he reacted to me this last time when he exploded.  My sister, [NAME OTHER], I guess he called [NAME OTHER] too and [NAME OTHER] said, "You know, I noticed it.  I noticed the hyperness and the all this and that."  And I said, well, same thing, I said, "[NAME OTHER], how come you don't tell me?"  "Well, [NAME OTHER] called me."  But I said, "But that's not what I'm asking.  If you see that's there's something that" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "I'm struggling, why don't you say to me, 'Hey, are you okay?  Is there something I could do?  Or is there whatever?'"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't, you don't see it.  You don't see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER] says that I try and deny it.  He tries, says that I fight the illness.  Well, I'm not fight, I've accepted that I suffer from depression.  I take my medicine.  I'm on my Pexeva and I take my Depakote twice a day.  I said, "I have no problem with that."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, I, I don't fight it.  I just, I hate, I don't like that everyone is constantly looking at me, when it might actually be something within their own lives that might be struggling and I don't know.  I, I just feel like sometimes people just have too much time on their hands and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, why do you think you've become such a focus?  You know, and like I say, whenever -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think [NAME OTHER] has really, really been stressed and I think he's just looking -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the more stressed that he feels -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He becomes, he wants, no matter how, and I'm not saying anything against him because he loves me more than anything in the world, but he just, it's like, his family is the one thing that he can have control over and if it's not running like a well greased machine, then he has to fix it, because he doesn't have control over his job, as far as saying I can't work today and this guy is acting like a jerk and that guy is doing this.  He doesn't have control over that, so me and his three kids, that's the one thing that he just wants to hold on to and when it's not running smoothly, and I don't, if you asked him when he was here and I ask him, "What is it really that upsets you about [PATIENT NAME]?"  And then he'll say, "Well, you're hyper.  Your thoughts are sometimes scattered."  Well, I'll say, "Sometimes I'll call you during the day just to hear your voice."  He said to me today, he's like, "Sometimes you call me and you really wouldn't even ask me anything."  And I said, "Well, it was just basically, maybe just to talk to you."  "Well, you should tell me that.  You don't have to call me to have to ask me a question.  You could just tell me you miss me."  "Well, I shouldn't have to tell you that I miss you, you know.  I shouldn't have to tell you to call me once a day."  Well, now he's calling me six or eight times a day, so now it's from the opposite to the opposite and I'm like, "Honey, you're smothering me."  When he got really upset a month ago and he blew up, I don't even know if it was a month ago.  I think it was.  He said it was long overdue.  We were out and obviously it was the last time we were both here together and that's when he got real defensive and he was trying to make a statement by saying he was going to jump off the building, he was so frustrated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not a kid.  Don't treat as if I am.  He says, I'm trying to get my point to you how I can't handle it anymore.  And it, and it was all because, the whole thing was he was tired.  I wanted to stay.  I didn't want to come home.  I wanted just to stay a little bit longer, finish up my food and just come home with the two friends that live by our house and he just blew up.  Well, he got home.  We drove home.  I mean, he was just like, "You bipolar bitch."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He said that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  "You, you've ruined our lives."  Da da da da, you know, "Our kids, you're going to," I mean, just attacked.  I came in the house sobbing.  My father saw it.  All the kids saw it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]'s girlfriend saw it.  She wanted to leave.  He came in the house.  He threw his shoes against the wall.  He took his coat, he threw it.  He walked through the living room.  [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were sitting on the chair.  He didn't even see them, punches the couch, walks in the kitchen, throws all his stuff in the kitchen, walks back, [NAME OTHER] goes to him, this is my [AGE], "Daddy, you're scaring me."  He growls at them.  He just, [NAME OTHER] goes, this is what [NAME OTHER] said, "He went 'grrr'" And he just went upstairs and closed the doors and told me not to come up there.  He didn't want me in the bedroom that night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And went to bed.  I didn't.  I went in there.  I got my pajamas.  I did, exactly what he said I did.  Meanwhile, my kids, "What's the matter?  What happened?  What did he do?"  I'm like, "He didn't do anything."  I'm not going to try and tell my kids that, I just said, "He's just tired.  He's worked too much.  He's too stressed."  You know, I just said, and, and my dad, "What can I do?"  He comes in, I'm like, "Dad, there's nothing you can do.  We just got to relax, step back, and just give him some time."  Well, he was off that next day.  This was Saturday night.  We didn't talk until 4:00 the next afternoon.  He's like, "Do you want to talk?"  I'm like, "Honey, what do you want me to say?"  He's like, "Are you going to apologize to me?"  I'm like, "Apologize to you?"  He's like, "Yeah, you were a bitch last night.  You didn't give a shit about me or your family.  All you were concerned about was having a good time.  You were out.  You were with your friends.  You were drinking.  You were eating.  You didn't want to come home and be a mother and a wife.  You wanted to stay and have fun."  I said, "Maybe you're right.  Maybe I didn't want to come home right away.  Maybe I did want to stay out and have fun, but [NAME OTHER] I don't get to do that very often."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, "And when I do, maybe I'm a little bit over excited because I don't have it enough."  I said, "What does [PHYSICIAN NAME] tell us?  What's the most important thing?  Exercise and some time with each other by ourselves."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Socializing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, "And we don't have that."  I said.  The exercise, I'm trying.  I've been trying.  I'm doing it once a week right now.  I'm going to try and get it in the schedule.  You know, it's, you should see it when I was doing the Stairmaster.  She's right in between me on the Stairmaster.  I mean, I, I tried to put a movie in.  I did everything I possibly could to get her so she would do something else.  She wouldn't, so I, I did it, I did it for like 15 or 20 minutes, which to me was great because that Stairmaster is really difficult.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, getting on there for the first -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you feel calmer when you did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I walk, too, with my girlfriend.  Uh, the one that told you that called [NAME OTHER] and we walked and [NAME OTHER], when I got to my sister's house, because [NAME OTHER] and I took her dog, [NAME OTHER] said that I was a little bit hyper.  Well, [NAME OTHER] is very hyper, so when the two of us get together -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You pick it up, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's like, [NAME OTHER] is the type of woman who socializes four out of five days a week and she has to get everything done -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how do you feel right now as you're talking?  Do you feel hyper?  Do you feel calm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a little bit hyper because I'm a little bit, like, upset with having to, like, just talk about everything that I've thought of through these last few months just all at once.  There's so much that I could share with you that, you know, I wrote it all down and I was trying to be organized with my thoughts and, um, I, I don't feel like, like hyper as far as, uh, you know what I'm saying like jumping up and down, just my thoughts, because I'm just trying to share with you what I think is the most -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel like they're going very fast, your thoughts, like racing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, like I said, I just wanted to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bare it all, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or just highlight what I thought was the most important and, um, and I think I pretty much covered it all.  You know, I tried to explain to him today too about his mother and how I have grown away from her, but she almost died this year.  She was in a coma for 12 days.  She was on a res -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was on a respirator for 12 days after her surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, they were talking about, like, pulling the plug.  So, I think in my heart of hearts I must, maybe pulled away a little bit more -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To protect, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To protect myself.  I mean, I buried my mom, my grandma, my grandfather.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] hasn't gone through that and [NAME OTHER] this year, his mom had lung cancer.  He buried his two uncles that are [AGE] and [AGE].  It was a heck of a year, 2008, as far as that goes.  So, it's just, you know, it's really, I can't even begin to share with him and you don't want to until you're a member of the club and you lose a parent, you know.  Do you have your parents still?  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remember I told you my dad passed last year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Last year, right.  You had him for a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How about your mom?  When did she die?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's, she's alive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, she is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.  Is she still real with it and stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's good.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard, though, when you lose a parent.  I mean, nobody takes care of you like, like a parent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [CRYING].  No, and I wish he would see that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel that with your dad as much.  It's almost like it's reversed for you.  Now you feel like your dad is, you're taking care of your dad.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [CRYING].  And that's another subject.  Remember you said, talk to your sister about your father's drinking, so I did that after the [DATE].  I said, "[NAME OTHER], you, you have to be the one who talks to dad."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, together, I thought.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I said, "I think if you start with it."  And he did, he's been better, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who, who talked to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], my sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I said, "I think if you start with him and just tell him that you don't think it's helping the illness."  Because his emphysema, I think, is starting to get worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But like we, like [NAME OTHER] and I, we were looking in his, one of his cabinets, like I told you this.  He's got medicine in there from 2000 he's taking.  That's nine years old.  That can't be any good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, he's probably not taking it if it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's got the codeine in it for his cough and I can't imagine it's too, I mean, it, but [NAME OTHER], she said she talked to him as the aspect of, um, with the driving with the kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has it made a difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  But I don't think that was ever really, like I told you, if he knew he was picking up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He wouldn't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He would give himself like a three hour window to take a nap and sober up, but, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never really talked to him either.  Either him or your mom, right about your feelings or your -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my mom didn't know I suffer from depression.  I think it was all diagnosed pretty much after she died.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I mean, just sharing feelings, like you said, about your girlfriends or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, boyfriends and, yeah, she just was very -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you really keep a lot just inside.  You don't really share anything -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, and too, and we were brought up never to cry.  You be as hard as a rock.  You never cry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, my mom -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, that's not healthy though.  I mean, it's healthy to let feelings surface.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I agree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you feel sad to cry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I agree.  That's why I love to watch a good movie.  It lets it all out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lets it out, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But not in my household.  I mean, my dad would be more to show his emotions than my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was like a rock and when she died, all the way to the end, that very last week before she slipped into, she was in a drug induced coma because her pain was so horrendous, but even to the very end she died with such respect and, and my dad he just, he was the same way.  He just, he never cried.  [CRYING].  I mean, we cried, when was it, like we've been in this house 10 years and I think I was seeing you and I, and it was 3 years into living here and [NAME OTHER] was like, we all started coming here.  And I just, you know, I just sat there and I said, "You never cried once."  To dad, and then he started crying.  So, and then I wanted to ask you too, um, the antianxiety drugs, the, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Klonopin, yeah, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what?  I don't feel I have anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what do you feel like when you take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I took it that one day, because we thought we were supposed to take them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel asleep for an hour and a half.  I was supposed to go to dinner at my sister's and on top of the Depakote, I couldn't get up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you haven't taken it since?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't really feel you need it then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, if you ask me why I smoke the pot, I'll tell you.  I smoke the pot because I'm bored.  That's the only reason I do it.  I don't do it when I'm driving in the car with my kids.  I don't do it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, see the problem is that can make you more depressed, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I suggest -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is instead of that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I quit.  I stopped and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't, I haven't smoked since, um, early last week, so it's probably been, what was that?  Last, a week ago Monday, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what we talked about was substituting the exercise for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, why don't we not change it.  Just keep the Pexeva and the Depakote and just try to increase the exercise -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To maybe three times a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want to try that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying.  I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm even trying to do stuff just standing there folding clothes, you know, doing leg squats and all that kind of stuff just to get, because, you know, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's see what that does and, the Depakote I think is 500 twice a day now, so that's a good enough dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Lately -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you, do you want to get a blood test on it and see what the, what the level is?  We could do that if you want.  Is that hard for you to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get a blood test so I could see how much Depakote is in your system?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you done that?  I don't remember.  B, before you take your morning dose, you take a morning dose and a night dose -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just go get a b, you know, I can give you a prescription and you can get some blood work and I can see how much is in your system -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I know if it's enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you can tell from by doing that if -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, if it's enough medicine.  We could do that or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I would do that, but I want you to know you're probably going to see all the pot in there still because I'm sure -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm not going to check for the pot.  I, I just check for the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just saying that it's probably going to still be in there, because doesn't it take like a good month to get out of your system?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's going to take up to three months and that, you should take vitamin C.  Vitamin C will -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Clear that out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Clear it out, but, no, I wasn't going to check for that, but I'll just check for the Depakote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you do that or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then let's do that just to see what it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any, any morning just go over to the hospital -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED] will do it and then, uh, just get the test before you take the morning dose and I'll just check the Depakote level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need refills or you're okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, I need refills on the Pexeva.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've only got like maybe a week's left, supply left.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  I'll give you that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I forgot about this.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a good day to get that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it was good.</p>

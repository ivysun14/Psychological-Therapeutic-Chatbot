<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today is the 13th, or 12th</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you sure it's the 12th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is the 12th (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And do you want this slip back?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You keep the anonymized one; I'll keep the long one. There're lots of copies of that other stuff. And if you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any time you can rescind it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how was your weekend? [00:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was good. I went to my stepmother's house for my little brother's birthday. And it went really well. He had like five friends over and they're into like making videos and stuff and you know. So, they brought their video cameras and they set up a little stage room. It was really cute. So, they made like a 20 minute movie. It was hilarious. That was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice that he can still...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we didn't talk. I didn't talk about it at all with him. He just...you know, it was his birthday and he was excited and I wasn't about to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and you should be focused on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, my little sister, I didn't get to see her at all because she had the SAT's. So, I got to spend a lot of time with my stepmother which was really, really good. We, even under the circumstances it was probably one of the best visits I've had over there. [2:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made it so good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, it just wasn't, not, everything is always focused on my dad and you know, his needs, you know. We talked about you know what's going on of course, but you know, we talked about other things besides him, you know and usually whenever I'd be over there I'd have to sit with him or you know, I'd leave and he'd be like, "Well thanks for coming over, but I didn't see you at all." You know, so, we just, we just talked and it was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you found that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know at first she you know, believed he was innocent. You know, that's not the case anymore, which was good and you know she was able to say that. The first week or so she was just in a total daze. Now for herself had to believe he was innocent in order to function, you know which I get. So... [3:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's shocking, really shocking for you and also I'm sure shocking for her in another way. This is a person she chose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, but overall, I was really glad that I went.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like for you to be in the house? Because I know you really worried about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it was so, it was weird, it was so weird. You know I want, he was always in, he would always in the same place every time, sitting on the couch watching TV. In the same spot and I walked through the house and everyone else was where, you know my little brother was waiting for his friends, my stepmother was in the kitchen cleaning and he would be in the living room. And, you know, my little brother was there, my stepmother was in the kitchen, he wasn't there. It was just, but it was almost like a relief, you know. It was like almost a relief because, even though I know he wasn't going to be there, but he wasn't there, I don't know. So... [4:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, his, it sounds like his presence was really not there either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was, I don't know, I'm really glad I went.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really needed to have a nice experience with them and a nice experience in that house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hadn't seen them since you know before it happened. So, it would be two months at this point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, so I got to talk to my stepmother about (pause), about my grandmother and what she knew and she said that last week she decided that, you know, she had to know the truth. There was no, you know, because we couldn't go the rest of our lives with her not - this is such a huge moment in our lives. So, she did know, she does know, you know. [5:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your stepmother told her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn't know the extent of everything, so I decided that I would call her. Which I did and it was not the conversation I was hoping to have with her. But, because she heard, you know, I had to [inaudible]. She instantly started crying and, and then she just kept sobbing asking me if he was a terrible father and you know. And I didn't know what to say like half the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are really hard questions to answer for somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. And this was, this is my grandmother, his mother. I'm not allowed to - who is in her mid-80's and I'm telling her that he son is a terrible father, you know. So, I was like, of course not, of course not.</p>

<p>[6:00] And she was like, "Please give him a second chance," you know. So, I just kept saying that he needed help and that he, he needs to be held accountable for what he's done, but you know, we'll see you know. Of course I'll never swear him out of my life, but I don't know. I was just kind of trying to get her to not sob (laughs). Oh! (sighs) I'm glad I talk to her but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a really, I mean it's just, you're in such a hard position having to try to take care of other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's taking care of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) I don't know. (pause) (sighs) But I mean, I'm glad I did call her because I couldn't stop thinking about it. [6:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that it's appropriate that your stepmother made the decision about what she knew and to be the one to have that conversation because I know you were anticipating trying to make that decision and have that conversation. That shouldn't have to be your role.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I was very relieved when she said, even if she decided not to tell her the extent of the charges (pause), I think I would have gone with it because I would understand why, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That puts you in a position...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To lie for the rest of my life with my grandmother. So, I'm glad that was the decision that was made, but you know. But realistically, she'll never be able to see him again because he can't leave the state and she doesn't fly and, but now that she knows she can write to him or, I don't know. It's always better though, I would want to know regardless of my age, you know.</p>

<p>[8:00] So, (pause) yeah. But, overall this weekend was really good. I mean, April 26th is his next date (sighs). It's six weeks away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like a long time to wait.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God. But, my stepmother's attorney was saying the prosecution, the State of New Hampshire, or whatever, doesn't, at this point doesn't normally bargain with criminals like these. So, you know what he's expecting as a bargain, you know, because he doesn't have any felony charges it's going to be a lot more than what he is actually going to get.</p>

<p>[8:57] So, you know he, if his sentence is ten years they might make a deal of nine. You know, not four, you know. So, he's probably going to spend some time in jail, which, I don't know, that way he'll be forced to get the therapy that he obviously needs. (pause) Just being in that house was so different. It even looked different, you know, because, my stepmother was saying that. You know that house, it was always neat, it was clean, but there was stuff everywhere, you know, from the kids or whatever. So, you know, she said, "Things that I always blamed the kids for, don't actually happen because he's not here, it was him." So, he was home all day long for months (pause). I don't know, it was strangely, it was like nice for him to be over there. Now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a dynamic shift.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, but she's talking about selling the house and because it's old and needs a ton of work. Mostly, I don't know (pause)...I don't know, when I pulled into the driveway, because it's like big news in their town and I just pulled in the driveway and I swear looks slowed down to see who, you know. I'm sure it was just all in my mind, you know. And like neighbors would like walk by, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling worried that people will see you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make that connection... [10:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, you know, because they have still yet to announce that he has two children. Not, there's never any mention of me. So, the first couple weeks my, actually my stepmother's stepmother, if that makes any sense, you know was having to stay far away from the house because all they have to do is run my license plate and the car is registered to me. You know, we have the same last name. So, I don't know, and I'm still shocked that no one has called me. (pause) My stepmother was subpoenaed and this is totally confidential, you know they don't actually release the names of the people they subpoena. You'd only ever know if they told you so.</p>

<p>[11:57] But she has, I'm guessing that people from his work, you know, were - so, maybe, maybe they have enough evidence that they wouldn't even need, which, you know. Hopefully that's the case. But (sigh) I met with my trainer on Saturday which was great. And, so I'm going to be working out with a trainer once a week which I'm so excited about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: New?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like when you sign up with a gym you get two free, so I'm able to swing which I'm so excited about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you use exercise a lot to feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I don't exercise, which I haven't been for months, ever since my father got sick, I've felt awful, eating terrible and the scale reflected that.</p>

<p>[13:04] And then, now, now I've been exercising like every day and lost six pounds and I'm happy. So exercise is my, besides coming here, it's another form of therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very healthy form of therapy. What do you like to do when you work out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kickboxing, weight lifting, cardio, a lot of yoga and Pilates, whatever, as long as you get a good sweat (laughs). But, did I tell you Kyle was away this weekend, my boyfriend?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned it and the anxiety it sounds like went up a little bit that he wasn't coming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well and that he had a great, it was just like a guy's weekend that he had planned.</p>

<p>[14:01] Where it couldn't have been worse timing for me on Friday, but I got over it. But they had a great time and they ended up staying at my mom's and which was awesome so they got some good quality time together and, you know, she's trying to exercise too so we went for at least one walk, you know, for like an hour and a half and we did almost three miles, so it was good. And (pause), did I tell you where I'm moving, Kyle and I are moving into their basement, their guest apartment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't [say the timing of that] (ph) - you mentioned the timing of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not until August. My lease is up August. And, so, it looks so beautiful.</p>

<p>[14:57] It looks so beautiful and, you know, I'm so excited.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so my stepfather...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it attached?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's attached, but it has its own entrance and everything. So we got to go, we went Ikea and we, you know, picked out some stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice to have something to look forward to like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where does she live?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: In Pelham.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, where you grew up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that the same house you grew up in?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yes. But not, you know, they're talking about selling the house too. It's like, there's no need to have, it's just the two of them, it's like three bedrooms upstairs and the guest apartment downstairs. (pause) But, I love that house though, I hope they...Yes, we're moving in August. I'm excited about it. It's way nicer than we can afford. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be very different than having roommates.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I know. And, you know, Kyle has a little bit of anxiety about living with my parents (laughs), but you know... [16:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is their relationship like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, great. You know, my stepfather and Kyle golf all spring and so [get along] (ph) together. And we all get along really well, but we're still going to be living with my parents (laughs). Which I get, you know, that he, you know, he's also excited about it because they're charging us like nothing and so we can afford...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Financially it makes a lot of sense, I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, and this way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does feel like maybe a little less independence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's very true. But, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just work out the boundaries that feel, you know, comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know, moving back home (laughs). It's all good and, but I mean, it's not forever. Even if it we're, even though that way we don't have to sign a lease anywhere. You know, we're not stuck in a location we don't like or, we're just going to go, which is great.</p>

<p>[17:09] (pause) But yeah, he had a great time on his trip, which made that a little bit better, you know. But of course all my roommates got home Saturday (sighs) which sucks. I cleaned the entire house. It was sparkling and they're home less than an hour and it's just trashed (sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it was awful. And (sighs) everyone's suitcases are in the living room, like, I was just. Cleanliness and organization makes me happy and they just don't feel the same way (laughs). But, I mean, I can't complain. Everyone pays their rent on time and...[18:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why can't you complain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've heard worse horror stories and I've also lived with people who, the roommates I have now look like angels compared to some of the roommates I've had. So, you know, and they're all good people and they're all nice people and they hang out and they're, I'm sure I do things and Kyle does things that, you know, drive them nuts. So, it goes both ways. It's just the wonders of living with people, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the dynamic like in the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It, you know, we're all kind of, I'm the one who works, you know, on top of going to school so they (pause), they like to party, you know. So I'm the bore of the house. You know, I'm in bed at 10:00 max Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>[18:56] And (pause) I'm sure they're frustrated with that because I just can't have the music on a Wednesday night at one in the morning. It just can't happen for me, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they respect that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They do on certain occasions, but, you know, if none of them have school on a Friday or a Monday and it's a holiday and I have to work, you know, it's, I pick my battles definitely, you know. But other days I have a Friday off and they have exams I would never...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would be respectful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course, you know. But, I'll be relieved when I'm done with roommates. (pause) But, you know, but we all get along which is good. There's no negative and there's not animosity.</p>

<p>[20:02] You know, they drive me crazy, but, you know (laughs). And our house is big enough where we're not all on top of each which is, because there are a lot of people living there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many of you live there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's six people and it's four bedroom. We have a huge, it's all open. It's nice, well it would be nice (laughs). (pause) But, (sighs) it was nice having the house to ourselves. Not anymore (laughs). I don't know (pause).</p>

<p>[20:56] And I was talking to my grandmother and I asked if my dad had called her and she was like, "He called me last week for like a minute," and guess hung up the phone, I don't know. And she asked if he had called me, and I said, no he hadn't. And she was like, "Why don't you call him. I'm sure it would make him feel better." And I'm like, what? Really? So, I was like really at this point, you know, I don't feel like I need to call him. And she was like, "You just can't give up on him. I know he's a good person and..." (sighs) It broke my heart, you know. But, I can't, no way in hell would I call him, not a chance. And, you know, I was talking to my stepmother and in the first couple of weeks, even if I said that, I don't want him to call me. But, it would have been nice, you know, even just to leave a message and just have that acknowledgment, but at this point just don't even bother. So, I don't know. [22:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think your stepmom relays the sentiment to him. Does she talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does she talk to him? She does. She, I think, I think they talk everyday at this point because he is staying at a hotel that's over a$100 a night, which, you know, is putting a huge strain on them financially, especially if his next court date isn't until April 26th. So, she's been asking, talking to him and asking him to find another place and, I mean he's got to know they can't afford that (laughs), you know. But, I just don't think he cares and he's doesn't have a kitchen or anything so he's out every meal.</p>

<p>[22:59] Which is expensive enough. And I just don't think that he cares.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's probably not thinking long term.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The financial impact on her is different than what he's facing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's very self-centered. But, I don't know, my stepmother at this point is very, you know, angry with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must feel validating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get so many messages that you need to have put your feelings aside and look out for what other people are feeling and to have her sort of feel the same thing that you're feeling must feel really validating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. Because, and I didn't want to go over there. I was just going to get a guilt trip from her and the kids, you know, because I feel so strongly that he is in the wrong, you know. He committed this crime. [24:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that you need to take care of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, that wasn't it at all, which was very relieving. (pause) Yeah, so I'm probably going to go over there again this weekend and just to see my little sister. And just have dinner with them or something. Which I would never have even wanted to go over there two weekends in a row, you know if he were home. But, I, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Family was such a different experience to be able to spend time with them without his presence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it was, not that it was fun, you know, but it was, I had a good time, you know. Just being, I mean, I got there at nine and the party didn't start until eleven, so, you know, there was no like, the whole feeling in the house was just different, you know. [25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it feel different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was always like everyone was kind of walking on eggshells. You know, but I never realized...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tension.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I never realized it until I went over there and it wasn't like that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just feel like a weight is lifted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was good. It was (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like it just makes the relationships much less complicated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when you were describing things last week, you know the navigation that you kind of need to do between your dad and your siblings, between your dad and your grandmother, or how to fit relationships in around the tension with him. It just makes it so complicated. And it sounds like it was just a lot more straightforward. Which is a relief not to have to think about, "If I do this, or say this, or act this way, what's going to happen over here?" But just to be able to interact in a straightforward manner with your brother or your sister or with your stepmother. [26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly how (pause)...I know I say this every week, but I just can't wait for this to be over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's ok to keep saying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). Just to have some sort of closure, you know. I, this is just the beginning, I know, but even if he was in jail it would be some sort of ending. Because I can't just keep having this be, like my number one focus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will let you kind of move from one phase to another. It's like you found out and you're in that beginning stage of shock and like, how could this possibly be? And it sounds like you're moving a little bit out of that shock phase to, you know, maybe an understanding. And maybe it sounds like you feel like once you know what really going to, what the sentence will be, or what the verdict will be. That coming to an understanding of what actually is happening in your life will be complete.</p>

<p>[27:00] And you can maybe move on to dealing with what, what do relationships look like now? What does, you know, how do you incorporate this into part what your story is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's certainly not something that you thought would be part of your life story, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And when I was at my mom's we had dinner with my uncle Connor who....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you said you were going to see him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh my God, it was such a good time. You know, because I was afraid, you know, it was the first time which we've seen him since...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot to be said about there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and (pause) it was just, you know, we talked about it, but it wasn't in, you know, we just reflected on Steven's life and not how it ended. And it was really good.</p>

<p>[28:00] You know, I had a great dinner and we'd laugh until my face hurt after, we were laughing so hard. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must have been really nice for him too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and you know, they live up in New Hampshire and they have dirt bikes and, you know, he invited us all up for dinner over there and it was good. It was just, you know, I had a good time. (pause) It was a good weekend. (pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It shows where maybe some of your resilience comes from outside the family. To be able to, to go through something like that and still be able to appreciate life is pretty amazing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't know how he (sighs), that was the dark (sighs) (pause). All these things just happened one after another, after another. (pause)</p>

<p>[29:10] He's definitely not, but he's been able to still enjoy the things that, you know, which, I mean, he said, "I really honestly believe that everything happens for a reason." He does not get what's going on. You know, my stepmother asked, my stepfather asked my mom not to bring it up just because I hate, I just didn't want to go through the whole story, you know, again. And we were having such a good time and, so he doesn't, unless he knows from the news, but my mom said that she thought he had no idea. Yeah. But, you know, it is possible that he does know through my grandmother, my mom's mother and (pause), but he didn't mention it at all, so, which was good. (pause)</p>

<p>[30:15] But he, I don't know, it was a good dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were saying how he was saying everything happens for a reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, hum-hmm. And, yeah, and you know, the, life takes us one way when only we're expecting to go another, but I just, I don't know, like having said that, it sort of works out in the end. And, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that notion sit with you? Do you feel that same way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I do, but I, I'm not one of those people who believe, you know. I think we're all in control of our destiny. There's not some sort of plan set for us, you know.</p>

<p>[30:57] We make our own decisions, you know, and we ultimately determine how our lives end up and in a way it's nice to think that everything happens for a reason. But (pause), you know, we have no control over what other people do that affect our lives. I just know that I'm in control of what I do. You know, so, (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is a lot that's out of your control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, clearly (laughs) (sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a religious or spiritual belief though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I was never raised, I was never baptized or anything. You know, I celebrate Christmas, but my family is not religious at all.</p>

<p>[32:00] I don't know. I don't really believe in one God, just kind of believe in my family and me and that's really it, I don't know (laughs). (pause) I also believe in science and fact, so. I don't really have a religion. (pause) And, yeah (laughs). I don't know, I'm trying to think [inaudible]. I needed it. I always hoped Kyle could be there just because, that he had a great time with his guy friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it was good for you to spend some time one-on-one with different members of your family. [33:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, the dynamic would have been totally different if Kyle was there for, you know, at my little brother's birthday and because I wouldn't have been able to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a lot more conversation with you stepmother than you probably would have had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it have been like you think if Kyle was there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she still, Kyle has been in my life for years, and you know, and they've known him for years. So, I think she still would have been honest, but you know, it's always a little different when there's you know, he's not family, we're not married. And so they way it worked out was the best way I would have wanted it to. So, if he were there it might not have been the same, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It still may have been good, but you don't know that it would have been exactly the same. [33:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, my little brother and I, you know when Kyle's around my little brother tries to be all tough and, yeah, cool. You know that he didn't have to be like that at all and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you different when he's around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When Kyle?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your boyfriend, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, he has been through a lot in his own life that he doesn't understand the magnitude that this is having on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this doesn't seem so out of the realm of normal for him because he's been through so many intense experiences with his parents. You alluded to his parents having a history of alcoholism, so there are other things that have also affected him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when he was, his mother had befriended this, this neighbor and she, I think his mother was in his, well she was in her late thirties and this woman was in her late twenties and she would watch Kyle and his younger sister you know, after school.</p>

<p>[35:08] And, and you know, that her mother, his mother would over and get then an hour or so later, just a way for this woman to earn a little extra money. I guess she was having her own problems, so one day she set Kyle and his sister in front of the TV to watch a movie and she put a gun in her mouth and killed herself while they were all there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (gasp) Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, they had no idea. Kyle was like ten and his sister was eight. You know, she turned up the TV really loud and I guess she had a muffle, he said she didn't even; he didn't even remember hearing a gunshot. So, his mother came and got them and you know and hour and a half later.</p>

<p>[35:48] At this point maybe 45 minutes later and she came in the house, no problem, saw that the kids were watching TV, went to go find her friend, opened the door and there she was in her bedroom. And so obviously she screamed, the kids ran in and saw and that, I think Kyle needs therapy (laughs), especially for this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such a traumatic experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At ten years, yeah. So, (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't have any memory of the incident or he doesn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't remember a gun shot. He remembers seeing her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He remembers seeing her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and the aftermath and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and then his cousin who he was very close to who suffered from bipolar disorder committed suicide a year and a half ago and his dad has attempted suicide twice and, yeah. So, he has his own sort of issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he expected the unexpected is sort of part of his reality. Because, I mean these are stories, any one of these stories that's happened to you in the past year or that happened to him are more than most people have experienced in their own lives.</p>

<p>[37:07] And to have so much loss and tragedy and just really traumatic events.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He, I don't know how, I would be just a mess, you know. But he...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look at what you're dealing with too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you think he needs therapy. Has he ever been in therapy for any of those things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never. Never, even when I always tell him...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he think of you being in therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He completely supports it and, you know, thinks it's so great and I always tell him, I talked to Dr. Bello, we had a good session and, I'm like, I'm sure she could recommend someone for you and, "Absolutely not, no, I don't need to sit and cry with a therapist." I'm like, that's not what it is, you know.</p>

<p>[37:58] And, so, I don't know. Maybe, I've been telling him for years that I think that (pause). But he can only make that decision. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly hearing the events he's been exposed to, who wouldn't need a little support? Wouldn't want a little support? But what is it you think, do you see something in him that you feel like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, he just has a way of suppressing, you know what he, he doesn't feel anything for, well I'm sure he does, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't express what he's feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, at all. You know, and so I'll be sitting there and, you know, sobbing and he just kind of like, "You're ok," or, "it's going to be fine." So he's like a, I don't know.</p>

<p>[38:59] Yeah (sighs). He just, and then I'll, when we were going through everything with his dad last time he slit his wrists and he didn't even cry and he was just like, "I've dealt with this for my whole life," you know, and, but that has to effect you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does have effect you, but it doesn't necessarily have to make him sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think, it's so hard to understand sometimes what somebody else's emotional reaction to something is because we imagine how would we feel if we were in that situation. What would you feel like if your mom attempted suicide? That's a very different experience than his dad. And I'm not saying that's not a sad situation. I think anyone feeling so badly about their lives that ending their life feels like the best option.</p>

<p>[39:58] You know, it saddens me to think there are absolutely people who feel that way, but, you know, I don't know what Kyle experiences and how he's been able to put distance between himself and his parents based on his history and what that might, he might need that emotional distance in order to be ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We, more recently, so that was like, that was, I don't know, almost a year ago at this point and then after that his dad was in an inpatient rehabilitation program for 12 weeks and is now, both his brother and his father are taking anti-depressants and something else. And, you know, it's been a total change in they're, so we've been going over there for dinner.</p>

<p>[40:56] Kyle and his father actually went golfing last Wednesday when it was nice out. You know, it's just something that they would never have done before. So, but still, I think there's still a wall between them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your relationship like with them because I know you guys have been a part of each other's lives for so long and so much of your growing up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, you know I've always, I think they're very nice people and, but it was always difficult to have a relationship with them because, you know, they were drunk by the time we got home from school (laughs). And, you know, and how people use drugs or alcohol, they're, they're at it, sometimes they were screaming at each other or, you know. So, we always spent time at my house; it was never at Kyle's house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any history of violence? [41:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I know of. You know, I've asked Kyle that, but he's, he remembers his childhood as being very good, besides this incident with. You know they didn't, they weren't drinking like they are now as he can remember until he was maybe 14 or 15. And then, you know, hopefully this is the worst and now they're starting to pull out of it, but I don't know, I worry because alcoholism is a trait, that he'll suffer from something like that., but, so far so good, so (laughs). (pause) I don't know, he could have so easily just fallen through the cracks without them noticing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's got something very strong inside of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [42:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's important for both of you because in both your families there is a history of suicidality, which also is something that, it's not necessarily an inherited trait, but people who have a family member who's attempted suicide or committed suicide are more at risk for depression and are more at risk for their own attempts. So, you know, you both have these histories where there's a lot of trauma and, you know, there's this history of suicidality for both of you. So, things to pay attention to, just, it doesn't mean that that's going to be a part of either of your live, but it's an indication to pay more attention to this stuff, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you do a really good job of looking for health ways to relieve some of the stress and relieve the imbalance of some of the emotionality that comes along with a year like you've had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of paying attention to one another is probably going to be an important part for a long time. [44:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). (sighs) Before this year, you know, I was talking to my mom and we were just like, well we were on a walk, and I was just thinking my life was cake before this year. Never...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if other people would have described it that way if they lived the same life you lived.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. But, I mean (pause) I did not have to look at other people and, you know, I'm so lucky, so lucky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do have, you have a lot of good in your life to be thankful for and a lot of, you know support it sounds like. And it's great that you can see those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just have to let this not be a defining point, you know in my life. [45:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, I think, finding a way to understand whatever meaning it has. Making some meaning of it for yourself and folding it in as, it is going to be a part of your story, but it doesn't have to be the focus of it. Like you said, it doesn't have to define you. And respond to it, you talk about kind of making your own decisions and being responsible for how you respond to things. That's going to be what defines who you are, what your life is like. But, these are some hard, these are some complicated stories to weave in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (long pause) I don't know, they're all in the past so you've just got to focus on moving forward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Making things work the way that they need to for you. Figuring out how the relationships change and what relationships, you know, you want to focus on and what's actually going to take care of you.</p>

<p>[46:02] You do a lot of taking care of others, I think just by nature. And your family has kind of helped you in that role. They've allowed you to do that. They look to you to do that. You've got to figure out a way, how do we balance that with you also taking care of you and letting some other people do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because (pause), you know, I think if my dad's not in the picture (pause) it's totally going to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it makes it easier for the relationships to be a little more straightforward and be a little more back and forth. Not to have to do so much caretaking or, you know, placating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just keeping his lies straight of what he's told people is job enough for anyone, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really energy consuming. Why don't we stop there for today. Do you want, I know we've sort of sometimes twice a week, sometimes once. Do you want to, I do have time of Friday if you want to try that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's just do Monday because I know my week is just going to be crazy because I go back to school this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So let's plan for Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you next Monday. [47:12]</p>

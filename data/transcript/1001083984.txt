<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And with that, I just turn this on and we start.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll hold these, you can actually keep that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay and here's your pen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, great and just pretend like it's not even there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's fine, what happens when this over with - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When it's over, I just turn it off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then what are you going to do with the tape?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At the end of the month, a person comes and they download it into the computer, then they send it to a place where they take your name and my name off of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What do they do with it when they get it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, I don't know exactly.  I know they look, I think they look at the time, like how long we spent together, what types of things educationally we talk about, like what kinds of things when I talk medications.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How do they tell?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're doing it across all kinds of specialities, yknow, psychiatry, family doctors, and internists.  I think they're looking at how patients and physicians have visits, so - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What do you get out of it?  Do you learn anything?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yknow, they haven't sent me any of the results of the program, but I imagine at the end of the year - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They'll probably send some sore of results of the, of the studies.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, how you are as a doctor?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They get rid of my name, as well as your name, they get rid of both.  It becomes just a, we're a doctor, patient and they just look at the visit and what we talk about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you were chosen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, I was told I was one of the few psychiatrists around here that was doing it.  I was flattered.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Now what I wanted to get down to at this visit, um, I wanted to tell you the way I look at it today is [NAME OTHER], my husband and me, when we married we were nice people.  Of course, we've been married forty years, but we're really not very nice people anymore and we never really, for whatever reason, just never been very close together and don't get along.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you say nice people, you mean nice to each other?  Have you been arguing a little more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A little more?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, maybe it's [NAME OTHER] or me.  I don't care what happens quite frankly as long as I'm healthy and happy.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm here -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember when I first met you in the hospital when you had injured your leg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was a time when you were having more arguments, as well, with your husband. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I remember that.  Well, it's been going on for ages.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but doesn't it kind of come and go because even the last time you were here, it seemed like things were going a little better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, let me tell you this.  When [NAME OTHER] is nice to me, usually I'm nice to him, but when he's nasty, of course, I get nasty, I don't mean not nice, but some of the language he uses and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When did you start feeling more tension here recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Here?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like here in the last few, when did it change here recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With you, you mean?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, no.  When you were here the last time, you had said that things were actually going a little better with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it sounds like it shifted the other way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, you know what it is, doctor.  I don't know very much about it, but this condition I have is, I could have something wrong with me or something wrong, but the next day it could be fine.  I could come in here depressed or something - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the next day feel fine, that's my condition, but I don't look at things the same, I'm not depressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your mood's going good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, now this bring up these people, whoever they are, that I like and don't know what their doing really, but they have some bearing on it, it effects me.  I've been fine when they're right, I don't always like them, but it's been fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the voices, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only thing I don't like is, the voices are there with me and I surely hope after this visit with you [PHYSICIAN NAME] that they remain in their home, because I just feel that the voices are, when their gone.  If [NAME OTHER] and I agree to remain together or something then that will be all right.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't want all this tension either with them here or with [NAME OTHER] at home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you want things to be more peaceful overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, because my kids aren't here anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there a wedding coming up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when is that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, my gosh, that's coming up quickly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mother of the bride, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's exciting isn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Although, you know, do you find yourself arguing with your husband about anything in particular, or, is there any pattern to how the tension gets bad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We always had money problems, but that's not what I'm talking about, that's always something - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, uh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When do you notice yourself more irritable or more angry with him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's just, yknow, he just seems to do it at home.  I don't know why.  He does things within the home on purpose, why?  I don't know why, unless.  You know, there was a time, I don't do it anymore because these people that are here make it seem better for me I guess.  He used to scare me - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you say he does things wrong around the house intentionally, what's an example, what kind of things does he do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, quite frankly, for the last fifteen years, we've not been together the right way as a husband and wife is concerned.  So in the morning when he comes up and I'm upstairs on the bed, he'll cover me up, which in my opinion, there was a day I thought, well, that was nice, it was nice for him to, now I'm looking at it, he's doing wrong, that wrong for a reason.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mean putting the covers over you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  He, I don't think he loves me anymore, being on that sofa down there, but maybe that's why, I don't know, maybe I don't love him or I'd go down, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you've been together for forty years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Forty years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, I mean, sometimes couples wind up sleeping apart because things change like snoring or - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Snoring, but that would have been for forty years. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But there's something that keeps you together, [PATIENT NAME].  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There is?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, forty years is a long time together, I mean that's a relationship that has a life -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I would say in my opinion, initially, it was my condition and health and all of that and before because I was a patient, now moving along with children and all of that, we didn't do anything because I was a patient with children and all of that, but me because of [INAUDIBLE].  We will end up divorced.  I didn't do anything and once it was shown that I, or he or we will be better of separated, I would never do it on my own.  I don't have the money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure, although, sometimes people make wedding vows, yknow, that include for better or worse.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well, maybe that's it for [NAME OTHER] and me, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You make a commitment and that's - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, they see if you feel I haven't, I think the best bet for me and [NAME OTHER] is just staying like this, is to check counseling and maybe we could find out what's wrong with him, like the way he asks me stuff.  I mean, maybe you could make him talk and how he feels about us or something.  He won't talk to me about what he does.  I can't make him talk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, what I think we might be able to do is, when we finish up, I will talk with him about your next visit, him coming in at the beginning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you don't want to talk today?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I was concerned just that I wanted to see you because I know you wanted to spend the time today talking about the voices and everything because that's what you had mentioned on the phone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the other thing, I think when you cancelled the last appointment, I heard that you had been feeling sick, that you had some diarrhea or some stomach problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no, let me explain it to you, to make the story short, I cancelled because my stomach had pains and then I had diarrhea for about three or four days.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I have a condition that I could need something there but it wasn't that, as I told you, I'm so [INAUDIBLE], the people, the doctors, and everything that's made that happen based on the things I tell, [INAUDIBLE] and I was a mess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you had that, did you have any other symptoms?  You weren't constipated or blood or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, just diarrhea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It just kind of came and left?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It stayed for four days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now during that time, were you able to kind of keep food down?  Did you have nausea or vomiting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] wouldn't let me eat.  He said I could have some, [INAUDIBLE].  He would say things to me.  Why do it, you know, he wouldn't let me have salt, either.  He was very - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Until it got better?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Were you able to take your medication?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or did you stop on them for a few days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I may have missed one night, but he keeps after me on that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I got the sense, because I think before we spoke on the phone, he had answered the phone yesterday and I asked him if you were feeling better because [NAME OTHER], my secretary told me that you had been sick.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he had said he got worried that you were feeling better but that you had gone off the medication for a couple of days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, there was nothing to do with, it had nothing to do with the medication.  I didn't [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Anything, you haven't been put on any new medications recently, nothing changed with that in the last month or so?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  So what would you say about - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I could ask [NAME OTHER] to come in the next visit.  I could approach him about the next time we schedule an appointment have him come in and we could talk together, like - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever you think, doctor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think if we let him know in advance, for the next visit, that'll give him a chance to kind of see how things are and then we can sit down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't want to surprise him and have him, just bring him in and expect him to talk about things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Without him being ready for it.  Because I think, I don't think he know, I don't he would - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know this is what I need, maybe that's what he means.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I thought you said you wanted to talk about him and your relationship.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but not about things, it's about everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That could be a long session.  That could be a very long session.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know whatever he's thinking, it's fine whatever he is thinking.  I just thought since I'm here today, we could be doing differently.  I'm not the doctor, though - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean do you think if I went him and asked him to just come join us that maybe there would be something you'd like to talk about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, we'll do it your way.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think if I bring him in, he might be more focused on the medications and you're being sick and everything's that happened the last couple weeks.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, we'll make an appointment - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The next visit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tell him today if you want to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I will.  I think it's good because then it'll prepare him and then he'll be ready to come in in the beginning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Often times, he'll get angry and say I'm going to ruin your talk with the doctor, but he never does.  This way, you're probably right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think if we just bring him in and we catch him off guard, obviously, you and he will both leave the office, if you and he go home together - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about these people, can you get them to go away?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what we were trying to do with the Seroquel, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't know what pill, but is there anything you can do so [NAME OTHER] and I can live naturally?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you have the voices, did you ever tell them to go away?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't tell them to, but I've asked them on many occasions.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but did you ever say - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do, but because I guess they talk to whoever it is, it affects, they can do things because of my thinking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to remember that the voices there are part of the illness, the condition.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They've always been there, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like they've been there a long time off and on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They have, but what I'm saying is I never always knew they were there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Today or most days they are there and I ask them to leave and mean it, but as soon as I think differently and I can hear my thinking, they pick up on it and start with something else.  So they're affecting me that way.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's no way of distracting yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, there's no way for me to not - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You always have to listen to them?  You can't tune them out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If there was a way that I could, I would, but I can't and I think it's affecting [NAME OTHER] and myself and that's why if they're gone and you talk to [NAME OTHER] about next time, maybe I'll feel better, he'll feel better - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  I agree with you on that one, too.  I think that there have been times that you've come in where they've been much calmer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When they what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where they haven't been as present, like the last time that you came in, you said that they weren't there as much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were feeling better the last time you came in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if we timed it on a day that was good for you and he's prepared, I think it would be more productive, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But to try to get rid of them, obviously, you're taking the medication for them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I think, let me just get your chart here for a second. I never remember your dosage off the top of my head.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know the Seroquel is 200 mg, I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You take two twice a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I take two in the morning and one at night, isn't that right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, no, I have you down for two in the morning and two at night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You do?  Well, you'd better write us a new script because I have two in the morning and one at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that what the bottle says?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The prescription I wrote for you in February said one hundred and twenty tablets which is a month's worth of four tablets a day, I wrote two in the morning and bedtime, but what I can do is make it more specific and write two, in shorthand, I'll put two in the morning and two in the evening, I wrote two in the morning and evening.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  I don't know what the bottle says.  I don't think I've looked at it, but I just knew that we had changed it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, is that what we changed it to?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, see I thought, I didn't look then I guess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Maybe that's part of this, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm going to make it more clear on the prescription that you take two in the morning and two at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is everything going okay for the wedding, is it on track?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The kids, the kids are doing fine in their lives.  That's a separate issue, as a matter of fact we're going to see our granddaughter tonight.  I would rather talk the thing out with [NAME OTHER] first.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I wonder is preparing for the wedding or planning for the wedding, if it's not creating more pressure between the two of you is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he real involved with those type of things like the planning and all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, my youngest daughter is a mess.  She's [INAUDIBLE] but she bothers everybody primarily her father and me.  She was home and she's almost [AGE] years old, but she has him doing a lot of work for her with this wedding and he does.  The thing is, it's not that I would mind, but I don't know how to drive or have a car or anything, so, and he's doing with her, a lot of things that aren't [INAUDIBLE] gets upset at some of things she asks him to do.  This has all been a pain I'm sure so I'd rather not get into detail on that, but I think that'll work itself out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I was curious.  When something like that comes up, sometimes it can be a pressure between -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it isn't, [NAME OTHER], I'm very lucky that way with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Good, good.  Well, how would you like things to be with him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Who [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let me tell you this, I bring this up to [NAME OTHER] and he says he wants me and wants to be happy and not treat me the way he does, that's fine, but if he's going to remain together with me and be nasty, then forget it, that's the way I look at it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's more, what you want is just the absence of nastiness or the, you just want the arguments and the nastiness gone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing that you want to add in, you would like - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, just as long as he's nice to me and wants to remain with me and, yknow, it's not normal or natural to look at it this way, but quite frankly, I don't even care about a husband and wife relationship that way, if that's what he wants, so I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's why I asked you too, I mean is it that you want to have a more intimate relationship with him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do I?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe some women do look at it differently, I don't care, it's been fifteen years - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So the main thing is not to change everything, just to not be as nasty, to be nicer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, just be a better husband, he's a lousy husband because he's a nice person and as I said, when we married, he was nice, I was nice, we're not nice anymore.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe it's just to people that he doesn't know as well.  When I talk to him, he always seems very polite, very -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the thing with everybody, but me he's very nice.  I don't care who else, but me - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he's nice to everyone else except the person he knows the best?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, who he knows the least let's put it that way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I think when he comes in the next time, just be clear on what you'd like to say, too, you know, what you'd like to bring up and what you'd like to talk about so if he comes in the next time and we talk about just how you've been arguing or if there's been any - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you want to bring him in?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you want to bring him in?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you'd like me to?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, not to be in charge, you know, we can do it, get this over?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we wouldn't have a lot of time to go into things but, you know, let's schedule another visit here in the next few weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and then I'll finish up here and I give the appointment, I'll ask if he's able to come in for the visit the next time, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then we'll talk about those things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, about how it's going, whether there's arguments, that's how I'll bring it up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you come in the next time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about these doctors or people -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think it's going to be better when you're on the medication I prescribed, too, so start taking the two and the two.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Do I have to?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have to, but I think the medication will help you distance yourself from them.  Help you be able to tune them out like you were the last time you were here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was only on the visit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think part of it is the medication allows you to be in control of the condition, it allows you to push the voices aside.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess if I do things the right way it'll be all right.  I don't know, you're the doctor, so - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, I think what we discovered today was the prescription I'd written for you wasn't as clear.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And now I'm going to make the next prescription very clear so you know you take two in the morning and two in the evening, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, I'm going to turn this off.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: What a lovely week, I think I met two new friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was - the ones I met last week, but, you know, I think they're going to become friends. It really sounds like - you know, I figure for the first time, it's so funny because, like, I (inaudible at 0:00:25.9). Of course, they're a lot older than I am too. I think the girl's about - they're all - probably both about 30 or somewhere in that area. So I find it so funny because, like, I realize, like, in lots of ways they're spiritually and mentally ahead of me. You know, I mean, not capacity wise I don't think so much as just, you know, knowledge wise, they've been around a lot more.</p>

<p>0:00:48.1</p>

<p>And I don't feel inferior (inaudible at 0:00:49.1), holy cow, you know. I mean, I feel like - I was thinking last night, like, why did it always bug me when I felt inferior? And I feel like now it's more - it's more than just an inferiority complex, to me it was like - especially now that I'm getting used to be able to share a lot easier. It's like a feeling, like, do I have an equal amount of whatever to share? You know, is it going to be, like, a two way street or am I just taking all the time, you know, and learning from them? Am I giving anything to make it an even relationship? And that's...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to me it's more important now than what I can get from somebody else. You know, it's like - I mean, it's nice to learn but it should be two ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should be helping to teach more or less too back and forth - back and forth. And so I realize that this was one of the reasons that it used to bug me to hang around with people because I wouldn't feel as if what I felt and what I thought was good enough to even bother, you know, with. Because they would either - well, like, with my one girlfriend I would be afraid that she would cut it down, that was part of it. Or she'd be thinking, "Oh, you're so stupid." And then I say, "Well, that's it, you know, no more sharing." But with them I don't think it would be so much that because, like, I wrote a story and it was - like, I let him read it because he's an editor, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all he did was change a few things and I says, "We'll submit it, this is your first effort in a long time." But he didn't tell me about my sentence structure, which stunk, you know, like, I guess a best friend would do that, though. And she said, "Well..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "I know what you want to say, you know what you want to say." (Inaudible at 0:02:25.7) here, you know. And so, like, I mean, it was a nice thing. But it was, like, at least I felt like one time I could really share something.</p>

<p>0:02:33.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then she comes back with, "Oh, yeah, well, I got that speech aware in 19 something or other for New York writing a speech." I go, "Oh (inaudible at 0:02:42.0) no." She was, like, "Don't push that - we're pushing it (inaudible at 0:02:45.6) underneath something." It was so funny.</p>

<p>CONSELOR: But a little of both?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was a little bit of feel like, oh, here, I thought partly because I never realized she was a writer. I knew she wrote some - she had written some poetry. Well, my poetry is about (inaudible at 0:03:01.0). I know I can't write it. But see, like, I wouldn't mind that, she was good in poetry, I was good in short stories and then I thought, "Well, speech is closer to a short story, you know?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, "Oh, boy," but it was funny - it was, you know, I'll probably rewrite it and do something else because she did give constructive criticism, which really helped me. It was, like, it was almost - it wasn't like this teacher/student' relationship, though, that we've had. And I really realized a lot of times, like a mother image I almost get her sometimes. And I feel, like, I don't want to be on that term anymore because, like, I'm growing and I don't feel like I'm a child anymore that has to be told, "Now you do this and you do that, and don't do this," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's for the birds, it's for the kids. And so, like, in a way I really felt good because she said it was cute and it had lots of creative ideas in it. It just - the sentence structure wasn't too hot. But it was, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was something there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like a critic but it wasn't like a teacher saying, now, you know, "That's got to go and this has got..." you know, it was, like, just an explanation of your sentence structure has got to be worked on, it's got to be polished and it's not good. And then she mentioned about the theme because I was working on the Mideast. And she said, "Well, you know, I guess it's been hashed over too much," which made sense.</p>

<p>0:04:12.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, they probably wouldn't accept it because it was such a hashed over subject. They see one thing more about the Mideast and say, "Oh, forget it," you know. So it was good, but, like, it made me feel like she was finally accepting that I could accomplish something too, you know. Something like - maybe in even the same field or a similar field that she is, but in a different type of way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said, like, she used to do that, sometimes she had thoughts in her mind that wouldn't come down on paper the way she wanted it, you know? But it would be, like, again, it was, like, just an explanation of what I was doing wrong but not saying, like, you know, "You got to go into this, you got to go into that or you can't do this or you can't do that." Or this is what the in people do, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she had done this to me, she said she didn't but she had, you know, things like - well, you know, with the charm school and that, I went to under her and that's all. Like, you learn that you shouldn't do this because this is not, you know - and all this baloney. And it wasn't me at all, you know?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She really saw what you had.</p>

<p>0:05:13.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: She really saw that there was an effort. That it was a creative effort that was mine that it was something I did. I took an anecdote that she had told me about, this one girl going into Woolworth's and doing something, you know, to (inaudible at 0:05:25.1). And I built a whole story around it. So in other words it was, like, you can't say anything is completely original because it just isn't. You know, you've gotten from one place or another and then you changed it, you know, or correlated it or whatever and made your own ideas about it.</p>

<p>And so that's what I did, you know, so, like, I felt like this was my own effort that I put this whole thing around it, you know, in a story form. But I don't know, it was kind of a nice feeling because, like, for once I did something that was - like, I used to be good at writing so I had to like it. I think - she said it would be a good idea if I took courses in college on writing and on - you know, creative writing and literature and things like this. Because she could see it and I could see it that this is something that I - I could sat down for an hour, boom, boom, the whole thing was written and typed it up, you know, and that was it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you really like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's, like, ideas coming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To do and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She could see that you like to do it and was encouraging you to go on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, it was like that. It was, like, not saying, like, well, sorry, it looks - you know, because the sentence structure is bad. But see, like, she could see it that I had creative thoughts. You know, like, I guess it's something that you really like to do, why not? You know, if you've got, like, a hidden talent that's starting to come out, why not try to explore it and see if it's really, you know, a real talent that might be something? So I figure, why not, you know, I'll go look into that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's pretty solid. You're feeling pretty good about yourself in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not sort of just waiting for someone to cut you down and then be shattered by that.</p>

<p>0:06:54.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, like, it didn't really - in fact, I was expecting more criticism. I really felt better, it was really funny. One time I wouldn't feel this way but now - it sounds funny, it's coming from me because at one time, like I said, it would - if somebody criticized me, it was, like, ooh, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did something wrong again. But it's, like, she criticized me more and I realized that we were closer because she did. You know, like, they would say just hand it in and just, you know, help me with, like, quotes and technical things. But she came right down to the basis, says look, "The sentence structure has got to be polished." I knew this even after I had read it over a couple of times (inaudible at 0:07:31.4). I didn't know exactly what I was saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thoughts would be a little bit - you know, like, I even recognized it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, when he didn't, I expected him to be much more critical because he was an editor, but see, part of it is he doesn't know me well enough and I realize it. And we're not that close of friends, so, like, he doesn't like to discourage a first effort and things like this, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:07:50.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - but, like, a real friend would do that, she'd say, "Wait a minute," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She could be real honest about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About things that you sort of knew were wrong too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, right, right, because I said that. I could feel that there was something, you know, that wasn't really being expressed the way I wanted to express it. And, like, my conclusion I realized too didn't have enough backing up, you know, in the story, it was, like, just sort of like little signs (ph) that I put in rather than maybe making it a focus point so that you could bring out a conclusion, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but I was really kind of happy about that. I mean, that was something that was really - I don't know, for me it was some kind of a - not just a good feeling but, you know, (inaudible at 0:08:31.7) stuff. Like, an opening up, another channel is opening up again, you know, one that I knew was there but I (inaudible at 0:08:38.6), you know, I don't like writing as sort of just, you know, like, writing on paper, I don't like to do that. So, like, that was part - like, the manual part I didn't like so I said, (inaudible at 0:08:47.6) quit it, you know? And I never did any just for, you know, playing around or writing down phrases or whatever, I never did it.</p>

<p>You know, but when I met these people, it was just, like, you know, again an opening up of a creative channel. And I realized that there's something there, and wow, you know, it's starting to come out. And, like, in a (inaudible at 0:09:07.7) when I started it. And it's only been, like, a week. And it's so funny because my assistant (ph) came up to me last night and he, you know, tapped me on the shoulder, he said, "How did you like the class?" You know, and I said, "Oh, I really like it." He said, "Oh, that's good." He was so sweet. You know, just, like, he is so - to me he is like a mix between, like, when I was in Kabbalah, I went to a fellow who was a swami and yet, he doesn't preach or anything like this. He's just teaching that the mind is so strong and that, you know, like, in a sense he's saying not just the mind but the soul.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and, like, he's putting the body word for ones or the physical world where it belongs. You know, it's secondary, it's important but it's secondary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's, like, the mind and the things of the mind and the soul are so much higher. And this is, like, what you're attaining to. Like, lots of people think (inaudible at 0:09:58.2) is just, like, you know, anything, it was like boxing or something but has nothing - you know, it's a lot higher in the spiritual aspect. And so, gee, I (inaudible at 0:10:07.3) I never miss a class, you know. (Inaudible at 0:10:09.8) I got to get down there and ten below, I'd go there. But it's, like, if I can feel, like, a spiritual uplifting in the class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:10:18.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And part of it too I think is because, like, I'm not in competition with anybody anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that can be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that, it's strong and it feels really alive? Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like a - it's a real good feeling and yet, like - and I realized yet that - like, Friday night I'll go in and I won't go out with my friends for coffee or anything because I have to get home. And I realize it's so funny that at one time, if someone would ask me to go out, I'd go out all the time. Any time any - oh, really, they want me along, good, you know? And now it's, like, something I have to do for me and for the apartment and for, you know, my mother is more important than spending time even with people that I really enjoy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, for that night, I can't spend time with them. And I realize that it just - it really didn't bother me, you know, to say, like, "I can't make it," you know? Or, like, last week I had to go to a party on Friday, I said I couldn't make it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, going by what you want - by what you need right then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in that - well, see, I used to have a need for people always, you know, and, like, I don't feel like it's a selfish thing. Like, I might have at one time, I don't feel like it's selfish. I just feel like it's - it's, like, a feeling that, like, I don't have to grab onto you, you know what I mean? Like, I can be your friend and I can give whatever I've got to give, and you can do the same to me. But, like, it's, like, I don't have to have you, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:11:46.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think when I feel the need - like, when I feel like, even before when I had these really driving needs. When a fellow did that to me - I remember my girlfriend cracked up because I told her, "I can't stand this guy, every time I turn around he's there and he's saying 'I love you' and all this." (Inaudible at 0:12:00.3), Go away, I've got work to do." And this is the office at night, this other fellow, Will, was doing that. After a while you just get to the point where, get away from me. And I realized that it was, like, because it was a need, he needed me to like him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it was, like, "You've got to like me because I like you so much" or some stupid thing, but it wasn't really that he liked me, just needed me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I realized that that's what I was doing. And, like, it wasn't really my personality or even the fact that after a while I could give a little bit even before. But it was like that, it was, like, "You're my friend. You can't be anybody else's friend, you can't go out with anybody else. You can't - you know, unless I'm there," and all this crazy...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Got to clutch onto somebody?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it was, like, this thing, like, "I lost my parents and I lost this and I lost that." So, like, now, I got a friend and I got to hold onto it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you're saying it's easier somehow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it doesn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're more relaxed and you don't have to hang on so hard?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I don't feel like - in fact, like I said, I feel like I share a lot with these people and I learn a lot from these people, and I like them, I like being with them. We can talk for two hours and three hours, and I can't do that with many people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:13:05.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and yet, like, if they weren't there next week, so they weren't there next week, I'd either go home or maybe somebody else would ask me out for coffee, or I'd ask, you know, somebody else who I had maybe worked with I'll ask for coffee, I'd just go out. And, you know, like, I can do something on my own or with my girlfriend of whatever, and it doesn't make any difference, you know? And, like, I couldn't feel that way before. You know, I just felt, like, "Oh, Jesus." And, like, I sat last night too and I was thinking that, you know, like, when I found out that Eliza and Jodie were going away too, part of that, she said that sometimes I can give a lot and sometimes I don't. I just sort of, like, stand back and I don't do anything, you know, either for me or I just - you know, I just want to stay out of the picture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's times like those, it (inaudible at 0:13:49.5) hasn't happened too much lately, and I know it hasn't either because, like, I'm coming out of it a little bit. But it was, like, a known going to be rejection that I knew about. Like, I knew that they were going to leave. And she had something about, like, not seeing this girl for eight years or something. And that she had progressed and this girl hadn't, this was a best friend of hers back in high school or something. And so what that did was, like, I felt, like, she's going to be going all over the world. Now what can I possibly do because I have to work in an office eight hours a day? So right there, you're confined eight hours a day, you may as well forget it. If you learn one thing new a year you're lucky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's, like - so that, like, at night I could do classes or I could take (inaudible at 0:14:30.5) and take classes and whatever. But, so that's about it, you know, that I could be doing for this year and a half. Meanwhile, they're traveling all over the world. They're living life, they're living with people, they're learning different types of things, different types of cultures. And they're going to come back and look what they're going to have to give back. And look what I'm going to have to give to them. And I'm just - I was just afraid, it wasn't so much, like, when they were gone that they wouldn't write or whatever, it wasn't, you know, that type of thing.</p>

<p>It was just, like, you know, these are my best friends and, like, when they come back they probably won't have any interest in me because, like, I'm here and they're there, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they've been all over. And so I said to myself, "Well," - now I think more logically and, like, Eliza had lived in Costa Rica already. She's been, I think, to a couple of other countries besides the United States, and that hasn't made any difference. So I've only been in the United States, so what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, the other one has been already to Europe, she hasn't been where they're going now, like, the Middle East. But, you know, this is the first thing you think, "Oh, Jesus, you know, they're (inaudible at 0:15:27.5) this and here I am in my stupid office job, you know? What am I going to say to them when they come back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, you would get to be really unequal somehow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, I would feel that way. And so - but when I thought to myself, "Look, there's other ways to develop." And, like, when I think about the great gurus and that and the greater depths, they sat on mountains and they were improving. They were going up spiritually and even mentally by thinking on life and thinking on people and, you know, working out problems. I said to myself, "So what if I'm here and they're there?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>0:15:59.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so they're learning in one area and I'm learning in another area, I'm growing in another area, but see, like, the initial thing is that, oh, jeez, look at this and look at this, it doesn't somehow equal up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's still a little bit there for you, like, you still feel that a little?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's getting stronger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's still there, but it's not as bad as it was before because, like, I am realizing that I'm growing in other areas. You know, and like, I don't think, like - well, first of all, just for myself, if I went on that trip with them, just say if I went and I did do the same things they did, I don't know how much growth I would have because I wouldn't have maybe time enough or whatever to grow within myself like I will have now, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think right now that that's the most important thing for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's, like, a really good feeling that inside you and in your life here, like, you really can become something, you can grow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and yet, I've also brought into the idea that - or bought into the - you know, the thing - if it should happen, you know - because I'm (inaudible at 0:17:03.2), and I could never do this. I'd always be eating and watching TV and all sorts of things, you know, like constantly if nobody was around because I couldn't stand to be by myself. I'm sitting on my bed thinking, you know, (inaudible at 0:17:13.2) around or whatever. And it was so funny because, like, it was just - and I was thinking, like, "All right, now facing reality." So if they did come back and if I had grown apart from them in some way, shape or form, so what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, they would still - I would still remember them as, like, you know, like, Jodie is doing probably more for me than any one single person to get me going someplace or some direction. And, you know, like, my other girlfriend really hadn't done all that much for me, but she was nice, you know, and I liked her and I liked, you know, talking to her and being with her and things like this. But I said, "So what?" You know, like, if you have to leave a person behind or if they have to leave you behind and go on to something else, then that's the way it goes.</p>

<p>0:17:57.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so then you branch out and you find new people, or you just don't find anybody. And if somebody comes or if they don't come, then they don't come, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was, like - I said to myself, you know, and I looked around and I said, "You know something, I care." I mean, I would be hurt probably more than she would be if I walked out on her and said, you know, like, "I never want to see you (inaudible at 0:18:18.4) just have nothing in common. You haven't done anything with yourself or, you know, or I just don't want to be near you." And I said, "It would probably hurt me more." But, like, I could bear it. I wouldn't go all to pieces or, you know, like, have a nervous breakdown or anything. It would just be, like, all right, you know. It would be, like, facing that my grandfather was dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, somebody I loved, he's gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't have to count on one person or a few people so much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I'm getting to the point where I'm - I'm depending more on me. It's so funny because, like, I can go and if I don't talk to anybody at (inaudible at 0:18:50.2), if I don't talk to anybody wherever I go, I don't care, you know, so what? And if you don't want to talk to me, so what?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I used to be, "Umm, don't even talk to me." I can't believe it, but it's coming to that point, like, I do like people. You know, I always will like people and I like to interact with people. But it's, like, it's like I don't feel that pressing need for somebody either to approve everything I do or, you know, to really like me. And it's so funny because, like, my boss has changed. My favorite boss, he hasn't touched me and I (inaudible at 0:19:29.5). And it's just been, like, he went on vacation, when he came back I was kind of snotty to him the first day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then he never bothered me. He'd come up once in a while, he make some (inaudible at 0:19:40.0), you know, "I'd like to play around but it - I know I can't." And things like this, (inaudible at 0:19:43.7), you know, because he was always, you know, putting his hands all over me and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but when you changed then the other people...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he can pick up on that, and he could respond to that because he realized now, I didn't need him anymore is what it was. And so he figured, "Ah, what the heck." You know, but it was nice. It's nice now because now we've got a good working relationship. We goof around back and forth, but he's finally discovered something that's really shocked me. He discovered I have a brain. (Inaudible at 0:20:10.8). It used to be before, you know, like, "Well, it's a good thing you're cute because you're stupid" and things like this. You know, and he was putting me on a completely - I like to be considered a woman, I mean, every woman does. But, like, I didn't like to be put in that category of being so dumb type of woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:20:31.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I said to myself, "Oh, come on, like, I don't need that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really didn't, you know? And so, at least now, you know, this is just lately I've come to the conclusion that I like fellows to treat me like a girl, but I can't stand when they treat me like just a sex, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a sex (inaudible at 0:20:51.5), it just bugs the heck out of me. And I don't mean it even, you know, like, in actions, I mean, just like, that's what you are, you're, like, the dollhouse, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's, like (inaudible at 0:21:01.1) before, the more I read on feminine and the women's liberation, boy, I'll tell you...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want him to see you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I want him to see me as a person. It's, like, with my two friends. But it's very funny because, like, I figure I came even one step further than not caring about whether a person is a man or a woman when I first meet them. You know, just take them as a person. But it's, like, with him I know he's a man. I know it's obvious he's a man. But it's, like, I don't have any kind of inclination towards him as a boyfriend than I used to. (Inaudible at 0:21:31.4) with any man if he paid any attention to me, I would reciprocate as a woman to a man, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, and now I don't think that way at all. It's, like, we work on a mental level and a spiritual level and that's it. You know, it's really weird. And then - well, I wouldn't say, I shouldn't say all the time like a teacher who lots older. I would think of more like a father, you know. But, like, it either had to be a father or a boyfriend, nothing else, you know? And it was, like - but I went one step further even than that because, like, I noticed, like, his wife, if he talked - (inaudible at 0:22:02.8) he was talking for, like a (inaudible at 0:22:04.7) you know, amount of time or anything. And he would be, like, talking more to me more or less, like, he'd be facing me more than his wife.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could kind of sense that and, like, because she's just - well, she's like most American women in that way, she's a little bit insecure, you know, about her man just like lots of married people are. So I had to make sure that the conversation would switch so that she'd be talking, or I'd be looking at her, say, "Oh, you're kidding." You know, like, I would be communicating with her. And I really thought that this was something that I finally learned, like, you know, just because you're getting over that one specific thing, that doesn't mean that everybody else is. See, I always had that problem. When I move up a little, I expect everybody else in the whole world to move up a little. (Inaudible at 0:22:46.7) move up a little, like, whoopee, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you expect everybody else to be the same place you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right, right, because, like I said, like, they're - this is what makes me feel good too and almost equal in a different way because, like, I feel, like, a little bit further than they are in that area. Not so much the man but the girl, you know. But, like, they are a lot further than me in other areas. So, like, this way I can, like, kind of solve it at the same time - how could I say it? Like, lots of times the wife will just sit there and go, "Uh-huh," you know, and had (inaudible at 0:23:18.8). And then she'll get more angry and more angry and more angry and more angry, and pretty soon she's coming out with smart remarks. So she's coming out with, you know, like - something like this and she's taking it out on the girl.</p>

<p>0:23:28.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who is - you know, wants to just be a friend, you know? So in order to nip this in the bud and hopefully, eventually to get her so that she comes out of this so that she does it herself without me pulling her out, you know? Like, get her to talk too, get her into a conversation. Get her so that the attention is to her, this is what she wants or needs at that time, you know? So it's, like, it's so funny because, like, I'm thinking, all this stuff is going through my mind. I'm, like, now you to make Lee feel like she's not, you know - like, he's not talking to me as a girl but just as another mind that doesn't know, like, maybe they had talked this over before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So this is, like, a third party bringing, you know, in on it. It was so - and I realize it just is that, at one time I would think that, though, I would think the same thing she was thinking, "Oh, look, somebody else's man is paying attention to me," ah-ha-ha. I really would. And it was, like, a real good feeling for me because some man who wasn't really mine was paying more attention to me, which was almost saying, like, "When she's here, I like her better than you," and, you know, like, "I've had you for all..." you know, that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was, like, picking me because I was (inaudible at 0:24:30.3) and finally. And I don't feel that way anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just, like, I want to share and I don't care, like, you know, I like them and they share back. Like Ginger, when I saw her, she said, "You know, I really appreciate those cigarettes you got us last week." But she said, "I like the way you wrapped it even more." Because in other words, she was acknowledging that I had spent time and, you know, had been careful with what I had done to put it together for her because she was special, you know? And, like, I'm glad she felt that way because that's the way I meant it. And, like, sometimes you can do something and mean it one way and some people won't even - they will, like, overlook it or they won't see, you know, whatever?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she noticed that. So, like, in a sense she fulfilled a little bit of a need that I have that I still have a need in a way to be - you know, like when I do something to be acknowledged. Not like - you know, not like I expect somebody to go, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you." But to more or less acknowledge that what you did was special for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, not that you would do it for everybody on the street.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't want them falling all over you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't want it to get to that point because it (inaudible at 0:25:34.6). But just the fact, like, when she brought that out, that like made me for like - well, didn't make me but it made me feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, even that I did because I already felt good, I'm feeling more confident. But this made me feel better because it was, like, you know, I guess it was like a full communication. She understood what I meant, not just that I did it and it went - you know, misunderstood or, like, with no motive, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so partly this was like - this is the type of person I am too, you know? Like this one fellow, I said this at work the other day because he came by and he had some stupid little jelly beans or something. And I said, "Oh, gee, could I have one?" And he gave me, like, about five or six that were left and things. "Oh here, you can have it all back." I said, "Oh, that was so nice," you know. He (inaudible at 0:26:21.7) came by again and I said, (inaudible at 0:26:22.9). And he said (inaudible at 0:26:25.0), you know - "And now I realize why all the girls are crazy about you." "Crazy about me, why?" I said, "Because you're so nice." (Inaudible at 0:26:32.9), like, he said, "Oh," but he looked at me, like, "I know what you mean."</p>

<p>0:26:39.2</p>

<p>You know, it's not really what you say, it's just, like, there was a communication and he understood what I meant. And, like, I think he should be told this because, like, the guy is nice to all the girls, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was, like, when I acknowledged it, I could feel him feeling better. Because, like, although I shouldn't keep giving and giving and giving somebody, it's, like, well, the only reason they want me around is because I give but if you acknowledge that you don't think he's doing this to get your friendship, you know, or to be considered, you know, like that. But just because he's a nice guy and this is the way he is, you know? And then, when you come back with that and he realizes that you notice it. Then it's like a two way street, you know, you both feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, like, a real nice reaction, like, you know, this guy, I couldn't care less about but he's just a nice guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, like, this whole new way of being you have, like, it's really rich and open and warm and it's really good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's a real great - do you mind if I light up a cigarette?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good, I didn't have my nicotine ratio yet this morning. I always crack up because I get like that, I got to stop these things because I looked at the thing last night and I said, "Hmm, that's not going to help the lifespan any." You know, but it's just the idea that it's, like, I have it. Would you like one or do you smoke?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, thanks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. And I don't know, it's so funny, though. Like, the way I get to feel about people that I have never felt before. You know, not a need for people but a wanting to be with people and, you know, interact with people. The only thing is I'm kind of wondering about that. I've increased my smoking, maybe it's because I've cut down my eating. I hope that's all it is because it's, like, a - you know, like, a thing from "Little Lads." I (inaudible at 0:28:29.9), you know, I used to pacify myself putting something in my mouth. I got to get over that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm hoping that that's not a symptom of something else. I'm hoping that that's just a habit that was acquired in youth and, like, it's hard to get rid of, you know? But - because I remember that all the time when I was little, it was always - well, of course, even when you're a baby, you know, you're crying so what does mommy do? She sticks a bottle in your mouth or she breast feeds you or whatever she does, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's so funny, then you're sitting there, every time you feel like - or just, you know, like, I just do this normally, I sit at work and I'm reading a letter and I'm smoking a cigarette. Every time I'm not doing something with my hands, I'm smoking or I'm, you know - well, I shouldn't say every time unless I start thinking, which is weird. Because I'm kind of a crazy kid, I just realized that. But it was - I felt so good because, like, I've been able to do this lately. This bit about just sitting by myself.</p>

<p>0:29:26.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I do this lots of times, sometimes when I'm setting my hair or doing something else. But, like, something that you don't need your mind for, you know? And I was sitting and I was thinking - you know, be thinking over things and I'll be trying to - not really psyche myself out but, like, trying to understand why I felt the way I felt about things. And, like, I could never do that before. Again, like I said, especially if I had a bad day and something happened and I was hurt, I would escape to the TV and, like, I wouldn't move except to get up to get something to eat, and then I would eat and eat and eat and eat, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now it's, like, you can kind of be aware of all those things and watch them just let yourself feel them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And do you know that I haven't in the last about two or three weeks, at least, I haven't bloated (ph) myself once. And, like, I used to do it lots of times. It wasn't maybe just because of hurts, but it was just any kind of frustration, I would take it out, you know, and I'd bloat (ph) myself. Of course, (inaudible at 0:30:24.3) smoking, that might be one of the reasons. But it was just like an idea that I had to be so full, you know? And I think we brought that up before because of the emptiness I felt inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it was, like, what you were saying about people, that you just had to take so much in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fill yourself up to make yourself feel something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that was true, that it was a very big thing for me to be, you know, like - yeah, and if I was alone - especially - I noticed that too, especially when I was alone if I went out to eat, you know, like, if I was left home alone I would do that. If my sister or somebody was around I wouldn't do that. I would smoke - see, like, part of the reason I did pick up smoking as a habit is because, like, I live with my sister and she smokes a lot. And where I work everybody smokes practically a lot, not everybody, lots of people smoke a lot. And, like, I get to the point where I am smoking, you know - I really can't explain it. But just like it's - it's just like a habit that I picked up and I just do it.</p>

<p>0:31:24.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I say to myself I don't really need it, and I can get by without it if I don't have them. But if they're there I smoke them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just kind of automatic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gotten almost to that point except for the nicotine. Like, if I have two or three cigarettes in the morning, I can go, you know, till late afternoon or, like, if I'm going out with somebody who smokes then I'll smoke again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's really funny, if I don't have them I don't miss them that much except for that one in the morning with the coffee I like. But that's why I think it's kind of weird that I don't really feel - I think I should start giving them up, you know, eventually. I don't think it's something I need so much as it's something I picked up that I do out of habit. You know, I just brought that up because I decided I felt like having one because I always have one around this time of the morning, you know, with my coffee. And it's so funny.</p>

<p>You know, something else happened that I thought was so nice with interaction with people, and it was Saturday and I overslept and went to a party. And again, I was going to leave the party because it was so rotten, and I started talking to these people in the kitchen, yet. (Inaudible at 0:32:29.9) the party in the living room playing cards and all crazy things, so what I do I do? I walk out to the kitchen and I start talking to these two people. And it was, like - and we were talking till 3:30 in the morning so, like, it was a real nice interaction. We were playing volleyball with a balloon and all sorts of crazy things, you know, mixing all drinks together. Not getting bombed but just, you know, like, doing all sort of crazy things.</p>

<p>0:32:50.3</p>

<p>I woke at 11:30, I was supposed to be in class at nine o'clock. And I called my teacher and (inaudible at 0:32:57.2), I got a problem, you know, I just woke up and I went to this party. She said, "Well, what are you doing now?" I said, "I'm standing my pajamas," you know, (inaudible at 0:33:05.6) get dressed, eat breakfast and come down. So she sandwiched me in, in her afternoon class, which I thought, you know - like, I thought that that was so nice for somebody to do for somebody she didn't really even know or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's just, like, I met another person I think that eventually is going to be, you know, somebody that's going to be more than just an acquaintance because somebody who will put themselves out like that for you or for anybody, not - I don't feel, like, it's something, like, now she's picked me, wow. You know, I believe she would do this for anybody who was interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so it's like saying, oh, I met a person not that can fulfill my needs especially mine, but, like, a person who can give, you know. And, like, that's what my girlfriend said too, she said just wait. You know, just open yourself up and when you do you'll meet people that are like you, or that, you know, that will do things. And when you find somebody who can share, somebody you can talk to and things like this, this is the whole basis of it, you know, because there's a communication. So, you know, like, probably after she's not my teacher anymore. Because, you know, like, for, like, four or five months I'll be going to her as my teacher, and then after that who knows? You know, friendship might come out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's, like, finding her, finding someone who likes to give.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that's so funny, you know, that there's so many people around like that but, like, I never noticed them before. And, like, I felt like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before it was only you, like you were all alone...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and maybe even because, like, I would go into things. Like, I went into Kabbalah the first time to meet people, not to go into Kabbalah. I eventually got to the point where I was in Kabbalah for Kabbalah. But, like, the first time I went down was to meet cool people because, you know, like, I just - I got to find someplace to meet people, you know? And now every place I go I'm meeting people. You know, it's not, like, I have to meet them. Like, it was really weird because, like, I'm walking down the street now and I'm just thinking, you know, and I'm not, like - like, at one time, you know, I used to try to be - walk the model's way and everything and hoping that, you know, (inaudible at 0:35:04.0) or something. How (inaudible at 0:35:06.1) oh, hi, I don't know (inaudible at 0:35:08.0), oh, hi, you know? But it's like an openness that I'm starting to get back that I had when I was a child.</p>

<p>0:35:13.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems like it shows.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and, like, I guess people can feel, like, when you're - I guess when you're happy with yourself that people can tell. Like, there are some people that I don't even walk down the street, and they'll be just, like - just look at them and you want to say hi or you want to almost talk to them because they're just - there's just something within them that's, like, a real open feeling, just like an aura around them, you know, that you can sense. And it's real weird, but it's, like, for a long time I didn't have that. I was always thinking, "Oh, now I did this wrong and I did that wrong."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this much wrong with me, it was always me, me, me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, I'd say, "Well, now if I don't do this or if I lose weight or I do this or if I do that then people will like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was always something outside of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what my friend said too. (Inaudible at 0:35:59.1) I said something about, well - I even said this, like, about a month ago. I said, well, I suppose one of the reasons I don't have, you know, the sharper boyfriends is because I'm too heavy for this. Come off it, you know, she says, "I have as many boyfriends when I'm heavy as when I'm skinny or in between, it doesn't make any difference." And I said to myself, "Well, you know, that's really true." So now, it's so funny because now I don't care. I really don't care. I had to drop one friend because he was getting, you know - he didn't have anything in common. We went to see "Five Easy Pieces," you know, he didn't get anything out of that movie, not a damn thing. He came out of it and he said, "Well, they think they can throw out a few swear words and that's going to really do something." And I said, "Oh, my gosh, oooh." I said, "Well, sorry, folks." And it was just, like, it wasn't just that. Like, it had been building up, like, he's German and he thinks he's superior.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:36:49.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: He said, "Oh, well, I'm glad you like Japanese places (inaudible at 0:36:50.6) because they're sort of like Germans, they're superior people." And I went, "Oooh." So, you know, he didn't realize how much he turned me off. But, you know, what I should have done is invite him over with a couple of my black friends and, you know, a couple from Mexico and a few other people were over. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you it's a point where you can not be with people that you don't particularly like or enjoy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it, I'm getting there now. Like, my girlfriend said, "I'm so proud of you." I said, "Why?" She said, "Because you told that guy off, at one time you would go out with a guy just to go out." You know, and it's, like, my friend, Jim. I think I'm going to try and get him into therapy and once I do - you know, because, like, I see it, I can see it now. Like, I care about him, partly again because he cared so much for me when I needed help, when I needed somebody he was there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, now when I go out, it's so funny because, like, I don't think he's having a good time, which is not really the way to go out. I mean, you should go out just to have a good time and interact. But now it's, like, I almost feel like I want to help him, partly because he cared about me and partly because he just needs help, and I know it, you know? And it's, like, I don't know how to convince him because, like, even my girlfriend said, "Look, I can tell you, I told you where to go but you had to make the decision, and you can do that with him." But, like, I don't know if I can. You know, and I feel so bad, if I can't get this guy to be helped because he's got such a good brain, such a lot of potential but he's so unhappy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and he's, like - he says it's because he's in the school system and it's rotten. I said, "All right, there's lots of things about it, there is a few things that you could say is irrelevant that you have to take in order to get, you know, where you're going for your degree." But I said, like, "Lots of things you consider irrelevant are not really that irrelevant, you just make them irrelevant," you know? And so, he says, well lots of - it's so funny because now he admits sometimes that I'm right. He used to always - he was always the teacher, you know, this and that and the other thing, you should do this. "Yes, Jim, yes, Jim, okay." You know, I (inaudible at 0:38:55.0), you know?</p>

<p>And so, it was things, like, now he's respecting me as a person, I'm respecting him as a person. But I ought to do something more, you know, I just feel like I've got to do something for this guy because, like, somebody who doesn't have the potential you can say, "Well, leave them there, that's all you can do." But when they got the potential and you know, like, if he was in therapy, what a beautiful person he could be, you know? Like, he wouldn't be blaming lots of things on his parents all the time. He wouldn't be blaming everything on the school system all the time. He could say, "Look, you know, I'm not perfect." You know, "Part of it's me, part of it's - well, look, maybe I'm not real good at this, so what?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe I don't enjoy this as such. But like I do with my job, make a game out of it and things like this, and capitalize on what I do like on it and do the rest as fast as I can and get it over with, you know? But to get to him, you know, to reach him, to get him out with people because he's scared stiff. He's afraid of people. He uses it, like, say, well, there's not enough people around to bother with and all this. Come off it, you know, you're - okay, so maybe you are in the upper four percent of the people. So that means four out of every hundred people would be up exactly in your caliber. I'm not up in your caliber and you go out with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, I may be seven or eight percent, you know? I said, "So what, you go out with me. So you'll go with me but there's lots of people that are a lot higher than me in ability and everything else that you could, you know, really, really - really deeply communicate with."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:40:28.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, "And you don't find that because you sit and you sit by yourself always." And it's, like, he says, well, he thinks about, you know, problems. I said, "Well, this is very important to think." But how come I've got time to think, to work a full time job, a part time job, go to classes and I still have time to see people, you know, for an hour or two hours here and there. And he said, "Well, yeah, well, you know, I just don't have time." You know, and all these excuses and he just will not admit to himself that, "Look, I need help," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, like, I try and I try and I try and he - you know, like, when I first - I told him because I thought I could maybe by telling him that I was doing this that he would, you know. And I said, look, I said - he said - I said something about (inaudible at 0:41:11.4) you see the (inaudible at 0:41:12.8). And it was, like - you know, (inaudible at 0:41:15.7) like, he said "a shrink," that's what he called. I said, "I'm not seeing a shrink, I'm seeing a psychologist. There's a big difference." And I'm trying to explain to him, like, you know, I wouldn't see a shrink because most of them are quacks, you know. The psychiatrists, most of them are quacks. And I'm, like, you know, please understand. And at first - because this was, like, when I first started, when I first tried getting (inaudible at 0:41:36.1).</p>

<p>And at first I thought, "Oh, Jesus, you know, he's going to - I hope he doesn't say anything. Because this is the first thing I though, like, if he takes it this way, everybody he talks to (inaudible at 0:41:45.7) tell them, I said, "Well, whatever you do, don't say anything." And then I thought later on that maybe this isn't the right thing to say because, like, I was caring about my needs. But I had put it in such a light like, Jesus, don't tell anybody. Like, it was really something - you know what I mean, like, really was awful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that, like, maybe this would scare him more than getting him in. And I - oh, Jesus, how am I going to get this guy to go? You know, and I just - I try to figure out an argument because I know I have to reach him on a mental level. It's got to be something that makes sense to him because if it doesn't, he'll just say, you know, okay. You know, typical woman, sorry, you know, and walk away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you have a feeling that's really right for him. But if (inaudible at 0:42:28.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know he needs it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to figure out a way to get to him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just cannot reach the guy. I've tried, you know, and he'll say - oh, he'll make very excuse under the sun. "I don't have enough money, I don't have enough time, I don't have enough this." You know, anything you want to imagine. And, like, well, what he was doing actually, maybe if he sits down and thinks about it he'll realize that - he didn't say ever that he didn't need it. All he did was say, like, he didn't have the time for it, he didn't have the money for it. He did know if they gave it, you know, so in other words, he's halfway admitting that he knows there's something wrong. Because like I said, like, you're really not happy, (inaudible at 0:43:06.7) like for you. You can't be happy because I'm here. Well, you're going to go from here and you're going to go into business, and you're still going to be unhappy, it has nothing to do with school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:43:13.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's your unhappiness in what you're doing. I blamed it on my job for a long time too a lot. I hate the job, the job is for dummies, the job is for this. It's not the job, you can make - all right, so admittedly, it's not the most satisfying because of my capabilities. I'm not be completely used. So maybe eventually when I can work myself when the depression and the recession starts getting better, and the country is starting to get back on its feet. In another six months maybe I will try to get a job that fits my capabilities. But that doesn't mean for the next six months I'm going to just subsist and I'm going to hate what I'm doing, and I'm going to hate the people around me and I'm going to - you know? And this is the way he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why suffer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, because what's the good of it? Like, who - let's face it, who cares but you? Who really gives a damn but you? You know, you make your own sorrow. I just realized that to myself too. I made my own unhappiness, not other people, not because I didn't have friends. I didn't have friends because I was unhappy mostly, you know? And, like, trying to explain this to this guy, Jesus, you really - it's really hard to reach him. And yet, he's such a likeable guy when he relaxes and he's not - you know, when he does finally, like, come down a little bit and come off the baloney, he's lots of fun. He gets up and, you know, he does goofy things and he talks goofy and things like this, and he's lots of fun. But this very seldom, it's a lot of work on my part and other people's parts that are close to him that, you know, have gotten through this shell a little bit.</p>

<p>And, like, how many people are there? There's, like, maybe three of us, and that's pretty bad. We've been with him since we were 14 years old, you know? And, like, that's an awful long time to not have anybody else get close to you. You know, like, heck, the people that I was close to when I was 14 I don't even know anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I (inaudible at 0:45:01.8) it just - it's real hard to try to get this guy to get moving. But, like, see, my girlfriend said too, like, if he got into therapy, like, we would probably find that once we were on it - because I don't need him anymore right now I don't feel. And, like, I'm only seeing him now because I'm worried about him, not about me, I don't care anymore. Because, you know, like, so what? So okay, so he's going to help me get some stuff for my apartment. So maybe in that way, which almost sounds mercenary, I might need him in that area, you know? But as far as otherwise, I just want to be with him to get him into therapy and after that - it's so funny because, like, I feel, like, then he's on his own. Then make your own life. Maybe in five years we could maybe get back together, who knows?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When we both have grown in our own areas but I doubt it. Because I think what was keeping us together mostly more than anything else was our need for each other, you know? And that's sick, that's not a good way to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you're changing and you want him to see a new way too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just want - you know, you would think he would see the happiness in me, that it would be just enough in itself because he knew how I was before. It was, like, all superficial, whatever was there was superficial and, like, these great plans and things like - I really felt - it was an awful way to feel now I realize. Like, I was nothing now but someday I'll be something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's, like, then you're always reaching for that rainbow, you know, because once you attain something. Like, most girls my age don't make the money I make and things like this in the area unless they've had college. You know, then maybe they can make better money. But, like, in things like this - and I say to myself, "There's lots of girls that have (inaudible at 0:46:44.2) lots worse than I am. So, like, why do I look at my job as being so subservient to other people my own age I (inaudible at 0:46:53.5). And I shouldn't feel that way. You know, even though like I say now it's just a stepping stone. Someday I'll be another plain, so what? So now I'm here. And when you admit that you're in one place it's not so bad once you say, "Hey, you know, I am what I am right now."</p>

<p>0:47:10.7</p>

<p>You know, and it's really something nice because, like, I can say that, now I'm free to grow because I said, look, you are what you are, you can't change what you are right like that. It's got to be a gradual thing if you want something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and if you want to change anything you have to accept where you are now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you can't be always waiting for something tomorrow because then you're living there instead of living here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, and then again, you're unhappy because it's, like, an anticipation. It's, like, you're never enjoying anything that comes along that you could have enjoyed if you just left yourself open for it now. And, like, it was so funny because, you know, this reminds of is a letter that Jodie got last night from one of her students. And it was saying that she had been really rotten to her so now she was apologizing in the letter for being so rotten.</p>

<p>And she said, "I want - I was going to wait till tomorrow." You know, till Wednesday, I guess she got - you know, well, she got it yesterday. So she said, "I was going to wait till we had the conference," you know, the individual conferences. But she said, "Tomorrow is not promised to me." And that just stuck with me now because that's so true. Can you imagine how sad a person would be, like, if all their life they were trying for something and pushing for something (inaudible at 0:48:20.6) for something and they die before they got it? You know, and here they are, they're never been happy, they're been looking for the star, they never got it, just two of them are dead, you know?</p>

<p>And I thought, "Oh, my gosh, because you never know." Like, I might not be here tomorrow so why should I be unhappy today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>0:48:38.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, why should I say that all my life I was waiting for something and I never got it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because, like, especially if there is an afterlife, which I'm pretty sure there is. You know, then you see there's a - boy, what a rotten (inaudible at 0:48:48.4). Yeah, I'm sitting and I've been waiting and waiting to get someplace and I never got any place because I was waiting, you know? That sounds stupid but, you know, like, that's (inaudible at 0:48:58.0) so funny because that's just what it is, like, an antithesis. You're waiting and waiting and then meanwhile, you could be doing something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's so funny because that just came back to me, "Tomorrow is not promised to me." You live today and you're happy today. And it's so - I don't know because I just come to these conclusions all of a sudden. You know, these things all happen that - all right, so, like, there's things that have happened, so there's things that have happened in everybody's life but now it's time to rebuild.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's time to build a new one and to really explore and see what else is in the world, you know? And it's so funny, like, you know, like, my girlfriend...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's amazing that that feels good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's so different from the way you used to think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I could never go out on my own. I could never try other things. Admittedly, like, on days when I go to (inaudible at 0:49:47.2) around three o'clock I (inaudible at 0:49:49.2) five o'clock come around quick, I want to get out of here. But it's, like - it's not like I really hate the job, it's just, like, this is an anticipation, it's only like an hour or two ahead. And you know what's going to happen, you know, and it's, like, you're not going to be there, you know? And you know that this is something you really dig and you're doing something that you want - you know, you've made a game out of it. And it's something that you know you have to do now.</p>

<p>It's not something that - I can't really say I really dig secretarial work, like, wow, it's the best thing in the world. But at the same time, I could live through that eight hours and I can go home, and I can still be - like, people say, "How can you be so damn happy, you know, at the office?" But it's, like - because now it's, like, I do the singing and I - especially if I start to feel like, oh, this filing is beneath me, I'll start thinking while I'm filing because you can do that. You just follow your numbers (inaudible at 0:50:36.4) and you're not even - you mind is a million miles away. So I'll do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and not even as a form of escapism. I just, like, I'm thinking, you know, so, like, this can be done with - you know, just, like with a subconscious mind barely putting it in order. But it's, like, before it was a terrible bore, oh, it was awful, you know, it's killing me, you know? And the more you say it's killing you the more it does kill you because you're making yourself sad. It's, like, we were talking last night about the subconscious mind. You know, like, when we were talking, and I never realized this but one of the fellows brought out this. This is why if you concentrate and watch a post, you're, like, drawn to it. They say never look at the cars in the opposite lane or something my girlfriend saying, because you see the oncoming traffic and you're going towards it unconsciously. Because you don't see - don't go near the light, all you see light, you know, you towards it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:51:28.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, you know, we were putting that together and we came out with - like, the mind can't - I mean, the subconscious mind you can't say do not do this, you know? All you can say is do this. Like, if we say arm - don't let his arm get - all you think of is arm and that arm can hold you, like, in (inaudible at 0:51:47.6). But if they grab you and you think forward, you're going to keep going forward. Or if you think that wall, you'll go towards that wall and nobody can stop you because your mind and everything is focused towards that point, the subconscious too. And, like, I remember that because, like, this morning I was going and I'm going, no wonder the churches and that are so, you know, uptight because subconsciously, like, all these things are popping into my mind. Like, they say do not kill.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'm thinking kill, well, of course, this is the only thing the subconscious registers is kill. So in other words, it's so easy then to say, like, okay, now consciously I know I can't kill my brother. But it's very easy then to kill somebody who's not on your side because subconsciously you've been taught kill, kill, kill, kill, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, it's okay to kill really because that's all you think. You think of killing inside because they don't - you know, it doesn't register negative, positive, it's just the thought, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Down there. And I thought, "Wow," you know, all these things are popping through my mind and (inaudible at 0:52:45.5), you know? Because things are - you know, it was like that dog (ph), things are starting to - people will say something and it will, like - maybe not right away but, like, maybe the next day, I may just be thinking of that same thing or maybe something that was said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all these things start popping, you know? Oooh.</p>

<p>0:53:08.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you're really taking life in or something like that, like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, I never felt that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reacting to things, you're meeting life, something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and the real world basis, you know, and level. And, like, now it's, like, too because, like, it used to be such a pain for me to read. Oh, I used to - I say okay now, you have to read this much. And I'd sit myself down and I'd read that half an hour if it killed me. I mean, my mind - like, I was reading on art and things like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, my mind didn't absorb a heck of a lot of what I was reading. You know, like, I could read the whole book and there might have been lots of things in there I didn't even see. Because, like, you know, like, my mind really wasn't working on it. Some of things I was really interested in that would, okay, but, like, otherwise, you know? And now it's, like, I am like a little kid at work, it's so funny because, like, sometimes I'm just filing and it doesn't have to done right away. If I (inaudible at 0:54:03.8) goes to make Xerox and my boss isn't around or if she goes to lunch, take the little book out of the drawer and I'm reading like a little kid sneaking it. It's so funny because, like, I realize that I see myself as a little kid.</p>

<p>0:54:15.3</p>

<p>You know, putting the book behind the schoolbook or something and you're reading something else. I thought that was so funny. But it was just, like, it was, like, I felt this way because first of all, I didn't feel like - I wouldn't do it if I felt like it was something that had to be done. Like, if it was a job like typing that had to be done, I'd say okay. But, like, this is something that I had all afternoon because the boss was out at a meeting. And I had nothing else to do so why...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Twiddle my thumbs later on when I can (inaudible at 0:54:40.9) doing something to me is a lot more, you know, meaningful now. And then, like, you know, later on so what? When my (inaudible at 0:54:46.9) partner's there maybe we can talk or something or, you know, I could be thinking (inaudible at 0:54:50.3). But right now I want to learn. I feel like learning so I sneak the book out of the drawer. And I'm, like, just making sure the office manager doesn't come by. But it's so funny because I just laugh at myself afterwards because I can just see the pictures as well, she's reading along, she's looking up making sure the office manager doesn't come, like, you know, like a little kid making sure the teacher doesn't come by. And stick the book in the desk when somebody comes, it's so funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're saying is that now you really enjoy those things. It's not, like you should do it or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, I never - I would never do that. I would - sometimes, like, on the hour if I didn't want to, I would meditate sometimes even before. But mostly when I meditated it was - I realized this, I would use mantra yoga, which would be the chants. Which is in essence what you were doing is you almost had to concentrate on the chant. So really, you weren't really - you could get to a certain point in mediation but it would be like doing an activity so that you wouldn't have to think, you know? It was still like anything else, it was like an activity so I wouldn't have to think.</p>

<p>Now even when I'm singing, I sing - I only sing songs usually that are meaningful to me or meaningful to life, like, "Everyday people" and things like this is one of my favorites and "Aquarius." Because, like, it makes me think while I'm singing it at the same time, you know? And it's, like, I never had that before. I never felt that before. And I just feel so - I don't know, so alive. I still have problems sometimes with my girlfriend getting defensive because I feel like (inaudible at 0:56:21.2) like her towards - like, I would towards a mother who was kind of strict or towards a teacher who's kind of strict. And who is critical, very critical, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:56:30.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, at times I get defensive. It's, like, I say, like, "Look, I have to defend myself every time I turn around because I say I'm doing something and you're always testing me. But, like, I don't like to be tested. This is what I'm doing because I want to do it, you know? And I don't have to give you a complete explanation of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it." You know, and like, so once in a while I find myself getting a little bit defensive but it's not as bad. You know, now we can interact again. For a while it was very hard. I couldn't interact with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it was always - it's a comparison, you know? Now I don't care, like, she was bringing out her love letters last night that she has from these guys. We had a ball. I said, are you (inaudible at 0:57:08.5) you bring these out and you crack up with a girlfriend, and here's a guy who was very seriously, madly in love with you. So we just sat there and she was reading some of the funny ones, and some of the real - not sexy but, you know, like, these really love letters. Like, "Oh, (inaudible at 0:57:22.2) stop moving when you left," and all of this crazy stuff, you know?</p>

<p>Because (inaudible at 0:57:27.9), "The statues wept when you left." And she's going, oh, but it's so funny because now we can - you know, again we can interact. And it's not, like - you know, like, I can feel like when I (inaudible at 0:57:40.6). I (inaudible at 0:57:42.2) read it because she was in it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's, like, because she's a very real part of my life. We were both so stupid, I don't know, it's a crazy thing that I made up, it was that story. I never read (inaudible at 0:57:52.7). And I guess maybe part of it was, like, she was kind of happy that not only was I going on my own, but, like, I did include her in a certain sense in what I was doing. And I probably will, like, if I ever go into writing, she'll probably be a person that I would put into some of my themes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she just is a very, you know, dynamic and a very lovable type person. Like, lots of people really, you know, care about her. So it's very nice, though, because, like, I can get again to that point, like, when I first met her. Because I didn't realize (inaudible at 0:58:22.9) I had. Mostly it was with men. But I was all right if I was just with one person, you know? Like, whether it was a man or a woman, I'm okay when I'm with a boyfriend as long as there's not another girl around, you know?</p>

<p>0:58:33.6</p>

<p>But, like, it's still another person that you're (inaudible at 0:58:37.5) seen before, it was, like, oh, I'm not getting enough attention, I'm not getting enough this and I'm not getting - you know, and I felt left out. And that was very bad. And it came to a head when we went to Atlantic City at the end of August because (inaudible at 0:58:52.0) because we had another girl come with us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was just, like, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you're saying you don't have to be into that (inaudible at 0:58:59.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-um, I don't feel like I need it. Even when I call, like, my one girlfriend up and I'll say, like, we (inaudible at 0:59:05.2). For three weeks we were supposed to go to a meditation, I was supposed to take her out to lunch. Three weeks, neither of us went. It was so funny. I don't go to it, you know, I just - I wanted to go to take her out to lunch. But now I said, I'd rather - I said, "Well, I'll just meet you during the week," and that way I won't have to because I don't like the meditation. They're not my thing. I mean, once in a great while it might be nice to go and pick something up. But when I went all the time I found his sayings and that repetitious. I felt things he was doing was getting - let's see - can I say it? Almost a little bit religious, you know, and I would never become a disciple because that's like being a Catholic.</p>

<p>You know, like, now you have to obey everything he says, I said, uh-uh, not for me. I'll read on different philosophers, I'll listen to you, I'll listen to other philosophers and other people, and then I'll take from you what I think I, you know, need. And then another thing they do to keep you in, it's like the Catholic religion and I didn't like it. You can't do that because systems contradict each other and things like this, so you have to (inaudible at 1:00:10.5) one system. I said, "Why?" You know, there's all these systems open in the world, why should I have to follow one system?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why can't I be an independent and just look into all different ones, and then figure out what I want from each one that applies to me, you know? But I (inaudible at 1:00:25.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of taking on someone else's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because then you're doing the same thing again, you're taking somebody else's mind and you're letting them pour it into you. And I don't believe you can do that now. I did at one time, you know, because I said, "Oh, I'm so stupid and I'm so ignorant and, like, I don't know anything." But now I say, like, you know, I've got to look into different people and different types of things. And that way, that's the way I feel that you can learn, you know, not by taking on just one person's - everything they say, that's it, you know? And so I guess maybe that's why, now I get to be, like, with people that I like to share with what I have, and also like to hear what each person says. And yet, like, right away, like, I find myself - if I don't agree completely I'll say, "Well, I agree with you."</p>

<p>Like, last night, I never thought I could do this, you know. I said, "Well, I agree with you partially but I also disagree." And then I - he had given an example and I'd give an example that kind of overlaps. Wasn't exactly the same, you know, but it was a similar situation.

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just need to look on the web site and see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Absolutely. Yea, no, I won't do anything with it until tomorrow morning or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause) I am frustrated (ph) myself today because I'm in pain for possibly no good reason. And so, what I deemed is no good reason which necessarily doesn't mean anything. It is quite difficult to get here. The weather is not necessarily that barometer is not conducive to having arthritis problems. There's all these other things that I would normally associate with having trouble and it was just really, really painful today. It's not that cold, it's not, you know what I mean, all the stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The usual things that you normally do really well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do walk here on a regular basis. [00:01:01] Like yesterday, I walked home. And although, it's a little bit discomforting. It's not too bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not like it's a different route where there's a different gradient that I'm walking or there's a different gradient that I'm walking or a different amount of distance or anything like that, it's just... So I'm just... (pause) </p>

<p>I did get from my doctor, awhile back, that although I'm on steroids, it would be in my very best benefit to do my very best to lose some weight, because if the steroids (ph) are unstable, they can't handle the weight. And I'm, well, "What am I supposed to do?" and they're like, "Well, have you heard of this thing called a 'diet'?" And I'm like, "Oh, great." Actually, that's not the exact phrase but that's what I recorded (ph) when they said that. It's not like I'm—I know because I wouldn't eat all the things that I wanted to eat when I was away for this funeral. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't eat like that normally. I really don't. And I'm not eating much junk food. [00:02:01] I'm not—not things that are super rich and fat or sugary or anything like that. It's just that my body, when on steroids, gains a lot of weight. I used to be very tiny. And so, with that, what I hear is, it's not eating anything or like—I mean not anything, but you know what I mean, like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —go to extreme measures to save your joints so that you don't have to get in the replacement. That's what I hear. And so—(pause) It's really frustrating to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. You're hearing like, "And I have to give up eating a lot of things I like."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, well I don't get a chance to eat most the stuff (ph) I like to anyways, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I [don't gall bladders] (ph). I don't really digest any animal fat all that well anymore, and I just can't afford most of the things I like anyways. There's a point in which I was for a year that I was a vegetarian, not for any reason other than that I was broke. Like, I would, (inaudible at 00:03:02) oh my God, I haven't had any animal meat in over a year. So it's not like it's—(pause) </p>

<p>And, I don't know how to explain it's—(pause) It's really frustrating because it's not that, (pause) I'm really indulging that much. And I have a very, very habitual diet at least in the mornings because I have to so I don't get stones and organs that don't want to be there because I have to take thyroid medicine. And I'm just frustrated because I want them to look at my thyroid [to this] (ph) and like, "Oh, we saw it in sometime earlier in this year and that means nothing." And so I go, "Oh, whatever." So basically, I've been getting off and on the message over a year which is, "If you lose "X" amount of weight, that is going to show that you're compliant enough that we will help you." [00:04:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that just really pisses me off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—(pause) And —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, that's bullshit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm doing what they want now. I'm writing everything down I eat, hasn't really changed. I don't—I have very distinct plans because we have a very, very tight budget. So it's not like I'm going out and eating lunch and not really understanding what I'm eating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much do you spend on food?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea because that's Mike's realm of things. But I know that every single day that eat I two packets of oatmeal for breakfast because I've been eating them, can't have any with calcium in it at all. At lunch time, I have ate a -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the stones?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the stones?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To the stones? Yea. Well, at lunch I have a nutrition drink that I've been drinking for years. Not really a weight loss thing, it's more of a substituting -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The vitamin thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The vitamin thing, but it doesn't have very many calories, as many calories in it. And (crosstalk) Mircrosofts. These are not large things. [00:05:06] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Whoa, an Mircrosoft?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I've had Mircrosofts. At night, it does vary an awful a lot but that's not a big—these are—I don't—I work at an place where I can't really eat while I'm working so it's not even like I'm eating stuff during the day and not realizing it. It's kind of frustrating. </p>

<p>And so, I'm not that kind of person who can afford to just spend all my money and eat all my calories in lattes and things like that. And I really try not to get too heavy (ph) in the grocery bill thing too much because of the fact that it's the only thing financial that my husband handles. So I mean, I will cut coupons and hand them to him, but that's about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't imagine that we spend more than 100 dollars a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Yea, which is very little.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:01) for the two of you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So it's not like—I mean, I pack everything I go with and it's not—(pause) It doesn't bother me too much. I'm not feeling deprived because of that, per se. I am feeling pissed because of the fact that I'm being told by somebody else who's not living my life how I am actually fooling myself. So therefore, I must write down everything. I've done this before. Yea, so it's like, "Sure, if you want to."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it? Is it that on the steroids or with your metabolism and the steroids you can gain weight or not lose weight, even if you're not taking in very many calories? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Steroids make you very much Type II diabetic. Your blood sugar becomes a lot more, a lot higher, amongst other things like that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So you gain weight really fast. [00:07:06] It does involve, also a lot of cravings for food. Most the time, I can't do really much with it so I—The most exciting thing that around my house right now is popcorn so I'm talking like the air pop popcorn that comes out of the—not like, there's no oil or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's right there with the Mircrosofts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Yea. The Mircrosofts sure are a luxury right now because they're in season.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, sometimes I get wild and get a peanut butter and jelly. This is like, crazy stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:07:39) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I understand that there are many people who have—and this is the sort of a thing that I have had problems with over all of my life, which is that I understand that there's awful lot of clinicians who have patients who are not very self-aware. Whatever. They are like, "Oh, I'm always running a fever." Well, what "always" is, is not really this and they're really not running a fever. Or, "I'm not really eating very much but I'm not actually self-aware of all the stuff I eat all day." I understand that, but I'm not one of those people. [00:08:06] I'm kind of a control freak about most of my life. So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I don't know if I just don't hear from representative (ph) sample but, I see other people who are—they're overweight but eat healthfully or like, pay attention to what they eat and because their metabolism or something else is going on. You get a lot of shit from doctors.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I've got ten times more shit up here than I did in Cincinnati because my doctor knew me from when I was very, very young.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But there's a lot of like—there is at least what I hear—this presumption that you must not be taking care of yourself. You're probably not very (ph) responsible. You need to be more disciplined.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're really not paying close attention to this. [00:08:56] Obviously, (ph) bullshit for a lot of people. I mean, certainly that's true for some people but it's a crummy place to start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the reason why I've been drinking this nutrition drink thing is, is that when you take—well, basically it seems to keep my stomach pretty happy. When you take certain types of medications, you tend to—one of which, you don't absorb certain vitamins. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other thing is that, you tend to also get very sick to your stomach on the stuff. My husband calls it Debramil (sp?) instead of Enfamil for babies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, basically it settles me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's very easy to digest. I started—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:09:36) name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I started drinking this stuff from time to time back when I had gall bladder problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that was taken out more than a decade ago so—but I still associate that as, "I'm not feeling all that well. If I take this, it seems to keep—and I don't know if it's a placebo or not—it seems to keep things kind of on the level.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not hard to digest. It's relatively good for you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to buy it from a doctor's office. It wasn't like you can buy it at a—You still can't, but you can buy it at least online now. [00:10:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Yea, it's 90 calories. (inaudible at 00:10:07) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And it's meant to be the glycemic index of it is very low which means that you don't—actually I know what the glycemic index of the food I eat is. I'm not diabetic. My dad is diabetic and he doesn't know the glycemic food. He's borderline where they don't give you too hard of a time [when you're it] (ph) right now. But I know the glycemic food that's in the foods that I eat. That's not like someone who's not self-aware.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do it because of the fact that I know that I have to plan for at least some—I don't want to be tired, plus my husband is a little bit hypoglycemic so I sort of accidentally, along the way, I've noticed that what things make him get lightheaded. So, sort of, all the ways were picked up: so if we buy this (inaudible at 00:10:52) versus this type of rice, this is going to be better because it doesn't go through you so fast and all that kind of stuff. The first time you're dating somebody and they faint because they had too much regular cheap white rice, because it goes through you really fast. It's very, very high glycemic index. And then two hours later he faints because he's light—because he has no sugar in his blood. You pick up on like, "Oh, this stuff tastes exactly the same, it costs three times more, but he doesn't faint."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. But these are not—I mean, I'm pretty self—I'm not eating as well as I could be, but I am doing a pretty good job. All of the foods I like so much I never eat partially because I can't afford them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've always been like a—I always like red meat. I like game, I like red meat, I like stuff like that. I can't afford it. I would rather wait and go once a year and get something I really want than buy it every week something craptastic. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I like steak, I like a lot of French provincial stuff. I love a lot of game. I'm hoping to try and convince somebody at work to share—they go hunting. I cannot believe this. I've started this—I'm trying to get what—it's sort of like a food co-op, except for instead of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a game share?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a game share but instead of paying money, we would be buying his ammo? Which is really weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) Your red neck kind of freaks (ph) you out (inaudible at 00:12:23) (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that they can go out and do this and cut paying for part of the processing costs because we get a whole deer is very hard to eat, that kind of stuff. And I'm actually—because I have pernicious anemia, which is —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not very good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I'm supposed to be eating—well, I can't really digest most of it, but if I do eat it on a regular basis I'll eventually get natural B vitamins. I normally have to get them injected into me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's one of the many things my husband has to do for me is to give me B vitamins because I can't digest them anymore. That part of my body, I almost killed, so—(inaudible at 00:13:00) organs. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is—there's a part of your stomach—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the front of your intestine that's missing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The part is this area near the bottom of your stomach in your intestine that if you have parietal—they are called parietal cells. It's almost like a sub-organ that helps you absorb B vitamins. If you have certain types of this, your immune system went after that area and nearly killed it. Therefore, you can't absorb it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it passes right through you. The other thing, in terms of my thyroid is Hashimoto's (ph) were my immune system, went after my thyroid. So, I've got a million things like that. These little teeny tiny Sjogren's (ph) went after my mucus glands in my mouth and eyes. </p>

<p>But it's just really—it's frustrating because I know that I have to lose weight too. Not only I have to lose weight, I have to have probably lost weight which it means I have to go in there and get weighed and I have to lose 15 percent of my body weight before running (ph) back in again. [00:14:03] I can't say that I've lost weight and they haven't weighed me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to provably have lost weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, like can you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. We'll see. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do that (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean, I don't like the way I look, but at the same time I do feel like I'm walking- I mean, I've gained weight recently, quite a bit. And I already feel like I'm walking around with a back pack full of bricks, so I mean, yea. Do I want to go through the action of it? No. I've recently bought, as an experiment, this craptastic stuff that is—you pour into water that is—it's kind of like diet Gatorade meets Red Bull? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It's a powder that you pour in there and the idea is it's electrolytes and caffeine and a couple of other things together and it is supposed to be so that—and this is like—I can't even believe that I got talked into trying this stuff. A friend of mine a work was, "This is terrible at ten dollars a box. Let's buy it and each split half of it so we don't have to worry how bad it is."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:15:05] </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:15:06) suing this stuff but basically you pour into water, there's a lot of caffeine, there's a lot of other things in it and also the caffeine—the idea is that you're supposed to become intolerant, or at least less tolerant to pain while exercising except for etcetera. It's like a performance drink for exercise. But it's low calorie. I'm not using it for exercise. I'm using it so that I can walk home at night and stay awake. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see if it works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that anything that has 500 milligrams of caffeine in it should be interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does a cup of coffee have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 200.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. That is interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Because of the way that it is formulated, it's supposed to be like [probably available] (ph) much slower than the rest of it is, so it's supposed to be spread out as a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, again, this is the Internet which tells no lies. So, yea. [00:15:58] But I mean, people have been living for thousands of years without these kind of ridiculous supplement crap to drink. (pause) And I have actually—disturbingly enough in my life—I am almost entirely immune to caffeine. But if this is supposed to help with my low (ph) doesn't really do much for my weakness. But if it does anything for actually helping being able to work through pain, then that's great because I have to walk around a lot. I know that if I can go through this terrible, terrible period of time and lose weight, it will feel better and will store (ph) momentum. I just don't want to start it. Not because I'm lazy, because it hurts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, I see you'll be starving yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Yea. In theory, after you do that, you don't get so hungry anymore. So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't eat as much, your stomach doesn't—Your whole metabolism shifts so you don't feel as hungry anymore, in theory. We'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am actually quite disturbed that when speaking to girlfriends of mine that they have recommended some things that, just asking about weight loss, that just horrify me, that this is considered to be OK. Have you heard of something called pro-mia and pro-ana? These are web sites that help you</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pro-mia and pro-ana.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Pro-mia is the pro-purging too. I don't need that problem, I just need to think about terrible things that I throw up. So—But still, "You should get some get some—glean out the best tips from those site because that's what people do." And like, "Wow. Really? Really?" And my friends are smart. They're not necessarily—that's right—my friends are intelligent, they're not necessarily smart. [00:17:57] (pause) They—it is a—more than one of my friends have said that every so often, going on purges good for you, like your intestine and all kinds of stuff like this too. I'm like, "Really?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Purges, like throwing up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, as in like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or just like, not eating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like drinking lemonade and cayenne pepper and that kind of crap. The stuff that's been going around for years, the colon cleanses things. Again, I haven't taken biology in many, many years but it still doesn't seem like it's really all that important. It's sort of—we've evolved to be able to not have to need that kind of thing ever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know that I have to do it. I know that I don't—every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I'm horrified to find out that's me, which is always a shock. Like, literally. I walk up, "Oh my God, that's me." And that happens every time I run into myself in the mirror. So I think that it would help me feel better about myself if lost some weight. I just—I know that it's going to be difficult to do it in an easy way. I mean, I know that, like you said, that much presently, I'm taking 80 milligrams of Prednisone which is a lot. I mean, a lot, a lot. Most people, if you get a really bad case of poison ivy, you get a five milligram of Prednisone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So it is going to be almost impossible to lose weight, but at least I can see what I can do to try. So, I am considering asking my mom to try and—I need to trump (ph) down on this, see if there are any personal trainers who deal with people who have chronic illnesses? There has to be something like that. Somebody who's going to come into my house and yell at me and make me run around and things like that and—I feel terrible to say it that way but somebody who actually will also know that I need to be very careful with certain parts of my joints. So, and see if she'll help me get a couple of sessions with somebody like that. [00:20:07] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't really swim much. (inaudible at 00:20:20) that's usually the thing that easy on the joints -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But like, just the a lot of motions probably aren't good -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Swimming, actually is not too bad. When I used to swim all the time, I used to do breast stroke primarily which is actually how they got me into—one of the things I did when I had my drink replacements -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to build up the—before I even had the surgery, they had these muscles built up so that they could support the extra weight of the metal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not, actually I don't mind doing that. It's just a matter of getting into the pool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's actually one of the primary reasons why I got rid of my extremely bright red dyed hair is because I wanted to be able to swim again. And, other than the fact that it's also cost me a fortune but it, like, dyed hair and chlorine never work out. So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it actually was an intention of mine to go swimming. Back in Cincinnati, one of the pools was actually therapeutically warm too, which was really nice. And so I could actually, also it could be a very, very warm room temperature which was very, very helpful. But yea, I worked with somebody for a while in physical therapy with sweating. Just a matter of figuring out where there's a place to go and getting all the other things. </p>

<p>Being a university spouse is kind of a pain in the ass because there are a lot of things I can't do. At my school, because of the fact that everyone already knew me, even after I graduated, I could just walk up and, "Hey, I need to sign up. This is Mike. Like, call him in his lab. He's bored." And like, he's not bored, he's busy. So he said, "I'm being sad over here." And I was like, "Oh yea, Debra, don't worry. It's fine." I mean, it's a school of maybe 4,000 people, so it's like—and if you're there for a couple decade everyone gets to know you especially if you're as loud and brash as I am. So it wasn't a big deal, but here I really don't even have a clue where everything is, so I'm sort of getting that kind part more (ph) worked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But it's something that, it's definitely a good idea, the swimming thing. It also gives me an excuse. I have to—I really, really—in the event that—(pause) even though it is knowledge to some people that Sarah did  really kill herself and didn't really die of asthma, it has really made me think I really ought to get my asthma under control. Not a big deal except for when I'm swimming or doing something that is really, really cold. It's called an exercise-induced. It's really cold, when that kind of thing—I really ought to get that under —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Under control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —under control. And swimming actually does force me to do that. [00:23:06] So. One, because you have to be really conscious of your breathing and two, because then, ahead of time, I have to go and get the drugs for it, so—But, I'm hoping, but I don't—it's just—it's just one of those things where I can't cheat. I have to figure out some way to sort of sit through the misery long enough to have results. And I hate living (ph) in one of those situations where it's like, "Yep. It's going to be terrible. I'm just going to suck it up. And that's it." So—(pause) But, if it does or doesn't need to convince them to be able to help me, then great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if it helps me just feel better about myself that would be really, really great because I—(pause) I have a lot of issues with the way that I look so—(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:17) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:18) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, never really from before. It's just a—it is weird to be shocked by your own reflection in the mirror every time you see it. Not like—I mean, that makes sense if you have a black eye or if you've got like, so sort of —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Short-term.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —some sort of—some short term thing. Or, like, "Oh my God, that's me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that I'm actively (inaudible at 00:24:40) here, just here either, it's just that it startled me going, "Oh my gosh, that's me." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your mind you tend to picture yourself the way you look before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit heavier but not that much. Yea. I still think of myself in that way. And so, I—(pause) Yea. Pretty much. [00:25:06] (pause) Which is always interesting because every once in a while you run into situations, you're like, "Yep. Not 22 anymore." So—(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have problems with in that the way you look? (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just not what I think I look like. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Doesn't look like you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't look like me. I mean, my face is a lot more swollen and round than it used to be. Just things like that. I am annoyed greatly that my stomach is wider than any other part of my body. Which is not very—I mean, these are—everything, all these are very normal steroid things, the moon face, the swelling of the stomach, that kind of thing. I mean, I can pick on the fact that I don't like to have varicose veins and stuff like that but that's not like really big things. It's just, oh my God, this isn't me. It's sort of like an antibody modification thing because I wouldn't want to get plastic surgery to look different. I just want be myself. And although I don't want to age, I would be OK with just looking at myself look older, it's just very different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—(pause) It's just frustrating. So—(pause) It's also kind of weird because a lot of people who have never known you back before I used to be this way are always shocked to find out that I used to be different and, I don't know. I was mildly insulted by that. The whole thing of that, "Yea, I actually used to go out and do lots of things. I used to be very thing. And yes, I used be extremely good looking. Thank you, very much, that you don't think that anymore." It isn't as important because I have not—in the act of trying to attract a mate, per se, but still.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I know it affects (ph) you that way. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just—(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have so many things like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you, like—(pause) Where things are different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just never expected to happen so fast. I understand that things are going to change. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't expect to get -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean like, age or do you mean, once you knew you were sick, or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. I mean, just in general. I knew that I wouldn't be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, young and happy forever, but I didn't expect it was going to be so fast. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Older doesn't necessarily equate with unhappy as far as I understand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I bet like, different changes in everything: my memory, or my energy, or aches and pains, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you're not going to be 22.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. But I just never thought it would happen just so damn fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By 25, 26, I wasn't really all that especially in great shape at that point. In terms of wanting to go—I remember turning, still going out, when we did this trip with my friend back when I was 25 or 26, and one of the days, they all went out -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you still working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you working like in the (inaudible at 00:29:13) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It was the very end of things, though. Where we did this quick, five day trip and everybody went off the see the catacombs and I did not because I was just too physically tired to do anything. So I spent the morning in bed. And, I mean, that was not just the beginning but it was the point in which I realized, "Wow, I really can't even force myself to do. It's not what I like to do. It's mostly what I have to do."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't think it was going to happen so fast. (pause) And that's just kind of the way things are and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What other kind of things did you used to like to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just sort of like to go do things. [00:30:06] I liked to go out and about and sort of just see. I was just sort of a person that was very interested in lots of things. I liked to do a lot of museums, just go out. Like, "Hey, we're driving somewhere else. But hey, there's this thing along the side of the road that looks kind of interesting. Let's stop and (inaudible at 00:30:25)." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. I know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see a lot more adventurousness in personality. I was never the type of person to jump out of a plane but I was definitely the kind of person who was looking for interesting things along the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:41) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So, it's sort of a written joke that, so—I don't know if you have driven towards Florida. There's this place in South Carolina called "On the Border" and for miles, hundreds of miles they have this as you're driving down the main road—it's like 19 or something—they have this, "100 miles until "On the Border," that kind of thing. [00:31:03] I was the person who, like, "I'm an adult now." I actually have never been there but I've been swearing that if we ever go down that road we have to stop at this complete and total tourist trap. It has been around since I was a kid. Everyone was like, "Don't worry. It's not nearly as good as you think it is." It doesn't matter. I want to do the tourist trap. I like to do different things, see different things, that kind of stuff. And now I have to sort of plan not to do that kind of stuff because my energy, and my pain level, that kind of thing. (pause) </p>

<p>And I just feel like my sense of silly adventurousness is kind of gone. [00:32:03] (pause) And—I don't know, I used to like getting lost in places. As long as you don't have to be somewhere immediately, that's part of the adventure of figuring it out. I don't—I'm anti-GPS. I'm the most technological person who in the world would say that would say that they don't believe in GPS's or Facebook. But I think that the only way I'm ever going to find my way around is to get myself kind of lost and figure it out. But it's kind of who I am. But I just always liked doing that of stuff. I was never super thrill seeking adventurous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even all that much into roller coasters especially. In fact, I tend not to because I don't want—Although I think it's good for me, I get kind of scared a lot more than I probably should. So it's not that kind of thrill seeking it's more like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, it's more like exploration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, adventure seeking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:32:58) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So, and I can't really do that anymore. I miss that. [00:33:03] (pause) And it's just hard to accept those things. It is even harder to know that if I try and tell myself that I may have the chance that it could come back, that I'm just setting myself up for bitterness and disappointment. It's very easy for many people in my life, including sometimes physicians, to not try and say, "Don't write this off. There is hope." But you know what, if I do that, then I'm just going to be wildly disappointed. And—(pause) Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now impression is you've had to work very hard and sometimes still do to [live what you lost.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I occasionally have do things that I probably shouldn't, to be able to keep going. And I'm not talking like big stuff like taking prescription drugs or something I that shouldn't be or anything like that. Though I have been known to cheat the system and something that is supposed to be taken every twelve hours I may take every eight because I know that I have to stand longer. But not long term, just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —just a little bit, and that kind of stuff. And it's just—I see that it's not—I mean, yes, there—I have improved over certain points in my life but I am, overall, gone downhill. And that's really daunting, especially knowing that we move places, or that just getting even at the point of being acclimated, that kind of stuff. [00:35:03] </p>

<p>I'm still kind of—and I hate the fact that I don't normally hold a lot of regrets against myself like that long. There's a few but I'm not like the kind of person who holds long term regrets. But I'm kind of mad at myself for not doing more when I got here to get acclimated, to even find out that a fraternity brother in the area, that kind of thing. I feel really, really angry with myself but I just didn't have the energy to do it. I just showed up into town. My husband was in a "full-fledged throngs" of being exceptionally depressed. I just been hospitalized for—the only thing they could classify it as colitis but there actually was no infection. It was swelled up just like it was an infection but it was just fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long did it last for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A day or two, but the point is that they kick you out if you're well. I was sick enough that they're giving me this crazy ass stuff that if you—that actually if (inaudible at 00:36:03) you might actually hallucinate. Apparently they give you something that is related to belladonna. It's called Donnatal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Which it is a combination of belladonna, high like basically narcotic drugs, and some anticonvulsants to make everything stop. And yet you do actually hallucinate if you help (ph) yourself, if you take too much. Yea, so they sent me home for that. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things that just I was not—I was more afraid of me burning more bridges than necessarily anything bad happening. I still have this pain of regret about not doing more when I first got here. I sort of—(pause) Yea, if I can, I let people—if I'm meeting new people or doing something for new people, I sort of believe that I'm somewhat new to the area because it's easier. Even though I've been here for two years or something like that. It's just easier to be like, "So I have no idea where this Square is." [00:37:05] Well, that's a lot more forgiving. I don't say that I've only been here for a couple of months but if I let them believe that, then it's so much more forgiving than —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —two years. Yea. So and I feel guilty about that. I feel terrible about misleading people. Even though there is no reason, there's no fall back, there's no moral, and there's nothing being hurt by this. It just seems like it's wrong. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it doesn't really do a whole lot to make me feel better about getting—I hate feeling like even getting established is based upon lies. They aren't lies but to me it makes me feel really bad inside. It's just who I am. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, it must feel like another—like, catching yourself in the mirror.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:01) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is so different than -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Yea. I mean, the places I've lived I've also gone out of my way to make sure that I knew people and had people over. Even when I was out in Cincinnati, I mean, I hated Orlando. But I got to know people around me and had people over, that kind of stuff. And it really wasn't all that fulfilling but I kept going because I had to have something. That's not especially me. I will go across the street to see my neighbors because they invite us to sometimes to places, at dinner and stuff, but really more to parties, but that's about it. Not a really big, "Let's go out and do things," kind of person because I just can't. It's exhausting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, (inaudible at 00:38:51) is work, the doctors, here, (inaudible at 00:38:57) but that's about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. That's really about it and it's very, very rare that I go out. Yea. [00:39:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many hours are you working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eighteen. It used to be 12 but now it's 18 because I have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:39:13) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but I will probably be working more eventually. I just realized that I spend almost four hours a day—not quite but really closer to three—but the point is that, I spend almost as much time commuting as I do actually doing my job, which makes me want to keep them longer hours so that by doing that. But that's really, really hard on me. So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand. Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So and getting a transfer is going to be almost impossible at the moment because of this whole ridiculous hiring freeze crap. So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:39:49) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. There's some things, but yea, I'm working on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) The big thing I'm worried about that is that because I've been having up and downs, I want to make sure that I can still—I don't want to—when you're establishing yourself during certain times of (inaudible at 00:40:11)—because I've done, I still do some stuff—[00:40:13] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it does, I've got my income but I need to make sure that I don't accept anything that I can't—if put to the gun if something bad happens, I can't finish though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, but there is some of that kind of flexibility though with work (inaudible at 00:40:29) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even just that. I mean, that's not even necessarily—I mean, that's not really all that flexible right now. But the point though is that if I screw up and I have no one to work with Mircrosoft. Mircrosoft's not going to actively tell other people that I'm trying to get jobs from and that she doesn't deliver.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That's where coming at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you're only as good as the last couple of jobs you've done, so—And it does help a little bit. [00:41:02] (pause) And I—Yea. So. But—(pause) That's pretty much the large amount of stuff that I do. </p>

<p>But—even that thing said, I really do hope that it will get better, at least finances thing. I did actually—I went on LinkedIn and connected with a couple of my—well, I've connected with people I used to work with. I've asked them to- it's this new thing where they can validate your skills for certain things that you have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's cool. [00:41:57] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So I've asked for some recommendations and things like that at least. So people that don't really know what went down, they just know I work for Mircrosoft. They don't know what I do. [00:42:04] To skirt the subject of what I do for Mircrosoft, I actually put on a silly job title that isn't true. Well, not entirely not true, but yes. So, everyone knows it's a joke. No one thinks it's real. But they -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the—I'm hoping that more and more people will come out and try and that guy and that someone that says that, "She knows systems engineering really well. She knows aerospace really well. She knows CMMI. That kind of things where people that you work with that can validate your -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that would be good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because if I could just—I mean, and the thing is that there's certain things that I could potentially pick small contracts for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That stuff probably pays well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. It depends. It matters. First the pay is based upon usually its stuff that I've done before is because they're trying to get a grant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And often, it's like possibly on the probability they think they're going to get the grant less (ph) how much they've gotten themselves screwed over in terms of against the wall. It varies a lot. [00:43:10] But it's better than 25 dollars an hour I get for Mircrosoft so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. We should finish up for now and (inaudible at 00:43:24) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I will see you Tuesday. </p>

<p>END TRANSCRIPT</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I didn't used to believe my father when he would say, "Yeah Mae, we love you." And kinda dismiss me. You know what I mean? Like tell me what he thought I needed to hear. That's how I always felt it was. So when you said you'd be tolerant, that just kinda felt like what you're supposed to say. Like I needed you to say that. Or you figured if that's what you said that's what'd make me feel good. It feels very weird exploring all these feelings. Like they seem like such a small part of my every day existence. And it's so weird to just focus in on feelings about these little comments, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What just, what if, so what does it mean to focus in on them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I mean clearly they're more a part of me than I think or am aware of but I don't know what it means to focus on that. It means to feel them I guess, right? Does that mean that I'm so good at not feeling them? (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you aware of not feeling them or are you just aware of focusing on them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm so aware that I'm cautious right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, it's almost like you're an animal in the headlights and I'm the headlight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>COUSELOR: Does it feel, do you feel sort of vulnerable? 0:01:59.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Is this all about letting myself feel what I feel? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what it's about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think we're going to figure it out in six more sessions? (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:02:36.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you're not, I mean if you, we don't know what it's about yet, you know? In six more weeks, where am I going to be?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm not quite sure what those comments, what that comment...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I feel like how far have I come and what work will I have left to do when this is all over. Just out of curiosity, not out of any, I didn't mean that in a negative way. Not like, I think I guess I felt like it's uncomfortable, I guess it was a defensive comment because it's uncomfortable to feel these feelings then maybe I can wait. What's the point of digging into them now if, you know, in six weeks it's done. You know then what am I left? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to start (inaudible at 0:03:22.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but, no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be left to sorta deal with it by yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but it's, I mean is that, am I suppose to learn how to expose myself to my feelings and go in and move on and sooner or later I learn something from that? I don't, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. It doesn't quite make sense to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But I can use a lot of things from when we first started working together. And you know, I realize they're all getting somewhere somehow so. But the point is if we open them up and then I'm left with no values will I suffer the same effect? You know will I still achieve anything from being able to open up and be vulnerable to my feelings? 0:04:18.7</p>

<p>It's so weird I feel right now like just when I was saying that I kinda got it and I'm feeling like this overall of the whole therapy you know. And it just felt again like this is not, this is not meant to be negative toward you but I guess it has something to do with me and my vulnerabilities but it felt like what have we been doing for the last? It feels so to me, sometimes it seems so classic like of what therapy is supposed to be all about. Opening up and feeling your feelings. You know. And that it's just, you know it feels very contrived. Sometimes I'm just, that feeling just came up. Like I'm like, you know, it feels very textbook. (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I guess I feel like I'm like the patient, you know. And you're this, you're the teacher and the book closes and now we examine how the patient did and, you know, what we learned from the patient. You know, whatever they exhibited the behavior that typically, you know I just feel like it's such a, I feel like I'm in a little box. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's hard for you to believe that you mean more to me than just (inaudible at 0:05:47.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it doesn't just have do with you though. To me it's like a back to the big picture. The relationship that we have is within the big picture. I mean it's more, but I feel like it's all part of it. But I don't know if that means I don't believe you. 0:06:12.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have a sense of being believed. I have a feeling that we're doing a little sparring. We're not quite meeting each other, each other's..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why, ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why would you feel that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know I feel like I need to sort of defend my feelings. It doesn't make me want to really express them </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I don't want to feel like I have to prove something to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't. But you're, you're at the same time asking me to believe you.</p>

<p>I don't like this, I mean. Things were fine and smooth. Why do we have to get into this? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can we stay with it or do you feel like you want to move on to something? I want to check in with you. I want to make sure that we're not doing something that really feels like a violation to you or is too difficult. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah we can stay with it but I just feel like I'm being examined. I don't understand why it's important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it just sort of feels, I wonder if the word manipulation comes to mind for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah it does. It feels like manipulation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you often use that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I often use that word? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you brought it up before. You said it doesn't feel real, it feels like a game or manipulation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that that feeling? 0:08:20.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that's part of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I have a very strong feeling like I'm being intrusive. Like, and I don't like that feeling and I kinda, you know, don't know what to do with it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really feel that way though. I don't feel like you're being intrusive. I just feel like, like if we were just having a real conversation and you weren't looking for an answer. As two people who genuinely like each other. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what kind of answer am I looking for? I mean, do you sense that I'm looking for? </p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not looking for an answer, I am. Did I say you were looking for an answer? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I heard. That's what I thought heard. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just saying that if we, like say the camera was off and that we weren't here to learn something, you weren't here to learn about me and I wasn't here to learn about myself and you said, you know just the connection we have between each other that's developed through meeting over the last five months or whatever. And you said, "I feel kinda bad that we're not going to meet any more." I might say, "Why? Well why, are you going to miss me as a person?" I don't know. I don't know. Just why are we focusing on a..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels confusing? 0:10:24.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just doesn't feel good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like I need your help in understanding that. That it doesn't feel good. Can you tell me? Can you say it? Can you describe it a little bit more? What doesn't feel good? </p>

<p>I feel like I really want to get to know what it is you're feeling and yet I feel like, right now I feel like I am being very intrusive. And I, so it makes me not want to intrude upon you. Not want to smash away at that brick wall. But at the same time I wonder if we're not doing a disservice to you and to our relationship not to look at this kind of stuff and what it means to share your feelings with me or trust that I, you know, really want to know what your feelings are. I don't, see I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on either. But I get the feeling there's a big sign saying keep out, you know? 0:12:10.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I do want you to keep out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just got the feeling like I wanted to go home, pull the blanket over my head and go to sleep for the day. That's not just because of what's going on here, it's everything, you know? I think.</p>

<p>I don't know what's going on, I just feel totally exposed. Like my skin has been pulled off of me and I'm like I want to run and hide. 0:14:19.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. It doesn't feel comfortable. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Nuh uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think I'll see?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe I'm so wrapped up in my own thoughts I don't stop to see what other people see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. That sounds kinda harsh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I don't. I mean I don't feel like, I don't care what you think or see right now because I'm just worried about protecting myself I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you protecting yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That makes me feel so bad.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. It feels like such a game, I feel like I'm on stage. It just feels kinda surreal. Like I just had a feeling that we totally dissected and now it's the focus of everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That doesn't sound like it would feel good] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just weird. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you feel like a specimen</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny though because all I think of is, "So if I am the specimen when the specimen is judged what does everybody think of it?" You know. 0:16:21.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that a question? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's kinda like if I were to think, ok now if this were a tape that was going to go back and be played in a class full of hundreds of people, would the people watching think now here's a very smart sensitive woman who is in touch, you know like, all of a sudden it mattered to me what everybody who'd being seeing me feel this way would think. It's ok if I look at good things about it, you know? Kinda like my ego. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. And there's always this sort of, this audience and this panel of judges watching you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's ok if they're judging me if they think good things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But that's (inaudible at 0:17:21.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) But I think it, I mean I'm not, well I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you just say? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it, I mean consciously it doesn't want to [top peg] (ph) I mean I feel hard feeling here, I don't you know, I don't feel like I'm putting on an act at all. It's just that when I get this sudden awareness that I'm being watched and examined then those other feelings come up. Wondering what the judgments would be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I feel like everybody's judging me lately. Like when I come in here with you and you know it's your job to judge, not judge but... 0:18:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you mean judge. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah maybe. And I have, we have this new boss at work so. Now we'll all be under a microscope. And I'm sure I can perform so I mean, I'm not, but I don't like it. I don't like someone watching over me and what I'm doing to see if I'm doing it well. Giving me limitations and telling me, "Here this your deadline and this is.." And then Cole always judges me. And that's all it feels like a lot of pressure right now. Like I'm different from everybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could just make, when it makes me sad or when I try to sort of understand what your feelings are, I end up going like this, push your way through like an intruder like I'm trying to hurt you or doubt you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But with you that's kinda like the outside. I don't really feel that way about you [in your office.] (ph) I mean I like I feel like you're a caring warm person, you know. That's your role, you know. That's what your role is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's my role? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Your role is to be the intruder or whatever. You as a therapist. But you as a person I don't feel like you are an intrusive person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I, you know, that makes me feel a little better that you can recognize that I'm a caring person but nonetheless, you're talking to me here. I wonder if it might not happen elsewhere to that, you know, you do feel so vulnerable when people want to get to know you because you don't want your feelings hurt. 0:20:37.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel like in general I have a problem talking about my feelings or exposing them, but who knows? Maybe the things that I do talk about are not what's really going on, you know? Maybe the things that I'm so willing to talk about are just symptoms of what the real problems are. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that feel like I'm critical, what I just said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't feel like, to me, it didn't feel like what I think everybody else sees me to be. Or how I think I act outside of this room. I don't think, I don't think I shut myself off and feel vulnerable in general. I don't think I do. I might. But I think, you know if I look at my actions with other people I think I'm very open and friendly and forthcoming. And so it doesn't seem like, when you said that about me, that seems like me in here but it doesn't seem like me anyplace else. It doesn't seem like me in general. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of what you're feeling now? 0:22:21.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I felt, I started to feel stronger I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stronger. Can you tell me about that? Where that strength is coming from? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I mean can I tell you what I think you think? (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I stop you? (chuckles) I'd love to hear any [of the thoughts you have] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was just saying that, that now I'm starting to look at it, now I'm looking at oh well, all that's just a cover up of who I really am. It's [the rule of life] (ph) on the outside. I don't know though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What rule?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's from my feelings in here are vulnerable but my feelings to the rest of the world aren't, you know? Then it feels like, ok what am I hiding on an everyday basis? But how I behave everyday outside of here feels a lot more real to me than how I feel in here, you know? But I realize that these must be my deeper feelings but I'm not going to feel them and experience them everyday with everybody. So I think it's hard to compare how I am with other people and how I am with you. Because not everybody out there's going to dissect me. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe there are other people out there that want to get to know those feelings that you don't show everyday. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why? Why would people want to see my vulnerability? 0:24:24.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your question? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think that people would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they don't even know they exist so, why would they, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's funny because the closest I can think of to feeling the way I feel in here sometimes, to be put on a spot, would be at times I feel that way with Cole. Because he obviously touches the wrong things that are uncomfortable to me. But he, he isn't sensitive like you are about it. He is like a wild driver. And he is like, "Talk to me. Once in a while, if you talk." You know like so when my defense mechanisms go up he starts bashing them. Like saying "You don't talk." You know that I'm just, I'm taking the space I need I guess to project myself. He just doesn't respect that. Whereas you do. So I can't, you know, and in any other instance you would. I don't know I guess I just need people to be super, super sensitive to my feelings and then I guess I feel safe expressing them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the space is important that other people sort of understand and accept your feelings before it feels ok to express them. Is that right? 0:26:31.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it feels, I don't know if that is so true but it's a lot more comfortable and safe feeling if people understand or want to hear and want to be supportive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I just want to just stop for a second. I have a feeling that we're in something, some kind of negotiation process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just where I'm saying something and then it's important that you sort of.. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Paraphrase? (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of correct me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, like you know, it's like you have to, you want to keep some control over it. You know, "If we're going to talk about my feelings let me, let me get, let me make it straight here. I want to make sure it's good and accurate." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you..?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not aware of doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) So now I feel like a real manipulator.(chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you laugh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You just made me feel like no matter what you say I'm going to make sure, I don't know, make sure I'm telling you my feelings and not you telling me my feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what's wrong with that? They're your feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I just was curious about that process. You know if we're really going into this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I know myself better than anybody else. I could be completely wrong. But I think I know myself really well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's a defense mechanism I have because, you know, Cole's always trying to tell me I don't feel what I feel. So maybe I'm, you know in here, I'm like, "This is how I feel. I'm putting my foot down and you can't tell me otherwise." Because Cole's constantly trying to tell me that I don't feel that way or I shouldn't feel that way or I can't feel, you know? 0:28:27.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. And what does that feel like when he kinda tells you what you're feeling? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It pisses me off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why? He does it. Everybody, he does it to his sisters and he does it to (inaudible at 0:28:44.0) No one can tell you how you're feeling. You know how you're feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And regardless of whether someone agrees with it or not, you're entitled to your opinion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is kind of a sensitive point, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was just thinking. This time I like, my old boyfriend Tim trying to tell me. I was just thinking when people say "You don't feel that or that's not," you know. And I just feel like saying, "Who the fuck are you to tell me what, you know, I'm getting mad about." It's like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have this whole, another whole big fight with Cole this week. God, it's just like continuous, but. I guess I have all this anger towards him that's all pent up and it comes out at inappropriate times. We were at an awards dinner for his company. Top twenty (inaudible at 0:30:09.0) dinner and I drank too much and I hadn't eaten. And I started getting insecure. And he was off talking to people and I thought he was gone for a really long time. And I was like, "Where is he?" you know when I was talking to someone. But then I looked around and I saw him dancing on the dance floor and I got, oh I blew up. I got really pissed because I felt like, I mean it's not what happened...</p>

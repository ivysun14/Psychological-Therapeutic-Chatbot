<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're here for the first time since February?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that means about three months have gone by.  Um, where are we at with uh, with how you're doing since then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well remember we changed my Effexor um, to the tablets —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To the generic kind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hoping to save you a little money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They um, still to this date don't have it, they said the manufacturer, I've got a couple of different stories.  The manufacturer is either um, hasn't, I've heard they haven't made it yet, but the prescription was for um, early, earlier, I mean its being advertised or whatever.  But I guess they, they haven't got it yet, the pharmacies.  I heard that and then another pharmacist had told me that they're out of stock of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've asked them just as recently as —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This, this week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no that was the first two months, the, so this previous month I haven't asked.  But the, um, the first months after my first appointment I tried getting it; because the XR obviously, you know, I didn't want to be doing that.  So, um, finally it, the last uh, pharmacist that I talked to said that I'm, they recommend that I have you call in a different prescription until this one is actually distributed I guess.  No pharmacist —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, I've had people get the stuff and take the stuff so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's out there somewhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I don't know why —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See that's what I figured.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So people that you've asked can't get it or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what I thought too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If they're, if they're willing to order it why they couldn't get in at least in a couple of days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They said "they try" but the first time they said it would two or three weeks I would have to wait and I said, "Um, are all the pharmacies like this?"  And they said, "Yes and that this is, this hasn't come out yet."  And I said "I don't understand why you would have written that prescription then for me" —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I definitely —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I figured —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Had people —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not only have I definitely had people get the generic, venlafaxine —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have also had some insurance plans, you know, how they don't always want to cover the expensive brand name —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've written prescriptions for some of my patients for Effexor; because they've always been on Effexor —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all the sudden their insurance company calls me up and says, "We don't cover Effexor anymore can you switch him to the generic kind —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's cheaper for us."  So I've —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even the tablets?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've even had that happen.  So, I, I'm confused —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I, I'll see if I can help you with that in anyway —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they, they do have uh, a representative of this generic company that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Comes out and I, I have some samples —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of, of the tabs —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I can also ask them to check why their product isn't being —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stocked everywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I um, I gave them my prescription; which I'm assuming had the three months of refills on it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It would've if they —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right well, they did actually tell me they would keep it for me until they got it in and then you know found out that I, they told me to just take a different medication completely because I couldn't get that medication.  Anyways I think they um, once again, I was told different uh, stories but um, one person said that the prescription had been like canceled or something because it had been —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They may have canceled that when we switched it to the regular —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or what —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They may have canceled the other one —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's possible too —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So anyways I don't have a prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've never taken a single day on, on this other kind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope and so I'm still having the same problem as before because I'm still on the regular Effexor um, I, uh, I find that just like before it seems a little bit worse.  I um, I feel like I wake up um, I don't know how, how else to explain it but almost like uh, not drunk.  But like, you know, if you take um, Nyquil or something you don't sleep enough, like you just, I can't focus on one thing, I just I don't have trouble driving for example out, you know.  But I just um, I don't feel normal put it that way and then in the evenings um, I tend to well I, I get headaches and I am assuming it's from same thing as before, it's wearing off or something.  That's why we were going to try the tablets, I don't know.  Um, but it takes me a while to um, not feel uh, I don't know, what's the correct words to use, [LAUGHING], explain like to feel my normal it takes me a while to get to that point.  Maybe like I don't half hour, hour uh, after I take the Effexor in the morning.  Um, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that possibly related to the fact that, I assume you're taking your Adderall in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Adderall is kicking in at some point —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's a lack of focus prior to that or, or is it feeling like something different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, not a lack of focus.  I feel, I literally um, the only thing I can even compare it to is if you're drinking alcohol and you can't like focus your eyes on like one object for example, you know what I'm trying explain?  Kind of like your, that's the only thing I can explain.  So not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we call that a stigmas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Back and forth of the eyes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, you know, it's and I, I if I'm standing um, I feel um, like I don't have, I don't have good balance actually not like I feel that way but I don't.  I mean I've never fallen but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you always had that with Effexor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I thought that was something that we had in trying some other things along the way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've, I've had this with other things um, and at that point you've either increased me dose or added something else on the side of whatever I was taking.  But, um, I, I didn't use to have this when I first started taking Effexor years ago but I was also on a higher dose, I don't know if that had something to do with it or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many of the Effexor are you taking each day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking two.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and the, I don't know if the Adderall has something to do with it.  Like you said or not but that was the other thing I wanted to talk to you about to.  Um, I still don't feel like it's working as well as it has been in the past, I don't know how many years I've been on it, five or six or, or I don't know how long.  But, um, at some, at a couple uh, appointments ago you mentioned that you could increase it and I said, "Let's try not too."  And, and I think at that point that's when we tried the um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You tried the Vyvanse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah the Vyvanse which didn't work.  But, um, I didn't know if that was still a consideration or not or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, technically 60 mg of Adderall is the highest that we like to go —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, that's where you're at —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There are a few people that take a higher dose —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Than that it's not out of the question its —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just that we try to uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go by guidelines —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why, why is that because of blood pressure and just all that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, the risks versus the benefits —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you look at the big picture and all the studies and all the people [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What are the risks besides uh, heart?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Palpitations and high blood pressure and insomnia and anxiety —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um motor ticks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's, like what are they like, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right like twitchy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  I never notice myself with that but um, when it comes to the sleeping that was another thing I wanted to uh, mention, um, why I thought the Adderall wasn't working as well and the Effexor, and or the Effexor.  Um, even with the Adderall the Effexor and coffee I um, have no problems sleeping what so ever.  I'm able to not let myself take a nap because I try not to, [LAUGHING], but if I let myself I, I could easily fall asleep, um, and a huge difference with me is my appetite.  It is just um, I've kind of reverted back to the ways I've, I used to be.  Um, I don't, my appetites huge Adderall used to curb it sometimes, you know, especially when I first started taking it, not at all and I've felt that was um, that was a huge for me to notice that and it's, I mean, it's not, it brings up other, it, that's, I don't know, kind of stresses me out a little bit; because I've always, I've had a history with, you know, uh, eating patterns.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you doing school or anything these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Um, I need to and want to but I just don't feel very capable of it right now still.  Um, but that's definitely my main, one of my main, yeah my main priority is you know, priority [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're paying for your, your own pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I, I'd be willing to go up another 15 mg, which is half of an Adderall to try to give you a little more boost.  I mean at some point we're doing as much as we can do —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And danger start to become —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More of a problem than the benefits.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I think we could try to give you a few extra pills on the Adderall so you could take an extra half, which I'd probably just take right in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless you want to slip another separate dose in but you're already doing doses throughout the day —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah okay.  So, you're saying first thing in the morning take 30 mg —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take like —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right take the whole —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In stead of a half of a  pill and then what I want to do with, with the Effexor is have you still take it twice a day.  I'm going to still try to get you the cheaper —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like to get once a day but two pills, oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's what I want you to try doing —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is uh, breakfast and the dinner —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To try to uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, get through the day better instead of all at once.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just on account of what you're going through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of people take it all at once.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But based on what you're saying I'm, I'm thinking spreading it out might be a better thing to do right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, you don't think thought that like I'll have problems with it.  I know it's, you know, extended release but will I feel like I'm not getting enough then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Only taking —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The level in your system is still going to be the level —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm, I'm just thinking there will be less fluctuations throughout the day —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In your case —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Well, um, could we try the tablets still though or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, sure we're, we're going to try —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm going try to find out why —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certain pharmacies are saying they can't get it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've only —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The other ones seem that they can get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't try any other pharmacies besides Giant Eagle because Giant Eagle told me that nobody has it and I go to Giant Eagle because I get the uh, fuel for which helps a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't believe that just because I know other people get it and if they're getting it from some wholesale warehouse somewhere —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All they have to do is call the warehouse and get it delivered if they don't have it today they can get it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I figured.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whenever tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I've didn't want to be rude and question them but I fussed at, you, I mean I know you know, you wouldn't write me a prescription when it's not out, I knew that, you know, so I thought that they were wrong but then they got, you know, kind of uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm thinking some day in the near future they're going to have a lot of people coming there looking for this cheaper generic —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Version so it's not like they're just doing it for you.  It's going to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Come down for more and more people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They, I mean, they mentioned that they would order it so I don't think that was the problem.  I don't know, I don't know maybe it's miss communication or something.  But I, I try a bunch, I went there a bunch of times for the first two months.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd say try them again —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you run in to trouble try someone down the street and see —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If, what they say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I definitely will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you still have trouble down the street, give me a call —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll put the representative from the company who's promoting this stuff —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To uh, check what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.  Um, you also said last appointment that at some point um, the regular Effexor, not the generic brand, um, was going to come out with that card for people that don't have insurance or something like that for —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, the Pristiq has the card, I don't think the regular Effexor —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, okay never mind [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I don't think they're even promoting it anymore since they've moved on to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A new —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Antidepressant alternative —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So at least to my knowledge there's not a card for any kind of Effexor right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Except for this generic one —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is being promoted and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You gave me some —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I gave you a card.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I, I also, I gave them that card.  Um, or it was like uh, a little form about the size of the prescription um that you use each month and so they had that with my prescription which I don't any longer have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can give you that again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think that's good for uh, several, several months.  You can use it everytime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Assuming that you never use it the first time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, in that case then I still have uh, I think I have two of them from because you gave me three for the, you, of the three months they come in at a time.  Let's see.  Yeah, I have two left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and just because it's all new and I'm figuring how it works.  I'll give you a third one just —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just in case they make you have a separate one each time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what kind of uh, pills do you still have left?  Are you out of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Effexor that you've been taking or do you still have a few left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm very close to being out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, you're going to be out soon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think uh, I've uh, four days left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so I'm going to give you a prescription for three months on your Effexor.  We're going to try breakfast and dinner to start it out —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Instead of two all at once and then I'm going to give you for the Adderall an extra half a pill.  So, you'll be taking a whole one and then three halves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me just go see, if you'll excuse me for just a second, if —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have another one of those coupons and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll get it for you.  Okay so here's another —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One of these.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll put the sticker on the prescription —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think one should just last for several months.  But you've got three separate ones just in case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think that will save you $35.00 off your prescription —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Each time.  Plus it's probably $10.00 or $20.00 cheaper than Effexor in the first place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, great that's awesome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so there's your prescription.  We'll try again on the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The generic and I would actually try to check it out before four days is up when you're out of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was going to do that today actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Medication and then I'm going to give you three prescriptions here for the Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just give me a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a question though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, there's extended release tablets and then extended release capsules or what —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is the brand name, the, the ones you've always had Effexor are capsules —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the brand name that's more expensive.  The generic is this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It only comes in tablets?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In tablet.  So, if you get a tablet it's, it's the generic —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The cheaper kind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Now my um, I don't know if I just didn't understand you or if I'm not saying it correctly but I thought that we were trying to um, do like the non XR form of either Effexor or the generic.  Remember when I was uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We can but that'll ware off even faster and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Leave you worse off in the morning.  That's that the problem is and I don't think the cost is going to be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Any different?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really different one way or the other once you have the coupons.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well um, my only reasoning for that was um, I'd say about, like two years ago.  I was on that, the non XR and the Add, Adderall and that's when I felt I had the best results.  I don't know, that's the way I felt uh, that's what I meant I guess that's what I was trying to say.  For some reason I thought the tablets were the non XR, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tablets are the old —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Long time release yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can still get them and we can always go back and try that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now tablets are the generic time release also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There, there's two different things that we can be talking about —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  That's why, you know, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah that's still on the table as something we can always go back and try again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  That was when I was um, enjoying school and doing well in it and able to do what I need to do and that's my main goal right now.  Is to get everything rolling in that direction and I, I guess I just uh, figured to go back to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see what we can do with spreading it out —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And with giving you the extra little dose on the Adderall in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay and should I, when should I be able to uh, feel a difference with out, you know, the headaches and stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you want to give it probably a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're still using a lot of caffeine it sounds like too huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I, otherwise I'm just so tired, I'm just drained and I've added um, even I'm taking vitamins everyday and I add other supplement everything that's good for me.  I changed the way I eat, I'm trying to eat as healthy as I can and avoid, you know, certain things that I know might give me headaches or but I just there's nothing else I can seem to do, [LAUGHING], and I'm not working out per say but I am being active I guess.  Um, and that doesn't help either.  I don't go for like a run but I play with my dog throughout the whole night practically, [LAUGHING].  I have to otherwise he's crazy, to energetic so I just don't know, you know, what else to do.  The only thing I um, I know I need to do is uh, start regular therapy again; because I think that has a lot to do with it I'm sure to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah if you're able I think that's uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very important piece —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know moneys always a concern with you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no insurance.  Now I've been giving you 60 but these are for 75 pills on the Adderall so you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get 15 extra pills, that's a half a pill each day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so I'll put you down tentatively for a three month follow—up —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we'll see how we —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you make any progress with this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you have any concerns at all or if they still tell you they can't find it.  Let me know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll see if there is anything I can do —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To help you with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, I read recently an article, uh, talking about how generic uh, medications can actually affect the way the person reacts to it as opposed to the, I don't know, the real one.  Um, but I thought that there like the exact same thing.  It just, they don't have the, you know, the Effexor name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not the exact same but they're close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Practically —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There within —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certain parameters of the government —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I though so it should have any difference right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the most part they're the same from, for certain people there sometimes small differences —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But it could work in their benefit —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To they're benefit right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could work the other way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I've even seen patients were they take two different generics because maybe two different generic companies make the same pill and one works and one doesn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it may be the fillers or it may be the release mechanism or it maybe something other than what's being released —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That different for a given person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see okay; because that was —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it can work either way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I read that I was thinking well maybe that's why um, my medication that I'm on now.  Everything is working different for me as apposed to years ago when I was on the exact same combination of medication and it was working for me then, you know, what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a possibility to some degree —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But unlikely, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and your life is different now and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your stressors are different and your bodies changed —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're that much older and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Different chemistries inside can change over the years —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There, there's a lot of variables —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But for the most part the generics ought to be within —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The small parameter of what the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I figured.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Brand names are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if anything doesn't feel right you let me know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will, I always do, [LAUGHING], thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  So, I think we're all set if you want to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell [NAME OTHER] to put us down in about three months —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll take it from there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well you have a good evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.  You too.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, so what's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, as I said, it's just, it just holidays are coming so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it stirs up a lot of emotions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you have -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, I think I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have red and green on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, and I did that on purpose, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, for the holidays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm thinking that way.  Uh, I think that the, the medications are probably helping me get through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I wonder what I'd do with all of the emotions that are stirred up and things I can't control with other people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And things I do to make other people happy and in the process making myself not so happy.  [NAME OTHER]'s looking forward to Christmas.  I, I asked [NAME OTHER] what are you going to do about the holiday and he said, well we're going to have dinner here, which means, that's code for everybody's coming and you're going to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who's everybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do all the cleaning.  My brother, his girlfriend, possibly her brother -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but them you like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My brother?  No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No my brother's the nasty one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And his brother is the one that used to stay with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His, yes, [NAME OTHER]'s brother used to stay with us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's the one who's living in [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  And [NAME OTHER]'s sister comes with her husband.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's going to come from [DEIDENTIFIED] for, for Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no [NAME OTHER]'s sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but the brother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he, he doesn't really go very far.  So, I guess I feel, I feel kind of resentful about this going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if it's mostly his family -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's kind of half and half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the split -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, so then couldn't he do half the cleaning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He has the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See his concept of cleaning is doing vacuuming the day before whereas I do the whole, I take the drapes down, I wash them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I put them back up, I, I vacuum under the couch, into the cushions, um, I take, I do the ironing, things that have to be ironed, so it's like a full presentation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus I think that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like the queen is coming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The drapes, that's impressive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know Christmas is about Jesus so if, if you think that you're preparing for Him, then it's the same idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's, you know I'm trying to get into a forgiveness frame of mind which is what it should be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It should reign cheer and good will toward men.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I just wish it was reciprocated sometimes and it's, and there, and it never is, it's always at our house which, which is hard for me because I'm tired with the Lyme Disease and the, uh, colon infection and, um, the medications make me feel even worse sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that's kind of what's going on.  Um, [NAME OTHER] is, um, keeping a low profile, I don't know what he discussed with you, but, um, I know, he sees, he sees friends from time to time, but he's not really doing anything much.  I guess with his new court date is in January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think that that's holding up any real progress?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, like a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some kind of hold.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] puts his life on hold.  He puts our lives on hold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, it's been, it's been a tiring process because every month you say, this is the month, so he doesn't have to look for a job and, um, we don't know the consequences of this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Court date and that, that might interfere with a job.  So, it's like well let's wait until the court date -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then it's another month and another month and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because usually, uh, your husband comes in at the end for, you know, the litany or whatever and, and, uh, couple times ago, and I discussed this with you, he's very emphatic, he didn't want to consider school, but subsequently we encouraged him about jobs and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's very particular and I couldn't possible do this because of that, you know, I said, boy you could, you know, do some temporary, you know, Christmas kind of job and then if it was something great, you know, they like you, things like that whatever -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He has very low confidence and he is upset about his hair and he starting to comes to terms about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's, he's thinning out faster now.  He hardly takes his hat off when he comes in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, he do, actually -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He did -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know what his hair, I mean, look who you're talking to, but his hair is not so bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but, I mean he's only [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I understand that but you know I started when I was [AGE], and I was miserable -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I, I definitely know, definitely know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, but you know what, this is the, the problem.  I was, I was miserable about it before I needed to be.  In other words, it wasn't so bad -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I was miserable.  I should have not been miserable the first couple of years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, but you know I've gone to websites and uh, done research and, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just gotten into the minds of how some of these people think about it and they are truly devastated by it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, yeah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And see how it's something that people see and something that people don't see, you can, you know, fix it, underneath so they don't, but this is something that everybody sees and he's been talking about it more and he says I'm getting older and I'm trying to come to terms with it and, um, you know, maybe people will be shocked if I shaved my head, but then this, that's the in thing anyway, guys, guys who have full heads of hair are shaving it off so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He, he is nowhere near, you know what I mean, that's an overreaction, like he's not, he's not that thin.  First of all, yes, you know, the cool rock stars have a lot of hair and you know it, it's very devastating especially if you have a fledgling self esteem to begin with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh-huh, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's true.  But, um, were all the dermatological options explored like Propecia, Minoxidil -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He has been taking, yes, and he just decided it, it was too, too much to do it every day so he stopped doing it and that was for his own benefit.  Uh, he went for a physical to his main doctor 2 days ago and, I said did you take your hat off when you went in?  He said yes.  Now, the doctor didn't have anything to say about it and [NAME OTHER] didn't bring it up.  I, I would think that he would if it was such an issue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  The doctor wouldn't raise it unless he did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, Propecia, you know, it's another variable, could, could affect, you know, uh, emotions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's possible, not necessarily, but possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it interacts, you know, with, it, uh, prevents the effects of, uh, testosterone or something like that, I'm not, I'd have to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Look it up to remind myself how it works, but it's possible -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if it didn't, it didn't have any adverse affects, you know, it was working, you know that would be great, if you go from front to back, I don't think Minoxidil will work.  I think, Minoxidil works well for those people with the monk scar.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, so, but, you know, there are these, I have a man in his late 30s, you know, whose, I, it didn't occur to me because it looked like he had a typical hair pattern for someone of that age -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he's very concerned about that and he sees this very sophisticated dermatologist who tries all this different, you know, so he's on a high dose this, and high dose that so if someone's motivated -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he has to have good insurance coverage -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's options.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it seems to be if something worked, I would have been happy to rub it on my head or take a pill all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We told him we'd be willing to uh, have him, get a transplant.  We're willing to go that far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that, that's, again, that's way down the line.  I mean first of all -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I imagine they're better than it used to be, but it's still -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, they're, they're making new strides in it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah because they use to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everyday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just look terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've done research on it, this doctor who has corrected some horrible mistakes that were made by -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other surgeons and, uh, he uses hair from, um, mustache hair, um, beard, the chest, that's if, if you don't have anything substantial here and he did that to correct some very bad mistakes and this guy's hair looks great now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  Because the early ones like Joe Biden -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, well those were plugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, now it's not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're better now I take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what [NAME OTHER]'s thinking about and he saw an actual transplant where they did cut the scalp -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And sew it, and it, and it was pretty gruesome, but they have other techniques, they don't have to take such a large -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's sounding much -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's beyond me, I mean, that's something further down, but if there's something preventative to keep his hair, that'll be the most attractive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If he's willing to do it.  Well, that's, that's, that's the thing, you have to be willing to take a pill every day, you have to be willing to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the big deal?  He's taking pills from me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.  Um, well, right now, he doesn't have anyone prescribing him, um, Minoxidil, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] and the doctors there gave him prescriptions for, uh, Minoxidil, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a hair specialist place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or for Propecia.  Um, yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He had Propecia and did he try it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's, he had been using it since he was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Propecia?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then stopped because?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, because we couldn't get prescriptions for it, I was getting it through a Canadian company, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you could have seen a local dermatologist or maybe through primary doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he has to be the one to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I can't, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I would say keeping it is the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't go in for him, you know, anymore, I used to be able to, now it's, it's up to him to talk to the doctor honestly about what he wants to do and he's deciding not to do anything at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More than anything -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For, for a man, if you're young and single, it sucks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, once you're a little older and there are other people that you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That are having the same problem -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you're married, it seems to be less burdensome, but for a young, single guy, very young guy, it's terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.  I know it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We've been going through this with him since he's [AGE] so, um, anyway, he's had to come to terms with it and he says yeah, I know that, um, you, mom and you dad, you, you've tried very hard to make me feel better about this and do whatever you could to help me and I really appreciate that, he says, and it's like he's coming to terms with it himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he says, I'm, I'm thinking about what kind of haircut I want to get the next time, maybe I'll just get a real short crew cut or cut and shave the hair off to see what it looks like and, you know, if you want to do it, just do it, you know.  Um, so he's working on that, but he's, he's still very isolated.  See, this one person who keeps calling him and she, she keeps after him to do the right thing for himself and I really appreciate that, she's a little bit older, she's married, she lives with the family of his best friend, they're like a whole, whole group there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is one of these cousin's wife or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So they're, she just keeps after him to, to work on himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told her, she's really good for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very nice person and I was kind of praying that someone could come into his life who wasn't really connected to us but, but could have an impact on him, some kind of mentor or, um, you know a motivator, so, I, she seems, she's, she's not giving up on him and I, and I talk to her a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old a person is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's interesting is he encouraged her to finish high school, she didn't want -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To and he, he told her why don't you want to finish, you want to be ignorant.  She says I'm not ignorant, he said well then finish high school and she did.  She, she's going to be done in March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So [LAUGHING] he gives advice out to other people that he should be using himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thinking, thinking that for himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's still looking forward to the holiday.  Um, so you know how I feel, [LAUGHING], how I feel about that, I know.  Um, I'm just really fatigued today from cleaning and running around.  And you know, I, I, I think the medications could help you cope a little bit better but they're not going to take away the feelings of desperation, resentment, uh, sadness over what other people do or don't do.  You can't make people be a certain way.  I've come to terms with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So [COUGHING], so are you saying that you feel that you're doing about as well as you might be doing under the circumstances?  Or are you saying that we still could do better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, with the meds, or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, like the meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My other problems?  Hm.  No, I think I'm doing okay with the meds with the combination that we have, um, I get a lot of relief from the evening meds and, um, the Clonazepam, um, helps me, I think both with the anxiety and physical tension.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The, um, I'm not sure if the, Luvox, I mean we could take it off to see if -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have we done that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take one lower, oh, let's see -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have we done the 75?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was taking all but one pill, but I can't remember -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, let's see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See if you had a few pills that I could split with some of my family and change their attitudes that would help [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, the, oh, no, no, here we go.  You're on, you were on 75 of that.  When you first went to it, we marched right up to 75, and then we went to 100 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then there was some kind of reaction, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you reported, and this is in May of '07.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Feeling more depressed -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On the 100.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now we don't, it's unusual that we took that at face value.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, also -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But we, we, but we could try the 75 again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean 100 maybe too much, 75 might be better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You usually feel more depressed, but you can never say never.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If that was May, there's really not much going on in May, it's not like a lot of family stuff interaction -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that would cause family type -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, and the Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're showing me everything you have here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, where's it say refills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Should say it right down there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Refills, no refills, I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In that spot, right there.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I've been, I've been using that a little bit more because, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just to up my energy level a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how much of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I take, actually, uh, uh, I'm taking one, this is the generic and I'm not sure, they have 2, 2 different generics in there and I'm not sure if they're just not working as well as the, um, the brand name -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's entirely possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  But I can, I can get through a whole day pretty successfully, energy wise, with this, and keeping calm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Ambien you take how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been taking 0.5 to 1 in the evening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so on that you have a refill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have 1 refill on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On the Clonazepam you have no refills.  You have quite a bit, but you use how much of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I take 1 in the evening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Rarely in the daytime if I'm, if I'm feeling badly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not when you probably [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I'll be hooked on this one not be using the, this for my energy level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, you know what, I'd like to just give you everything -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we can never make them time out at the same time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, let me give you everything.  Okay.  So, you want to try to go to 1.5 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think why not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

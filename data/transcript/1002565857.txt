<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Again, blind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, sometimes I don't know who I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so just to get us on track here before you get back into the story.  I saw you [DATE], your mood remains good, not sad, anxious, or irritable, appetite okay, sleep okay, energy okay, some pain exercising, joint pain, knee, low back pain, neck pain, self esteem good, working a lot, concentration good, not suicidal.  And we maintained, we pulled back on the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I've changed back to the 450.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You went back up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just as a safety net type of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What has happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we were getting toward graduation for [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We get a hysterical phone call before graduation.  She got a grade that prevented her from getting her degree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she didn't attend classes in a course.  Now this is, you know, this is the second time this has happened in her four years because she took an archeology course and decided not to go to class and failed it.  That cost me $20,000 in financial aid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This time she had, so this time I had to rush, personally go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] and enroll her in a class right after graduation which was another $4,500.  Um, so, you know, we swore to secrecy, [NAME OTHER] and I, I think we handled it very well, that nobody, not even [NAME OTHER] would know about this.  That she would, you know, she would graduate but not graduate.  And, you know, so the, so we, the Thursday before Sunday's graduation we drive to [DEIDENTIFIED] because [NAME OTHER] had his last final Friday, you know, get there in time for dinner, spend the afternoon waiting for him to finish his final, and we moved him out of his dorm at 6:00 at night.  Drove home in six hours of the most, the worst pouring rain I've ever driven in.  The next day, the next morning we went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Drove?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Drove.  And honestly it didn't feel like a graduation [INAUDIBLE], you know, we were rushing everywhere for what I don't know, uh, and the rushing continued because I had to get her moved out Monday morning after graduation Sunday to get her to her 3:30 class at [DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean, can you believe the time constraint that we were under?  And we got her there.  But it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she has to take the class for how long?  I mean, how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the class, so here's the next catch.  The class ends two weeks from yesterday or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's a short, boom, boom, boom—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's about, you know, like a spring, the first summer course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But a week from Sunday she's going to Israel with [NAME OTHER] on birthright.  So she's going to miss the last three classes.  I said, [NAME OTHER], you have to go to that teacher the first day and if she tells you that you can't pass the course because you're not going to be there the last week, you drop the course and you're going to take it another time.  I don't care what you say, you just can't, no more risk taking in this family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And bad judgment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More than bad judgment.  I mean, how in the hell could she have the nerve to cut classes in the last term of her senior year after that charade she pulled at her sophomore year when, I mean, I had to go to the dean of the arts and science school.  I had to talk to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, you know, and then, you know, all kinds of things were going wrong.  And I'm, you know, and I'm not making money right now, you know, and my mother's birthday had just passed and all kinds of stuff, and so I just started to melt down.  I just, you know, I mean, things just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After you got onto the course?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After, yeah, I guess it was, you know, either that week or the following week or something.  I can't even remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it was about a week or two ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, let's, let's say—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's say early June.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  She started the course on the [DATE] and I guess, yeah, by early June I was, you know, I was just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was around Memorial Day I think.  I still feel at least a couple of weeks ago.  Because you weren't coming in for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right, it was about two weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About two weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was probably—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So right after you crashed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and I didn't handle it well.  I mean, I was slamming doors, and, you know, and stuff.  I worked—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was feeling terrible.  I felt like, you know, things were really crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the phone you talked mostly about the money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, that has a lot to do with it because I'm under a lot of, you know, it puts me under a lot of pressure.  I'm getting so tired of living in [DEIDENTIFIED] the way things are going.  I mean, I just don't know how much longer I want to stay here because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where would you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could go to Florida.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I've got a website coming up for my restaurant consulting, it'll be up in about another week.  I guess I could do that anyplace, except obviously I would do it better here than anyone else because I know the turf.  So we'll see what happens.  I mean, I've been doing a lot of things.  [NAME OTHER] was so upset with me with my mood and everything that she came in one day and she said I can't deal with it anymore.  She said, maybe I can move out.  Maybe you have to move out, something.  Somehow or other I worked, we worked through it.  You know, I was very apologetic.  I said you're right, you know, I don't really know what happened even, you know, but you're right.  I can't argue with it.  And somehow or other [NAME OTHER] have worked our way through it.  Um, I didn't feel like I wanted to go to [NAME OTHER] and apologize because she was part of causing the whole thing.  So I didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She never apologizes to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been very good to her.  I have been busting my ass to get her a job.  She doesn't have a job yet which is very frustrating because she's uptight all the time.  You know, going to school, doesn't have a job, but going to Israel, so, you know, who the hell, so p.s., [DEIDENTIFIED] calls where she worked last summer and they had a, uh, I forget the word, maybe it's a one month consultancy or something, you know, in other words, it wasn't a permanent situation, but she could have had a one month job starting like immediately.  And since she's going to Israel she was counted out.  Because either you're there now or you're not there because that's the way the TV stations work.  Um, and, you know, so I got, I got her into HBO, she got, somebody got her into Food Network, I got her into another digital ad agency, and she doesn't act like, you know, all she acts like is being uptight about the fact what am I going to do?  I said, [NAME OTHER], I don't know what you're going to do yet.  Something's, you're going to get a job because people seem to like you when you interview and, you know, you're going to get a job.  I mean, I can't tell you what day it's going to happen, but all I can say is I have been out there calling and emailing everybody I know under the sun, which I have, to get you the openings that you were getting.  So I don't want to feel like you're, I don't want to feel like you're coming at me for not doing, you know, not doing what I should be doing because nobody else is doing it for you, nobody.  I mean, nobody, you know, so just appreciate the fact that I take time out of my day every single day to worry about your future.  Now, [NAME OTHER], you know, god bless him, you know, [NAME OTHER]'s a different breed of character because [NAME OTHER] got himself an internship, I got him the internship, but he got it because he's smart enough, by a company called [DEIDENTIFIED] which is a company that was formed by [DEIDENTIFIED] to do efficiency studies.  And they're, they're in [DEIDENTIFIED], all the [DEIDENTIFIED].  So he's located at the [DEIDENTIFIED] doing all this efficiency stuff and, um, [NAME OTHER]'s just a very bright—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me interrupt.  How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So even through the worst of it you were sleeping okay and eating okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  And I'm working out more than I've ever worked out because, you know what, because my PT person with my knee—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Convinced me that the only way my knee is going to get better is to bike a lot, stretch a lot, I mean, she can't believe how fast I've progressed, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like a rehab.  And, uh, is your energy level decent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're getting pleasure normally, are you enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have time to enjoy much right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you can enjoy a TV show or a walk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, I'm actually enjoying reading a little bit more, I'm reading a couple of novels right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, and you're able to concentrate okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And every, anyhow, I'm a voracious reader with newspapers.  I mean, you know, because I'm very passionate about politics, not that I'm happy about it, but I'm passionate about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are your thoughts about Obama?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, got another couple of imbeciles that are going to, one wants to get to the White House and replace the worst of it, I don't know.  I mean, this country's a mess.  The Congress is a mess.  Presidential candidates are inadequate.  I don't know who their running mates are going to be.  If Barack Obama has a half a brain he'll get Jim Webb to run with him who has this great military background who is smart as a whip.  He's a junior senator from Virginia.  That's my take on it.  I don't know.  I don't know if anybody really thinks these things through that much.  We have a horrible administration in [DEIDENTIFIED].  It just keeps getting worse and worse and worse.  And, you know, when you read what's going on, I mean, it's just total corruption.  Everything's corrupt.  And Congress is the worst ever.  There's no leadership.  There's nothing going on.  Nobody's tried to figure out the oil situation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Economy's a mess.  It's a mess.  And I'm feeling it, I mean, you know, because everybody around me is being affected by it right now.  Closing on anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm getting close on a restaurant situation that, an Irish guy who's stuck with me for 10 years, his wish list was to get next to Madison Square Garden and I think they may have them there, in the Pennsylvania Hotel.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right across.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	An Irish guy went out of business and I think he jumped on it at the right time.  And, you know, I'm doing a few little consulting things for $1,500, $500, whatever I can get, and of course, you know, the minute my website's up I'm mailing to a thousand restaurants, so that should open up a lot of doors.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you doing the website, I mean, is someone is [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I did all the writing.  So it really is costing me like $1,500 a month.  I mean, I could have done the work.  I mean, but you know what?  If the guy can put up the website the way I want to see it and I think he will, then it was all worthwhile.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then what are the maintenance costs on a website?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where do, who, where [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Server is with a company called Network Solutions and it's like, you know, I'm paid up for 3 years so it's nothing.  And I paid another $15 for three years to have an email address [INAUDIBLE], which I've already been able to hook up to my Outlook.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now can, if you leave [DEIDENTIFIED], would you be able to consult in [DEIDENTIFIED] or in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could consult anyplace.  I mean, if somebody's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If somebody's got a problem in the hospitality industry, I can, you know, I can sharpshoot that problem.  I mean, you know, that's my forte.  But I also in the middle of all this, I also called the CEO of [DEIDENTIFIED], which is a very interesting little boutique chain that started downtown.  They bought the Hollywood Roosevelt in West Hollywood and they're just growing very nicely.  Actually faster than [DEIDENTIFIED] right now.  And I know him through a friend of ours, a very close friend of our sister's married to the guy.  And I went to him and I said, "Listen, you know, I know you generally hire very young, very, you know, some very aggressive looking people, but I got to, but in my opinion the hospitality business means experience also.  And I'm here for that."  So, you know, I interviewed with him for a position whether it's full time or consulting or whatever, I don't know, but, um, you know, I gave him a very strong presentation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how much time did you get to spend with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About an hour.  And, you know, he's got to take it to his partners and I'm not rushing him because I feel like I'm just going to, you know, discount myself if I push too hard.  I'm really careful about who I call back when because it's a very funny world.  And if you're too aggressive people will get pissed off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you're too unaggressive you get nowhere, so it's like a jungle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so I'm trying to play the act, you know, listen I do the best I can every waking new minute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, listen, you put this together far better than you were a couple of weeks ago.  I mean, you really put yourself back together.  You feel back to normal?  Do you feel normal again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not totally, but, I'm, you know, I'm getting there.  I think I'm doing the best I can under—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, listen, we had you on Zoloft Wellbutrin combination for a long time and then pulled that back last October.  Pulled back the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I wonder if we should start another antidepressant in addition to the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are your thoughts?  I mean, have you been worse in, let's say, in the past year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, pretty sporadically I guess so, yeah.  I mean, you know, as you get older and things are harder it's pretty logical that things aren't going to be so good.  You know, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but you were treating the mood problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have the answer, I really don't have the answer.  I mean, I would love to feel better about myself than I do right now.  And maybe it'll happen if things start to change.  You know, I don't know how I can really change much more than, you know, I don't know what more I can do for myself at this point than I'm doing because I'm like a workaholic because I know I have to be.  And I still have my mother which to me is a real burden right now because even the thought of cooking dinner Friday night which I still do is, it's a burden now.  You know, I feel like it's another thing on my back, which, you know, it's like I would like to think that I don't have to do it.  So, you know, putting that all in perspective I would say that, you know, that life has become a bigger burden.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You went back up to 450 on the Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, as of a couple of days after I spoke to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you think it helped?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I vote adding another, a Prozac type medicine.  You know it doesn't have to be Zoloft.  I think maybe Lexapro's a good one for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've been mostly on, uh, Zoloft through the years, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was 100 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you a bunch of the Lexapro, no prescription, just see how it goes for let's say two months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then we'll play with it.  You know, see if we get a bump from that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll take the new prescription with me for the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Wellbutrin and I need one for Klonopin which is just 1 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Every night, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One mg a night.  You know what?  That's the best thing because I get to sleep with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not a very heavy dose is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, it's mild.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just gets me to go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take one of these every day, okay?  Every night, and when it runs out we should talk to see whether we want to keep it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Close to 2 months then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so that'll give you a 2 month supply, we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, listen, if I'd seen you 2 weeks I don't know what we would have done, probably the same thing.  I would have said [INAUDIBLE].  Now I'm remembering what you sounded like on the phone and I really think it's important that we protect you from falling into that again, because, you know, your brain's probably vulnerable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to go into that again.  I really don't.  I mean, it really bothered me that it got the way, it got that far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It may have been partially because we had pulled back on the, uh, Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I think also just the set of circumstances, I mean, you know, it's just, everything just has been happening so quickly and such a shitty direction.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she going to go do birthright?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, did they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The teacher told her, the teacher told her that as long as she writes her papers and, you know, it's going to be only, she's going to miss two classes because the last class is canceled already, at least that's what [NAME OTHER] told me.  If she's lying to me, I don't know, but I said, "[NAME OTHER], if you don't pass this course, I am, you know, you're going to lose a father.  I swear to god you will because you can't do this again.  You just can't."  I mean, she, you know, I was really hard pressed for that $4,500 that I had to come up with the next day because, you know, I've got $2,900 bill to pay for [NAME OTHER]'s first housing pop for, you know, for his fraternity, which I don't mind.  I mean, [NAME OTHER]'s a great kid.  [NAME OTHER]'s really doing everything he can for himself.  He just got himself a teaching assistant position for the fall and is in the financial accounting course that he got an A in last semester, you know, last fall.  And the former dean of the hotel school is his professor who I happen to know very, very well, and very friendly with.  Used to have lunch with him in the city every time he came in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, and that helped.  I mean, no, it didn't help [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] got an A anyway, I mean, you know, he earned his way into this, but it's going to help [NAME OTHER] get, because he'll become his faculty advisor and this is a former dean who meets everybody in the world when he's the dean of that school.  The hotel school is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it should be able to help him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no question.  And then an associate dean who's a finance professor I am very, very close with who said to [NAME OTHER], "Come into my office in September and I'll start working on next summer for you."  You know, you don't wait—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you ever wonder if you're a bit over—involved with your kids, enmeshed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, you know why?  Because I really enjoy being part of this hotel [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get a lot of pleasure out of it and, you know, something I'm enjoy the fact that [NAME OTHER]'s in the right place see because, you know, I also hooked him up with a guy who's a PR, the head of PR in the school and [NAME OTHER] now has little internships at conferences that they're paying for.  So he's volunteering and he's getting something for it.  And, you know, he's doing all, let's put it this way, he's doing all the right things.  And he's already becoming an officer in his fraternity in his sophomore year and, you know, I mean, obviously people see his leadership skills.  He has them.  He takes after his father in that respect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I think both your children are going to make you proud.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope.  I hope.  [NAME OTHER] worries me a little bit.  She's afraid of her own shadow when it comes to talking to a perspective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, wouldn't her character allow her to really mess up.  So, uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I think she's following [NAME OTHER]'s school path.  [NAME OTHER] was a total screw up in school.  She didn't work.  You know, her father passed away in the middle of college so that didn't, you know, that obviously, that was a real problem to her because she ended up switching schools because her mother moved to Florida.  She started at [DEIDENTIFIED] and finished in [DEIDENTIFIED] but it was a very druggy era and she was partying more than going to school.  And I think [NAME OTHER] followed in that footstep in the sense that she's really spent much too much time socializing in [DEIDENTIFIED] and much too little time thinking about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She have a boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  And that's a problem too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is that a problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she just doesn't seem, she doesn't have confidence in herself for some reason.  And, you know, and what happens is some of her friends like her [DEIDENTIFIED] friends who are really very aggressive kids, you know, seem to overwhelm her and they'll go talk to a boy before they'll let her talk to a guy and she just feels like she's taking like a backseat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean let her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She gave us the impression that she liked a guy and her friend, [NAME OTHER], who goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] who went to [DEIDENTIFIED] said, you know, I like him and she just kind of stepped aside and let [NAME OTHER] just move in on her.  I said, "[NAME OTHER], that's not," you know, and [NAME OTHER] said, "It's not good.  You can't do that.  [NAME OTHER] will find her own people.  Don't worry about [NAME OTHER], worry about yourself."  She doesn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She could use some confidence.  Was [NAME OTHER] that way too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [NAME OTHER] had one boyfriend after another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She had a lot of confidence?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess so.  I don't know.  I mean, I met [NAME OTHER] when she was turning [AGE] so I don't know what she was like when she was [AGE].  I know she dated a lot and stuff, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER]'s planning to stay in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s living at home and is not moving anywhere until she starts making money.  [INAUDIBLE].  And [NAME OTHER] goes back to [DEIDENTIFIED] in August, so, you know, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but eventually he's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think he'll end up in [DEIDENTIFIED] or he'll go overseas somewhere.  I mean, he's already got the school, [DEIDENTIFIED], on his brain for an internship.  So, uh, yeah, he could get a month or 2 of economics behind him, yeah.  It's a great school.  [NAME OTHER]'s going to earn his way into something very big one day.  I just see it happening.  You know, he's the kind of kid that'll get to the right place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't know what extent yet, I haven't figured that out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, you're getting frustrated with [DEIDENTIFIED], does [NAME OTHER] agree with your?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is prepared to move out of the city if we have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And anything on your mind about where to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Haven't thought about it.  Because what's going to happen is, you know, my mother's not going to live forever.  She's [AGE].  When she goes there will, you know, there will be some money because, you know, I'll immediately fix and put her apartment up for sale.  And that will bring enough money in to really get rid of all the debt.  And that's how I look at it.  I mean, you know, even splitting with my brother I'll get out of debt.  You know, I'll be able to pay my mortgage down to a point of maybe it'll be a quarter of a million instead of 650, and I'm sure I'll be making some money at that point and, you know, and then the cost of living will come back down to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Down to normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And hopefully [NAME OTHER] will be making some of her own money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she won't be a drain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm finished with her college other than a couple of, you know, well, there are some loans out there that's, I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to take care of her loans?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what I'm doing to do yet.  I haven't figured that out yet.  There's about $60,000 in loans.  It's not the end of the world considering that I got it for four years.  So [NAME OTHER] I really, I don't think I borrowed anything for him so far—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because [NAME OTHER] has been cut such a good deal at [DEIDENTIFIED] that I think I was able to, you know, pay my way through the first year already.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Shouldn't the kids have some loans when they come out of school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I wanted, [NAME OTHER] does have a couple of loans in her name.  I don't think she realizes that I cosigned loans that were in [NAME OTHER]'s name.  But she does have loans.  I know that at least $39,000 that I know of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That in addition to the 60?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's part of the 60.  No, I put them in her name specifically because first of all the students usually get a better pop when it comes to the benefit of the payout and the interest rate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, she got, you know, she got good terms.  They're Sally Mae loans.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was just able to negotiate for her.  So I think I did well, and I consolidated everything, you know, at the last minute, so I'm going, there's going to be one organization to pay off and whatever happens will happen.  I mean, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've got to get credit for trying.  I mean, you're really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know something?  And I know, I've got it down on my list right now, I know that I've got to call Sally Mae one day and start to direct my attention to it at least.  But, you know, I don't know where it fits into the whole picture yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Um, all right, so I think with, uh, adding a touch of another antidepressant we can get you back to where you used to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd like to think that would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, we'll know because you should get better all in 1 day and then if you want, after 2 months, you can stop and see if it makes a difference, see if it [INAUDIBLE].  And if you need it just give us a call, you know.  If things go the wrong way, just give me a call.  We'll figure out what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm not telling [NAME OTHER] what I'm taking as far as medication because it's really not important that she knows.  She doesn't need to know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's better that she doesn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She doesn't ask.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, you know, as long as she doesn't ask, I don't tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel very good about the fact that, you know, nobody knows about the [NAME OTHER] situation because fortunately, [NAME OTHER]'s mouth is usually big enough to tell somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're kind of, I don't know, enabling her a little bit, but—</p>

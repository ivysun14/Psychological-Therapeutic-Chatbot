<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: But at least he told me why. Yeah,[who he knew] (ph) I don't know. It was the last time I saw him which was when I was with the people, which hasn't been too long ago. And I always thought it was because he didn't like me. But I think he has his own hang-ups. You know he said he's always been an introvert. You know, like he's always known that. He doesn't start conversations. And I always thought he was an extrovert. And that he could be charming and etc. if he felt like it. And then I thought, well maybe he's just moody. And he probably is moody too. But I really felt good that we had, you know, we had a really good talk. And talked about how we felt instead of the piddley little things like how are you doing in your job, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Good. Like you had...

</p><p>PATIENT: Like you would talk to any stranger. I don't know I have a really big hang-up about being close to my family. You know, and that's not necessarily so. And I felt badly when my younger brother who I always had thought I had this great rapport with and we had nothing to say to each other. My husband and my brother talked all the time. And I just felt really good that I could talk to my older brother.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like part of it was feeling good that you had an older brother and not a stranger. 0:02:02.7

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you know you could talk to a stranger. I think sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger than it is someone within your own family that you've grown up with and, you know. You're supposed to be close to them. You've grown up in the same house. But you aren't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I never had talked to him. And I found out, you know like he says "I've never had a talk with you or my brother or my father." You know that must really hurt him even though he doesn't say "Yeah, that really hurts me. "

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's not just you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That he hasn't talked to, no. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought you meant something like it's not just me you hurt. Others were hurt too. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. But now I'm kinda wondering about my little brother. Yeah, and supposedly it was such a nice family. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like the Saturday Evening Post. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. We could have been on the cover of that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But anyway what was it you were asking Tuesday that question? I think I thought of an answer on the way home. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't remember. If you tell me the answer, I'll tell you the question. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Ok. I think that I really, it really, after all it is my crap and I am kinda embarrassed to have him in the family. Or for me to be in that family. My brother- in- law. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Does he make you uncomfortable or? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel really lucky that, you know, I said to Jim, "Gee I'm lucky I got you instead or your brother." And he said, "Yeah but you could have maybe not gotten into the family at all." That (chuckles) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Third prize. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I'm only at second. 0:04:04.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So, but it's like it's hard on Jim because he feels like there is something that he could do and yet his hands are tied. And I don't, I can't think of a thing anybody can do until he does it. Until somebody kicks him out of the house. 

</p><p>Well, anyway, I'm not going to worry about him any more. Unless he comes to New York. Oh yeah, I think he could feel badly that he's the way he is but I don't have to get involved. Besides that there's no way to get involved. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Even if you wanted to get involved. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, if I thought I could do something yes I would get involved. I mean if I could do something good. But I can't think of anything that wouldn't just stir up a hornet's nest. And so instead of sitting around thinking about it...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just put it out of your mind. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think, you know, even it would bother me a little more if it was my own brother or [or my own family.] (ph) That much, you know, in that sense it must be a reflection on you. Because I just finished saying there wasn't any close ties. 

</p><p>I wonder if people always have motives for everything they do? You know, and all the feelings that are felt.0:06:24.0

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not with you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Would I feel badly because that was my brother or would I feel badly because that was a person and a brother? Or being my brother, would that reflect badly upon me? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:49.7} I'm stuck with a motive. I don't know what you're saying. Are you saying? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm saying I wonder if you always have to have a motive for your feelings. Or whether you can just be free and easy. If you can, you know, just feel compassion for somebody because he is somebody. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I, yeah. Whether you can just, yeah. Whether you can just have simple unalloyed (sp?) feelings or whether there has to be some psychoanalytical explanation of the feelings? That you're not really feeling compassionate for him. It's that you're, because he's your brother-in-law. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why is that a question for you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I've just been thinking more.(chuckles) Otherwise it wouldn't even occur to me. I don't know. Because I want to be, I really I think I want to become a simple person, you know. And if I want to cry. If I feel like crying I will and not try to hold it in. If I want to feel compassion for someone, I will. Not because he's related to me. Or not feel compassion for him because he's not related. 0:08:22.6

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want to be able to feel your feelings. Just express your feelings and not have to feel that you shouldn't because... because why? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know, like I watch a TV program and cry and people sitting around going "look at her". Or, a movie or read a book and cry. And I want to be able to do that without people pointing. I guess I want other people to change. I'm not going to change because I do read a book and cry. I'd like not to feel self conscious about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you feel sort of on display or something. Yeah, on display. People kinda laugh at you. It's abnormal. You look abnormal to people. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well now I think well, maybe they are. They don't have it in them. I just can't say, it cleans your eyes. It clears your tear ducts. Why not? It's a good feeling sometimes to be able to cry. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you're right and they're wrong? 0:10:04.0

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I don't mind if it's in my own home and not in a movie when you have to kinda stifle your crying so the rest of the people can hear and it hurts. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hurts in your throat. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, your throat hurts so bad when you get out of there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not clear. It sounds like on the one hand you're sort of serious and then you're sort of laughing at yourself or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: For crying?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What I'm hearing, you're telling me is you're laughing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I guess you know that's the way I am. And I just don't think that that's one of the things. I don't really care if I change that. And well it's kinda funny, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No I don't I'm sure that's funny. It may be but..

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you know like obviously this, is fiction you're reading or you're watching and here I am just so wrapped up in it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Crying over something that isn't there. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Crying. That isn't even true you know. But that's what I, you know like I'm like that in a lot of different things. Like when I read a book where a husband and wife are just saying one witty remark after another to each other I just think "wow, that's really cool." Knowing full well that nobody could be that witty day in and day out. And be or not bee a screen writer or something. But I do think that that would be nice. 

</p><p>(chuckles) 0:12:36.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you say you get, you sound like see something and go "I'm getting suckered in by illusions."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I'd never thought of being suckered in. You know like I know I do that and it is kind of funny. But I don't, you know like there was one and there is probably one spot where it hurts and that's in the marriage bed. Is that a term? (inaudible at 0:13:11.1) Sounds like something I read, the marriage bed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel self conscious saying that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Saying that. (chuckles) I don 't know what else you call it. It's just, you know because everything is, no it's not the marriage bed. It's just the bed. Thinking back on the novels I've read, not too many of them were married. You know and everything goes so perfectly that I think that would be neat. I don't know whether to be in bed with that, the hero of the bed. Or to be the heroine where you're giving this to this man and he's just really going wild and everything is on fire the whole book.0:14:19.6

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And like that's the only spot where kinda living in a dream world would hurt. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it really does hurt when you compare the kind of fumbling and pain and whatever the course that you go through with a live vibrant excitement that you read about. [And you're just covering for your pain] (ph) 14:57.0

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it seems like it should be different. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I just don't' know whether like it's more often to happen like Jim and I or like whoever's in the book you know? And why that even should make a difference. Well, I guess because you want the best. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your looking at me like I should answer that one apparently for you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No I'm looking at you to see if you'll accept that answer. (chuckles)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you accept that answer? 0:16:08.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm just not convinced on either side. I still I just don't know what to say about that. You know like, whether it is possible. Yeah, it's probably possible. And whether it matters. You ought to have something tapped into my mind. Because I think so many more things than I say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you were thinking a lot of things right then.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just don't know whether any of these things make a difference. Anything that I'm thinking or saying really  - want a cola? -  

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean, make a difference? 0:18:12.4

</p><p>PATIENT: Make a difference to my enjoyment of sex. Anything that I'm..

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thinking. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Thinking. You know. I'm even wondering why are they popping into my head. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you? This, is guess. Are you feeling uncomfortable with what you were thinking? Or sheepish?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I just, I guess maybe I am. Because I don't want to say it because it is so, it is just little fragments. And I can't bring them all together to even form a sentence. I know like one thing I was thinking was Ann Bolen being my favorite heroine. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like that has some meaning but.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in her relationship to Henry the Eighth in the book or the movie you know. But like that's something I've already said. She really, she had him jumping over hot coals and redoing the whole church just for her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just for her sexually. 0:20:03.4

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then he was crazy. (chuckles) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Be nice to..

</p><p>PATIENT: Be nice to have someone do that for you but I don't know. I've always thought it would be nice. I'm beginning to wonder about that. Especially if you've got your pajamas off.

</p><p>And I was wondering today if I'm not climaxing because of something in my past? So I'm thinking about my mother's relationship to my father. Obviously that's getting me nowhere. 0:22:41.4

</p><p>And I was thinking when, I think all of us saw her really being better but letting on like he was better. Better being clever more intelligent, you know. But being very devious about letting him get the better, I mean. Clearly she was more read and really more intelligent. Not more intelligent but like more worldly than he was. But she would pick out one thing that she couldn't do. Or she'd let him pick it out. You know, like he'd bring it up. Like she couldn't do math. And she'd let him kind of lord it over her. I mean there must have been a hundred thousand things that she could do just as well or better than he. But it was only math that was under discussion. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:24:04.5

</p><p>PATIENT: And I, you know I have some quarrel with is that the way to play the game. Or is there supposed, I mean is marriage supposed to be a game of building his ego? I mean surely there must have been. You know instead of running her down he could have, or she could have let him be built up in his own area, which was farming. Instead of saying "you don't do math well." You know there shouldn't have been that need for it. For him, and you know it was like he was like a leach or something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like the only areas that he was going to feel good in were the areas she (overlapping)

</p><p>PATIENT: Or that he was better than she was in that particular area. But there, I mean like she couldn't go out and do the farming or take care of the business. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um-mm. That's where I'm confused. It sounds now as if you were saying "there indeed were some areas where he was solidly better than her."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So then why? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why was that so necessary to always to be harping on math where he was good and she was poor? Does that have anything to do with me? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just something that we all saw and wondered about. Well here we go on the old math bit. Well why don't you challenge her in English or something, you know? (chuckles) That's her strong point Dad. Or painting or.. 0:26:11.1

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm... the deception...

</p><p>PATIENT: Has always been a puzzle. Why was there no... Or if he would get mad. This, is a very like typical thing of a lot of people. They'll drop something and say "look what you made me do." You're in the next room and you made them do it. And that's the way my dad was and she would always just "Oh, Seymour". Always in front of us kids though. So that like we learned that was kind of a response. "Oh, Dad." And I think that really she didn't have very good motive for being such a sweet gentle even tempered person. I think she was just a little bit devious. I don't think she was teaching us anything great by not openly saying "Now listen guy, I was in the other room and you did that yourself." But because accepting the blame for all to see, "Your dad, you know how he is. We kinda have to go along with him." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well it sounds like you see her sort of self consciously playing martyr. 0:28:05.3

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like that do you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, and I know that I'm not playing the right way. But it kinda aggravates me that everybody thought that she was so great. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And she was just...

</p><p>PATIENT: Average. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, but what I had in mind was more like she was like deviously getting her jollies. Or something. Like she wasn't being a martyr, she was playing martyr. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or styling a role.

</p><p>PATIENT: She was so cleaver about it. Like Jim's mother, well, somebody offers to buy her a stove she'll say, "Oh no. You spend that on a boat. You buy the boat. Well, I could have had a stove." And that is so obvious. My mother was so sneaky about it. Really. Cleaver. (chuckles)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Successful. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, very successful. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What does that say to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it kinda brings her down a little. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because she was successful?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. That I thought she was so great and that she shouldn't have been really doing that. I mean my sympathy was all with my mother. And now it's quickly going over to my father. When you really shouldn't have to. They get along perfectly. Why do I have to take sides? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's what you were saying before but in a different way. Which is like "Well, what's in that for me anyway? What the hell difference does it make?"

</p><p>PATIENT: But I somehow see that and you know, that's where I got my lessons. From my mother. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:30:05.5

</p><p>PATIENT: And like, what am I doing to my husband? Or am I the father? Am I getting what my dad's been getting. Or am I doing what my father's doing? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I'm a person who will say "What'd you make me do that for?" (chuckles) And he's in the other room. I'll have to go home and see if he's been (inaudible at 0:30:44.1) (chuckles)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sound like you tend to give another person the (sighs) and to like blame other people like Jim for stuff that's happening.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or the kids. If something is burned, it's because I had to step on to get over to the oven to turn it off. You know which isn't really true. Yes, they are there and I can't get to the oven but I could have turned it down before I left. But I don't do that as much any more either. There's just not as much conflict or strife in my house as there used to be. But all I'm trying to do is find out why I'm not happy in bed. Like, you know, there doesn't seem to be anything that I can point to. Unless I've already pointed to it and I don't know it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. 0:32:03.8

</p><p>PATIENT: But maybe I already have hit on it. Because I am, if it doesn't take too long and if I don't begin to feel like it's really work. And that being that I don't like to practice. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand all that. Part of what you're saying is, [you know I hear] (ph) is you need a hell of a lot of foreplay. (inaudible at 0:32:52.7) Like tons of it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Then I enjoy it more, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Make him think] (ph) it's not foreplay but forework. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think maybe he's just not tender. And when I get out of bed, I'm sore all over. From the whisker burns on down. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't like the way he handles you then. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. And he seems to be a very, very slow learner. He'll say, "tell me." And I'll say, "Softly." And then he gets carried away and it's not. And then all I'm doing is laying there saying "softly, softly." And he'll slow down or be a little more gentle and then it will...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The tempo accelerates and there it is again. 0:34:20.3

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling like you've been through a fight or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I have been practically. I'm bruised when I get out of bed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But then again if you didn't have to concentrate on how you felt. And that's not what you should be in there for, is to protect yourself. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You shouldn't have to feel like you're about to have a fight when you start. The thought that should be uppermost in your mind shouldn't be something like how the hell am I going to stop him when he starts pawing me so hard. Like you're just waiting for that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like that's not uppermost in my mind either. You know like what is in my mind. Except let's get it over with here. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Let the mauling be quick? Yeah?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't even think that, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:53.6) it be quick. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but as far as when I think back on it, it's just what it is. Not very satisfied. 0:36:14.2

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like a sort of understatement. It sounds like now it sort of sounds like that it is sort of painful. Like being a punching bag. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, but then but that's not anything I can control unless I haven't found...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're helpless to do anything about that? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you can only try. Laying there saying the same thing over and over and over. But that's not the reason I'm not climaxing either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why isn't it the reason you're not climaxing? Because you can't do anything about it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, because I would think that if I was concentrating maybe I wouldn't feel the whisker burnings or the rough treatment?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. I mean maybe. But the way you're telling it now it sounds like the whisker burns are like, that's a minimal thing. It sounds like you're talking about feeling you felt really being mauled. Maybe what you're saying is that if I really were into it then it wouldn't feel like mauling. It would turn me on. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't answer that. 0:38:06.1

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, how am I to know then?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Whether you're hurt or not? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. What's good for me. You can't answer it and I can't answer it then who's going to answer? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What are the alternatives? I'm hearing you say something like, "One thing I know is I don't like the way he makes it with me in bed." And then I hear you say something like, "But maybe if I had a different set of feelings that would be alright." But you don't have a different set of feelings. And given the set of feelings that you have, it sounds like there are other people you would rather be in bed with. Or at least you just do not like to be in bed with him the way he is. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know what I really think sometimes, that you really should shop around before you get married. Because how do I know that this, isn't the way it is universally. That this, is the same feeling. I mean the rough. 0:40:30.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That all men would be that way. That you'd have that feeling with all men. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was born too early. Before all of that was acceptable. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Born into the wrong morality. If you had it to do all over again, it would sort of be at least instructive to sleep around a bit. 

</p><p>PATIENT: For me it would be. Well I mean, if I knew the trouble I was going to have now. At least I'd know if it was me or him. 

It's really a shame this, is so, you know. The reason I came and it's the hardest one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by it's really a shame. 0:42:59.7

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's really a shame that it is the hardest. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'd put this as the reason I came. I did have a couple of beers this afternoon with my brother. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did you eat with those couple of beers? It's the reason you came and you're like, "oh, (inaudible at 0:43:23.2) at all". 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, not really. I'm just not as far along as I would wish to be. I mean everything else came, just fit in so nicely. And this one I just don't have really a clue even. 

</p><p>I don't have anything else to say. Kind of unique. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That must be a funny place for you to be, then. 0:45:14.2

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's been that way for a couple of weeks. I don't have anything to say on this. I don't know. I'm usually so good about talking about myself. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it is hard to talk about this for some reason. 

</p><p>PATIENT: If I well, if I had an inkling of what would help me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just do, talk about the thoughts you are having.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I seem to be dry. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. You're saying that now. But I remember earlier this hour you were having thoughts. They were like fragments. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They slipped my mind. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All I was saying was it sounded like not just being dry but something else happening too. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's just, you know, there are things that I just, I just don't think are important. But then you know, like I'm no judge of what's important. And you really can't hear them until they're out loud a lot of times. (chuckles) I mean I can't hear them. I knew you couldn't hear them until...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right. Like when they're inside and not talked, it's very hard to evaluate. It's hard to apprehend stuff. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because it sounds so differently sometimes between thinking and saying. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But saying is really very important. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. 0:47:57.2

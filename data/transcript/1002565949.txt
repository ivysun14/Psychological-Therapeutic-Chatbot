<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, now, just to get our chart in order, I saw you [DATE] and over the past year, you know, you had the horrible insult to your psychic, the loss of your wife, right, which colored everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there was more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I didn't tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With my son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?  He's getting divorced?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He got married [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and, and, and uh [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, when I saw you then in December, it was looking that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you had mentioned that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I did, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So, 2 massive stressors.  You remained on Wellbutrin 200 back then, you were bereaved—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only 1 though, only 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, just 200, 1 of the 200's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were bereaved, , uh, although the bereavement was not as heavy over the 2 months, you know, in the wintertime.  Your mood was decent.  You said you were not sad, you said you weren't anxious, you said you were having no panic attacks.  Your appetite was lower, um,  you were on Metformin, the Januvia, the Amaryl and then recently you were sad, so, so it looks like what we went through was this, first you gave your good face, you said everything is fine, I'm doing okay, there's no problem, and then when we really talked, it was clear that you were quite sadder, you were easier ta, to get tearful, you were frequently tearful, you don't like being alone, you're withdrawn, it doesn't want to go away, not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless, and exercising but we thought, we called it, at that point, a partial remission.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So is that called in denial, am I in denial.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who cares.  I mean what did your daughter give you those words?  Your daughter is giving you those words?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's not in denial.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just putting the best face on things, so if you're 90% depressed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll focus on the 10% that you're not depressed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And put a good face to the world.  That's a very good strategy, don't stop that.  Take my medicines—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But act as if you're not depressed, that's the best way, it's like fake it till you make it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's difficult when, um, I told you I felt better that Friday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Friday but we had a meeting downstairs in the community room and I'm one of the board of trustees there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was, I was out of it, I should have never went to that meeting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing, I couldn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you embarrass yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Close but no, but close.  Anybody, you know, you could see my eyes, you know, I just did look right.  No, it was close but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were close to embarrassment.  You didn't say anything that you regret?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well listen, denial, it turns out denial, which, denial is, um, kind of ignoring reality, that's what denial means—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ignoring things for psychological reasons.  It's actually a pretty good defense mechanism.  It's not the enemy; it's not horrible to be in denial, a little denial.  You have to have denial to move on and act like you're okay but you have to have enough insight to know that you need to take your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so let's talk about what has happened.  I saw you 2 months ago, today is Tuesday already.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I saw you 2 months ago—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The 23rd.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And at that point, even though you were putting the best face on it, we thought that you were, um, probably relapsing and we restarted the Lexapro, correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My good friend [NAME OTHER] told me to come in, you know that, she said come on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Back in December?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Back in December.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, because I hadn't see you for a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When she called, you were really on your way down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it was the early phase but we didn't give you enough.  What did I give you, 10 mg of Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, which is a, you know, you used to live on 30 to 40, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's going back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As recently as, well, October of '05.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But when you were sick, you were on Celexa 80 mg, which is equal to Lexapro 40.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Celexa?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on Celexa; I had you on that for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At 80, equivalent to Lexapro 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's from August of '01.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on Celexa 80 from August of '01 until, well, until May of '03 and then, uh, we just switched you over to Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, but you know, I don't know if it's in your records but my first real, real experience with panic attacks was a real, a real, I mean a really bad one—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In 1989.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, I bet it's in my records.  I do a careful history.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I didn't tell you, 1989, that was a real, 1989.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your 20's, you had, uh, major depression for more than a year and then you had a low grade sadness.  At age 39, you had a big depression in the setting of a midlife crisis and then at age 52 you had a big depression with panic attacks, that's less than 4 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's the one, that's, you know, right, so that was, you were disabled, you couldn't work for 4 months, yeah, you were a wreck.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I might have been a wreck but I was focused.  I wasn't focused up until a week ago Friday, this far, I was not focused.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this is a different condition.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I had a lot of anxiety back then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, that was more anxiety and it kind of morphed into pure depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You told me that once or twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Luckily, the same medicine treats both but you're panic disorder morphed into major depressive disorder and now you have depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so anyway, so let's go through what we did.  I saw you last time, we thought maybe you were having an early relapse and it is good that she pushed in here because if you had called me the way you called me and I hadn't seen you, I would have scratched my head, I would have had you come right in because you were such a wreck, you know, a few weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you called for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	By the way, you called the wrong number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That first time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or second time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You called my voice mail.  You happened to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have 2, you have 2, you have a number for the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, I actually have 3 important numbers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have the third one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One is my secretary—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who handles all scheduling, billing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then you have voice mail.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then my voice mail, which is almost always the best way.  That should be the main number and that's what you called but then there's an emergency line that if it's the middle of the night and you're in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's when it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's when it was, then you kind of up the ante and you got to call the emergency line.  It turns out that I, I got back to you at 2—3 in the morning.  I happened to check it, do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I remember, that's when it happened, you were up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I was actually out of the country and it's 7 hours later, so I was checking my morning voice mails and I got it but it was an emergency, you should call my emergency line but I don't want you to put it in, I don't want you to use my emergency line unless you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's on all my things and it's on the voice mail if you need it.  If you're in an emergency, just call the voice mail—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll say if it's an emergency call this number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  But anyway, it was fine but that was an emergency.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have, I have [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Correct, that's the main one, those are the main ones you should—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if it's an emergency there's another one, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You'll have to give me that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, no, it's on, just no, if you have an emergency call any of the main numbers and it'll have if this is an emergency call this number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah, gotcha.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can always get it by calling those numbers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's better this way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because I don't want to get those calls, you know, in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean a lot of them might be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of people call the emergency line—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh for that, when it's not an emergency.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that was a true emergency, you were really, your neighbor was over, you were having a panic attack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, luckily, on my floor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I live in a condo, there's a nurse too.  I'm pretty friendly with her and her husband.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Luckily, that's the first thing I thought of, to call her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and the husband came over and sat with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well they sat with me a few hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He went back and then she stayed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's really nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I had dinner with them a few times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm friendly with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're lucky.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Otherwise, you would have called an ambulance, you were in such a state.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only if the panic attack continued.  It stopped, it started, I really, okay, how do I explain this, I felt the panic attack coming on and I got scared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I'm not waiting.  I took the Xanax right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You aborted it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You aborted it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I aborted it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could have taken 2 or 3, put yourself to sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took four, 0.5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so you took 2 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	2 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, that's a good dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So luckily I was at the right place at the right time but I carry them all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Always.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always did and now, all right, you go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's also another one called Ativan, did I ever give you Ativan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, you never did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ativan is the one that works fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I'm going to need it when we get into my side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's go to work.  Let's forget that for a moment.  I saw you December 23rd.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just before Christmas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were going downhill, you know, you were very reluctant to go back on the medicine but I kind of twisted your arm, I said please start something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Celexa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we get you on to 5 or 10 mg, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You gave me samples of Lexapro, gave me a prescription, and it said no refills, correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, because we didn't think you'd need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, all right, so but after I saw you and you got onto the Lexapro, what happened to your mood, did you mood lift a little bit or did it continue to go downhill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I must have went downhill because January 28th is when I crashed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think it helped at all though, the Lexapro we gave you?  You continued to drop despite, despite Lexapro 10, which is a low dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then by January, what was the date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	January 28th, that was the night, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE], for the New Year you developed, uh, panic attack, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it came awful close to one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, it was, you aborted it, it would have blossomed as a full one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I aborted it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you aborted it, you stopped it, good move.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Remember a long time ago, I didn't want to take any medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, anyway, you had the panic attack—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You aborted it, so you had a subthreshold panic attack, you aborted with Xanax 2 mg and then we talked and we raised your Lexapro to what dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	First we went to 20 for 2 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we went to 30 for 2 days and then we went to 40 and we stayed, we're on 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right and so in these last 2 weeks, what's your mood been like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My mood?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Around people I'm all right.  When I'm not around people, I'm very sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You had the panic attack in the setting of your mood being pretty low, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were getting sadder all day every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your mood now better than it was then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Am I sad?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think I'm sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The same, so the Lexapro has not lifted your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not the mood, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What has Lexapro done for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Got, me, got my focus back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're less anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're less anxious but you're still depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can, yeah, I can concentrate now but I'm still not, I'm not nowhere near where I should be.  My memory is so bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Little simple things like, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's depression/anxiety, it really interferes with your ability to think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of things do you forget?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Simple things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know that's normal for a person my age.  Names, like I can't connect 2 names, sometimes I forget [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], I remember [NAME OTHER], I'll forget [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll remember [NAME OTHER], I'll forget [NAME OTHER], it doesn't come to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you ever get lost?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lost?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you ever, uh, do you cook?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have trouble cooking, do you leave the stove on, any problems like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No legitimate—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not at that point, not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad we can joke about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm glad we can too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have no legitimate kind of problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have just depressed related kind of impairment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I don't remember ever having but I could be wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember ever having that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've got it now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have to fake it through with people, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, what do you have to fake through, that you know their name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, really, I, you know, my memory is going, I don't know what the hell is going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you have to fake with people though, socially what do you have to fake?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just faking my mood, you know what I mean, putting on a face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have to fake your mood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who can get to you though, who makes you cry?  Your daughter, your son?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, both, when I think about [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't cry in front of [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel guilty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Guilty, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your self esteem very low?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel like you're no good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm good, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why is your self esteem low?  What's your self esteem low about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  What is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when you say your self esteem is low, what do you mean?  To me it means you feel like you're no good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, come on, I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're self esteem is fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right but, you know, some people get depressed even when they are great, they feel like they're no good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you don't have that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your self esteem is okay.  Any suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel that life's not worth living in any way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your appetite like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Here's the biggie, that's number one on the list.  Since the 28th, I have no appetite, no appetite, even—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you get on the scale for me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, even, I lost 9 pounds, I lost 9 pounds.  Well, I have all these clothes on now, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, no, we'll follow this over time, do you know how to do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know how to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then vary the top one, yeah, till the bubble is in the middle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, this is the same one I have home believe it or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] gave it to me a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	165.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	3 pounds of clothes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	165.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We'll go by yours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get 162, so I lost 10 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Taking naked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	10 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if you losing naked, you losing with clothes anyway, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, you know what, you want to know something, it's very good for my diabetes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is.  Is your blood sugar better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only because I'm not, I don't have the appetite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're not eating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm not eating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's a cure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a cure for diabetes, pretty soon I'll go off the insulin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depressed and miserable and anxious but boy is my blood sugar good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My blood sugar is fantastic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  In the beginning of the night, how long does it take to fall asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It takes forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like 2 hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At least.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I fall asleep.  I close my eyes all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you tired enough?  Do you nap during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I never did nap.  I mean there's been times when I, when I didn't sleep at night, the whole night—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the next day, it's light, I didn't sleep and I felt okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you manic in any way, high energy, racing thoughts, talking too much or too fast?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing like that, nothing even close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not revved up in any way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing, nothing at all, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just have bad sleep, so it takes hours to sleep, once you get to sleep, can you get a couple of good hours or it's up and down all night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have to go the bathroom anyway a couple times, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right but once you do get to sleep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get some decent hours?  About how many?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How many?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, solid hours, average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, sometimes I'll sleep, you know, when I do sleep, I'll sleep late, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll oversleep, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll oversleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I want to say it's 7, I guess, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	7 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your sleep is shifted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	7—8, it's shifted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's shifted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's shifted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you tend to oversleep, could you stay in bed all day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your energy like during the day?  No good, your energy is low, you're dragging?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, very much so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you exercising?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I stopped.  I belong to [DEIDENTIFIED], it's like 5 minutes away and I don't even go.  I've been there a few times with [NAME OTHER].  I haven't been there since this episode I haven't.  I have gone by myself and it seems like, everything seems like it's in slow motion, it seems like I have no strength.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What the hell is happening?  I have no strength.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you sometimes feel that you can barely lift your arms and legs you're so drained of energy?  So your stamina is down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stamina is out, appetite is out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you ever, do you have any sensory problems, tingling anywhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tingling?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tingling or difficulty walking or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you go to your regular doctor regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a new regular doctor, so called, my old regular doctor I stopped a few years ago when [NAME OTHER], when I had the bypass I started with a new one and, uh, go to him once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When was the bypass, what was the year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was 2 years next month, March, I had the heart attack on my birthday, March 6th.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, your birthday is March 6th.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That happened on March 6th, is that right doc, I think so.  Anyway, why does March 19th ring a bell for me, I don't know, maybe that's when I had the bypass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, anyway—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It can't be, so it can't be March 6th, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's following your cardiac problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My cardiologist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and he thinks you're fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, you know, I take different tests.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You mean my heart, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have the defibrillator now and my diabetic doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and there's no, um, no atrial fibrillation or anything like that, do you know what that is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, when you, yeah, it happened once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did that happen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It happened after they put the defibrillator in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before, before, yeah, at the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're not on Coumadin or any blood thinners?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you get it checked, that your blood is thin enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The reason I'm asking these things, I want to make sure none of this is stroke related.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Related to the possibility that you're throwing any clots.  It does seem that way because you don't, you have no specific neurologic problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know, the risk, if you're not thin enough, if your blood's not thin enough is that it can throw clots to your brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well I'm on Coumadin.  I've been on Coumadin since—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's more important than your blood sugar, than anything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Coumadin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Coumadin.  Make sure that your blood is thin enough because the risk is always to throw clots to your brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well one time on the Coumadin, I was taking 1 every day, one whole tablet every day and I peed blood, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your blood was too thin then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Too thin, so I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay, you have a little bleeding problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They cut me back—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, cut you back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To 11/2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But then they checked it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it was okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're blood's nice and thin.  Don't fall by the way, right.  When your blood's thin, you don't want to fall.  Be careful in the wintertime.  You know why you don't want to fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't want to get cut.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to, yeah, you don't want to bop your head—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And be, and have your blood so thin, it'll be harder to clot it.  Be careful, don't fall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if that happens, what do you do?  What can you do, I don't know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if you're on blood thinner and you fall, you go see your doctor just to make sure that there's no bleeding complications from the fall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The diabetic doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even me, any doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And make sure there's no complications from the fall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, more importantly, because of your cardiac history—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We know that it, you know, you're at some risk for stroke related problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so whenever there's any change in your neurologic status, we have to be concerned and keep an eye.  It looks fine to me, it looks like it's your regular psychiatric illness coming back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we'll just, you know, knock you over the head with medications and get you well again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, um, when I had the bypass, at that time, that's when they told me I was a diabetic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At the same time, they said I'd probably been a diabetic for 10 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's probably normal, right, with heart people who have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It runs together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's got nothing to do—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It runs together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's got nothing to do with, uh, yeah, it does, they're related somewhat but none of the diabetes was ever in my family that I know of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Isn't that funny?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you won the jackpot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, it's a risk factor, that and hypertension and, you know, all the, they're risk factors for both cardiac and brain, and smoking, you're not smoking, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not since I was 35.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Had you kept smoking, given these risk factors, we wouldn't have you anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, uh, all right, so let's, you've got to keep up with your regular doctors because you're at risk for these other things so, your diabetes, your cardiac—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Those two I keep up with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and well, they'll keep an eye because they know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the diabetic doctor is a little different.  The cardiologist, I'm, you know, I have to take these tests all the time, blah, blah, blah.  The diabetic doctor, you just fax, you fax in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Your blood sugar in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's not good for a relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no repour with him anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's very efficient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] got in a fight with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My lawyer.  He tells her to get out and she says I have patient rights.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why did he tell her to get out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was a little late.  I was waiting downstairs.  His appointment is exactly; if you're not there they don't take you.  So I was, they finally took me, I had to wait for [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] came 10 minutes later, knocked on the door, came in and he said to her, he said out.  Oh, that's the way he is, he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's a piece of work and, you know, she closed the door for a little while and then later, a few minutes later, she opened it up, she said I have patient rights, this is my father and he didn't say a word, you know, but, uh, I have no repour with him at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you should get a doctor that you like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but more importantly, you've got to let these guys keep an eye on your system, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the diabetic doctor, what does he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, he keeps your blood sugar in control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That helps us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your cardiologist should be in charge of the heart and your potential for stroke and I'm in charge of your brain and every other way, okay, so let's fix your brain.  We got, huh, so on 80 of Lexapro, we haven't closed the deal.  Is this week better than last week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you say, on how much of Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean 40 of Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I was thinking 80 of Celexa, 40 of Lexapro; we haven't closed the deal on this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My focus came back a week ago Friday, like I told you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So after 1 week on the higher dose—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got better focus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the focus came back, the focus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you say your mood is equally low this week as it was 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your trajectory may be off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're getting better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's better, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because there's a delayed response to every dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the delay could be 4 to 6 weeks, so now you're still on 1 of the Wellbutrin, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And by the way, that's also at a, you know, I need a new prescription for that also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'd like to, I think the Lexapro is going to do it for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But why be on a 1/2 a dose of Wellbutrin, let's go back to your old full dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 400 Wellbutrin, 40 of, uh, Lexapro and that should close it for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it doesn't, I'll either have to trade it, trade the Lexapro for something else—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or add something to the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, gotcha.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully, we won't have to do that.  I think we're going to do it with just this treatment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so, uh, and you're not suicidal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you know, we have a little room to maneuver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, with that no appetite, which is really, my taste buds are, food don't even taste good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that normal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this week is not, yeah, tasteless.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is this week any better than last week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As far as appetite?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I have to eat which is good because I'm, because, you have to eat otherwise my blood sugar will go all the way down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you should always have a candy with you or, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There you go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Juice or, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Orange juice in the refrigerator, lifesavers and I have some of those pills in the car, you know, you know, sugar pills, whatever the hell they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see you in 1 month because if this doesn't do it, if you're all better, you can cancel the appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if this doesn't do it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we're saying the only thing we're going to do now is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Raise the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, let me write out prescriptions for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So yeah, well you, I'm actually going to need 3 of them, Lexapro, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, Lexapro, Wellbutrin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I would like to get some fresh Xanax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I have it but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's fine but I'd get some fresh still.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have mail away, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you do but do they take Xanax, usually they don't take Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't?  I don't know, yeah, they've taken Xanax, [DEIDENTIFIED] yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They do, okay, a 3 month supply?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], I'm surprised too, huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, now there's a different type of medicine called Ativan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That works much quicker if you're having a panic attack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, for panic attack?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought it was for sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's right, we have to put you to sleep also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ativan is not for sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ambien you're thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't we switch you over?  Do you still have some Xanax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so hold on to those, let me switch you over to Ativan.  The reason I'd like to put you on Ativan is for 2 reasons, one, and I want to put you on it every night to, what's the reason you can't fall asleep, are you anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't give you an answer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it anxiety or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you take Xanax, can you fall asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You tried?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I haven't tried enough, I've only taken 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One of the 0.5?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think I should take—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll need a lot more than that to get to sleep, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I only took 4 pills to break the panic so should I take 2 of the Xanax, that would be 0.1, I mean to try to fall asleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's use Ativan instead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ativan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the reason I choose Ativan is because it's the most fat soluble so if you let it, uh, dissolve under your tongue, it works immediately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For panic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For panic, so it's the perfect medicine for panic.  The difference with Xanax is it lasts a little longer.  Xanax lasts about 6 hours, Ativan lasts about 8, so it'll help you get a good solid nights' sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You want me to take that every night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take it every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One or two of them.  I'm going to write for the 1 mg, not the 0.5.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll be a bigger dose and I want it in your pocket all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, the Ativan and the Xanax?  No, no more Xanax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you don't need the Xanax anymore.  Ativan works just as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you want me to take 1 or 2?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One or two every night for sleep, okay, or 11/2—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or even 1/2, just play with it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Till you get it right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some people take Xanax and, I guess, right away huh, some people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well you don't take enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and that saves us from having to give you Ambien or something else.  So if we needed something else—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ambien is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the one that knocks you out.  Have you used Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the other one we're talking about now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but I'm not giving you that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is that for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's if we really had to knock you out for sleep but here we're using Ativan for the panic and the sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so I should write 3 month supplies for everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Actually, for the Ativan, I'm only writing, I'm only allowed to write a 1 month supply but I'm writing that you take 3 a day, so that'll be enough, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're not allowed to write it, you're only allowed to write—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a [DEIDENTIFIED] doc on this prescription can only write a 1 month supply of benzodiazepines, of that class of medicine.</p>

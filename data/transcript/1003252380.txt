<p>This series of six transcripts features a couple, Dennis and Renee.  The following is the last of the six sessions.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, Renee and Dennis, as you know this is our last session, and being our last session, I'm real curious about your thought about this experience. Also I'd like to just check in and just see how things are for you now. We haven't seen each other in a while. But I'd also just - maybe take some time and review the six meetings we've had, and see what you've got out of it. What feels good or not so good about it and so I'll let either of you start wherever you'd like.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Been a couple months. Right off the bat Renee?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'll wait for you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I - I don't - I enjoyed coming here. It's been a good experience for me to learn how to talk back and forth and understand parts and separating my parts and it's something that's kind of hard for me to work on. But just coming here understanding that and learning how to talk to each other through our sessions has helped me. I still have a lot to learn and as far as speaking skills and thinking before I talk and separating my parts and - But it does help and I'm working on it slowly, so. It's been pretty good for me but I still have a lot - long way to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What about you, Renee?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think more difficult than I expected it to be. I think - I think I was really pretty much in a state of shock when I agreed to come and do this. And then knowing that this will be used on tape. That's difficult to know that a lot of what's happened to us is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's going to be exposed to me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that part is hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think I learned a lot but I'd say overall it was more difficult than I expected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That aspect of it or what - what in particular felt difficult.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The exposure aspect and I think just knowing that it's going to be a limited basis and - and trying to fine - I was ambivalent a lot of the time about being here. And for me, I think that that's more unusual, because I'm usually the one that's the first to call to get help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So for me that was a little bit harder. Interesting way in which to look at ourselves, the different parts. That was really good, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's been good about that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just a different approach in being able to separate things out. Separate my feelings out and I - I've actually done a lot of work outside of here. I'm using that kind of model and have been able to actually come up with quite a few cast of characters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that's been real interesting as well as painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it okay if I ask a little more about that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Given what you said about exposure I don't want you to talk about things you're uncomfortable with, but.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, it'll be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So in addition to the parts that came up in here and that we worked with, you've been able to find some others on your own?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well in therapy, I have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Okay, good. Good. And you do some on your own too, or it's mainly in sessions?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I think it kind of - I can elaborate on my own, if I get in touch with different parts, which we - Dennis you were there for that one session.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Getting in touch with the little girl.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I actually have a couple little girls, and I've been in touch with some of the other ones, but this one in particular one, Dennis was able to watch the process of how I connected and because I am very visual, it's even kind of a fun experience, even though it's a - because it was such a vulnerable part, was painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was - was that with Zuess (ph) or with -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. That was with Seese. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay, because you hadn't done much parts work with Seese before, is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, hmm-mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you've started to do more of that through this?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like to do that and be that vulnerable with Dennis present?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that the vulnerable part - I'm - Dennis did really well. He did really well I mean he was - you were real supportive and - but following the vulnerability then came like all the other parts to protect me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And so those came out and then it was a difficult time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: During the session or in ensuing weeks?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, later. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Later, and then - and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me try and get a little bit of a chronology is the word I'm thinking of for that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when - how long ago was it that you did the work with that young child part?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm thinking it's only been two weeks, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two weeks, okay. And it seemed to go fine during the session. But then afterwards -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your protective parts started to come after Dennis more?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think. I mean I recognize that the protective parts, the protective parts' always there, and they've been actually a part of my artwork for a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So they were just kind of like, visually, they kind of lined up. There's the little girl, and then the - and Seese helped me find or bring her out and I - and I became available as the mother figure for her in my present age. And then I had these three warriors lined up and last week I got in touch with a part that comes out but I never had like a name for it or - I can visualize it. I've talked to the boys about that part. Because that part can come out - it's like a jet-fueled part and if it's triggered in a wrong way the energies can be negative. I mean it's a good part, because it's so dynamic, it's the kind that I use when I do a seminar or when I do any big project.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But if it's tapped into negatively it's - it's really hard to handle, and it's real hard for you to handle and hard for the boys. It's even harder for me to handle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. Hard in the sense that it gets so enraged or - what - how - okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. Right. And so it's scary for my children to see, it's scary for Dennis to see, it's - and it's uncomfortable for me. And it's - the part doesn't go away till like the fuel's used up kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so until it runs itself out, almost.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And so that happened after you were vulnerable with Dennis?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. But I think actually - and I don't know - we didn't really actually talk about the part because the session with Seese was very difficult and it was - .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Last what do you mean?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: WE had the last one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So that part was there for the session?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, so it was really difficult to even be in the session, it was difficult for Dennis and I'm sure for Seese.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Is that a possibility to have a part like that step back? When it's so enraged?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I wasn't able to do it last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't ask you to though. I mean.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. Well, I don't know. I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Seese probably asked to. Did she or not?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that she might have asked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard when they take over totally.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because usually it's later, you say, after they've kind of spent their fuel.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She just wanted to know if we wanted to go home.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well no, I actually had put my coat on at one point, so.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, we were - it was - it was something. We weren't sure we were ready for a session the way it was going, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well sometimes that's the best time to come in.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I've heard it is. I wasn't really comfortable, and it stayed a long time. I don't think we really kind of reconciled till -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Next day.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not for me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No? I don't remember.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'd say like maybe Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sunday.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: For me. Yeah, I was really kind of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was three days or -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean not really enraged that whole time, but I wasn't gonna make -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yesterday. Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Wasn't making any real steps toward you. But I did.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But what can I do to help - help you in a situation like that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, the part that triggered it I think is the part when it got triggered was when you said the boys looked fine. We were talking about our children. So that was difficult for me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I think part of that part - the part of me that came out was the real protective part and I was real angry with you for not being able to look at what could be the - what could be the issue for them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Dennis would like to be able to do something when that part takes over. You have any thoughts on that then?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Leave.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, gosh. Sometimes you're doing the right thing. I mean lately, some of the time you're saying, it'll - it's gonna be okay, and you know, not - I'm - I'm trying to think of what you could have done that night.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: At Seese's?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure. I just don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I couldn't seem to get real close to you at all to comfort you or nothing. So it was kinda - kinda tense for you. And me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like for you, Dennis, to be sort of powerless in the face of that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I was very very - what's the word? I was helpless. I just wanted to do something to comfort her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I couldn't do much. Couldn't do much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Couldn't say much, couldn't - you know, put my arm around her or nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think we both felt - I mean we both said the word hopeless that night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That it felt hopeless, that you know, there just wasn't going to be any change and - .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Okay. So it almost made you feel like you were back where you started and -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And that - that certainly happens on this road, doesn't it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how did you - it burnt itself out, sort of and you kind of snapped back, and?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I spent a lot of time -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Several days, huh?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was a long - it, yeah, it's felt long for me. I felt really depressed there were - where I had thoughts of self destruction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And - and I hadn't felt that in a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I think it was - I had heard - I mean it just really snowballed for me, I had heard Seese say you know, can you show your vulnerable part to me and you were - you had said no, I can't show my vulnerable part so I felt again blamed, and that's a big thing. A recurring theme in this scenario.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Where how come I can be vulnerable - how come I have to be vulnerable first and then you can be vulnerable? Why can't it work the other way around?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it makes it for me I feel like I'm stuck if I'm not in a good mood, or if I'm not nice, if I'm - if I'm angry, then you aren't gonna be open to me, and you're not gonna be sharing with me. And so I feel like oh! Well see, then I'm to blame for what's happened and that's really hard. It's a difficult place. And if I have to keep - and if I feel like I have to keep the anger squelched, or it being that real, then I get - then it turns into me, and I feel depressed and I feel -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it's almost - I don't know what to do either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I felt helpless, yeah, okay. So I'm still curious about how it shifted though. At what point? What happened?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think - well I worked with my own therapist on that - the energy and - and gave it a name and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you got a little separation from it that way?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. And actually it's - it's a cartoon character.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's like - it's Cruella DeVille, except that she's in the form of like Aladdin in the genie bottle. And so when she comes out she's just huge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's not about to go back in.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So. So you know, that - that helped a little. But it - it just took time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Was it different from the angry parts that have been in here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It seemed way bigger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seemed way - way more. Okay. So it may be a different one.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Way bigger. I think maybe some of the warrior or something in -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tear?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But not I don't think -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cruella hasn't been here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Cruella - although she walked in one night. But that kinda - I was able to kinda -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sat on her then.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, literally. I know. It didn't happen very often, I don't think. So I haven't really had a chance to share that part with you. I shared it with the boys, but it was fun, actually because Max, the little guy, nine years old, he got it right away. He understood. It's like you know, when I - when we agree that you're gonna do chores and you know how to do the chore, and - and if I ask you if you have done them and you haven't done them, who comes out is Cruella, after a couple of times. And then I can't - I can't - and he was like, yeah, wow. And you know how scary she is, and so he understood that a lot and Evan kinda like really? But he got it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's nice you could tell them about it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I was encouraged to tell the boys about it. Because I feel badly when that part of me comes out. Because I can tell that the kids get afraid you know, just to hear how enraged I can be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And most people with your history have a part like that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, that's interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, almost everybody. For many of those - many of those people, that part almost never comes out and they're terrified of it, and everybody's - and they keep it really locked up but I work a lot with people who've been abused, and when we get to it, it's very, very powerful.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is. It's extreme. I mean when I look at like inside, I can see everybody lined up. The little girl, the mother, the three warriors - and the warriors are you know, they're suited out in helmets and they - they have weapons, but Cruella's like huge. She's like three or four times the size of everybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean she just takes up this whole scenario.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't realize that a lot of abused people have that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is a scary part. It's really a scary part.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: A lot of abused people have what? That - that part of them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The Cruella part.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's really extreme. Real overpowering part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just total rage. And it's determined to never let anything like that ever happen again, you know, it's gonna do whatever it takes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, and I think for me what happened that - the night that you said, oh, the kids look fine. You know, it could be - you know, it's their age and this and this. It's triggered - I know the part about not being seen - not being told the truth when I was a kid -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: - of saying everything looks fine, so let's not do anything about it, you know, and that's my mother's way of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coping.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Of being, you know, we all looked fine and dressed fine and so everything is fine. And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when Dennis does a denial or minimizing or -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That just really - and about my children I recognize that I am really extremely fierce about protecting them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Protecting the kids. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And so that I think is part of - and - and I learned that over the next couple of days, and not working in therapy but recognized it myself that that - even more so that that protective part, that's what came out. And so I felt like I couldn't reach you, I couldn't hear you and I felt - I have to protect the kids, and whether you see it or you don't see it. I'm not gonna wait for you to see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense. Yeah. The good news is as you work with the parts that Cruella protects, she'll be able to relax. So it won't be like this -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: All the time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the time, yeah. As - as you feel less vulnerable, then she doesn't have to keep doing this. And she can actually totally change and you said that there's a kind of good and bad side to her -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And usually they'll just change into that good side.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well that'll be a relief.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, there's a good side of Cruella, too?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, the good side of Cruella is she's got this tremendous amount of energy. She's the one who puts - you know, all the things that I'm able to do, she's the fuel behind the things that I can do.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So she's the director, she's - you know, get the work done, get everything taken of.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mmm -  so she's a big part of your life right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: She always has been a big part of - I mean, that's - she's the survival, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. She got you through it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Ahh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. She's the one that - when it's - when I'm really, I'm totally exhausted, and I'd rather just like lay down and forget about it, she's the one that kicks in and okay, this is what's gonna be happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotta do it. Get going. Yep, that's right. Yeah. So what - when you see that - we've talked a little bit about your experience when you see that part. You said when you talked to the kids about it it kinda felt good to let them know that you don't like it either. And are you saying the same thing to Dennis now, or did you have a chance to?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I - I don't think I really had a chance to and - and I - I really am uncomfortable with that part and I know that you're uncomfortable. I think the - I think what would be helpful is for you to say that I see that you're really angry but when you try to like clamp down on me it just make it - I mean she just gets bigger. I just feel more -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Enraged.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. So I don't know if you could feel comfortable enough just to say okay, I see that you're - you're angry and maybe we can talk another time or - but sometimes the comments that you make to me are - because you don't have that part. You don't lose like what appears to be is losing control. You kind of - I feel like you put me down, you know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: With a comment or something?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that possible?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I - I get to the point where I get upset with Cruella kicking the shit out of me so I you know, I have a hard time coping with that part of her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. That makes sense.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So while I definitely have to work on holding it in and just knowing what's going on and being able to reassure her that we'll get through it or just let her know that I'll be there for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's all I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes it does help if you know it's just a part. You know, it's not Renee, it's not who she really totally is. It helps you not to overreact too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah, that's something I think I could work on to where I could ease that situation when it comes up next time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You do sometimes now are a buffer between the kids and I. Like when it's - like when we do papers in the morning you've done a lot to do that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I step - yeah, I stepped in sometimes where -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm, you've stepped in to kinda -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Where it gets a little hectic and we just like - things start escalating, and I'll just like get in there and just say, you know what? We'll get through it. Everything's going good and everything will be fine, whatever, I just like kinda step in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Take over and bring things back down to a calm level.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's been helpful to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It has been, I mean there have been many more mornings that are - because - because it's difficult to be up that early and get everybody organized and do papers and -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Church right away and stuff, and it's like pretty -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's very hectic.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Things got to move along pretty quick to - to get to the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've talked about your parts a little, Renee. The parts we've focused on on Dennis have been the kind of confused part, the minimizing ones, and we've talked about your having some kind of pain in there or shame as well. We never really got there, very much, I don't think.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has he been able to maintain his ability to - to listen in a different way, would you say or has that kind of come and gone?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'd say it's - his ability to listen has been better overall. I mean there are times where it - it's difficult. But our - our conversations even both of us were complimentary over the weekend and we had some you know, tough discussions but they were good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And different than we've ever been able to talk about it. Some things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what in particular was he doing that was different that you could tell?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think just being more willing to look at different parts and being more accepting - a little more accepting of a difference of opinion and a difference of feelings. And I think that's especially because it was about his family. His parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. So -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So - so that's different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He used to be more defensive about them -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And didn't like the fact that you were upset at them, is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now he's more open to hear what your experience of them is like.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And actually there's some - been some humor, too, I mean, we talk a lot about you know, the - what's defensive and - and really, you can talk a lot more about it than you ever could before. Usually a wall would come down and that would be the end of the conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So you really kept the communication open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it hard to do that or were you consciously trying to do it, or what was that like for you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It - it's hard to do, but I recognize more about my past and upbringing and how things were growing up in my family so as we talk about this, I'm able to recognize it better and understand a little better and I'm not so defensive and angry about some of those things. And so I've just been understanding things better, talking to Renee more. So it's - it's been good, you know. I'm basically, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you saying that before you hadn't really looked at what things were really like in your family?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And somehow you've been doing more of that lately.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, yeah, I've just been able to recognize more of - of the situations that occurred in my family growing up and how I kinda - what's the word? Pushed - pushed things aside and not really realized how bad things were as I was growing up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So I'm able to look back and realize a lot of the problems with my family growing up and I'm slowly understanding them. My family. As - as we talk so it's - it's good. You know, it helps us and together as well as with our boys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So actually Renee's talking to you about it, not only is it good for you to be able to ventilate your feelings about it, but it's good for you to get more perspective on what it was really like for you growing up.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well that's nice to hear. Because for me, Dennis, that's what I would really encourage you to continue doing. I do think that we didn't go there much in here, but I think that - you've talked about them, and there is some pain in there that it would really be good to clean out. And I - I think it does take - take another look at things that happened to you. So I really hope you get a chance to do that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How about the other way around? What have you noticed over the time that we've been working together in terms of shifts in Renee?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well that was really encouraging, thanks. None?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, you know, it just - things have been just like so up and down for a long time, so I mean I - I - it's still hard for me to - to go to therapy and stuff. I mean I know it's good and it - it does help but I mean it's just like - I don't know, I just - you know, and it shifts. I mean it's just like there's so - so many highs and lows on a weekly basis. It's just real - real tough, I don't know. I know that we're doing better overall as far as communicating and talking but you know, you know, we - we've had - our sessions here have helped. It - it all helps, I think it all you know, helps a little at a time and it's just a - gonna be a rough year, I think just getting through therapy and understanding each other better and learning how to deal with each other and with our own separate needs and - and just so I - I'm happy that we're on the right track at least, but it's going to be a long road.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But it sounds like the - the ups are okay but the downs -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really bug you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I wanna just like jump through the window.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't hear anything about any shift in my own. What you perceive me to have made.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well - well I don't know. I don't know how to put that into words right now. You know this - this affair thing keeps coming back to Renee and just like - it's just like that Cruella jumps out of that bottle man and it's pretty - you know, it's pretty - it's hard for me to deal with. You know, I just like - it really - I'm - I'm at a loss for words when that happens and just Renee gets so upset and volatile and there's nothing I can say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Okay. So I get that, that that's really hard when you see that part.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it seems like - I - it seems like it'll never go away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I - you know, granted, if someone's been in you know, whatever, four months, whatever, but it just like - oh, man, it's like really - it - it seems to me that something like that may never go away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I guess it probably never will in your - you know, in your mind, in your heart, or whatever, but it just - it's hard for me to hear that and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My feeling is sort of what I was telling Renee earlier. As she does more and more work on these parts that were so hurt, not just by the affair but also by what happened to her in her childhood, this Cruella part can relax more and you won't - it may not totally change to the - just the up energy, but it won't take over as long and it won't take over as fiercely. Over time, as you do that work, it may be around a lot, because you're getting close to the parts that were hurt, so it gets triggered real easily.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So sometimes the closer you get to those exiled parts, those parts that have all the pain, the more reactive it is for a period of time. But you do get to a point where it just really relaxes a lot. So in terms of what you're saying about feeling hopeless, I wouldn't agree with that as long as, you know, you continue working on yourself so that you continue to be more present in the relationship than you had been.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And that's what we've been talking about, just recently, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Me working with my - working on myself so that I can be more present and communicating with Renee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I think it would really be good if you could work with the part of you that gets so blown out by that part of her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because from what I just you know, asked you, this question about shifts, that part of you is really focused on that Cruella part of her. And it sounds like it has a tremendous impact inside of you. And if there's a way that you weren't quite as terrorized by that part, it would probably help a lot. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that would be one recommendation I would have. How would you say you've changed?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I - I'd say that in letting you in on more vulnerable parts. And - and really I see that letting you in on the vulnerable parts would trigger Cruella.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trigger Cruella. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Then the vulnerable part, the little girl, who you know, isn't lovable enough, isn't beautiful enough, isn't good enough, you know, that got - that's - she's been there since I was abused and the affair triggered that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And so I don't feel beautiful enough, good enough, and now I don't feel young enough on top of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So you know, so that to me makes Cruella being out there more makes so much sense because not only did I find her but I asked her to come out of the place that she's been in for -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know, forty years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I mean that's a long time, and that's a really scary thing to let you in on, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you talking about the little girl you asked to come out of where she'd been for forty years? Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So for you to be witnessing that work would make Cruella on guard that much more I would say.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that that is what happened is that she - because it was the very next week and - and - protecting my - our children is really so incredibly important to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Making sure that they have information, making sure that their feelings are validated, making sure that I'm not just saying that everything on the outside looks fine but I'm able to see the signals underneath, that's really -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Important.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Very important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and your children also become kind of symbolic of this -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This one too for her. So - so to put a little context on what happened the last couple weeks, I think is helpful. You know? Because I don't know that it'll have to be this way all along but as you do that very vulnerable work, there's gonna be - and I usually warn people about that. There's gonna be a little more - you'll be more prickly, you know, you'll be more protective and just to be aware of that. But it's temporary.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that the more willing you are to tell me that you're willing to work on yourself and to keep working on yourself and the more willing you are to look at your own parts like the denial and the minimizing, because those are the things that really trigger Cruella for me. You know, it's like, I get panicky, I think oh my God, you can't see this and I mean I know it's tied right into the sexual abuse, because my entire family was like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You know, and then I see your family being that way and it's like, oh, my gosh, he's never going to see it and the whole - your whole family is - is very much in denial and very much into minimizing. So it makes me feel like you know. And there's just so many triggers there for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Does that make any sense to you Dennis?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it does. It sure does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, my feeling is it's going to take a lot more work, but you've made some significant steps out of where you were. And out of the conditions that the affair came into your marriage in. But it's - it's important to see these as first steps and it's still a long haul. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Are you okay with that? I mean I - you get frustrated when - I mean you seem to be frustrated like if we have a setback or Cruella's out or I mean -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, you know, I understand that I need to realize what's going on at that point in time and just reassure you and tell myself inside that we're gonna - you know, we're going to get through it and I just need to deal with the situation at the time. You know, as far as Cruella coming out and stuff, so you know. As far as my minimizing and - and stuff like that, I - I have to consciously think about that too and when we're talking about whatever, the kids, whatever, you know, I do recognize and understand what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I would say about all this to you, Dennis, is as you guys do this, you're using this event, the affair, to really change in a profound way each of you individually and your relationship in a way that'll be much more rewarding to you eventually but it's hard work. Because it's forcing you to deal with stuff -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That you're not used to dealing with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not used to dealing with at all.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've - you've been socialized in your family to not deal with it and everything in your environment says don't do it, don't go there, don't deal with it. So it takes lots of courage to do this. It's not - particularly for someone like you who comes out of that environment, it takes a tremendous amount of courage to hang in there with it and then to hang in there with it when you see what seemed to be hopeless setbacks, you know, when Cruella comes out at you, when things like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So very honestly I've been quite impressed at how you've hung in there this far because of the parts that tend to dominate you and how open you've been to looking at them and getting the step back and we still see them coming back in every so often and - but I really, I want to give you a lot of - you know, praise for that, and just hope that you hang in there even though it's so against your nature.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not your nature, but your - you know, your socialization.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I'm trying. It's not easy, but I'm trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But I think as hard as it is there'll come a time where you'll be really glad that this - that you did that work.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you get glimpses of that now, I think from the sound of it, the times when you guys are talking to each other feel better than they used to feel.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, well, we've had conversations that we've never had before. You know, in both depth and meaning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you get tastes of that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can see what ultimately could be there. And just - if you hold onto that, then it'll be worth it. Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It does. I'm having a hard time with hearing that it's really hard for you to hang in there and I just feel that bland thing, you know?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Dick said that, not me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, no, you agreed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you - you said it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The two of you are talking about the same thing. And it's - it just - I feel really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well - well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look, look. Slow down. What were you saying to yourself about that? That you're forcing him to do this or?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. No, not that I'm forcing him to do it but that it's - I - I'm not sure I can put my finger on what it is. It's almost like - I'm almost I want to touch the spot where the little girl lives, and it's like - I'm not worth you working through this, and it's just so much work that it's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I get like I don't count.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I - I get that. You know, let me speak to that. Because the little conversation that I had with Dennis has nothing to do with her or you at all. It really totally has to do with the way he was raised and my experience with people that come out of that background and just how hard it is for them to do this kind of thing. But it has nothing to do with whether or not you're worth the price of trying. I don't know if this is helping or not.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It does help, it just - I feel frustrated because it's like how - why do I always like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel that way?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Why can't I separate that out? You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Separate - not taking it personally, you mean?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, she's very, very sensitive and it's understandable why she would be. But just occasionally times like that she just needs a little kind of comfort from you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense? Yeah. And as much as I have admiration for people from your background, and I do work a lot of work with abuse survivors, I have tremendous admiration for the courage it takes to do that kind of work too. Really. You're having to face things that you just would never want to look at again. Or experience again. And that takes tremendous courage. And it's also very emotional. It's very, very upsetting kind of work to do so it helps to know when you're getting closer to vulnerable things, so you know that there's gonna be a kind of a roller coaster for a while.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So. How you doing now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Good. I'm glad you could speak about her.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm - I think I recognized that the part that got me through working the recovery work was Cruella. And remember how many friends I lost, and how much family I lost, and I think that it was - she's the one that scared everybody. People were really - it had to take a strong person to be able to - to hang in there with me and to still be my friend and.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it does make sense. A lot of sense. I can see where its still real sensitive for a few of my friends or recently when they were saying, you know, gosh, remember when you were so angry? You were angry all the time, and you weren't vulnerable, you were angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it's difficult for me to see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I think that underneath I always knew that it was vulnerable, it just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't realize that those parts didn't come out so that must mean that those parts didn't come out a lot for you either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's pry right and it's really nice to hear that Cruella and the other protectors now feel safe enough to let you go to those parts. And it - you know, until you really get to those parts, it's so hard for them to not be on guard all the time, so. We're gonna need to stop in a little while, so just kind of any final reactions or thoughts about this stuff, the journey we've been on?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I'm glad you hung in there for me. I'm impressed.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I am too. I - thankful of you letting us come into these sessions. Like I said, it's been helpful in many ways that I haven't explained to you probably but to her. We're on the right track and - I know it's helped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels that way to me and I'm really grateful to the two of you especially given what you said at the beginning of the session about how hard it is to expose yourself this way and to - to know that this will be viewed by other people and what a sacrifice it is to do. I'm even that much more grateful to you. And if there's anything about that you'd like to say now or anything I could help you with, I'd be happy to with that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The one thing that's good I think is that it will help other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'll definitely do that. Yes, no doubt about it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's the saving grace.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, right, right. Okay. I guess that'll do it, and I wish you both great luck and you have a lot of help, you know? Seese is great and it sounds like your therapist is doing some kind of similar work too, with you. So good luck.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay Dick.</p>

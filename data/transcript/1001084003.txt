<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how have you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not too bad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. It's weird though, I think even with [INAUDIBLE] it seems like the Adderall that I still couldn't like keep a thought. [INAUDIBLE] I can't stay in one spot, yknow, I have to like do this and go do a little bit of that. And, uh, it's just so hard to stay in that one spot. I can't concentrate that long. I can't keep a thought in my head.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, do you get like intrusive like other thoughts that push it out of the way sometimes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I just can't like do it that long like if I was [INAUDIBLE]. I can do a little bit but then I have to go do something else or something.  Maybe just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, maybe.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Like even the bills, yknow, um, it's like I know I have to do them, but I just can't concentrate and do it, yknow. I wait 'til like late and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But sometimes you can are better than other times, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not for a while, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. That's my husband. He came in here to talk about how about we're two peas in a pod. And now just trying to stay organized. Well, I have a lot of health problems too, but, uh, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I said how'd it go? I was waiting for her to, um, did you say something about me.  When I was talking about her last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did she say that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no. When she come in the, she come in the kitchen I thought she was gonna say did you say something to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]? I said how'd it go? And she's like good. I'm like, I'm like, I didn't want to push it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she doesn't say much about what happens?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now do you get sometimes like, I don't know, seems like maybe you can function better, a little bit better at certain times, other times it's hard to do anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. A lot of it depends on my health too, how I'm feeling too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Physical?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or mental or both?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Both. Yeah. I'm going to have to start keeping like a chart or something like, yknow</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Each day is, Friday is always good. I don't know why. Fridays always feel okay and it's weird because I can spend like three days in bed and then do a little bit, yknow. I told you I was, um, trying to get over mono and then I have fibromyalgia too and just too many things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, um, all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think we changed that last time. Did we?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think we did, huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Meds?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I just got the script through the mail.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I think so. I don't think we changed medication. So what about, I mean, your whole thinking, besides the disorganization or the not being able to, yknow, finish things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A lot of anxiety it seems like. And the, what is it, the Xanax helps, and then I think if I can stay in my room I would. Even like if the phone rings, I just feel like ah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean, sometimes it seems like you probably could if you just stayed without anybody else. Actually [INAUDIBLE] for weeks. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then other times you wouldn't necessarily do better. Most of the time you probably would.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A lot of it is my health though with the mono, with the pain, I'm sure that has a lot to do with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you sometimes feel like when you're thinking that, I mean, you get distracted sometimes, you can't stay still, but other times like you kind of get derailed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can [INAUDIBLE] can't get moving.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Either 1.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty much can't get moving. I'm just so tired. It's like I can go out of the house a little bit, then I just wanna run back. I go outside the neighbors come out and I'm like running in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, do you ever like get thoughts about the neighbors, like they're thinking weird things about you or what would make you run in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're all nice. It's not that.  It's just I guess trying to keep a thought and I guess 'cause I never feel good and they're like, yknow, you never feel good and it's true, and it's just easier to run back in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then stay inside.  It seems like when I do stay in my room too, like I have to have the door closed. It's like a year and a half ago I had a tumor removed and it seemed like before they found out what it was I felt like this even more, like could not keep a thought, knowing like something is wrong with, I mean, a lot of it probably is the mono and the fibromyalgia [INAUDIBLE]. Uh, where was my thought going?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were saying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I'm touching what my point was of, I guess I'm just trying to think that was kinda how I felt before they found out that I had a tumor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where was the tumor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My neck, parathyroid. I keep on saying I'm gonna start a journal at night, but it's like I'm too tired to do it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My mom is like you should get out of bed, jump in the shower, and take a walk. It's like, mom, I can't even like change out of my pajamas.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, are you sleeping some with the Gabitril?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> More the Xanax it seems like.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> More what, the Xanax?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, like relaxed and like a lot going on or something that seems that, well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe it's both together, I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 'Cause I wondered about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it supposed to make you tired?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Gabitril? Yeah, well, if it works, it does. It makes you kinda less anxious, no worries, thoughts, and that'll get better generally. What about the.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't feel like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said, I don't feel like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good. I mean, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See I have those thoughts and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like I want to fall asleep so I don't think about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever been, you've never been on anything like Abilify or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about Gabitril and </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lamictal, Zoloft, Adderall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Abilify?  Did I try Abilify?  I've heard of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have no idea. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I didn't remember. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I mean, literally, I can't tell you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, oh, she's on 20, I know, it's like I don't know what I take.  No, I've never been on that.  I just remember the name, I mean </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wait, I'm on Lamictal</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. And that's the mood stabilizer, Gabitril, the Adderall.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You think with all these medicine I should be pretty normal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure how much the Zoloft's doing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been on that for a long time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. But this could maybe take the edge off of some of the worries and the.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Abilify. If we added that, some of the.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That would help.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some of the disorganized disruptive thought that goes on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a lot of that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. You could think about it. I could give you some samples to try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now when do I take that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Probably in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At the same time as?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Does it make you tired?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, not usually. If you're one of the few that it does, then take it at night. All right. So how tall are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 5'9".</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much do you weigh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You gonna weigh me if I tell you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, get on the scale.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll believe whatever you say.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, like 150, 155.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 155. Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. She was supposed to go to Pittsburgh yesterday but they canceled the flight. She didn't want to go. Her baby's up there. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She didn't want to go back.  So I dropped her off at the airport and she like slams the door like I'm sending her to a bad summer camp or something. I guess they canceled it. After I got back home then here she comes in the door. I'm like, and my husband's going like, what are you doing here? </p>

<p>DZR: Oh [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We thought we were going get a break for a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Let me get you to sign this. You don't have to sign this 1 for me. This 1 you just, yeah yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Initials and or sign it. Okay. Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And let's see what we're gonna do I think we'll start slowly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's, uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. So we're gonna start with this, what the heck was that? Two mg. Okay. We'll go a half for 4 days, then 1 for 3 days, [INAUDIBLE].  All right. So here's this. I have to go find the file. So what we'll do is we'll start you on a little bit. It'll say here 2 mg, a half in the morning for 4days, then 2 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So cut this 1 in half, so it'll be one mg?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, for 4 days. And then 2 mg, 1, in the morning for 3 days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then 5 mg, a half, in the morning for 5days. And 2 mg, 2 in the morning, for 1 day. That uses up that package. Then go back to the 5, 1 in the morning. So then that would give you half for 4 days. That would leave you with 5 for 5 days, 5, 6, 10, 17, then 10 mg, take 1 half every morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you know, thank you, like the [INAUDIBLE] this 1 makes Gabitril, like any vitamins or herbs you shouldn't, you know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not particularly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was gonna get this colon cleanse thing like it's a lot of different herbs, at the pharmacy or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. All right. Then what I'd like you to do is come back in like 3 weeks or a little over 3 weeks. Give this to [NAME OTHER]. [INAUDIBLE] go find the 5.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did you give me, oh, you did make a copy of that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

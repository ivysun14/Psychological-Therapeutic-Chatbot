<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Renee and Dennis, welcome back. And, I think like last time, I'll just start by checking in and seeing how the week was for you and reactions you had to our session. And, I think you had said you were feeling nervous. So, anything you guys want to say about any of that stuff.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. Not right now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Things have pretty much just been status quo or the same up and down, day by day. You know just ups and downs every day. But, more than that, things have been more positive and we've been having several okay conversations. And, enjoying each other's company at night, the little time we have. And there's been a problem or two. [0:01:18.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. That's the up and down was really accurate.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And we have tried to spend time together.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. And there's problems at night with the kids and stuff. And I try to step in and help out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Without her doing all the hard work with whatever's going on. So I try to help out and sometimes take over but just step in and bring things down to where they should be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've noticed him doing that and that's been helpful to you? [0:02:02.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. It has been helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And he's taking more responsibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So he does and being more involved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that feels good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well you mentioned ups and downs. And, you haven't said anything about the downs yet. Is that something we should talk about or it's just the routine ups and downs?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well the last time was just two nights ago. Right, two nights ago?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Where I have a part of me that's a minimizer part of me. And, I ended up scheduling an appointment with Seese (sp?) a week ago yesterday. And with my partners at work, she only had 9:15 appointments or in the morning. And (inaudible at 0:03:02.3) drive all the way back and it's like it's hard for me to do that. And my one partner just didn't like me really doing that. I said well, I'll have appointments at 5:15 p.m. from now on. [0:03:13.9]</p>

<p>Well, I told Seese that I think I would pass on going yesterday. And I told her hey, that the night before. And instead of telling her before I actually cancelled my appointment, I really blew it there. And Renee felt that I really needed to be not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the appointment?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. So I called Seese at 9:30 and left him - or 8:30 and left a message. Called her at 9:15, left a message, never heard from her. She called real early in the morning the next day and walked out. And I was able to go and so that really brought us back together. Because she felt that I was minimizing that I didn't have to go there and our life's in a crisis in a way. And I felt that well we're coming here the next night so. [0:04:08.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So, you know minimizing. I'm good at that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you kind of agree with Renee that that's what you were doing?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Minimizing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, and that's something you'd rather change?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Wouldn't hurt in some instances. Right honey?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. It would be helpful. And actually it wasn't me that came up with the minimizing but okay. It's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well Renee, I don't have a sense of where you are tonight. I remember last time you were really angry when you came in. And you're quiet to the point where I'm not sure. [0:05:01.0]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Not as much anger this week but a lot of grief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Grief. Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Dealing a lot with that and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Grief. Grief over the relationship or about other things?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think - well actually it's two-fold. It is about the relationship and it goes further back. It kind of triggers grief about the child sexual abuse too. That's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's come up for you this week?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More than it had in a little while?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well actually when this came up, it does feel very much the same way and the trust and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So the betrayal of this event sort of -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pulled all those back up for you - all those memories.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And it happened once again more this week.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, more this week. I had an opportunity to have a body massage and that triggered a lot. It triggered some drawings and it triggered a lot of feelings. We did an outing with some friends of ours. And it's the first that we'd been out together with friends since the disclosure. And that was difficult. And also I was at his parents' home and that was difficult. [0:06:18.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was (inaudible at 0:06:19.0)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There was a lot of - there's a lot of -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Tension.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Tension. Well but it's the - I have private grief but I have a public face. And that - those are hard to reconcile for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. So when you have to go into situations where you can't be real, it's very hard on those parts of you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. Incredibly hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I feel real worn out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. And so there was more of that this week than there had been in the past.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I get that. Okay. So, do you think that because there was less anger, it allowed for more grief or do you think it was related at all? [0:07:02.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well that could be. I felt actually after our last session that the anger was helping me to protect my vulnerable part actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because we had some intimate times together be - prior to the anger. And I felt like the anger was indirect proportion to how -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To having been vulnerable?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I think that, for me, was a protective mechanism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was a kind of backlash to having opened up to Dennis early.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, to push him away.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right? Okay. Well it makes sense. Okay. Okay. So, do you guys have a sense of what you'd like to do with the session tonight? I know last time we had talked about working with some of your parts like the part that had got you to have the affair. And, we had talked also about some worthlessness I think or some shame in there? [0:08:13.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, so that certainly is still a possibility or if you wanted to - wanted some help with your grief; that would be possible too. So, or we could work on getting to talk to each other from yourself, from your heart more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'd like to do that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay. I'm open to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good. All right, so what would you like to talk about? Is there an issue that we could work on or -?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Something from the heart up. Well gosh; nothing really pops into my head right off hand. [0:09:09.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How about you Renee?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm kind of just open to what's - I don't really have a direction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well I'll throw out some possibilities. Just see what you think. And we could have you talk about some of the different parts and maybe even talk some more about your grief and see if that Dennis could be present as you talk about it for you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, about the grief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Or we could switch it and maybe have you talk some about the - was it worthlessness that we worked with last time or shame or what was it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think it was both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was both. Some of that; you could talk some about that. Where you think it might come from and have Renee be present for you while you talk about that. Or we could take something that you fight about and try and work on it. So it's any of those possibilities. [0:10:08.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What do you think?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well one of the things that we talked about last week was the fear - Dennis' fear and the fear of fear and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I would be interested in hearing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hearing more from him about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The fear of what? My fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Your fear. I think you talked about a fear of losing Renee. Wasn't that -?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well yeah, there was. But there was like a whole set of where you felt the fear and then there was fear of the fear because you felt like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You were going to be overwhelmed by the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. How would you feel about talking to her about that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Confused with not knowing where to start or what to say. [0:11:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I remember that came up last time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it seems like this confusion comes in a lot of the time when you try to think about your feelings.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it sure does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It sure does. I'm getting better at it but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Very slow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. But it's a very quick, immediate reaction. I remember last time too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Me coming up with the fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No the confusion.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh. The confusion. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That the minute we talk about maybe doing something in comes - I mean you're basically say I'm confused.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay. You know it might be easier if we did a little work with that confused part first so that you have a better sense of what's in here. And then you can communicate it better.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would that be for you? [0:12:00.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that okay with you if we do that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I know last time when we talked about going in and working with some of these parts that confused part came up and there was also - I remember a reaction of thinking this might be kind of goofy or strange or something like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Just something, it's hard to understand and accept.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hard to accept. Yeah. Okay. Are you feeling that also as I talk about doing some of this work right now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, so I want to start with the one, the part of you that feels that way that feels like this is hard to accept.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you focus on that thought or that voice or that feeling and see where you find it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you find it? [0:13:00.0]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just in me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No particular place?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:13:07.3) not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, but just focus on it and sort of zoom your attention in on it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, ask that part of you what's afraid of happening if we continue with this? See what it says.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It would be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's willing to step back and not -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Interfere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interfere.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, now let's focus on the one that makes you confused.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you find that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got a beat on it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And ask it the same question. See if it's willing to step back also.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep. [0:13:59.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Great. All right. All right so with these two parts stepped back, should we check in with the fear or do you want to go to the - some of the others we mentioned like the one from who wanted to have the affair or the part that carries that worthlessness or -?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The fear would be - we could try the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So we've asked the confused to step back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever you want to call that - the other guy. It's kind of a skeptic or something.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With those two parts back for now -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They can watch. Let's focus on the fear then.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Focus on it. Can you find it again?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I can find it if I can focus on something I'm scared of. [0:15:05.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want to focus on losing Renee again?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: There you go. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Where do you find your fear this time in your body - around your body?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My heart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So let's focus right there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And tell me how you feel toward that fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel scared - still scared of the fear. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So it's still scared, yeah, of what could happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So you're feeling its feelings. You're feeling the fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Feeling the fear. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:16:00.6]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how do you feel toward the fear?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How do I feel toward the fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sometimes I feel that I might not be in control of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you're a little afraid of it taking over.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And getting you out of control.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And what might happen then? What might it look like if that happened?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What would what look like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you look like if the fear took over?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: To myself, what would I look like to myself?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I would - I would look - I don't know. What would I look like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you afraid would happen if the fear did take over then like you said? What would happen then? [0:17:03.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like I'd be out of control just like when - be real -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you couldn't function or -?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I couldn't function. Yeah. Maybe that's a good way to put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you couldn't function - work or you'd lie in bed or you'd -?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just - I would just - it would just affect my - affect me all around I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. Okay. If we could help that fear not be so afraid without it taking over, you'd be interested in that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right so focus on it again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this time really just try and zoom your attention on it exclusively.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: On the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And in your mind and I know there's a part of you that's going to say this sounds goofy or something. But just ask the fear not to overwhelm you. [0:18:02.0]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that we can get close to it without being in it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See if it'll agree to that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay. It will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And in your mind as you're doing this, can you tell how close you are to it now in terms of feet or inches?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not really. You know I feel it's just there with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Like next to you or a little bit of distance or you don't really have a sense of that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because I've asked it to step back you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, just the way it feels right now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It just feels like it's in me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's in you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's in your chest.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That's fine.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: In me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And how are you feeling toward it now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, not much different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still afraid of it? Afraid it's going to overwhelm you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That it can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So you're still afraid to get to know it? [0:18:59.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I'm not afraid to get to know it. It's just it's hard for me to understand it and look at it like we are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the part that says it's hard to do this or it's - it's come back?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're doing fine.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See if that part will step back. And the confused again, see if they'll trust us a little further with this.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Got it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How do you feel toward the fear now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel that maybe I can look at it a little better now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. Okay. So is it okay if we ask some questions; is that all right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So just focus on it again. Focus on your chest.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just ask what it wants to know about itself. See what comes to you. [0:20:02.5]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Ask the fear what myself wants to know about it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Ask the fear what it wants you to know about itself. So just focus on it in your chest and ask what it wants to tell you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What do you want to tell me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you don't have to say it out aloud. You can but you can just say it inside if you prefer.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It wants to be able to understand and deal with Dennis' self better. [0:21:09.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wants to deal with you better?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wants to. Okay. (inaudible at 0:21:15.6)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It wants to be able to work together with Dennis' self.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Usually I call yourself you if that's okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Me. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So it wants to work better with you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. There you go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How's that sound?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. That sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let's ask it - ask it a little more about its fear right now. What's it afraid of? See what it says to you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's afraid of all of the - it's afraid of the future and our relationship and figuring everything out. And Dennis being there for Renee and not making too many mistakes. [0:22:10.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So this is the part that's really afraid you're going to make a mistake.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Which I seem to do on a regular basis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it's a part that tries its best to keep you from making mistakes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is afraid of Renee's reaction to mistakes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you walk around in fear of certain parts of Renee.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. I just - it's usually after the fact. You know not - that's when the fear comes out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After those parts have been triggered already.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. After I've made a mistake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So some mistakes you're not even aware you made.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not until it's too late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Until it's too late. [0:23:02.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And then I do realize that oh geez, you know? So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, so now that you're in there a little bit, how would it be if you talked to Renee about what you're learning a little bit? And, Renee, you kind of listen and respond and I'll play coach. So that if I see parts of you jumping in, I'll blow the whistle and see if I can get them to step back. Is that okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So go ahead. Just tell her what you told me about what's going on there?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I sometimes am fearful of making mistakes when I'm not satisfying your needs. And, although I wanted to, I sometimes make mistakes. And I know that it's too late sometimes once I've made a mistake to change it. So, I'm scared of that sometimes. [0:24:16.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What kind of mistakes are you afraid that are too late?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh. Just being there for you and saying the right thing sometimes and, some of the holidays, stuff like that. Nothing particular just it seems like I make a lot of mistakes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And what's it like for you inside, Dennis, when you've made a mistake and Renee lets you know that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just tell her. [0:24:56.5]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It can be hurtful because you can sometimes come down on me. And, sometimes maybe rightfully so but it's hurtful when you really hammer me like you do.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And tell her a little bit more about the hurtful. What's it like in there? What kind of hurt?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, I just feel crushed and twisted inside when I know that I could have made such a difference by doing something so simple. And yet, you know for example with that sweetest (ph) day I just missed? I missed it by six hours. I gave her a card six hours late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:25:59.8]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And she threw it away. This doesn't matter. It's late. So that crushed me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I forgot it was Saturday and I gave it to her Sunday morning. So that hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And, so go ahead and react to what Dennis is saying there.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I feel more open to hearing about you making a mistake the way you're explaining it now than how it goes normally.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because normally the minimizer is telling me it's not that bad.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And so when I get disappointed and I express to you that I'm disappointed, I feel like I'm not real. I don't hammer you in the beginning. But the more that you - [0:27:04.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Minimize.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Minimize that then my anger comes out rather than how hurt I am.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see. How did I minimize giving you that card late?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well you said that you had it for a few days. That you were going to give it to me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But how is that minimizing?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: How is that minimizing? To me, it's negating that the importance of the holiday. It's just like well, it doesn't matter when it comes but I was thinking about you. Except that it doesn't let me know that you were thinking about me unless you do it. [0:27:59.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Unless it's on time?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I did do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that that part? Okay.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. That was it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Did you catch it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't catch much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So - no. No. So tell him.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I said that it mattered that it was on the holiday. And that it hurt my feelings when you didn't give it to me on the holiday. And you said but I did give it to you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Minimizing her.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like negates my feelings.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Minimizes my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense Dennis?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [0:28:50.6]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's really odd for me. It's because I am so much more verbal than you. I don't realize I guess that telling you that I - that you hurt my feelings - I'm kind of - I have a couple of different thoughts. If I tell you that my feelings are hurt, if you acknowledge them and say I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings that would - then I don't have a need to like hammer you and go on and on and on. I can hear that you acknowledge my feelings that they're hurt and that you made a mistake. And then, I feel like I can go on. But the minimizer for you comes out then it's like you didn't hear me so I'm going to say it louder.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And the more that you do that, the louder I get and -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The more frantic I get too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you get in a vicious circle because you see that part of Renee coming out and getting more frantic and more angry. And so you protect yourself more by minimizing more and defending yourself. Does that sound right? [0:30:03.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah really? Is this making sense to you guys?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. That minimizer has been a big part of me, I think, my whole life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's something I got to get a handle on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And realize when I'm doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Why don't we try this thing over the card again? Let's try it again for a second.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It really hurt my feelings when you didn't acknowledge sweetest (ph) day to me with a card or anything else. You just skipped it. My feelings were really hurt. I felt crushed.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well I really apologize for that. I blew it and that's all I can tell you. I'm sorry. [0:31:06.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I didn't mean to. I had the card. I just blew it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can understand how it would hurt?</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh boy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you understand that you did - that that did hurt her?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes. That's what I understand. I understand how that hurts her. That might not be something that would hurt me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I understand that would hurt Renee. Absolutely.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:31:50.4)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How's that work with you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That works okay. I mean I don't - you don't have to be like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The same as you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The same as me. Just that you accept that those are my feelings. [0:32:03.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, that wasn't so hard, right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Un-um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's really a matter of just keeping an eye on that minimizer or protective part and not having to jump in every time you think Renee's mad at you. Does that sound right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to try another topic?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I would like to compliment him -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Go ahead.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: On when the appointment came up and you started to minimize about it not being important to be there with Seese and - but you changed half way through the full scenario.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: By acknowledging that and calling her?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm. So thanks, that was really good thing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You're welcome.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was very different from -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The old Dennis? [0:33:00.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I want to say how much it's important for me to know about your feelings about the things that scare and the things that you fear. And, it's really important for me to understand that. And I can't do that unless you tell me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Got it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I can only guess. And I haven't been a very good guesser all these years. (Laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. No. I'll work on it. I have been working on it and I'll keep working on it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks. It makes a big difference.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the bit of disclosure that Dennis did earlier about feeling crushed by when you're angry like that; that was helpful to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is helpful to me because when you use a minimizer instead of saying that you feel crushed, I just get more hurt. [0:34:01.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it doesn't seem -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I think it doesn't matter to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem to bother him.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh I see.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. It doesn't matter to you. And it doesn't matter that my feelings were hurt or you just - it feels like you just keep denying my feelings. And that's really difficult for me. I just feel kind of trapped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like that minimizer was working overtime when the affair first came out.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't remember but Re says definitely.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You don't remember? But that's a really -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The minimizer (inaudible at 0:34:33.2)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that's a really frustrating for me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well I just I don't remember specific situations.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: When the affair first came out and you didn't disclose all of it. You didn't disclose the affair. And then you didn't disclose how often you called her and that. That's frustrating when you say that. It makes me angry that you - something that happened two months ago you say you can't remember. [0:35:00.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well I thought you were calling about when it was happening.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When what was happening?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The affair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I mean when it came out.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, when it came out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When it was discovered.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh. Yeah. No, I do remember. I'm sorry. I was thinking when it was happening a year ago or whatever. When it first came out, yeah, no, I was minimizing a lot of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No doubt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it makes sense to you that in addition to having had the affair, the cover up, it's sort of like Richard Nixon and the cover up of the tapes was worse than the actual incident. So does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So a lot of it is just - you know for these minimizers and I've got a part like that too so I'm very familiar with these parts. For these minimizers to trust it's safe to just be honest and to face the impact of your actions on somebody else, it's very hard. Because then you feel really guilty if you really accept that you hurt somebody or you can. [0:36:16.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they try to protect you from the guilt and they're also trying to protect you from the rage of the other person. Right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it really - but as Renee is telling you, you wind up getting a lot more rage because they do it. But these parts think they might kind of weasel their way through it somehow.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's about the best way to put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's the matter of realizing that being honest in the short term anger that you're going to face -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Is better off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a hell of a lot better than the weeks - [0:37:00.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And months of rage that you're looking at otherwise.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. You got that right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Now, generally when I have couples talk to each other, I discourage them from commenting on each other's parts. But I would be possibly willing to make an exception in this particular case when Renee sees that minimizer part if she were to mention or note or point it out to you in a kind way not in an angry way. Would you be willing to hear that or try to?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah really?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Well she does that anyway.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But Dick said in a kind way.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: In a kind way. Oh. That -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And would you be willing to do that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is on tape honey.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'll clean it up for this version. [0:38:02.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And, if you didn't face that minimizer all the time, what would life be like for you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh my gosh. It would be a lot more real I think. It's very difficult for me because I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to get through that. It's hard to break through that part.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Very hard. And I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Between the minimizer and the confusion and the skeptic, they keep him pretty felt up? You would agree?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But I think it's important for me to say that once we got those parts to step back, you did a really nice job of listening inside. And you had a lot to say to Renee.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean that makes me like really excited. Like gosh, there really is something in there and I thought there was all along. (Laughs) So I know it's been difficult for you but it really does make a difference to me. [0:39:11.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good. I'll keep working on it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Yeah. And when I said that about those parts protecting you, I want you to know that most men, myself included, get trained to be that way. And so it's really swimming upstream to try and change that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You got that right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's some really hard work. But it really works. It really is worth it. Not just for Renee and for your relationship but for you personally. It's just a better way to live.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And if you can do that, you'll feel more connected to Renee in general. And you won't have nearly the same impulse to have some affair or something like that. Does that make sense? [0:40:09.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What doesn't make sense about it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't know how that would -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How that connects?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just because we're closer and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Usually my experience is - we can go in and find out for you in particular but my experience is these parts that are looking for affairs or are interested in affairs - I don't know if you're looking for it but get interested in it are usually trying to get somebody to take of other parts of you that feel lonely or cut off or isolated -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And want some kind of connection and intimacy. And, if we, as men, walk around with all this protection around, we don't get much of that and if we're - especially if we're afraid of parts of our partners. Does that make sense? [0:41:05.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, if you're getting more connection because you're not so protective and you let Renee in, then you won't have these little desperately screaming parts that need somebody else.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's very frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Frustrating that that happened?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's frustrating that it happened and that I - I mean I wanted the connection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I'm not saying you didn't. I'm saying -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. I know. I know that you're not. And it's I just feel frustrated that that's how it worked. [0:41:56.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And it's really too bad that it worked and it was really hurtful to you. But it also presented an opportunity to crack Dennis open so that you can have that possibility. I mean the fact that it was found out presented that opportunity. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So ultimately there's a chance for this to really be a good thing. I mean not that what he did was good but the consequences for your relationship could be good depending on how things go. Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it makes sense. It's just really painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And it really makes me angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Do you feel like I appreciate how painful it was or not?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe not. I don't know. That's just - well there's part of me that's just screaming that this isn't fair. [0:43:04.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that there were other ways to do this and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No question about it Renee. And I'm not trying to justify what Dennis did. I really want you to hear that. I'm not trying to excuse it or minimize it or justify. And there were other ways to do it. Absolutely.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well maybe I should be speaking to you and not to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because I don't really have an issue I don't think with you but I do with you. I feel ripped open. And it's hard for me to hear that you were lonely and looking for someone else when here I am. I've been trying, turning summer saws, doing all sorts of things that never worked. And yet, you went to somebody else. So now I have all my skin peeled off and my body parts are strewn all over the place. And yet I'm asked to look at this as an opportunity for our relationship. It's really hard. [0:44:11.6]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sorry for your pain. I'm sure it's hard. That's why we're here. That's why I'm trying to connect with you and learn more about myself. Able to understand feelings and parts of myself so that we can grow together and be close, be connected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's he doing?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not really well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It just sort of sounds empty. [0:45:02.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sounds empty?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a minute Dennis. So, what I said the whole thing about him feeling lonely and triggered this real angry part of you it sounds like or not real angry but -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I would say -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This protective part of you that was here last time. Is that fair to say?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And I apologize for triggering it. But could you ask it just for a second to step back? Is it willing to step back and let you be here again?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How are you feeling now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So Dennis try that again what you just said.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well that's why I'm here and trying to understand myself. And get to know my parts better and be there for you and us. And, I want to make a difference. And I want to connection with you. [0:46:05.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how does that feel?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels better. Okay. All right, so we're going to have to stop because we're out of time. But, we can do this some more - this kind of thing of what - I'm just trying to keep you guys connected while you talk about these very difficult issues. And keep your parts from pulling you apart. Okay? So this is something we can do in future sessions. Does that sound okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good. Well good work tonight.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

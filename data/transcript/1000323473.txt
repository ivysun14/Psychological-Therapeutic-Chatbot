<p>PATIENT: (Silence) While I was coming up in the elevator I was very aware of feeling quite nervous again, which increased, the nervousness increased while I was waiting and I was thinking about why, whether it was the waiting that made me nervous or something about being here that made me nervous.  I don't know what I know (chuckle) why, but (clears throat) I had a funny reaction.  I met the woman who usually calls you and I don't know, it was almost like a friendly figure wasn't going to be there in the outer room where I wait.  I don't know whether that was part of it or not.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I was even thinking of how I might feel, uh, maybe in a year or something, when I no longer feel this nervousness and that was kind of my defense, while I felt nervous to think about how I'd be some day when I wasn't.  And I know I use that same defense lots of times.  I used to use it when I'd have to go to the doctor for a shot or something, and I'd think, oh, I'd choose an age like 15 and think to myself, well, when I'm 15 I won't want to cry anymore when I have a shot.  And I'd keep thinking of that rather than of what I was going to happen.  And I'd, I'd, probably a similar kind of approach is, uhm, this thought was struck by something I was reading in a book on how children's art changes and how when they're in the 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 year range they are so busy socializing and conforming to the peer group standards that they will for a while lose a certain desire to be individual and awareness of themselves and they will only try to really achieve in the areas that are accepted by the group and I used to always think how I'd love to be able to play the piano and if I could just do that then I'd be popular at parties and that I'd be relaxed at parties and I'd know what to do with myself so I'd just, I took piano lessons and I'd just keep, instead of thinking about now and practicing now and being happy with the actual experiences of playing the piano now, I'd think I must have thought a lot in terms of maybe someday I'll be good and then I can play at parties and everybody will want me to play.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So perhaps if your thoughts turned to the future it's because there's something in the present that you want to avoid.  What I notice, is that you, you mention that uh you felt you wouldn't have a friend when you came up today.   Do you feel the special need of a friend here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm waiting I guess I do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Before you see me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Were you aware of any reluctance any other way to see me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.  I was trying to think how I felt.  Some days I would, especially after a previous day of feeling good about what happened here I would be quite eager to come and I was trying to think then if I felt nervous waiting.  But I can't remember.  I don't remember feeling nervous but I don't remember that I didn't too.  And I didn't know too, whether it's because of those days that I've already spoken of when there were a lot of people around and I began to feel very uneasy.  Because some days when I've waited there's been practically nobody there.  And I think too well, she doesn't try to involve me in conversation at all and I like that.  And yet, somehow I feel that she's well, again (chuckle) feeling friendly toward me, and I need, I do need to feel that way.  And the fellow that's out there who calls you when she's not, no, (stammers) it isn't that he really tries to involve me in conversation but if there is one and I'm at looking at all in his direction he will include me which is probably very nice of him but somehow I want to be ignored.  I think if there were a corner I could sit in, (chuckle) that's what I'd do.</p>

<p>Something that came out of class last night, the professor was talking about space and uhm how it can change and change your feeling and he was using two cardboard pieces and forming different types of corners and I don't know, it just, he formed one that was fairly open but still there was, you were protected if you sat right in it but yet you could see out all around you and sort of observe and I just felt a great understanding of wanting to sit in a corner like he was describing the way children are.  And sort of the way I guess I like to spend a lot of my time if I really just did what I felt most comfortable doing.  (Pause) But going back to the question of or uhm, looking at it this way, now why I might need a friend.  I think I always look on things that way, that people are either feeling in a friendly way toward me or in an antig—, antagonistic way toward me.  I don't think I ever think of them as just being neutral toward me.  How did I think —</p>

<p>ANALYST: And to me?  Today, how did you feel about me?  Because it was you know, after all, coming here that brought on your feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.  (Pause) Unless I look at it, I don't know because I don't, I'm either repressing it so that I can't know, or else I think of your relationship to me more in terms of the fact that you are, well I was going to say the word making me, but seems kind of strong, but because you are here I am feeling forced to, out of duty or something, say things that I find very hard to say and very unpleasant to say and I don't know that I look at it as that you're antagonistic toward me but it doesn't make me relax.  And I suppose I still can't, I, I just can't accept that hearing the things you hear you don't have some reaction to them and since some of them I would judge very harshly I just I guess I think you must be too.  (Pause) It's funny, just thinking about being judged harshly, it makes me feel either very defensive or like crying.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It bugged me think of last night, and yesterday afternoon when I was meeting the parents.  They're always some who uhm, because they want to be sure their child is going to have the best teacher for every year, have to know how many years you've taught and what your background is and everything, and they're very doubtful if you aren't an old experienced teacher and so they'll start quizzing you on how long you've been there and what background you have and all.  I don't know, I just, some parents give you the feeling that they approve of you and like what you've been doing so far and, and might just be asking to make conversation.  And others give you the feeling that they already questioned what you are doing and are asking because they can't understand why you're teaching and then I get very defensive.  (Silence)</p>

<p>There's one mother that uhm, I just already have a rather antagonistic reaction to because she's been, every time I've seen her she's been kind of asking me again well how are you qualified to teach and she's about to be separated from her husband and, and I'm sure she's got an awful lot of problems, much more serious than any I've ever had, and she seems to find it very hard to talk to me anyway so I think probably she is sort of an odd person, but because she's annoyed me, my, I have to keep holding myself back from just being nasty to her and it's almost like I'm telling myself I'm superior and that I can treat her as an inferior thing.  And of course then the reaction of holding myself back than I pat myself on the back for being big and not being nasty to somebody that I could so easily be nasty to and the whole reaction is very unpleasant.  And I don't know quite why I don't like her.  Because I, I, guess that's it, I just don't like her.  And I'm sure part of it is because of her approach.  Every time I see her she asks me again how long I've been at LKC and wasn't I an assistant before I was a teacher, which usually makes me think that they are trying to tell me the know I haven't been a teacher there for all these years and that I better watch my step.</p>

<p>And then when she told me about the fact that her husband was going to be leaving the home soon she made it sound like there was really nothing, it was just this  great friendly separating and I can't really believe that and I wish that she'd just tell me nothing or tell me things honestly and so that annoys me.  And her attitude is that her son didn't know anything at first, when I'm sure he sensed an awful lot and then that he probably doesn't really know too much or understand too much and I'm sure she really is concerned about him but the feeling I get is that she really isn't or, and anyway I use the, the approach that I am the only one that can understand him then and I'm the only one who's sympathetic to him which I knew is a very bad attitude.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking back to this little passage I read about development of children's art and the change from sort of a spontaneous self-confidence in relating of oneself to one's environment and the whole openness and everything that younger children have and how it does get sort of lost for a while, maybe this is why I used to think I was so adventurous and happy and free.  Because I, I just went through from one stage to the other and but then something just happened, I never got out of the second part.  (Pause) And I was just wondering, if, if I had been happy, then although I'm sure that something in my family partially caused it, whether it might not have had a lot to do with the way my relationship with my own age group was going and I can't remember any of that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>The only part I could remember was that by 5th or 6th grade, I was bigger than most of the other girls and heavy enough so that I dreaded having the times when you'd have to be weighed because I was always about the heaviest girl and of course the boys then weren't that big so there was only one boy who was heavier than me and of course this was always known by everybody, how much I weigh and the fact that there was only one boy who weighed more.  Used to be very humiliating.  And the only way I could make myself feel good about that or sort of to negate the feeling I had about that was that I could run about as fast as that boy and he was about the fastest runner of all of the boys (chuckle).  I don't think anybody else cared.  But I have no memory of 2nd grade at all and in 3rd grade was in a mixture of 3rd and 4th and then I have absolutely no memory of 4th grade.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think by then I had met the other 2 girls and so the 4 girls, the 4 of us that were fairly close friends for quite a while had already begun to form sort of a small group and I don't even know how much I felt a need for friends outside of just that small little group.  And I think I used to be kind of jealous if the others had any friends outside of the little group.  And I've almost continued to be that way if, well, I have continued to be that way, if I'm friendly with somebody I want them to just when I'm with them in any case, be friendly with me only and including no other people and if I see them starting to branch out then I think well maybe I should be too more because they are then that I feel a need of it in myself.  (Pause) The feeling I have while I talk is just that I'm not really getting into whatever it is that —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes, that is the impression you give me.  Right uhm, uhm —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of go in and then I go off and come out again.  And I don't, I don't know what I'm trying to go in to get to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I had a similar kind of a feeling uh, part of the time uh, Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've had this feeling I think all week.  Maybe not on Tuesday, but that I'm sort of just catching at different things because I, I can't really seem to focus on anything that really leads anywhere.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not certain whether this has anything to do with it or not, but the idea occurs to me that Wednesday there were some times when one way or another you indicated that or it seemed to be true, that there was something you couldn't say to me or think of saying.  And then near the end you were talking about your older sister FYC and your feeling that she knew everything and then when you got up you mentioned, as you were leaving, that you wouldn't be in yesterday.  The thought that occurred to me was, had you thought of that during the hour and not wanted to say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I kept fighting with whether I should say it or not, because I knew that I'd said it once and so probably you were already aware of it, but then I kept thinking but what if you had forgotten or that I hadn't really said it clearly, then I should say it.  But then I'd feel stupid saying it again if I'd already made it clear because your reaction will be well why is she repeating herself.  And somehow anyway, I don't know, I just —</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you felt in conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And the result was you didn't say any of what those thoughts were then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, my only thought was no, I won't say it now.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't thinking out, you know, what I've just said —</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you did end up saying it at the end, then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because I was, I always repeat (chuckle) myself, when in doubt.  I don't know, I just felt sort of funny, starting out with well I won't be in tomorrow.  I don't know why I felt funny about it.  (Pause) But beyond Wednesday I've been sort of feeling this way anyway and some days uhm, now I've hit upon something that does lead somewhere and some days I come in just feeling I'm going to get somewhere and I have.  And it just seems a matter of luck if I do or I don't.  But I just seem to be always casting around and I guess I do kind of select from the thoughts I have and think well, some aren't really anything to talk about so then I don't say them.  And then I'll, one will occur to me that I, I'll think well, maybe this will go somewhere and I'll start talking about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you sort of pick and choose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) It's funny, just when you, you used the word pick and choose for some reason into my mind came this image of uhm 2 women today that I overheard talking and one was I, I imagine she was talking about her husband who had died and the fact that she'd carried out his last wishes and that anyway she'd been married to him for a long time and that seemed to justify a great deal, and just sort of a whole attitude of a duty done.  It really disturbed me.  (Pause) Now, I don't know whether it was because I thought she was being kind of ignorant in what she was saying and that it was an awfully stupid attitude or whether it was because it had some thing to do with duty of sort of this feeling that now a lot was owed to her because she'd spent quite a long time with a man, maybe I don't know, she didn't ever say anything about whether he was hard to live with or not, but just this attitude, well, I spent a lot of my life with him and carried out his wishes and I don't know, almost now I've earned my place in heaven if there is such a thing.  And the whole thing just was very annoying to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I always get very annoyed too when I hear mothers talking about how they've done so much for their children and then look how ungrateful they're being.  And I think part of that reaction is the fact that I have felt on occasion that I should feel more grateful to my parents than I am.  When I'm being, or when I used to be especially, particularly nasty to them, I would think I was being very ungrateful and I'm not sure they ever said anything.  But I had a very strong guilt feeling about it.  But yet, on the other hand, I think once I brought up that subject about parents making sacrifices for children, and my mother was very cross at that use of the words and said that what parents do they want to do and they're not sacrifices, and yet I don't know whether she really looks at it that way.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about how sometimes I've been curious to know or at least I was right at that moment how my other sisters and brother see my mother.  How they really see them, not maybe just what they'd say, but sort of how they felt her presence and everything and then it made me think of the fact that once in a while we've talked either I with my brother or I with my sister FNA, not so much with y, because she's much more sympathetic to them, but about uhm, my father and what kind of a person he is and how life used to be kind of hard under him and we've always agreed pretty much on our views of him.  But I wonder if we really do, or whether we, it's kind of a superficial thing that we get to.  And then I always feel guilty that we've talked about him.  Somehow it's kind of a cheap thing to be doing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, as though it hurts him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what good is it going to do to sort of pull him apart amongst ourselves and there's some kind of a perverse enjoyment in doing that.  (Pause) Just like I used to get or I do still of a perverse enjoyment out of the sort of feeling that my view that I am incompetent or stupid or whatever is being justified because of something that might happen to me.  And this thought is a very vague one, I don't know how to really express it, but when I use the word perverse enjoyment this other feeling that when I used to feel so unhappy that I think I had a sort of enjoyment in feeling unhappy.  And almost as if this view of myself were being justified.  The same with feeling that I wasn't popular and liked by very many people or whatever the feeling was I used to have.  That I knew that I was already ugly and unattractive to other people and had nothing to talk about.  It was almost as if I purposely didn't know about things that were being popularly talked about in my age group.</p>

<p>And I suppose not knowing those things too was an element of what I was saying about my mother the other time that she wouldn't even attempt to compete in a situation that she really wanted to do something in.  She was, seems, afraid to, like in just dressing, the way she might like to dress.  (Clears throat) Because probably more than anything I wanted to be able to talk about popular songs and clothes and that type of thing.  Maybe I was just afraid I wouldn't really say anything worthwhile so I didn't even want to try.  The other thing my mother once said that, we were talking just about teaching at this point and well, I think I was probably being kind of hard on some of the parents in what they had done with their children or their attitudes they had toward them and in a way I imagine I was that hard on them because I was beginning to see things in my own life and then I was feeling very critical toward my parents and she just made the comment that it was pretty tough on parents too and that you shouldn't really be so critical and then and then she said that, even—, and sometimes there was a child in the family that just her persona—, that personality of that child, she kept it very removed from us personally, but that some child might have a personality the parents didn't care for particularly, couldn't react well to.  And so immediately I jumped to thinking well who in our family did she feel that way about.  And I couldn't make up my mind whether it was me or FNA.  And sometimes I thought it was me because she definitely defers to my older sister and my brother.  She's got the feeling of a mother toward an only son and the young—, the youngest and then that left FNA being quite different from things she's always approved of, and yet my father's very fond of FNA, and he's always saying too, well, FNA said this, as if well, that's the end of that.  FNA said it so it must be right and then the feeling of her, if I'm talking in a conversation when there are other people, you know, both my parents sort of look at me as if well, why don't you keep quite now because there are other people to talk to.  But on the other hand sometimes I've had the feeling that she feels she says things about FNA that she does only because she wants to please my father and kind of sublimate any feelings she really has towards FNA.  So I've never been able to decide.</p>

<p>And another thing I find very annoying about my relationship now with my parents is that MSCZ and I are often staying with them either in n or t because we might be there simply to be there and uhm, so we end up staying with them.  Whereas FNA is in PYKK, and l, right now he's home, but he used to be at college and very rarely coming home for weekends.  And then FYC was very involved with her own life and so they always seemed to welcome us, welcome MSCZ and me with a lot of enthusiasm, but I kept thinking it was because none of the other children were around and so they're just glad to see a child and then I'd get annoyed at feeling that way.  Because I couldn't really believe it was for me they were feeling that way.</p>

<p>And I think one reason I've, well man—, it's probably many reasons, but one thing that comes to mind on why I might feel this way, is when I came back from PEC, well, several things happened about coming back that made me feel practically as unhappy about coming back to my family as I had felt when I left it.  And one was I had been told by letter right around the time I'd be coming back that there was a certain weekend I couldn't come back on because they were planning to go to t and I hadn't planned to come back that weekend, but it just hurt me to think that if I did decide that that was the weekend I was coming back, e—, even though I had been away for a whole year they really wanted to have this weekend in t and that was more important than my coming back and this is sort of an attitude my parents always have had.  We're doing these things and if it works into your plans fine, if it doesn't, fine, we don't really care.  And I know MSCZ has been kind of amazed at this attitude they can have sometimes.  And so then when I did come back finally, I think I even delayed my coming back to the very last minutes, I was coming back for FYC's wedding and I knew I was kind of annoying my mother not being back sooner and I think I got some satisfaction out of doing that.</p>

<p>But then when I did come back we were having a conversation and the whole family was together and they were just asking me who I'd be living with the next year at RZG and I was talking about the girl I'd be living with and then I began to voice certain uncertainties I had about living with her, as you would, I should think about anybody you'd never lived with and my mother went, "Oh, no, that again?"  And she just, you know, almost as if well, she's always complaining and there she goes again.  And it really just made me feel as furious toward her as I've never felt, and I, or just back to the mood I used to have when I'd always be so nasty to her.  And then that really made me feel disappointed because I'd hoped after being away a year, I felt so eager to see my family that maybe I could start over again and if I didn't get in the habit of being nasty then I wouldn't be.  And so what I did, is, I just, instead of being nasty back when she probably didn't even realize what she said, I just kind of withdrew.</p>

<p>And it's sort of the same pattern except that I used to withdraw after being really nasty first.  It's almost as if the fight went out of me and then gradually I began to feel more and more that I wanted to please them and I almost felt the year I was at RZG that instead of moving away from them, need—, needing them less, I was beginning to need them more than I ever had.  And I used to never want to go home for weekends unless I had no place else to go, and then I was just simply so I could have a place to go.  And I began to really want to go home on weekends from RZG and it just was a very puzzling reaction.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I know it all just adds up to the fact that I never felt that either of my parents really understood me or particularly cared to or appreciated me for me.  But somehow knowing that, still, that this is my attitude toward them whether or not it is true doesn't seem to help much.  Because I still care whether or not they do.  And I, I can see I still want their approval.  But yet I know now that the things that would win their approval aren't things that I am happy in doing or being myself.  So there's another conflict (chuckle) in me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Something else that's bothered me when we do see my parents is the way I react to e.  And it's, I get very cold toward him then and sort of moody to him, almost like I'm treating him as badly as everybody else is making me feel and it's not so bad now, because now he's relaxed in the situation and I don't feel I have to take care of him as I used to when I was first married to him and he didn't know my family very well.  But I wouldn't take care of him, I would kind of ignore him and then it would make me feel very badly that I was doing that.  But yet I didn't feel any warmth toward him at all, especially at the beginning.  Now I think I am beginning to sometimes, but —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 1325-017, interview number 4 on January 19th, Napolean, counselor, interview number 4.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been thinking about what you said last time about the idea of, you know, the focusing thing. And I think I understand why because it suddenly hit me that you could go through all those kind of problem solving behavior, but you never stop feeling the next minute (inaudible at 0:00:56.6) get used to feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say it again, if you go through all this problem solving behavior, what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you never stop feeling, though, I mean, you can solve a problem in retrospect or, you know, will it solve the problem? But, you know, the next minute there's a new experience, you know. And if, I guess, you know, if you learn to feel comfortable feeling intensely, then you would feel that somehow you can handle it. Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>0:01:23.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or if you can have those feelings, sometimes the things don't seem like problems anymore because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you allow yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if you allow yourself to have the feelings...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel differently (inaudible at 0:01:36.5) in your experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that has or not. Just, you know - I'm just feeling - really I'm not sure that that's (inaudible at 0:01:48.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, have you ever cried and felt better afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I used to when I was a little kid. But I just don't do that anymore. I get - you know, I just get tight inside. And maybe I'd feel better if I started, you know, burning down buildings or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, I don't know if I created that many kind of emotional outlets for myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of feel like maybe you've bottled up your emotions inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to keep it down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's true. Like, I really do kind of admire people who aren't controlling themselves. And I've always felt that I was extremely out of control, but, you know, that's why I was really surprised when people would look at me and say that they were - you know, they were surprised when I would express an emotion because they always thought I had everything, you know, fine, you know, magical (ph). And inside, you know, I was just a wreck. But I don't know, as long as we're on this thing about feelings, I probably - I should have talked about something last week and I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I was kind of afraid that you wouldn't respect me or that wasn't relevant or something, I don't know quite why I didn't. But, you know, it was a funny thing because, you know, I previously had all these very kind of romantic delusions about sexual relationships. You know, I really believed in love, I was very idealistic. And, you know, I had a really good talk with this guy that there had been this big hassle with, you know, the one who said...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The Chicago...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thing about pity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and, you know, so I went ahead and slept with him and everything. And, like, you know, I didn't feel badly at all about it. I didn't feel any guilt. I though it was a really good thing. And then the next day I started thinking, well, it might not have been such a good thing but I can manage this. And then by the next day after that, you know, I hadn't been prepared for it, but I really started missing him, you know, personally. And I just - I began to wonder what I was doing, you know, to myself, and I just - I got really, really panicked. I just - you know, it was just totally panicked, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the panic like? What was that feeling like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I had to keep moving, moving, moving. And I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had to get away from the panic you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, you know, I guess or just somehow get it resolved, you know. And I went up to the north side and saw these friends of mine. And I just - I talked just kind of briefly about the kind of problem with this girl because she's been through a lot, an incredible amount sexually. And, you know, she didn't really say anything but I really did feel better just the minute I talked about it, you know. And there was no - well, if you work out this way it will be okay. It was nothing like that. It was just a thing, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're talking about it.</p>

<p>0:05:08.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then, like, her baby kept kind of getting in the way and we finally never really talked about it all. You know, we just went out to dinner and talked about other things. And I was really okay when I got back. And, you know, but I'd never though ahead that I would feel that way, you know. I thought it was all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like kind of (inaudible at 0:05:29.8) you feel like what you wanted to do and it was okay. But I guess, you know, it raised and I don't know exactly what it raised, but it somehow raised kind of all sorts of wants that you want in a way or you'd been missing. You wanted to be with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I thought - yeah, I thought, well, I can really hack this because I'm not that involved with him. I really like him and respect him, and I feel close to him in certain ways, but I'm not in love with him like I was, you know, before. And all of a sudden I realized that it's just not that simple, you know, there are consequences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, what are the consequences? Consequences or that you did want more, and to make you feel like what you don't have too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually, it was very good because I knew - I'd been knowing for about six months what I didn't have. And, you know, it was - you know - I think it was a really good thing that I kind of went ahead with that. But, you know, I realized that, you know, that I was also involved at least to some extent with the person. And, you know, like, I really wanted to see him and he just wasn't around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd known rationally in my head that he wasn't, that he's involved with a billion other people. And, you know, I just - I couldn't put it all together, it kind of got out of control for a while, though, it really was okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like - I guess when I said, like, you wanted him, in that wanting him kind of like you really want to just kind of be with someone, to sleep with someone and have someone...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that was definitely important, yeah. But then I realized that, you know, if it had been somebody I hadn't known at all, it probably would have been easier aside from any kind of guilt feelings, you know, that I would have had just some kind of (inaudible at 0:07:22.4) conditions before that. That, you know, when I was even the slightest bit - well, close to him, you know, when I did feel some kind of emotional involvement. Then I realized that maybe I was letting myself in for something, although I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, is that about, like, you did have some involvement with him meaning you kind of felt something towards him that just wasn't...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah - oh, no, he wasn't just that, although that was, you know, a good thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's kind of like afterwards, well, what's going to become with that? I guess, like, I know that there's a limit and that's it. But I don't know - I mean, that doesn't feel right to me. And I do want something more, and I guess I kind of do yearn for a relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and it wasn't just a relationship, it was, you know, that I really wanted to talk to him more, you know.</p>

<p>0:08:25.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although, you know, I think since then, you know, it's not that kind - but I don't know quite where this - you know, this really frightened feeling came from. I think it was just that I, you know, hadn't - you know, that I hadn't really solved anything but just going ahead. Although I think in retrospect I probably did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it kind of sounds like you really - like, what that experience did for you, it's not a clear cut thing, it's like, in a way you sense, well, maybe it was a good thing for you to be able to do that and it felt good. But yet, it raised all kind of confusing and frightening thoughts or feelings, you know, that I guess you're not quite sure that's what they are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think, you know, like - I don't know. I guess just the whole lack of definition of the thing scared me. And then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also I don't know, I think it's scared me that he thought it was nothing to me either. And I wanted it to be that way, you know, I wanted to kind of play it cool. And it really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't quite...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:09:43.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I really couldn't. Well, we talked about that, you know, a couple of days and, you know, I felt really relieved when he understood, you know, from my side that there was definitely kind of no obligation or duty, you know, for him to keep seeing me. But just that I felt relieved when he knew that I wasn't just, you know, a bitch or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Kind of like you felt relieved when he knew that it just wasn't a - you know, a meaningless nothing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Better or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then also in retrospect, you know, six months of being deprived was really blowing my mind. And, like, the Saturday before that, you know, these guys had come over. They (inaudible at 0:10:42.7) I come over with my roommate to Joe and we were talking over there, and these guys - a friend of hers came over and he came over to our house later. And then I just kind of hung around and I finally went to bed, you know. I woke in the middle of the night, you know, this guy was sitting there.</p>

<p>And all he had to do was just touch me and that was it, you know. Like, I didn't actually go through the whole thing but got pretty close, you know. And I couldn't believe the next day that, you know, I had, you know, done this. Although it didn't really bother me, I didn't really feel guilt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What had you done? I mean, he touched you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, yeah, a lot more than that. I didn't dare, you know, just go through the whole thing because I wasn't taking the pill or anything. But, you know, it got pretty involved. And then after that, you know, those same two guys were in Joe's about a week later. And I think he told his friend that I was some easy bet thing, you know, and his friend came up and tried to, you know, get - you know, asked to be invited home and stuff.</p>

<p>0:11:47.1</p>

<p>And I knew what they were up to (inaudible at 0:11:48.5). And then his friend - you know, it really bruised his ego, and so he kind of leaned over and said, "I have trouble with Americans, they just don't have any good whorehouses here." And I really pissed, it burned me out and then I - you know, and I realized, you know, just, you know, confronting a real bastard like that, you know, I realized how - again, how important this other person was. I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like to them it was just a fuck. But to you with respect to this other person, it was more than that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was more than that, it wasn't the intense, you know, a real love thing with this other guy that I'd known in the spring, but it was somewhere in between. And it was not bad because of that. And it wasn't meaningless and I think that's what - you know, what frightened me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it was like - it had some meaning to you and you weren't exactly sure in a way what to do with that meaning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think that was it or it was a really indefinable thing in my own head, you know. And also with respect to him, we haven't really, you know, talked enough about where we both stood. You know, as soon as we both kind of understood each other, it was really okay. But and I don't think that they kind of problem - well, I don't know if I'll be vulnerable to that feeling again. I don't know if I ever really learn, I think I'm just going to go on being this na�ve as I always was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But where are you now, I mean, with respect to what that experience meant for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel, you know, pretty good about it actually, like, I know that he, you know, is involved with a lot of other people. But I know that I really - I care about him, but not - you know, I'm not in love with him, it's nothing ultimate (ph) at least at this point. And yet, I don't think that we'll necessarily stop either, you know, that doesn't really bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want something to happen? Do you kind of sense, like, that you would like something more to happen (inaudible at 0:13:52.9)?</p>

<p>0:13:54.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would like, you know, to be in love again, you know. But I know that this, it just isn't really the right person completely, you know, maybe, I don't - you know, maybe - I do feel - you know, it was the first time that I really felt that kind of physical warmth thing towards somebody, you know, since that terrible thing last June, you know, where I had just been so afraid of people. And, you know, and it felt good, I really liked it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could feel it again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:14:24.9) again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I just - you know, I think it was just good in that sense, you know, that it made me realize that I really could feel that way again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, I wasn't destroyed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and kind of, like, I remember you saying earlier (inaudible at 0:14:40.3) other times, like, you know, could you ever - was there any ever hope of you feeling that kind of thing again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you know, you may not have felt it again but it was something other in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, it's still there and you had a potential...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it's going to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and that was - it's just such a really - but, you know, like, I know I can't make myself be in love, you know, but I still feel like it's okay jus the way it is. I feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but do you kind of - I kind of sense that you're saying, well, you'd like to be able to see what happens with respect to this other guy, but kind of, are you saying you don't really know - you know, know what he wants from you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I don't really have that much at stake.</p>

<p>0:15:25.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think I have more judgment than I did before, you know, I think I know more about, you know, about the limitations in relationships and how...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not immediately trying all your emotional (inaudible at 0:15:36.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm really not at all. It's kind of the middle point, you know, between, you know, being totally distant and being totally involved. You know, and I don't feel like it's wrong or anything. But I guess the other big thing that scares me so is just, like, five o'clock (inaudible at 0:15:57.3) front of this professor and he's kind of a big guy in this history thing and I wrote him a letter. I really debated with myself about, you know, just how personal it should be about why I'm leaving school. And I thought, you know, my God, why should I apologize for having personal reasons, you know? After all what else is there?</p>

<p>So, you know, I used a fair amount of discretion in what I wrote of course. But I was kind of - I was trying not to attack, you know, his way of life. And I was just trying to say it wasn't mine right now. And, you know, I am really afraid of confronting him. And I was just - the other night right before I went to sleep I was just panicked because I thought, okay, you know, I romanticize the thing about leaving school. You know, l think, like, I could go off to a commune and do subsistence farming and live with a community of people and, you know, everything would be idyllic. And it hit me, you know, this - you know, this is not going to, you know, be how it is. It's going to be really, really rough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just had this thing, like, I'll just never be able to get up in the morning. I'll just never be able to do anything, you know, and I was just really clutched, absolute panicked. And of course I did get up and I did function, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind - yeah, was there kind of that panic there or about is anything really going to happen with my future? I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really uncertain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, I...</p>

<p>0:17:27.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am putting eggs in my basket leaving school in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not - I knew - I never really thought that I was just escaping. You know, if I thought that then I would really worry. I really feel like it is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going to something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're really just unsure about what it is you're going to and what's going to be there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and what I've fabricated in my mind about what it's going to be. And, you know, I realize it's a big risk, but I think also that, you know, like, people do not make mistakes, you know, it's not a matter of a mistake, it's a matter of trying something, you know, of having nerve enough to try something else if you're unhappy with a situation. And, you know, it is a risk if I'm never to come back. But, you know, I'm really afraid that this fear thing is going to get in the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fear thing of making something where you go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but just by being afraid, you know, that (inaudible at 0:18:29.2) really defeatist thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, that's why I wish that I could just kind of take a day at a time. Actually, it's funny, I'm less worried now about kind of my age, you know, chronological age thing relates to the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I used to feel like, okay, I'm 25 - but 25 I'm over the hill, things are really over, I've just got to settle for second best and other alternatives. And I don't really feel that way anymore. I feel like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you still got a few more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Years to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel like my age hasn't - you know, my age hasn't really defined me, you know, like - but I really can control things more than that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you could look and (inaudible at 0:19:08.0J) what you want wherever you are in life (inaudible at 0:19:10.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not over because, you know, you're not in love at 25 and married and have a family to (inaudible at 0:19:20.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:19:21.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, it doesn't necessarily mean (inaudible at 0:19:25.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also, you know, it doesn't - in a way I'm almost relieved that I'm not because, like, if I'm going through this right now at 25, you know, it's really crucially important that I kind of live out this thing. And I've had a situation where I was really pinned into a, you know, the definite kind of role, then maybe - you know, like maybe this will be a really good thing. Maybe I really will become much more involved with all different aspects of life that I've never really dared to try out before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of pick your fruit from different trees or, like, you know, just appreciate different things in life and kind get the gratification from those.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that, you know, if I hadn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they can be meaningful to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, they can. I'm not sure whether I created the meaning in my mind, you know, that's what I'm afraid about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah - well, it's like, I guess, one, that you're worried about that they won't be meaningful. It's, like, in your mind they have, you know - what you do have is that they really feel as possibilities for being meaningful things to do and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaningful experiences.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure it will be so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:20:46.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But the thing that I know that I do is that - you know, like, I knew at the time I was teaching the literacy thing in Eastern Europe that I really - you know, I'm not sure that I've kind of built this thing up out of proportion because I've been so unhappy without a role over there before. But all of a sudden, here was a way I could relate to these people. And, but maybe I've thought of this role thing as being the only way I can relate to people, and that this is really going to be it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, I'm just kind of worried that I'm not - and I never really enjoy something - like, it was really tedious, it was a drag, you know, teaching three or four hours a day. And I saw at the end of a certain amount of time (audio gap). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you just can't take kind of the remorse that might be able to be found in something limited for what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you really kind of want full...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I want it - you know, absolutely full existence, you know, kind of super excited state all the time, you know. And I know that I really don't have the energy to live at a manic pace the rest of my life. But yet, I really do want, you know, just total bliss.</p>

<p>0:22:29.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But does your wanting total - yeah, and what you're saying is you want total bliss, you know, like, keeps you from seeing or appreciating what there is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I know that there are moments when I'm really, really happy, like, you know, when I talk with really good friend of mine, a roommate of mine, and we both kind of have the same hopes, you know, and the same feelings. And when I'm talking with her I'm really very, very happy communicating at that level, you know. I'm very (inaudible at 0:23:09.2) I know the situation's where I am very, very happy. You know, I also know that they're very personal type intimate relationships, you know, at least emotionally.</p>

<p>And I guess that's kind of what I'm looking for. You know, like, the excitement of being in a situation, like where teaching involves a real personal thing, you know, where people are - where the ideas are connected with how people's feelings relate to (inaudible at 0:23:44.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then that's kind of the way - it's really funny, somebody was pointing out to me last night all my kind of anti-intellectual antics, you know, that I really - the way I battle (ph) with things this incredibly intellectual way. Like, you know, instead of fighting with this depression thing, you know, by going out and swimming or ice skating, running around. I was reading Nietzsche, you know, and cutting out things and putting them on the wall and reading them over and over, you know, and feeling them. And that that - you know, and that's really why I think that intellectual - you know, really thinking the way it should be, you know, that it's so just tightly bound up with the kind of feelings you have going through experiences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like, those things are about life, you know, but it's your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, they really are. And that's - you know, of course, that's not what I'm going to get out of doing monographs the rest of my life. That's not the way I operate. I'm not a scholar (ph) at all. I really have to find some kind of point where - well, the way I communicate about the ideas that I feel strongly about is a real personal thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, where that - where, you know, a monograph be dry (inaudible at 0:25:04.7) to write, you want to be able, whatever you do, for, like, you to articulate with you personally about something in your life in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it means something but the word isn't dry. If you teach, it's a lot of word for you that you're teaching...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not a narrative concept (inaudible at 0:25:22.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I've kind of been debating about this thing, like, you know, that operating on that kind of really deeply personal level is kind of exhausting for a lot of people. They really don't want to put up with it, it's really rough, you know. And then I keep thinking that this is why I should get out of this introspective, intense thing that I can't seem to without just feeling dead. And yet, at the same time I found that when I do kind of open up to some people, they really do respond to it. And that they want - they like having someone that they can talk to about, you know, feelings themselves too.</p>

<p>0:26:04.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so I just - what I have to do is learn to be more discrete about it, you know. And yet, if I don't take the first steps sometimes, then I never really get to know those people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of like you feel in a way you have to start it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you know that it can be nice to people if there can be responsiveness between people, like you basically kind of feel that it often isn't that way, and you have to kind of try to do things to make it that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And, you know, I know it's really a risk when you are honest about yourself with other people, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's being vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is. And especially in an atmosphere like this because it was really a risk for me to write the kind of letter I did to this professor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really don't know how he's going to respond, I wish I did so I could, you know, some way to (inaudible at 0:26:57.5) imaginary conversations that I have before I go in. You know, and I think, well, you know, if this is indiscretion, if this is some kind of, you know, continual life on an analyst's couch with people, this is not fair to them. It is an imposition, but I also know that the most rewarding relationships I've had are often been the ones I've started with people, you know, we started talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, where you have kind of said something from inside yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's really hard to judge, you know, about what is a discrete thing to say and what isn't, you know, and with whom.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That kind of worries you. I mean, because you said it a couple of times. I mean, it's kind of really hitting you that it is very meaningful to you, that you know you have to do something to kind of bring that out in people, the responsiveness but that's a risky business too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:28:17.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're just not exactly sure of when and how and where and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, some people are really bastards and you shouldn't do it with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also, there's a real element of subtlety in it, you know, that if you really want to get to know people, you have to go about it - you know, like often times a really effective way of doing it is by just sitting kind of telling little stories that can (inaudible at 0:28:41.6). And in a way it's really kind of seductive thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, with a man. And I suppose ultimately that's what teaching would be, that you kind of deal metaphorically with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that kind of like in telling stories, like, that's a way for you to do it because it is subtle, it's kind of like there's a medium which has to be extracted out of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but people...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's in there but it's not overtly in there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, people get really startled when something blatant - I mean, just in a way it's the same kind of startling thing is when something, you know, very violent happens because it's unusual, and it's not the kind of thing that you're used to dealing with and handling. And you just have to go about it very carefully. And I'm not - you know, I just - I've had very intense relationships with people and everything, you know, since I was about 18. And before that I had the kind of buddies, you know, where we never really discussed these things.</p>

<p>You know, I guess that's part of, you know, just growing up is learning how to not turn off your feelings, but not display them overtly, you know, just to do it carefully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have them but to be moderate in the way you express them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But yet, be open at the same time at the same time when there is, you know, a kind of opportunity, you know, an opening with another person. I don't know how I'm going to learn it just by talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, yeah, but it kind of - kind of you get the feeling inside is, like, it really would be (inaudible at 0:30:42.9), would like very much to be able to kind of do it that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be very - yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And careful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Control (ph) yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess with this fellow in the spring, did you throw yourself open in any way? Is that what you feel that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know I did inside because I just - it was a very immediate kind of thing and then very intense. I mean, we were practically living together, you know. You know, it was a kind of careful, getting to know each other. And yet, we knew (ph) - you know, like I said, you know, I was really trying to be cool about it. And I never just said, you know, "I really love you" ever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it sounds like (inaudible at 0:31:22.1) those real discrepancies between what you told him and what you told yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there was of course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of in the end it really worked against you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you knew what you told yourself was true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, and of course it was a little shock for him too. In a way, it wasn't really fair to him to feel those things without having let him know kind of what he was in for, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:31:57.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just never seem to know when things are better left unsaid, you know. And there are situations, of course all the time when they are. And that really kind of scares me because of course, you know, when I was - before I was 22 I never really talked to anybody except one person. I said everything to one person and nothing to anybody else. And I guess that's why I kind of feel so impatient about life, and especially a kind of life where I'm not learning because I feel there's so much I have to learn in how I'm operating with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, that's not enough time, that's not enough opportunities, you know, it's a stifling environment at least here. And I'm just not able to set up kind of situations where I can really experience (inaudible at 0:32:54.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you really wanted just - you know, and I guess this thing about how to feel - and (inaudible at 0:33:03.2) feelings with somebody is one of those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do that, you know, like, you really want those - you want it but, like, you're not sure you see all the opportunities how you could do it and you're impatient to be able to. You kind of feel like you're not doing it. Like, it's really - you know, as quickly as you want to and would be able to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I want it to happen so quickly, and yet, you know, the irony of it is that so many things did happen so quickly, like, in a period of nine months. Like, you know, when I came back here from the Peace Corps, like, in nine months I'd been through kind of getting readjusted to the school thing, you know, and all the pressures of that. Having a kind of being in love with love relationship, well, it wasn't entirely that, it was much more than that, completely turned into nothing and going through this kind of suicidal fit last January, and then getting totally involved with somebody else.</p>

<p>You know, I mean, things that - normally, kids start experiencing these things when they're teenagers, you know, 16, 17. And I was doing it when I was 24 and I was living through about a ten year period in nine or ten months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of really feel like your development's been retarded in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, definitely and I feel like I have to catch up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, you have to - yeah, catch up for those seven years, eight years you missed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do it, you know, real quick you have so much to learn.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Making up for lost time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a whole - like, in the last year in a way, and being in the Peace Corps a whole world opened up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:34:39.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you know, you started...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was incredible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's, like, you know, you started to develop later something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of were anxious to get on and learn things and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have the growing kind of experiences that usually take place then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of before it's too late, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You really do feel kind of - I mean, you're saying the contrary on the other - you know, earlier, but you really do feel that pressure of time, like you are 25.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've got to...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm where I am, where I should be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Get through these stages.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, at 18.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's kind of like I have to set up the stages so that I can live them out in (inaudible at 0:35:19.6), and then I, you know, make up the time. And yet, I know that they were happening too fast for me really to assimilate, you know, and practically, I just about cracked up.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really did. And I just don't - you know, I really deeply wish I were 21 right now, and that I could just relax and live it out, you know. And kind of wait for it to come instead of feeling I have to control it, you know, and create it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and, you know, it's, like, in your impatience, you know, you may be even missing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:36:00.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, it can be for little things too (inaudible at 0:36:02.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like we were talking about before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of wish you could just be more relaxed about it and just let it happen, and have the faith that it will happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yet, like, I really feel like it's happening with a capital H right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know, that's the sense I get from what you're saying, that you do have that feeling like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling pretty good, like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it was getting down to the bottom and I feel like I really am kind of reconstructing. In fact, this friend of mine came over last night and (inaudible at 0:36:40.0) just from - I let her read the letter that I had written to this professor. And she kind of looked around my room and read all these things and just, you know couldn't believe, she said, "You really, really come from an awful lot in just the last couple of weeks, haven't you?" And of course, I don't really realize that measure, you know, it's nothing you can do. But, you know, I really do feel that in, like, two or three weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, when she said that to you it just - like, you could really see it and it really made you feel good that someone else had seen it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think I did, yeah, I think it did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And feel it all the (inaudible at 0:37:14.4) there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, like, you know, two or three weeks ago I had been talking to her about killing myself, you know, and all of a sudden I was really trying to handle things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:37:25.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, she was - I think she was kind of impressed actually. But I do feel good about that. I feel like I am kind of letting whatever it is happen, you know, and not just sitting burying myself in books. I am, you know, maybe doing the wrong thing. I don't think it's an escape, but I am just giving myself the freedom by not - you know, by leaving school, by not doing what - the work that I'm told I should do, you know, by failing. You know, in a way I'm giving myself freedom to fail right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like, you know, you're saying - yeah, it's like you're choosing kind of - say, well, I'm not going to do it that way, kind of that's a choice and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, feel like in a way you are putting together a life that's more suited or looking for a life more suited to just what feels right to you inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's - you know, like, I'm kind of accepting failure in outside imposed terms in order to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From the life (inaudible at 0:38:33.1) part of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You - you failed but you just don't feel like you failed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I feel like the (inaudible at 0:38:40.6) of my mind I haven't failed at all. I'm really getting somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you know, they may think this is a failure, this professor could say you're a failure, but, like, you don't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of ...</p>

<p>0:38:53.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't believe that at all. In a way, I'm kind of afraid he's going to talk me into staying here because they have a big stake in it because I have four years worth of money, and also he (inaudible at 0:39:04.6) good student enrolls (ph), but - and I could just by a little bit of flattery, I could very easily be talked into staying, you know. But I know I ultimately won't be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really do feel like - I felt kind of strong last night (inaudible at 0:39:19.8), like, almost anything could happen right now and I could really manage somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like outside that could - or would have really thrown you could happen, but, like, you could kind of feel strong enough and that, you know, you could take it and you'd still be there, and you'd still be standing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, your feet felt firm in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the same thing kind of happened the first year of the Peace Corps and I was confronted with all these, you know, a totally different value system, you know. People sleeping with each other and smoking pot and taking drugs, you know. I just had never been exposed to it. And I kind of lived through it in a agonized way. And then all of a sudden I realized, you know, that I was going to make it, you know. And I felt so much - you know, I felt like I really could - you know, I felt kind of, you know, kind of secure in myself at least for a while. (Inaudible at 0:40:14.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it - but, like, at that time - and I guess that's kind of like it is now, like, you just - you know, like, you could let it be. And you knew that there kind of just had the - really just felt inside that it could just come out of (inaudible at 0:40:30.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were okay too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that the only - you know, that I really - the only honest thing for myself that I can do is to not read, you know, the things that I will write my paper on, then I'll take my orals on. But to, you know, to go ahead and read these things that just blow my mind, you know. Like this - I don't know if you've read Edie Cummings' Six Long Lectures.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, it's really - well, I won't go into that, but there were things in it which really hit me incredibly - yeah, like, he quoted Shelly - the last verse of Shelly's, "Prometheus Unbound" which - I really just felt like running around, you know, it just about killed me. And then another thing (inaudible at 0:41:18.1) where he talks about kind of the slow growth of the philosophic mind, you know, of accepting and having the bends (ph) and growing with them, you know. Accepting the losses, accepting the fears and really kind of coming to grips with it. And these things just really hit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And how can I - I don't have any other choice but to do this right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, kind of right now you could kind of feel like you can accept the losses and sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can come to grips with it, and you kind of feel like you just really are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or I feel like I will get to that point if I give myself this much time to build up reserves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:42:01.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, that I really have no other choice but to do that, you know. But it scares me at the same time that, you know, I might, you know, quote, "Lose myself." I don't think I'll lose myself, but I'm really afraid that - well, I'm not sure getting lost is such a bad thing if you kind of know yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:42:22.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you can be lost in a world but if you're not lost inside, you won't be lost in the world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah, and that's kind of the feeling I'm finally getting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, you are (inaudible at 0:42:38.7) you can have - you kind of do have a sense of where you are and, well, situationally, you may not - your path may not be clear, like, you don't know if you'll ever get the things you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But kind of feel like (inaudible at 0:42:53.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:42:54.3), yeah. And I never understand how that process takes place, you know, from total despair, then, you know, two or three weeks later, you know, I've managed. I never understand, you know, I can say, well, this is what I read, this is what's made sense to me this is what has happened, but I don't know - I really don't know what happens inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really like to be able to understand (inaudible at 0:43:23.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd like to understand it enough that I could create it myself next time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you feel if you understand it then you'll be able to make it happen (inaudible at 0:43:31.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in a sense, yeah. Well, in a way I guess it's just kind of a miracle. It really is - it's like being born again. There's something, I think it's by Jung that's pinned up on the wall at this other guy's house, this guy I really admired. And he's talking about - you know, continual process of life as being reborn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and that's really what it feels like. It really is like being reborn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, kind of out of the ashes of your despair has kind of - you feel like a new person in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I do. Like, I don't think I am anymore right now what I was a month ago, and definitely two or three, four years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:44:27.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really - I just don't understand how that happens. You know, and for all practical purposes being dead for a while, you know, which is what it felt like when I decided that I was going to die, you know, I really was dead for...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of sense, like, you have kind of this feeling of miraculousness is inside me. Like, you don't know what to do with it, like, you want to understand it, you put your hand on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not sure I do. I mean, I don't really want to understand miracles. You know, I'd like to understand how I operate so that I can kind of predict it and handle it, and not - I'm not - maybe it's not such a bad thing to get into these despairing things. Maybe that's not - I always feel guilty about it, like it's such a terrible weakness and stuff. But I usually come out for the better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess that was the kind of - when I asked you much earlier, do you ever feel better after you cry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like a metaphor for, you know, the thing you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, that maybe you can feel really down, and because, you know, you can feel down, really down that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:45:36.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That enables you or that very thing makes you be able to be up again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, and just not even - like the (ph) okay but, you know, it's because you've been down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But up again and beyond.</p>

<p>0:45:50.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:45:50.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like in a new place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Of course I'm always afraid of terror and panic and despair, you know. And I'm really - I'm always...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does, and, you know, like, what happened over the summer, I didn't realize until maybe just recently how close I came just to (inaudible at 0:46:15.6) because nothing made any sense. There was just a totally chaotic world, I couldn't put anything in place. I couldn't relate to objects even really, just they were meaningless, totally meaningless. And I'm really terrified of having that happen again. And I think it very well might knowing me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, scared of that happening again and, like, really might get thrown again. It's, like (inaudible at 0:46:45.0) just your legs might not strong enough to stand on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take that again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, well, (inaudible at 0:46:54.5) telling you, I really have to quit then (inaudible at 0:46:58.0).</p>

<p>COUNSEL: Go on, (inaudible at 0:47:01.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. One of the girls that I worked with this summer who's been through it, she's been in the psyche ward a couple of times and she's been through an awful lot. And she was really very patient with me at the time that I was kind of cracking. But I just - I went off and saw these friends of mine Sunday. And she - I was telling them - I went in really excited and I was telling them about how great it had been, you know, reading these things and the idea of leaving school and trying other things and everything. And she just said, "Well, you know, you're just the kind of person who just sets up continual disappointments for yourself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:47:39.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in a way I guess that's true because like I said, I realize there are situations that either are just going to bring (inaudible at 0:47:46.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Put too much stake in...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I definitely do. But I can't help myself putting stake in things and I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:47:53.3) because life is for high stakes for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is, yeah. And I'm not sure...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you take it seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure that I want to be complacent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be just casual and cool about everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, because when I'm casual and cool, I just - I'm not excited, I'm not really living.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not alive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not stimulating, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just don't know you're alive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:48:15.9) meaning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so I guess - you know, I guess what it really entails is just the need to reconcile myself with - you know, with the way I do put stakes on things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just learning to accept the stakes and accept the consequences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, being able to live through it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but of course, the time that the consequences fall then I never can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You miss (ph) all sort of - you don't have the (inaudible at 0:48:42.8).</p>

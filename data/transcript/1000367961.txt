<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) I think I must often, before I come here, choose some safe topic that I can at least start out on.  Because when I came in, or before I came, I suddenly thought well, what do I have that I want to talk about today?  And it seemed to me that there had been something that had happened since I was here last that had occurred to me I'd like to talk about.  And I couldn't remember what it was.  And then I thought I remembered it.  So when I came in I was, my first thought as soon as I lay down was sort of, I wonder if I'll be able to remember.  And then something which is, well, I, I don't want to talk about it at all, came to my mind, which was having intercourse with MSCZ last night.  And I don't know quite why it came into my mind because I wasn't aware previously of thinking about it particularly.  And yet even though I could think of other things to talk about I somehow just seem sort of dishonest.</p>

<p>And there was, I don't know, the, for some reason the connection between wondering if I could remember and then thinking about having intercourse with MSCZ was just somehow connected with freedom.  And, and yet it just seems so unrelated.  But I think it might be partly because last night I wanted very much to respond to him and very often I thought I could.  And then something would happen and I couldn't.  So that I didn't feel free.  Just like I was wondering when I came in, I suppose, if I were going to feel free to think and recall.  And it was upsetting to me then but I, it's the kind of upsetting thing that I've just learned to not think about because I don't seem to get anywhere when I think about it. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think last night it bothered me more that I couldn't respond in a way that I know sometimes I can and feel the same way about it that he was than it has other times.  And I, I don't know, it just seemed worse to kind of be passive and just sort of make up my mind that it was going to happen and let it happen, which I've often done before.  (Pause) I suppose my attitude about it is changing somewhat.  I was just thinking of the fact that once MSCZ asked me why I always referred to it as intercourse and not making love.  And, and it never used to seem to me it had anything to do with making love. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it was funny too.  I was aware, even though I wanted to sort of let myself go and not have such control over myself, on the other hand there were some things that I had to do last night.  And I was conscious all the time of the time and hoping it wouldn't take too long so that I wouldn't waste too much time.  And so there was this feeling of wasting time.  And I think that feeling is often there when I'm in the midst of teaching and doing other things and that when I rate things in order of their importance, that comes the lowest, it's the least important to spend time on.  (Pause) And I think I was aware, too, last night not only of controlling myself but of controlling what MSCZ could do or couldn't do too, more than I've ever been aware before.</p>

<p>ANALYST: For example?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, he might have been touching me somewhere and I would say, "Well, I don't want you to do that."  Or I know there were times when I just had to pull away from him too.  And I, and I think I was very aware of trying to make myself feel something and I couldn't.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I think all along I've wanted him to want to have intercourse with me but I've also wanted him to accept without (clears throat) getting angry at me or turning away from me or ending up not wanting me, to accept my refusing to have intercourse with him and to have control in that way.  And I suppose things kept going as they were until he began to not accept this control over him.  And I was just wondering how I feel now.  And, I don't know, it just seems to have gotten more confused.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I wonder if right now, when you were quiet, you know, in the midst of thinking about this, you weren't exercising a control over what you were thinking here too?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Probably.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And in that respect, over me, I suppose.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, over what you could know and couldn't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Thinking about that makes me feel confused too because on the one hand it seems that if I don't want to say something there's no reason why I should.  But on the other, it was practically like your asking me what I was thinking, in my mind, and my inclination is, if you ask then I should tell.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>But I think in a way the reason I didn't want to talk about having intercourse with MSCZ at all to start with, and then why I'm still choosing what I say, comes from some kind of, well, I keep saying, well, it's so personal.  But really it's the feeling of being ridiculous or, (pause) or even almost, what if I'm not like other people, I guess. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think I didn't say this because I wasn't sure how to say it.  But I know if I don't it will bother me.  And it was simply, that when you asked for examples on how I controlled our having intercourse the thing that I didn't say, that I was thinking, was that I even controlled when MSCZ had an orgasm.  And (clears throat) I don't know, it just seemed very hard to say.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That's even harder to say.  (Laughs, pause) Well, it's so simple, really, just by moving or not moving.  It's almost I, the feeling I had right now is almost like I told a big secret.  And that in itself makes me feel sort of ridiculous because at least as far as MSCZ and I are concerned, I know, even though we haven't really talked about it, that he's as much aware of this, or more so, than I am.  (Silence) And it was almost, too, the feeling that, however much I admitted to myself that having that kind of control gave me some sort of pleasure, now that I've said it out loud or said it to you, because I might have even spoken of it to MSCZ, it will never be the same.  It's almost like now I have to face it.  And, and I think there was an element of the fact that it was that I could choose by what I did when he had an orgasm, not that he was having an orgasm and I was glad that he was, but that I could, to some extent anyway, choose when he would.  (Pause) In fact, it just came to my mind that my whole attitude, when I didn't want to have intercourse with him was simply, well, if I'm going to do it and I have to do it sometimes, it was sort of my duty to, then at least I can control it, have control over it.  (Pause) So that it almost reduced MSCZ to being kind of animal, which is what in my mind I was sort of criticizing him for being anyway.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not sure I understand that.  How, how did that work in your —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not sure either.  (Laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I mean, what, what, ah, how do you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, —</p>

<p>ANALYST: How does it work in your mind that you —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That it's all — well, I don't know that it does entirely now, but I was thinking it used to bother me very much because it seemed that that kind of response to another person had nothing to do with using your mind or your mental capacity or whatever made humans something different from animals.  And I don't know how much I believed this but I think it was a fear I had that it really didn't matter whoever it was that MSCZ was having intercourse with as long as he had it.  And I suppose very often I wanted to be sure that even if I refused him, he would wait and have it only with me because it did matter.  (Pause) But then somehow that I could treat him the way I was by having such control over him, as if I were disciplining him like I would a cat or a dog or anything, I, I'm not completely clear on how I feel about it but it just, I just know that there wasn't any kind of interaction between 2 people. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I remember that, before we were married and we talked to my minister, he said something which I don't recall very clearly but it essentially was that to have a happy marriage and to be united as one person and to fully experience this union, intercourse was part of it, and, or physical union or whatever words he used.  And at the time I, first of all, was sort of horrified that he was saying it, he of all people, who should have been aware of the fact that that wasn't an important part.  And, I don't know, I just kind of discounted that he did.  And, but it also disturbed me very much that somebody that I had looked up to and sort of thought was above something like that, that he could have said it and obviously meant it.  (Pause) But I don't think I really feel that way anymore.  But there's still something there that gets in my way.  It's, now I want to be able to be part of this and I feel sort of left out.  (Pause) It's almost like the fear I had of not being like other people has come true.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) You know, I'm sort of struck by a parallel in what you say.  You describe, you say that you control MSCZ to some extent by whether you move or you don't.  And the parallel that occurs to me is that in a certain sense it seems to me that that's how you try to control what happens here or what happens to your feelings here or what happens to what you think of here.  And that shows up by whether you talk or don't talk.   (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  When you say, by controlling things here, it's more, really, by controlling myself, not you.  Because it just made me think of something I'm very aware I do.  And I've thought of it a lot lately: how I'm very often quiet when I'm with other people, more from a fear that if I'm not quiet I'll look stupid and say something stupid.  So it's controlling myself.  And that was another area that I have a fear I'm not like other people.  Because I used to think that I was quiet because I had nothing to say because nothing was in my mind.  And lately, at least, I'm aware of all the fears that are in my mind that are keeping me quiet.  But then I suppose I'm also afraid of getting rid of them because if I do maybe there won't be anything in my mind. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I've sometimes wondered too, since I'm going to control myself anyway, if my desire to control other people doesn't come from wanting to have that satisfaction.  Since I don't really find it so pleasant to control myself, at least I can enjoy having that power over someone else.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

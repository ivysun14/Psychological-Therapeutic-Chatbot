<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So unless there is somewhere else to start, I was going to mention some of my thoughts about. Okay, so I am, I am going to get of the Blue Cross HMO. I am happy to reduce the fee at least through the end of December. I don't know exactly where we are with visits but there is today and three more. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Four more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, four more. So you would be paying like 50 bucks a visit on top of your (inaudible at 1:19) that would be it after that in terms-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess that would give us another month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Okay, I will think about it and talk to Jeremy. I got a call from the chief of student mental health at the university.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:02:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had good things to say about you. (pause) Well I have good things to say to but it was just, it was odd because unless she has been in therapy with you, it's like I have a better perspective. For someone to tell you-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She knows I work fairly well because, she's seen for medication another patient I have seen for therapy. And people that we have shared for years and years. [00:02:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well anyway, she was very nice. She was very committed to just doing as much as possible within their limited capacity. She basically said we don't have the capacity to see people once a week really at all. We basically try to get you on your feet and-in terms of individual therapy and then we have a number of group exercises and group therapy and group course things. And she explained how the peridee (ph) law does not apply to this school or academic institutions and yeah, it was nice. [00:04:02] </p>

<p>It was nice that she took the time out and she wants to know what I decide to do. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that I can find someone who in on the HMO if you wanted to go that route.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had no idea. I still don't know what role this serves. [00:04:58]</p>

<p>Other than being positive. (pause) I don't know what I will do. Time will tell. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your thoughts about this role this serves and the rest of it? What do you think about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well actually it sometimes feels like an interruption or like the end of-also where it is and what the timing and everything. This sort of feels like the end of one portion of the week and then tomorrow is the beginning of another, which is the weekend and whatever the weekend brings. [00:06:09]</p>

<p>Weekends and lab (ph) traveling, just slowing down or speeding up in this pace. These past weekends it has been more speeding up. So maybe whatever happens on Thursday afternoon would be, sort of has a conclusive or closing force but even if it wasn't therapy but it is, so it almost feels like I restart after it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or (ph) the punctuation of the week? [00:07:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was not true for Wednesday mornings. So anyway, that is not really a feeling. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 7:19) I also had a thought about your question about meditation, I don't know if you have gotten more of an answer since you last brought it up. [00:08:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Only through my own practice. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is going on with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's pretty nice and hard. I sit less often than I did in the beginning because it sort of takes a lot of energy. [00:08:58] </p>

<p>To actually physically to sit and when I have been on my feet and begging (ph) and going to jazz or going to whatever or going to lab twice a day, which I have been doing that a little bit. It is very hard to even focus on my breathe because of minor aches and sickness and stuff. I've just been not going on those days except for maybe four times a week now. Yeah, I guess I'm in a good rhythm. I just don't have anything good (ph) to say. [00:10:04]</p>

<p>I mean I sit and I watch and there's lots of anticipatory things that come up. Lots of focus on meals and the big things in the next hours or next day and there aren't necessarily any specific things that I try to or that my mind tries to work, it's more just it's like drum beats. It's like anticipation, which has been not negative or positive either really. [00:11:09]</p>

<p>And well the last time on Tuesday evening, something really cool happened and I just let it happen. I'm giving this talk at this retreat next week about what I work on and what my little made up group works on, so we split the lab into three groups based on the shared interests and the other two labs did that to and three people from each lab are going to tell the rest of the group what it is that they do. [00:12:10]</p>

<p>So, it is a really cool opportunity for me because I get to speak and make a talk and think and have a good talk without needing to have to data and that's because (ph) the data is so painful to get because it's not coming. It's a talk that I haven't spent that much time actually working on and I have thought a lot about it, but not in any formed way. [00:12:51] </p>

<p>During orientation on Tuesday, the whole talk formed in my head and it was so out of control. It was like I couldn't see anything else. I was seeing the shapes and the words and the sentences on the Power Point slides and the colors and slightly slightly refining the language. I was aware the whole time, like wow, I'm really not paying attention to my breath. I'm not paying attention to sitting. I'm letting this carry me and I did. It was extremely useful. So, I just did. And now I have most of my talk formed. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 14:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never experienced anything like that before. I'm not struggling with fear right now during meditation, as I may have been earlier and endurable (ph) again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question, if I remember it correctly was [have you not] (ph) your thoughts and feelings when you're meditating? [00:14:57]</p>

<p>(pause) Maybe nobody (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) How does that work? (pause) There is some agent exercising well. Maybe not in the instantaneous moment but from moment to moment, minute to minute, day after day. [00:16:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that is not the meditating? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Or we are thoughts and feelings and we just are changing all the time. [00:17:05]</p>

<p>(pause) And leaving and coming back and things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 17:30) answer, which is [at least from this] (ph) point of view the thing that causes this level is the way we identify with our thoughts and feelings and sort of having the (inaudible at 18:10) that is who we are. [00:18:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Beginning (ph) travel isn't the same thing as, then it must not be true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that (inaudible at 18:55) that it gives us really causative (ph) and true. [00:19:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It is very hard for me not to attach to positive (ph) things. (pause) If I were describing my various difficulties with this practice that is probably the biggest and scariest one in that if I take away my identification with positive things then it's not really clear what is left. [00:20:13]</p>

<p>I could reduce my-It's not just my thoughts and feelings. It's the positive thoughts and feelings. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's actually pretty close to something we have talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the way that feeling distant or separate with your mom and family or at least partially in relation to them. [00:21:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I can feel that it's very very very slowly being replaced or becoming more okay but not because the distance is becoming okay. It's because I am gravitating towards everything. I have a lot of people contacting lab these days. [00:21:59] </p>

<p>I'm mentoring a couple of people. I'm just on Kelly's radar as I get a lot of interaction that way. Meditation is lovely in that it's a thing that I-it's like a pillar. Jeremy and I have-I don't know, it just feels like there is more there between us, and there is stuff going on. [00:22:58] </p>

<p>I'm speaking to my parents a little less, not that on purpose but I'm okay with it and I'm not jumping to call my mom when I'm free. I just normally have been. But it doesn't feel like it's-I mean maybe this is the process of having your own center of gravity that it doesn't feel like there is any kind of less of an attachment to positive things. It's just that things are different. And their plenty of sort of small, little, special things, like apples to us and Oreos. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>(pause) And the debates and media games and sleeping. Like the more lab work I do, the happier I am to sleep. So these things felt like they were kind of not there a little while ago and they feel like they are coming back but I don't know, I guess it doesn't bother me, but meditation makes it very clear that there is so much attachment. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>Almost to the point where I couldn't imagine living without it. So that would be interesting if I continue to live through having fewer attachments, if that ever happens. (pause) [00:25:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is sort of (inaudible at 26:10) but ever since that and the orientations (ph) that you have now, that it's a little like I am doing something hurtful to you. (pause) [00:26:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know that there is enough emotional attachment. I think maybe at times there is or there is partially but I think at least in the-what I am conscious of there is a pretty clear awareness that-look I can just move on to someone else. [00:28:07]</p>

<p>I don't think that I am entirely comfortable with that. Why would I-I feel inertia about or I was feeling inertia about the idea of actually just not wanting to change. Not wanting to figure out if it would work through the school. Not wanting to look for another person, not wanting to-actually the thing that has come up in the game of not wanting to change is also what would I talk about with the other person. [00:28:56]</p>

<p>I don't know what to talk about almost here. (pause) Things feel a lot more settled now. There are these huge swings that maybe is very weird (ph) for a person who is really grieving or suffering about something concrete but-I guess I feel a little self conscious even being in therapy. That just gets brought up when I think about switching to someone else and they are like well, tell me about why you are here. [00:29:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like well, I'm here because (pause) because last week I was here with someone else and I didn't really want to change. So I was saying that I am not entirely comfortable with the change and it is not clear why that is and there are the thoughts about-I don't know. Could this all have been avoided? Would I have had I known that you weren't going to take the HMO in January and that their were 24 sessions, would I have done something different? [00:30:58]</p>

<p>Clearly you knew that you weren't going to take the HMO, so that could have been something we talked about on the first day in July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I could have told you sooner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I was sure that is what I was going to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But as it turns out, I'm satisfied with what I experienced so I don't feel any actual bad feelings or regrets but I do have those thoughts. I guess I also have what I brought up to you last week, which is-yeah this idea of psychology being a great service and why should people who have financial needs be the ones to access it through you. [00:32:12]</p>

<p>I had a thought about-I wonder if it is really boring to see only rich people? And don't you want to diversify your things you hear about? So I have a lot of thoughts like that but I don't think any of them involve anger or really directive hurtfulness. I mean maybe I'm hurt that I am in this situation. [00:32:57]</p>

<p>But again, the whole positive spin comes quite quickly, which is maybe it will get even better with someone else or I don't know. I don't know what could happen. (pause) [00:33:58]</p>

<p>I think it's mixed. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind about our whatever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) [00:35:00]</p>

<p>Well what came to mind with-Jeremy's mom asked me while we there whether I like the work that I am doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And labs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And lab. And I didn't-my response was I don't know what that means. I don't mean to say it in third person. I said I don't know what that means, and I attributed that to the way I was raised and my personality and also the nature of science. I don't really quite know what it means to like what I am doing. [00:35:58]</p>

<p>And the same sort of really mixed not clarity is coming up here. (pause) It's like well, I was raised in this house where my dad more my dad than my mom was very much happiness is overrated. You just do your duty and of course he is a very happy man and same with my mom. I mean it wasn't like, you should do what makes you happy or you should major in the thing that you love. It was you should do something practical that is going to allow you to have an easier time. [00:37:01]</p>

<p>And he came here when he was 19, he had no money. He has really-he has worked very hard in part so that we can have these opportunities. So in a sense, I am doing what, I'm just doing what I'm doing and it's the right thing to do and it feels really nice to take advantage of opportunities the most that I can. The thing about my personality-so that's the first thing. My personality is-it makes sense when you contrast it with another personality type like Jeremy's and Jeremy drew this contrast recently, which is he probably needs to be doing something that he actually really really really has a genuine love affair with. [00:38:02]</p>

<p>And I could be put into so many different situations in the world and kind of be-I will be competent and content. Because I don't know why, I think lots of reasons. I strive to work the positive so I don't know about that. </p>

<p>But the third thing is that, it is really hard to like science all the time because actually it kind of sucks most of the time but then when it doesn't suck, it's really cool. The part that sucks about it isn't actually constantly in your face all of the time, it's just when you step back a tiny bit it's like god it's been days and days and days and I haven't whatever. [00:39:11]</p>

<p>But yeah, I'm happy with my day to day life for now. I'm very aware that it's temporary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that you'll finish private (ph) school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it could be different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I'm not counting the down the days or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) [00:39:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I responded that way, Jeremy's mom said yeah that makes sense. You've made a lot of progress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like progress in your work or in your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no, just in my— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mental health wise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in my insight into myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. (pause) [00:40:58]</p>

<p>I agree with her. But I also think don't get me wrong, that there is an answer in there to her question that you do respond emotionally and sometimes intensely to what is going on at work and reflective of what you do and don't like about it. [00:42:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, all the time. I'm still emotional about it. I don't know what that means about liking it or disliking it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's a more, I'm not meaning to make fun, it's like molecular kind of experience of enjoyment or not or liking it or not. It's king of ongoing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It means one thing to ask the broad question, do you like it but it's another thing for somebody to come in with a microphone like</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some kind of interval (ph) and said how is going right now. [00:43:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can hit it. (crosstalk) No, it's okay. I'm (inaudible at 43:05) that's awesome, all of it's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's partly (crosstalk) what's happening but also partly feeling what you do and think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So right, it's hard to know how to average that. It's hard to take the interval (ph) of the average. How am I going to answer questions. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We stop. I know. But we will talk about this-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we are going to get back from the retreat in time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I'm not 100 percent sure, I think we should possibly look for another day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. [00:43:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry, I just remembered that it's next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this something you will know more about in the next few days or is this something we should do something about for sure? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we should do something about it for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. When do you leave for the retreat? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday morning at 9:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Why don't I-okay and then you'll come back Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At like 4 or 5.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, something on Monday, Tuesday or Friday is likely to work, especially if it's at the end of the day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, let me send you an e-mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in all probability Buddy has cancer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God! Oh I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's been in the hospital since Thursday. Wednesday. And he's been having all these problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it started with — he threw up Tuesday night. I think it was Tuesday night. He hadn't been eating his dinner right away. Then he ate it. And I took him for a walk. He threw it up. He'd been doing this weird squatting. And then I just noticed on Wednesday he threw up in the morning. When I came home, I walked him. I went and got a coffee. The entire living room was covered with water and saliva. He had just completely—you know. [00:01:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I went and checked his cage and barely peed or anything. He didn't pee on the walk. In fact I got so frustrated on the walk because of his constant weird squatting. Nothing was really coming out. So I was concerned. And I called the vet. And the vet's like, "You better take him in." And it turns out that—originally they were like, "He has an enlarged prostate." And they showed the x-ray. And basically his urethra was being cut off so he couldn't pee. And his bladder was just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Poor thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yesterday they went and did a more thorough examination. Did an ultrasound. And they could just tell by the tube at the end of the bladder. And there was inflamed lymph nodes. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was inflamed. That this is basically is in all likelihood some cancer. I don't know the name of that. Potentially could be treated with chemotherapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other alternative is to give a high anti-inflammatory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (inaudible at 00:02:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Powerful anti-inflammatory to at least bring all the inflammation down. Stop the blockage. And let the cancer run its course. Send him home. And I gave them $1100 I didn't have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday night Jess gave them another $1300 out of the cash she's been stashing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday morning. And they're going to keep him through tomorrow. So it'll probably be another grand or so. And my Dad sent me $600 bucks but I mean — you know I went out last night. I was like, "I've got to go out." [00:03:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to pick up four medications at CVS. There's $60 bucks right there. I've got a tournament tomorrow. So I've got to buy Gatorade and crap for the tournament. And it's just — you know. I feel like everyday I just kicked in the stomach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I snapped at some lady. I was taking Ian to school Thursday morning. And you know I didn't stop before the crosswalk. I stopped in the crosswalk. And she was walking. And she wasn't even — it's not like she was in the crosswalk or right at the crosswalk. She was approaching the crosswalk. And she starts rapping on the back of my car yelling at me. So I got out of the car and told her to go fuck herself or something like that. And she's, "Aww nice. In front of your son. I hope he doesn't love you." Or something like that. Or whatever. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>And I said, "Your Momma doesn't love you." Lord knows what Ian has told Jess. And it's funny because when I was at Ian's school where you think people are going to be very calm in their driving, I was actually in a crosswalk and a car turned on me. And someone did the same thing to me that I did to her. It's like, you know, just fuckin' livid all morning. It turns out at E&G we thought we had this new space that was nice. And at a restaurant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it turns out that — we thought it was going to be $50 a week plus coffee service. And then all of a sudden out of nowhere they added this $75 charge which is going to go up to $85. Which we can't afford. So it's like that fuckin' happened. So it's like every bad fuckin' thing is all coming at once. And I just — I got a call from a matter that I should've done weeks ago. And didn't do. And I didn't want to deal with it. And I had to deal with it. [00:05:21]</p>

<p>I'm just — I got into a fight on the phone with Jess while I was at the vet. Ten o'clock at night. And she's telling me that I'm not doing enough. I'm not making enough money. And I'm not giving any money to the kids. And it's like everything I said she had an answer for. I said, "Well what about the taxes?" She's like, "We haven't been given anything for a year." And I go, "What about all the years I made much more money than you? What about the time you were walking dogs?" It's always — she's got a fuckin' answer for fuckin' everything. And the nurse came into the room and I said, "I've got to go. They're here with the invoices."</p>

<p>She can't — her concern was just — she said, "I don't want to just give you money." You know it's like this is your dog too. You know? And I'm in a situation where I don't have money. And she's like, "You've got to find ways to get money." And I'm like, "What am I supposed to do to get money in a day or two?" And she's like, "Sell your tickets." I'm like, "That's not going to get me money tomorrow." And it's like who wrote the $11,000 check to preschool? [00:06:43]</p>

<p>"Well that's your parents money. That's not your money. My parents have been giving me money over the years. Do you want me to get a list of the all money my parents have given me?" And I'm like stressed out enough as it is about the dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't that all kind of beside the point? It's not as though you have money that you're holding back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just don't have it. I mean you actually, as I understand it, you couldn't agree more with her thought that you need to be making more money. Like that's exactly what you've been trying to do. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She didn't bring this up but she's brought it up before. She's doesn't think I'm doing enough to be making money. It's like I'm fuckin' — I'm in trying almost everyday now meeting with someone for lunch or trying to generate business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I know. You're even doing all you can. It's not — I mean some of it is actually helping and some it's not but — .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually right now have my pipeline is as big as it's been in two years. I've got —. [00:07:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. There is this cash sale. They haven't really committed to me yet that would close June 8<sup>th</sup> down in fuckin' [inaudible] of all fuckin' places. But it's money. But I've got two re-fis and two purchases next month. So it's like you throw in that extra cash sale. I've got a new client meeting that was supposed to be Thursday that they're going to put off till Monday. So there is going to be some money coming in there. I'm actually in a position — I'm so far behind the eight ball — I haven't paid my student loans. I haven't paid the car insurance. I've got to register my car and I owe $200 to the city. I can't even register my car so I'm probably going to get whacked with some fuckin' ticket because I couldn't register my car. It's like this is $1100 I didn't have. I owe money to all these people for the start of my business. The new office. [00:08:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just getting nailed everywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she doesn't give a shit. She just doesn't think I'm doing enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No you didn't have the money to pay for stuff before you didn't have the $1100.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she sends me this e-mail yesterday. Because she's like, "I never get a chance to talk to you without the kids being there. But we need to talk. I know you're dealing with Buddy right now so this may not be the best time." So that's where you stop and you don't write the rest of the e-mail. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she sends this e-mail about she's so worried about where she's going to live with the kids. That she's not going to be able to get a place because of her credit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there is one option of someone renting their house to her. But they're worried about it. She actually proposed moving into my apartment and me going and finding someplace. Like I'm going to find someplace with my credit. And it's a one bedroom. She's going to move two kids into a one bedroom? She has no clue. [00:09:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's panicking. They haven't even set a date for the fuckin' auction. And she feels like she's gotta move today. That's how she's treating this. And it's just like, "Go fuckin' live with your parents. If you don't want to put the effort and do what the rest of the world does and find a fuckin' place to live; then go fuckin' live with your parents."</p>

<p>Don't put it on me. Add to the things I have to do in my life that you're unwilling — you look and you say, "Oh everything's $1500 I can't afford." What the fuck do you think I can afford? If that's what everything is, that's what it is. She's all, "I'm looking to save." She's always looking at the expense side of the equation. She's never looking at ways that she can increase her business. [00:10:45]</p>

<p>She's always, "I don't want to do county cases. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do that." And it's like you can only save and scrimp so much on what you spend. Make more fuckin' money. She has the ability to do it. I don't. She literally could bill more hours to both. She could get more divorce cases if she did the minorest amount of fucking marketing. Or join the chamber. Or do some network. She does no networking. None whatsoever. She talks to the woman in the office space next to her. And that's the only referrals she gets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Imagine if she went and did some fucking networking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everybody knows people who are going through a divorce. And it's just — I'm so fuckin' sick and done with her it's not even funny. And it just — I want to tell her to just go fuck herself and leave me alone. She's like, "Most people would've gone into probate court and gotten a support order from you." [00:11:58]</p>

<p>And I'm thinking to myself, "Really? Then you would've seen a lot less money than you've seen of me because they would've gotten nothing." You can't get something from nothing. If you're not making any money they're not going to make you—it's not like they're, "Oh you've got give $1500 a week if you - .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You can't get blood from a stone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not how it works. There are guidelines. And it's based on what your income is. And if your income is zero, they're not going to require you to give any of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just fuckin' drives me crazy. And then I'm having this—. (sighs) I don't even know what you'd call it. With this woman on my Handball team. I don't know why it's driving me crazy. Because it's like — I know it seems to me something that's not going to happen. Or shouldn't happen. Or whatever. But I still want it to happen. But I won't do anything about it. And it's just — the whole time I'm judging everything. I don't know. I stress myself out over it. And it's just the same exact thing I did with Claire. [00:13:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's with fuckin' Handball. It's something I go to twice a week. Because I was considering not going to Handball last night. And I was like, "Wow if you don't go to Handball then you're not going to see Barbara." Whom you're not going to barely talk to anyway as you know. I had a couple of conversations with her. She sat at the other end of the table during dinner. And so — I don't know. To say I've had it is redundant because I'm so done with everything so long ago. But now this whole thing with the fuckin' dog and it's like it's bad enough that the dog's sick. He's had a miserable life the last six months. But it's costing me a fuckin' fortune. And it's like I can't even — I thought, "Oh I've got all this money coming in. I'm going to be able to pay my — get caught up." [00:14:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not going to happen. It's not going to fuckin' happen. It's just — I don't know where to go, what to do. I've got no one to turn to. I'm just — my Dad is in rehab. He sent me $600 and says he's going to send me $600 later. But I've got to ask Jess maybe. I don't know. I have a new client who is going to send me $500. So I took $500 out of the [iolta] account thinking that when she sends me the $500 I can put it back in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got the Handball tournament tomorrow. So I don't know. I guess I've got to pick the dog up. Either leave the tournament or pick the dog up after the tournament. But I didn't bring a check to put more money in the business account which I fucked up. I've got lunch with a loan officer today. That's more money I'm spending. [00:15:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause at [00:15:58] to 00:16:11) The loan officer is like, "Do you do other states?" Sends an e-mail. I'm like, "Yeah I do." And then she's like, "Do you do estate planning?" And I go, "Yeah I do." We were supposed to meet last Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Asking questions like that it could turn into something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so it's like I really don't want to meet with her today. I need to get laundry done. I'm so fuckin' backed up with laundry. It's completely totally exhausted. I fucked up my knee yesterday. There is a like a sinkhole and I hit the edge of it and hyper-extended my knee. I was hoping Barbara would come over and say, "Oh how's your knee?" But she didn't say anything about it. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>I know she's going to the Preakness this weekend with her brother down in Baltimore. Her brother lives in down there. I was like, "My dog's sick. And there's a long shot called Teeth of the Dog." I said, "You've got to put some money on that horse." I go, "I'll text you if my dog dies because then you'll definitely want to put money on the horse."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the horse that won the Kentucky Derby — I'll have another, not even a favorite of the Preakness. But just on that name alone I'd want to put a bet. [00:17:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause at [00:17:50] to 00:18:04) Just pisses fuckin — I don't know. I just don't know anymore. I really — (pauses at [00:18:13] to 00:18:21). My Handball team for the tournament is having like a party tonight. So it's like I'd want to stay home and just kind — that's when I'd really want to do my shopping and hang out. And get to bed early but this thing's at seven. What time is that going to end? Ten? Ten-thirty? Eleven? I'm not going to get to bed and I need to get up early. It's like I just can't fuckin' catch a break — I was up with Buddy. [00:18:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the hospital till like eleven. Then I come home and I can't sleep for fuckin' two hours. And I've got to get up in the morning and take Ian to school. And even if I didn't take Ian to school I had to go into the office anyway because they were delivering my desk. So I might as well take Ian to school. Then I fuckin' snap on some old lady. I told him, "Buddy I'm tired of being criticized. Don't criticize people. People shouldn't criticize other people." There's no reason she should've been criticizing me. And I wanted to say, "Your Mom fuckin' criticizes me day and night." But I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you. [00:19:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Moment of sanity. Self control. I really kind of wish I could remember the whole argument we had on the phone. But I was just fuckin' blown away. And it's like — I don't know what year we should start counting. But I went and worked two years where I was making six figures. She always took the job that she wanted. She got the job out of the clerkship that she wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It paid forty something thousand a year. But that's the job she wanted. And then when things started going sour at that job she wanted to go join the public defender which was the job she really wanted before she got that other job. So she got the job once again that she wanted making fifty maybe close to sixty. But I always had to take whatever I could get. I was walking dogs. I really didn't know how to get business. Not even sure I wanted to be a lawyer. [00:21:02]</p>

<p>And then an opportunity came to take a job and I took it. And I probably made eighty grand the first year and over a hundred the second year. And then I got laid off. So that was the fall of 2004. So things ramped up slowly. I think 2005, 2006, 2007 were decent years. All years I think I made more than Jess because Jess stopped working. She always had to have Ian in some program we couldn't afford. She wanted a nanny. Most parents go to fuckin' work and put their kid in daycare. And she didn't want to do that. She finally because — between bankruptcies and two fuckin' foreclosures she finally realizes that we can't afford to be the people putting our kids in these special schools or whatever. [00:22:03]</p>

<p>The kid needs to go to a fuckin' daycare. And she needs to work. You know? But after a bad year here, a bad year there, and it's like in the middle of my bad year—what can I say? I don't have any fuckin' money. What if they said, "Okay, sorry you're no longer on the list." That's basically what happened to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she doesn't understand that. She's talking to Claire about selling the the house on a short sale. Why don't you fuckin' ask her why she's not sending business to your husband anymore? You're such good friends with her. What's the story? Did I fuckin' do something? Because she can't be this slow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everyone else is busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sent her like three, four deals last year. (pause at [00:23:06] to 00:23:14) I don't know if she just doesn't think I'm competent enough for — I can't get Jess to fuckin' help me out in that regard. I'm tempted to say, "Let's fuckin' find some other realtor that will send me business." She can't possibly be living on one closing a year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's gotta have stuff going on. (pause at [00:23:44] to 00:23:57) I keep forgetting to write thank you notes to the people from [inaudible]. We met last week. And I still haven't sent sort of a follow up thank you note. And I'm like, "Is it too late to do it?" (pause at [00:24:11] to 00:24:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. [00:24:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I even put in there, "Sorry that this is late?" Or do I just write like I wrote it the day after and forget about it? I asked you two things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The latter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause at [00:24:35] to 00:24:44) (inaudible) doesn't bother me tomorrow. (pause at [00:24:47] to 00:24:58) (inaudible) lying there fuckin' face down on the ground writhing in pain. And I'm just like, "You know, what else can fuckin' happen to me?" [00:25:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If someone could just come along and shoot me in the fuckin' head I'd be much better off. (pause at [00:25:17] to 00:25:47) All I do is I come in here and I bitch and moan. Twice a week. (pause at [00:25:50] to 00:25:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There's never any resolution to any of my problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like it's not as though we figure stuff out or how to make things better? It's just venting and leaving? [00:26:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah. (pause at [00:26:16] to 00:26:34) I'm just like at what point am I just going to totally, completely snap? I've come close several fucking times. (pause at [00:26:42] to 00:27:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like when?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When will I snap? [00:27:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When have you come close?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you almost do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just I get so fucking mad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the woman crossing the street you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But even there was just a whole several hour period after that where I'm just like, "Fuck!" I just feel like I want to do something and I don't know what it is. Like punching the steering wheel in my car. It happens all the time. I get the voice mail from the guy I fuckin' dropped the ball on this thing. And I'm just like, "Fuck!" [00:28:07]</p>

<p>(pause at [00:28:07] to 00:28:16) It's like I'm tired of doing all these coffees and lunches and it's forcing me to spend a ton of money in gas. And I just feel like, "Am I gaining anything from it?" (pause at [00:28:37] to 00:29:07) This woman I'm supposed to be meeting with on Monday, she wants me to do something I've never done before. So it's like another - [00:29:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I think apart from the dog — I mean if we were to take that out of the picture — things would actually be getting somewhat better. You're more able to work. You're more (inaudible at 00:29:36) running a business is actually starting to work. You're playing Handball again and getting out there. Things aren't any better with Jess but they aren't any worse. Best I can tell. The dog's been driving you nuts. There's been piss and shit all over the house all of the time. Now he's sick. He's cost you a couple of thousand bucks. $2500 bucks over the last few months. [00:30:05]</p>

<p>I think if it weren't for the dog — I'm not saying things would be great — but they'd be headed in exactly the direction you want it. Feeling better enough to do a little more work and run around a little more. And start making more money and ramping up for the first time in — what a year and a half?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't feel any different I think mostly because you've been — your apartment is a disaster because of the dog. And it's costing you probably most of the additional money that you're making or more. And it's also just really upsetting, of course, in its own right. You care about him. He's a companion. You've lived with him a long time. [00:31:13]</p>

<p>He's got fucking cancer. I don't know what his prognosis is but I would imagine it's not so great. His lymph nodes are enlarged or whatever. Inflamed. So I'm sure you're really upset about it. On top of all the other sorts of strains put on you. I think if it weren't for that things would actually be headed in a somewhat better direction. And that happening to him doesn't have anything to do with you. (pause at [00:32:04] to 00:33:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like I've been more stressed out. And the dog is sick. [00:33:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well a lot of why you've been more — I guess another reason you've been more stressed is because you're taking on a lot more. You're actually doing a lot more stuff. You're playing Handball. You're getting out. You're seeing people. You're going to social events. You're running around everyday to do work. That is more stressful. And it sucks because you're not really — I mean you're seeing a little benefit from in the sense that your business is picking up. My impression is that at some point you twist the shit out of your knee or you hyper-extend your knee — or somebody says something nasty like last week. But it's been fun playing Handball. [00:34:08]</p>

<p>(long pause from [00:34:08] to 00:36:38)</p>

<p>And you know this stuff will start to settle down. I know you've been waiting for that for a long time and that has not happened. And it's mostly only felt like it's gotten worse. But this stuff will start to settle out. And among other things it will be easier to put some of the pieces together in here. [00:37:09]</p>

<p>(long pause from [00:37:10] to 00:38:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanted to buy a new pair of shoes. You probably can tell these shoes are falling apart. I can't even do that.</p>

<p>(long pause from [00:38:46] to 00:39:43) (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. I'm sorry again about running as late as I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Next Friday do you want to just switch the times up? [00:39:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. Okay. I could do 8:30 on Thursday. Is that feasible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the morning?</p>

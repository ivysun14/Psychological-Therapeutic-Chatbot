<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[00:00:23] CLIENT: So I was going back to campus yesterday, to work in the print shop. There's no way I'm going to be done by Friday, this is definitely a two-week project, not a three-day project. It might have been a three-day project back when I was in practice, but (pause) this is a really complicated job, and no one is available to help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause)(chuckles) the guy I'm sleeping with, actually, the kind of casual, when-our-schedules-happen-to-align, which is every two months or so hookup, he used to be the print shop manager. So I gave him a call, and I was like, "Talk me through this, so I don't hurt myself."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a guy you - I don't think you've mentioned? There was a couple...</p>

<p>[00:01:14] CLIENT: Yeah, this is another guy, Tom. He's (pause) (chuckling) entirely too young to actually have a real relationship with. (pause) But our social circles overlap. (pause) He's (pause) one of the few submissive boys I know, so that's fun when we actually have time to see each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like... (pause) sexually? Personality-wise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sexually, in a kink sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I called him up and he was like, "Do you want to play?" And I was like, "Actually..." (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) "I want to work!"</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Yeah, I need some... I need you to talk me through this." So he did, and (pause) I just wanted to see if I felt mostly safe. (pause) I'm not going to try to push myself to work at the same speed I used to be able to, but I can definitely finish the job by myself. (pause) But I didn't realize how much I missed being in the print shop. It's just so much fun.</p>

<p>[00:02:34] (pause) (sneezes) I felt poorly last night, so I didn't actually manage to make it in to work this morning. I was just having a flop in bed all morning and trying to get... bed kind of morning, and then (pause) I'm handing over my laptop to the student who's taking over my project after I leave here. So I was trying to clean the laptop off, get my files transferred, secure where I'm going to get a new laptop from, all of that. (pause)</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to getting back in the shop tonight after dinner, and (pause) distributing the type from the first piece of the invitation I drop, and then setting the type for the second. And I probably won't run the machine because after a full day of being out and about and poor sleep, that's a really bad idea. But at least get everything set up and ready to go Friday morning. So, looking forward to that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:03:34] You looked confused when I said "distribute type." (pause) This is a wedding invitation set, so envelopes have the return address printed on them, reply cards have the to address printed on them, there's the wedding invitation card, the reception details card, and the reply cards. That's five different pieces of paper, so that's five different blocks of type that have to be set. And because we have a finite - each letter is a physical lead slug, that letter on the top.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and then you were explaining yesterday how you have to sort of... (pause) what's the word I'm looking for? Where you have to set all the shims, to hold the type in place, and how that's an art and not a science.</p>

<p>[00:04:23] CLIENT: Yes. Immensely, immensely frustrating. But (chuckles) we don't have enough Garamond type to set all five at one time, so - do one, print it, redistribute the type into the case, and then set up the next. We ran out of A's. (chuckles) That's bad!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you get a particular, distinctive kind of look from this machine once you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm... yes and no? Some people really like having their invitations embossed, so you can actually feel the indentations. But that historically was the sign of a really bad printer. (chuckles) And if you're embossing, you should have everything set up so that the type and the paper are just barely kissing, that's the term that's used among enthusiasts, and that there's no indentation left in the paper. But if you do it that way, it's hard to tell the difference between a monotype press or a linotype press, or even an offset press. So there's really no... (pause)</p>

<p>[00:05:47] THERAPIST: I see. So in that case it's just knowing that it was done on a press.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it definitely does not look like it was printed on a computer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it looks very distinct from computer-produced images. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: As I was walking, I couldn't find parking anywhere near campus, of course, so I wound up parking my car down in the Central and walking down to Harvard from there. And (pause) I just kept remembering all of these events from being an undergrad. I walked past the little Asian grocery store on that I used to think was, "Oh my gosh, so far away, I'm totally going to get lost going there and never make it back to my dorm!" And now it's like a quarter mile down the street. (chuckling)</p>

<p>[00:06:55] There was an ATM and a parking lot at the corner that I remember when I first came to HARVARD when my parents came to drop me off, they set up a bank account for me at the credit union. I got an ATM card and I had never used an ATM before. I asked my parents to show me how and there was this ATM right where we parked the car, and they were like, "No, we can't use that ATM because what if we get mugged, it's right out here on the street, and there are all of these people walking by, and you don't know any of those people. There's an ATM in the student center that's much safer." And I completely flipped out on them: "What if a professor sees me and thinks I'm an idiot for not knowing how to use an ATM? This is so embarrassing and humiliating. Can't we just use this one? No one's going to mug us." And again, the thing was, the ATM outdoors was still on HARVARD's property. In a parking lot, owned by HARVARD. The idea that...</p>

<p>[00:07:56] THERAPIST: Not a sketchy neighborhood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Also the idea that a professor seeing a freshman learning how to use the ATM would think poorly of them, or even remember the incident. Or even be in the student center in the first place. (laughing) (pause) But this was the first time - ever, really - since I graduated that I was able to go back to HARVARD's campus and not feel just horribly ashamed of all of my failures as a student.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:08:47] I also realized just how out of shape I was, because walking 3/4 of a mile from where I parked, there and back, and then walking up the stairs - her office is on the fourth floor of the building. And then being in the print shop, being on my feet and lifting cases of lead type.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those must be heavy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the lead type is very heavy! And solid wood cases too. None of this lightweight modern aluminum. Our type cases are also antiques. (pause) I was completely exhausted. And sore. (pause) That didn't used to be the case, but I guess I am out of shape. I also used to have the layout of the job case memorized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of the what?</p>

<p>[00:09:40] CLIENT: The cases that the type is laid out in, they're about this wide and about this deep. They have dividers in them, almost like a fishing tackle box? And then each... each little pocket contains 30 or 50 or however many slugs with that letter. And they're not laid out in alphabetical order. They're laid out in some bizarre fashion that I'm sure made sense to someone at some point in time, it's called the West job case layout.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like B, C, D, E, H, J, K, L, M, N, U, something, something, something. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not wildly different from the alphabet but not the same. They're alphabetical. [00:10:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It actually is not similar to the alphabetical order at all. B, C, and D form the top row. But then A is in the bottom right corner, and I is in the center, and Z is up in the top right corner, and (pause) presumably it has something to do with the frequency with which letters were used in broad sheets 300 years ago. I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's an opportunity to be kind of obscure there that somebody jumped on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the QWERTY layout for keyboards originally had some kind of justification as well like that. (pause) Yeah, I used to have that layout memorized and I don't anymore. It was slow going, but... [00:11:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often did you used to be there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to do three or four jobs a semester. Usually small ones. Our Players Troupe would have us print tickets for their shows, those happened once a semester. We did tickets for the Shakespeare Ensemble, and we did registration cards for Registration Day every semester. There were always people who wanted business cards. Occasionally other chapters of APO would want us to print - chapters from other universities would want us to print invitations to their formal events. (pause) And back in the day when I was a student, there were only four of us who were trained to operate the press and now there are fifteen, it's amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. (pause) Are there just more people who are interested, or? [00:12:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: More people who are interested, and about four years ago, (pause) one of the older alumni who is a print shop expert got really sick, and was worried that - he's quite old, he's in his late 70's. He was worried that if that was the end for him, there wouldn't be people who knew enough to keep the shop running so he went on a very aggressive campaign to recruit and train new operators. (pause) He recovered, thankfully. He's a great storehouse of knowledge, I don't know what we're going to do without him. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there people in there today? I know you said there was nobody who could help you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't go in today. [00:13:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday, there were people in the office. The print shop is in (pause) we have a fairly large space in the sense that it's fairly large. It's probably the size of this room plus the waiting area out there. So there were people in the main part of the office doing whatever it was they do. There were some people who were having a meeting about recruitment and other people who were just hanging out in the office to do their homework. I run the back half of the office where the print shop was. It was just me. (pause) But none of the people who were hanging out were trained to use the printer, unfortunately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It looks like it is nice to be back. [00:14:45] And that it's a pretty fun job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I didn't have enough paper in the office, though. I thought - one of the undergrads e-mailed out an inventory of what card stock we had, and of course his inventory was wrong which I actually went and started printing. So I tried going before I came here to pick up more stock, and they wanted to sell me some Italian linen for 80 cents a page which, (pause) if you're doing 250 invitations, that adds up quite quickly (chuckling). They didn't have any just plain, (pause) hundred-pound card stock so there's a shop in Allston I'll probably hit up tomorrow, pick up some stock. [00:15:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) These are just big sheets? That fit in there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that you can cut to size because the invitations are actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have some kind of fancy big cutter or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was just going to have the shop cut it down for me, which they will do for me. (pause) But I was really disappointed, because I used to get stock for jobs all the time, but I guess since they closed and then a new owner bought the business, that they've changed what they keep in store. They're going much more for the lower volume, fancier, more expensive paper than the affordable to buy in batches of 500. (pause) (chuckles) [00:16:46]</p>

<p>I don't know, this all seems terribly mundane to me, like there's nothing - I know you said your theory is that you start talking about whatever and change it off to something important, but... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably the happiest twenty minutes I've heard from you since you came in, that seems kind of significant to me (laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Okay, fair enough. (pause) [00:18:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine there are a bunch of things that account for that, but one of them, I suspect, is usually believing in what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meaning? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That (pause) you're happy to be working on the invitation for your friend, and that you think it's pretty cool to be working with the press this way as compared to doing certain thesis projects (laughs) which you said were pointless for people you didn't particularly want to be working for. Stuff like that.(pause) [00:19:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny because (pause) from an outside perspective if I look at (pause) all of my angst over school and work, and what does this mean, and what's the point (pause) one would expect me to think, (pause) a ridiculously labor-intensive process to produce custom wedding invitations when you could do them on a laser printer for one percent of the time and energy, you think I'd object to that. You think I would find that pointless. And yet it's a lot of fun. (pause) [00:20:01]</p>

<p>I think I would resent it if I were actually trying to run a print shop business, though. (pause) [00:20:15] What we do with the press... because the friend who's ordering these invitations is also a member of the fraternity that owns the press and trains the operators, she's only paying for the cost of the paper plus wear and tear on the press. So it's going to cost her the cost of the paper plus 20 bucks, essentially. Whereas the same job done by a professional letter press shop, and there's two in the area - they would charge probably over a grand for the labor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess you said it - a two-week project. [00:20:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And quite dangerous at that. I mean, you're exposed to lead type and volatile organic solvents, and (pause) the ink isn't exactly healthy, the ink has various heavy metals in it. And there's the moving parts of the machine. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, they can bite your hand off. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I'm sure professionals could do it in four days instead of two weeks. But still, it's a highly skilled... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are reasons we've moved on to laser printers. (laughing) [00:21:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Yes, there are. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do those - are there (pause) dangers to put you at any risk?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dave is concerned about the lead, which I don't really see as a problem because it's not lead dust, it's solid lead type. And as long as you're careful to wash your hands when you leave the shop and not wipe the lead on your jeans. And not go and get a pack of chips and eat when you've still got lead on your hands. (laughing) [00:22:11]</p>

<p>Everyone who trained me said, scrub your hands. We have industrial orange cleaner. The kind that car mechanics use to get grease off their hands? It's this kind of gritty, high-strength soap, detergent thing. And we have a nail brush behind the station, so you grab the orange and the nail brush and you scrub your nails. So it gets rid of the lead. And the organic solvents, we have a respirator - not a respirator, a gas mask in the shop because there's no ventilation, and no one wants to inhale volatile organics. So there's that. And the ink also washes off with enough scrubbing, and heavy metals aren't skin-permeable, just dangerous if you eat them. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you make sure not to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You make sure to clean up before you eat. Apart from the moving parts, which if you go slow enough and are careful, you can mitigate that danger. I don't really think it's that dangerous, especially not doing it - I think I would have much more concerns about the chemical safety if I were doing this as my day job. Five days a week, fifty weeks a year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exposure would probably cause trouble but you're careful. You know, that makes sense. (pause) And how is the time split? I imagine the things that take the time are setting the type, and then actually doing the printing. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing the printing is the fastest, actually. Getting the type to lock is the most time-intensive. Setting the type is just plucking the slugs and laying them down on the stone. The hard part is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but getting all the shimming done so that it stays in place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's really time consuming. The next most time-consuming step is (pause) the bedding. So they've got the chaises locked into the press on one side, and the paper goes on another side, and there are these registration pins that kind of stick up and hold the papers, lock the paper into these pins. And then attached to that plate there's a large sheet of paper that's attached on the sides, and there's space to slide more paper in underneath. And that's how you adjust how much pressure is applied to the paper. So the more stuff you stick under it, the further - the higher its height off the plate. So when the two plates come together, the more impact the type has on it? [00:25:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's how you decide how far you want the type to push into the paper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So if you have old type - like we have vintage type from the 1800's. Some of our type even dates to the 1700s, it's really old stuff. Some of the letters are worn more than others, and a difference of (pause) a tenth of a millimeter actually makes a difference in how the finished product looks? So then you have to adjust the bedding so that maybe, you've got a piece of card this big and over on this side everything looks nice but down on this side it's not so nice, so now you need to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A tenth of a millimeter isn't much taller.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then you need to adjust the height. (pause) So getting back, and then (pause) one of the pieces in this invitation has text with a border? So then they have a registration issue - you lock up the text, you have the text, and then you lock up the border separately and you want the border to be aligned correctly with relation to the text. After all of that, actually running the press is not the rate-limiting step. (chuckles) [00:26:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it's a pretty satisfying step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's the most fun part. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you use black ink generally? [00:26:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For this job we're using dark green ink. There are lots of colors. Most of the colors come from heavy metals. I'm not sure which metal gives you green. (pause) We had one customer in the print shop once, she wanted us to do an earth-friendly, soy-based ink, but it turned out none of our regular solvents worked on that ink. It just stuck like nobody's business. So we had to get extra-harsh, extra-dangerous, extra-horrible for the environment solvents to clean up. (laughing) (pause) But hey, we used recycled paper - and vegetable-based ink.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ink, yeah. That's really funny. (pause) [00:28:07] Tell me what comes to mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still have one more piece of work to do for the guy who's taking over my project with my advisor. I need to put together all of my various scripts and notes in some kind of coherent order for him, and I've been avoiding thinking about it. I'm meeting him after he gets off work at 5:30 today to hand over the laptop and answer any more questions he has - and I really don't want to. (pause) I've also been trying to figure out if I want to buy a laptop or to take my old laptop in to be repaired. Encountering a lot of analysis paralysis because I don't want to have wasted money on a laptop that is not perfect for what I need it to be. (pause) [00:29:08]</p>

<p>Getting my old laptop repaired - the screen is, the display doesn't work anymore. And it'll probably cost about 200 dollars to get replacement parts and have someone else do the repair. Because I learned the hard way on old laptops that while I am perfectly capable of doing the repairs myself, I usually don't have the emotional energy or follow through to actually finish it? I left one laptop sitting disassembled on my workbench for about 11 months before I put it back together. (chuckles) It's not a lack of technical skill, but... psychological block, or whatever. (pause)</p>

<p>So I've dedicated entirely too many brain cycles to angsting over whether it would be better to repair this old laptop, which will probably break again. Because the reason why the display broke is that it's a cheap, flimsy laptop and the lid is not very robust. [00:30:09] I carry my laptops everywhere, and they take a lot of beating. I end up doing a lot of freelance stuff in coffee shops. It's not done much for the environment. And whether I should just spend the 800 or whatever to buy a new (inaudible). I suspect either way - I can afford either plan and either way I'll have a laptop that will work, but (pause) the idea that I might waste money by doing the wrong thing. Like what if I pay to get this laptop repaired and then it becomes unusable for a different reason? Am I just throwing good money after bad? But if I replace it that's four times the cost of getting repaired. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness. (pause) Right, and the anxious thought there is about wasting money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) Oh, bad. I get it now. Thank you for clearing that up, I wasn't sure. (pause) Is bad dangerous? Bad immoral? Bad...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad immoral. (pause) Because... (pause) because you shouldn't spend money on things you don't... (pause) need. [00:32:15]</p>

<p>And (pause) you should save money so that you can do good deeds with it, or save for your future, or... Why buy a more highly powered computer than you need? If you're not actually going to use a four core chip, why pay for it if what you need can be acquired cheaper and will still serve your purposes? Why go overboard, because you could use the difference for some other purpose? And of course, the parental voice in my head says, "You should save for your retirement." But the moralist in my head says, "You should be donating more to charity because poor starving children in Africa, oh no." [00:33:05]</p>

<p>Never mind the (pause) systemic forces that work to keep African nations impoverished, and that actually solving the problems of world hunger are not a Tomer of individual righteousness. I love how like in real life, all of that and make all the critiques about social forces that keep trying to make people take personal moral responsibility for things that are actually the responsibility of governments and institutions. I could rant for probably an entire session's worth about the "pick up your litter and turn off the water when you brush your teeth" form of environmentalism. Bullshit. (chuckling) And yet there's still that part of me that feels like that 600 dollars could make a big difference. [00:34:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not yet hearing any voices of what you actually would want to do, in the sense of - are there things you like about your old laptop, or would you enjoy more having a new one? That voice hasn't emerged yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. That's like asking would I enjoy having a new hammer. The laptop is a tool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't Tomer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On one hand, it would certainly be easier to have the old laptop so that I wouldn't have to install operating system and software on a new laptop and I wouldn't have to transfer files. So that's less hassle. But on the other hand, the reason the old laptop isn't functional is because it's got a flimsy case, and also its wireless antenna is a piece of crap. But it's perfectly functional. I don't really use my laptop for intense gaming. [00:35:19]</p>

<p>I use it for writing, mostly, a little bit of browsing the Internet, a little bit of screwing around, preventing hypo in matlab. If I were to buy a new laptop, I would not buy a new top of the line. I would probably buy an older model.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I got that you've got the rest of the world covered, and (pause) the moral principles considered. But in terms of actually what's good for you, that you haven't really spoken to. [00:36:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) In terms of what's good for me, there are pros and cons either way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not obvious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On one hand, a sturdier case and better wireless would be nice. But on the other hand, to set up a new laptop is a huge pain. I don't know, six on one, half-dozen on the other, it feels like. (pause) But you're right, I didn't even think about that until you asked. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that was because it feels like six of one, half dozen the other, so you sort of - it was a wash that way, or because that's just not usually what you think about? [00:37:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just not usually what I think about. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just curious. (pause) I guess you get kind of dwarfed by these other considerations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. (pause) My parents and my sisters are both completely neurotic about money, and I feel like (pause) in one regard I'm really lucky because I'm not nearly as crazy as they are (chuckling), but in another regard I feel like I angst over financial decisions far more than other people in my economic class. [00:38:17] I don't know, (pause) looking at my parents, they don't seem to have nearly as much guilt over buying luxury goods as I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you buy luxury goods?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly in term of consumables. I really enjoy things like high-quality ports. Dave and I frequently buy expensive artisanal cheeses, organic craft bread, meats. At least I can argue that's good for you, good for the environment, good for the economy, buying local, fair trade, but it's also expensive. [00:39:07]</p>

<p>I buy quite a bit of expensive coffee, expensive chocolate, expensive tea. And Dave and I both eat out a fair bit. (pause) I also have quite the taste for natural fibers in clothing, so I end up buying the more expensive options - real silk instead of polyester, real wool instead of microfiber or whatever passes for wool sweaters. (pause) I felt really guilty about that for a long time before Dave told me to stop. [00:40:14]</p>

<p>But there's still a little twinge of guilt every time I buy (pause) - any time I buy clothing or shoes full price, there's the little voice in my head beating myself up: "You could have waited until it was out of season and gotten it on sale. You could have gotten something that looked similar at Target instead of Nordstrom's." Of course they're not the same. There's a huge difference in quality. But the voice in my head doesn't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just cares about the price tag. (pause) And not so much about you, (pause) I suppose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:41:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something about what I'm saying that makes you feel bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) [00:41:46] When I was younger my dad gave us a clothing budget. I think I was 15 or so when he first instituted the clothing budget? Basically, he had just gotten tired of fighting with me and my sisters in the stores over whether a particular piece of clothing was too expensive or not. So he decided he would give us a budget and once we were done with our budget no new clothes for the rest of the year. And our budget was 250 dollars a year for clothes and shoes. [00:42:15] And this was in the nineties so things were less expensive than they are now, but not that much so. There hasn't been that much inflation in the last fifteen years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't imagine that would go very far, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom had the same clothes budget and for adult women's clothes, 250 dollars? That's one suit, essentially. (pause) So I got used to only rarely buying clothes, and buying the cheapest clothes possible. (pause)At the time I always resented it, and I promised myself that once I had a job I would only buy nice clothes and not cheap crap. (pause) And for the most part, that's true. [00:43:04] I don't buy crap that's going to fall apart after three washes. I buy nice clothes from high end stores because I can, damnit. There's still that little horrible guilty voice that says, "Look at how much money you're spending on clothes. You could be saving for your retirement. You could be donating this money to Red Cross. So selfish. Such a consumer whore. Consumerist whore. What's the actual phrase? I don't know. Something derogatory like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop for now. But we'll talk more.</p>

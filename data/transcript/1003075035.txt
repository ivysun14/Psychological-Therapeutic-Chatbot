<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My daughter's coming into town.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did I tell you about that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you told me that she was coming.  I, I don't that, that you told me exactly when, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's coming in this week, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well good, I mean I know one of your concerns last time that we talked just that you wanted to be well for her visit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry again tell when she coming?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's coming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, possibly Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  How are your folks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they're not doing well at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They're [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, boy that's a, those are, that's a lot of years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mother's senile, and my father has renal failure, so they're really not doing well.  Their, their anniversary, it's their 67th anniversary coming up this weekend.  That's why my daughter's coming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what are you guys doing for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we're going, um, it looks like be in the, uh, looks like from the weather reports, I don't know if they've changed because it's supposed to be raining today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It looks like we're going to have, uh, the first meal in the dining room and then the second meal in the, uh, in the, uh, special room set off at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum, that's sounds nice.  Are they looking forward to that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh, well I think they are, kind of, I sure hope they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they're, I'm sure that they're, they wanted to get well, so they checked themselves, both of themselves into the, into the medical center at, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] to get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and, and can they stay there indefinitely?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can that, is that?  I don't know is that a long term stay place or is that a —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, they can't stay indefinitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They have to go into assisted living.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, how do you feel like you're holding out in terms of your mood?  Any periods of manias or elevated mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you know a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I do, yeah.  I saw here a note that you, that they did a telemedicine thing with  [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he was one of my instructors at [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they think that I'm depressive, and I don't know about changing my medicine, my GlycoLax and my Haldol, and my —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, so tell me they, they wrote on here that he had some suggestions, and they're going to be sending me report?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But did they get into any details with you about what he thought would be helpful or changes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the Haldol, the, the lorazepam, and the GlycoLax —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Were, they think I'm kind of depressive.  I'm too depressive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But what do they think about those medicines?  They think you should be off of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that I'm not sure of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So tell, when you say the Haldol, the Ativan, and the GlycoLax what, what did they —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I think it's the opposite of what [NAME OTHER] wanted to do.  What's it, what, what, are the medicines [INAUDIBLE] information in there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, I'm sorry [PATIENT NAME] I'm not sure that I'm tracking.  I know what you're taking and that does include the Haldol, the Ativan, but did they specifically mention it, did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] mention those medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, Ativan?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lorazepam, yes they did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what did he say about them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they thought that I was too depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, do you, what do you feel about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I sure would like to, uh, have not every day be such a long day for me.  I always, uh, end up very, very tired no matter how I start.  I've been sleeping well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when I get up and get going I'm very, very tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum, and, and I know they've mentioned it because we had lowered dosages last time, that maybe you're a little less tired than you have been.  Does that seem accurate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What does it say in the paper there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it just says that, that you'd talked to the people at, at, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], and that they'll forward some recommendations once received.  Um, that you haven't been as tired since the last medication change, and they said that it still seems like you're kind of struggling at times to really participate in any of the activities out at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm not sure, like I said I'm very, uh, depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do feel very depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do feel very depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even though I'm really looking forward to my daughter coming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's real about that.  I can't believe that how excited I'm going to be when I actually see her, when she sees me.  I can hardly believe it, but, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, do you, is, is the depression at all, feeling like life isn't worth living?  Is it involving suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Do you have things in the day that you do look forward to, that you do enjoy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I look forward to a malt I'm having tonight, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if you can tell, I've lost a lot of weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you, no you do look you, are you getting some exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tomorrow we're going to the Y.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where are you going to, to Curves or are you going to just to the Y these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I haven't been to the Y since this time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So tomorrow they're planning on going to the Y.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, one of the, yeah one of the thoughts that I have, [PATIENT NAME], in terms in trying to treat kind of depression and bipolar illness —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Schizophrenia, I have that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, is, is trying to, uh, is trying to probably get you on a little bit higher level of your, um, your Depakote, again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know it's a, I'll be curious to see what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] has to say.  I certainly respect him as a clinician.  I think one of the limitations may be at their system is that, you know, they didn't request any records from me, and you've got a long history with us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, for example he may be looking at your Depakote level and saying that it's a little bit on the low side, it is a touch on the low side, but what, what I know from your past experiences, you're not going to tolerate running you on, on very high levels.  You may tolerate bringing the dosage up a little more, and I think there's some room for that, but, you know, in theory we'd like to treat, see people, with, with Depakote at a level of say 80 to even 110 if they're tolerating it.  You haven't tolerated blood levels that high, and if, if [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] doesn't know that, for example, one of the things that he may look at and say well you might be able to eliminate some of these other medicines if you get the Depakote level up.  Well that's all well and good, but we, we've been there.  He may look at the Haldol and wonder about stopping the Haldol over the longer term or, or reducing some of the dose, but again, you know, what —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's, I know he specifically, I don't remember him mentioning Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I don't know either, like I said, what he may not know either in as much detail, and that's still unsure as well, something that you remember in your mind and something that I remember definitively is the long hospitalization that you had a couple of years ago, and one of the things that really seemed to be the difference in terms of finally breaking that up, is that in my mind was the Haldol, out of all the things that you tried during those, you know, really a few months —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so I, I, again there's some, there's some, well, I, let's read what he has to say and we'll go from there.  I think that we have some good options for treating depression yet for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you know, one of the, one of the things that, um, that I, I would like to do though is, is I think trying to get your Depakote dosage up just a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Makes sense, and again I'd like to do it, given your sensitivity to some tremor and to some sedation, just a touch conservatively, but bring it up, um, at least 250 mg here, and, uh, and I, and I think it would be okay to try to raise your Celexa dose just a little bit too.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would, um, I would do, I would kind of do both, um, and again, I think that's a good kind of double approach both in terms of being protected and being sensitive to somebody that we don't want to, you know, we don't want to induce manias but I understand that depression is, is the real burden of this illness, and we got to treat it more effectively for you.  Do you feel like at, at this point other than the sedation, do you feel like you're having any side effects from what we're treating you with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure.  I have, I have, still have the tremor a little bit, but, but like I say, I start out in the morning with a lot of energy and then now, now I lose a lot of energy because it's, uh, I feel tired right away even though I gotten a lot of sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't like the Activity Director.  That has something to do with it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, I do understand that's never a good thing.  Do they do, I mean do you skip the things that you might even enjoy because you don't like the Activity Director?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's because I can't stay awake.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, the, how do you feel like you're doing with just anxiousness, nervousness through the day [PATIENT NAME]?  Is that, is that bothersome yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  I have to admit it does, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you think that's any worse since we lowered the Ativan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's the Ativan?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry, that's lorazepam, that's the one you get in the morning, in the afternoon, and at bedtime.  It's a small pill —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For kind of an anti—anxiety medicine, but we cut the dosage in half about, uh, three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the, with the telephone call, yeah, yeah because [NAME OTHER] thought that you seeing in therapy, seemed a little bit sedated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think that's a good thing, that hasn't been a good thing for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well no, I'm saying, I, excuse me, I think it has been a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  We've got you on just a real low dose of it, um, one of the, one of the things I think we could do is if you really are, if you're still feeling pretty tired, is we could discontinue your, the oral Haldol, the pill form —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And in a couple of weeks, we might be able to lower the Ativan then.  I would be in kind of inclined to let the Haldol get all out of your system before we maybe tried going without the Ativan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, because I, I think, you know, again I know you've had some kind of stiffness and some restlessness with the Haldol if we haven't, I mean the Cogentin that you're giving, that you're getting at night —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Also helps with that.  The Ativan helps too, and I know that again in the past we've see you kind of restless and pacing if we've been too aggressive with your Haldo, but I think if we eliminate it and give it just a little bit of time to get out of your system, then we might create a little bit more room to stop the Ativan and again that might, both those may be some factors in helping you feel a little bit more wakeful, you know, through the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what I'm going to tell them is we're going to adjust your Celexa up, little bit to 30 mg.  We're going to increase your Depakote just by 250 mg at bedtime.  We're going to stop the pill form of Haldol that you take and still continue the injectable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  I thought I was taking the injectable, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are getting the injectable, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, but you're, now you're giving it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're getting, you're getting a real low dose pill form and the injectable form of Haldol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, my thoughts are clear though, but, uh, that may help things, I know that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] mentioned Haldol —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, and GlycoLax too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that ones not a medicine I'm prescribing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's coming, that's coming from whoever's, whoever the primary care doctor is out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know who that is?  Do you ever see him, anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A primary care doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, him.  It's been a long time since I've saw him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] decided that I didn't need to see him.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just decided I didn't need to see him.  That, uh, uh, that I didn't need any tests or anything done by him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long you think it's been since you've seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four weeks, at least.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just been a month since you've seen him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's been longer than that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think eight weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just a couple months since you've seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Okay, so he's still regularly involved in your care?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well then —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They took what he recommended and then didn't have me go back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's, yeah, he's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, and I understand, so it may not be that you any, but, you know, probably seeing your internist, I understand there are real no acute internal medicine problems, but yeah I, I guess my thought would be just seeing him at least once a year is reasonable, but it sounds like you're keeping some regular contact.  It's just not, you haven't seen him in a couple of months is all, you know, if you have problems they'll, you can get back out to see him too, and I'm going to have them, [PATIENT NAME], fax the report from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] when they get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I saw [NAME OTHER] who was in charge of it, getting me, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said that they wouldn't be sending it until, he wouldn't be, it wouldn't be ready until the next time I see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Do you know, do you know the nature of this project?  Will, will he, will they, will doctor, will you see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Somebody else was seeing him this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So does he actually come in and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I saw [NAME OTHER] this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does he come, does he actually come in, in person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's a telecommunication thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, sure they do it by that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Telepathic airways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They do it by that ICN network.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you're making some, some definite changes?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm making some definite changes, and I've made notes for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then I'll ask them to check a level of your Depakote in a week after we've made that change, okay [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And otherwise, you're really in pretty good shape in terms of your labs.  Um, I don't think there's anything we need to do because in February we got everything and everything looked good.  Uh, and so we're, um, I think the only thing I haven't checked is just, uh, we'll check a Depakote level and platelets and then, uh, we'll make you that, I'll give you, you want me to put this back in the envelope for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, I'd like to see you if he's changed a few, I want to see you back in a month, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll, we'll keep on track again.  I though I think —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can we possibly make it six weeks?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really, make it longer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I, because in July I don't know what kind of chore I'm going to have until it gets closer.  Until, nothing like I said that, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Activity Director hates me and I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I, I, don't believe she hates you.  I believe that they may want to be encouraging you to do things —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that sometimes creates tension.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But like I said take an objective look at what the activities are, and, and if it looks like it could be fun, give it a try.  Most of the people I know when they go out and do some of those things extra, they're pleasantly surprised that there was some enjoyment to it that they didn't anticipate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so we're talking five weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I told them, well I told them six weeks, but I know that you're, you know, they're keeping track of things there too, so if, if there are problems you call me sooner, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, hope you enjoy the, hope you enjoy the anniversary and the, and the visit from your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

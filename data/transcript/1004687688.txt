<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how I said I wasn't applying for teaching positions because it would be too much. Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have to guess where this going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) There's an opening—or there might be an opening. There's nothing posted—the job isn't posted at least—for a part-time biology teacher at a school nearby. And I saw it and I was, like, this is exactly what I wanna do. This is exactly what I want. I have to apply for this. And I've been kind of freaking how since then. I applied, I mean, I sent in the application this morning. [00:01:03]</p>

<p>It's, like, you know how usually you have emotions and you kind of have a good sense where they come from? This has been, like, all over the map and I have no idea or, like (laughs) I have, like, most of the last 24 hours trying to figure out, "Why am I having a panic attack now?" I really don't know. Why am I really, really happy, and then I'm crying, and then I'm happy again? And I'm really excited about this, but.... so, I'm—yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>It's—I'm really scared. I'm so scared of this, but I really want it. [00:01:55] I mean, I think, oh, I could be doing this, instead of anything else. Why would I do anything else other than teach? Like, there's nothing else I want. (pause) But it's hard for me—but I don't connect, like, who I am now with who I was when I was teaching, you know. So one day I think, well, I can be successful at this. I'm a good teacher. When I asked my—the head of my department if she would be a recommendation for me she said, "Yes, you are the best natural teacher I've seen in her first year." I'm—and—but I'm such a different person now, and if I fail at this, then I won't have anything else to say, "This is something I can do." [00:02:57] But I can't let being afraid keep me from doing the things I wanna do. And also, I don't even know—if this position is open, I should get an interview. I'm more than qualified. I'm more qualified than they're asking for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What sort of school is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a private school, boarding (inaudible at 03:29), Catholic. Affiliated with the Catholic church. So, they have, like, mandatory religion classes that have to teach. But they're on, like, a Catholic school—well, sort of like, Catholic schools. But it's more kind of religious studies than religion, you know. [00:03:58] It's a mission that I really believe in, that I think, you know—there are very, very few places in this country where people can learn that a religion is something that has to do with the mind as well as belief. That it's about thought. It's not just about, you know, whatever faith means. People don't think that it's appropriate to exercise critical thought in the domain of religion. It's really, like, that's what I wanna do with my life, (pause) is teach that. That's really scary, you know. It's like, this is what I really wanna do with my life and then I feel, what are you talking about? You don't have a future. [00:04:55]</p>

<p>I don't (pause)—I mean, I can't get out of bed just some days. Or, I always can get out of bed, but sometimes I can't get much further (laughs). And I don't—It's like there's this idea of myself doing this thing I love and that I'm good at, and that maybe now I have an opportunity to do. It's the same kind of story as reading Jane Eyre the other day. Like, it has the same level of reality for me. So how do I take action based on that? I mean, obviously I did, but (pause) I don't know. I'm really scared. (laughs) [00:06:05]</p>

<p>I've taken, like, three doses of Xanax's in the last two days. (laughs) Usually, I take one like once every couple of weeks (laughs). It sort of helps, but not really. But, there's been a lot of, kind of, panic that it's hard to tell where it's coming from. Or—[00:06:46]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I get that you've really been kind of at loose ends over this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, in some instincts I really trust. And when I see something, I say, "This, this is what I want." I go after that. I have to say, yeah, go for it. Do it. [00:07:59] And then sometimes that works out really well. I kissed James. That worked out really well (laughs). Sometimes, it doesn't work out very well. Like, I got a dog. That was not a good experience (laughs). But I don't (sighs). Yeah, this feels like the sort of thing—because it scares me, I should push for it. (pause) That [that means] (ph) it's a risk that's worth taking. But it's still scary. [00:08:53]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I had to turn in the application today. It'll probably be like every application I've turned, in which I didn't fear anything at all, ever. So (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Or yet.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Or yet.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I talked about it with James for a while, last night. [00:09:57] And, you know, [I both] (ph), you know, talked about it with him today. Like, "Is this an insane idea?" And he said, "No, no. It seems like a great idea." So I said, "Okay, thanks." You know, like reality check accomplished. And then I—when I talked to him last night, I was really upset it and trying to, kind of, explain some of that. Took a while, but I think it got there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like, I sort of get the impression that (pause), like, the way—maybe I'm misreading (ph) it—but the way that you're talking about it with me, what you're feeling, has been like about the job. [00:11:05] (pause) It feels a little like jumping out of an airplane. Where on one hand, I think that at some level—probably not so much consciously, cuz consciously, you know, this is not likely to happen—but, I'll reassure you, and I'll come up with some explanation for what's going on. And why you feel these very confusing (pause), varied, shifting ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I've thought about it a lot. [00:12:02] And I feel like I can kind of say, well, I feel this, and this, and this, and this. And that sort of makes sense. Then I don't know where to go from there. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does feel to me like you're sort of looking pretty intensely for something in the moment, from me, to help you feel better. Because you're so intensely, like, distressed, distraught, over what's happening with this. And I guess (pause) or I think that somewhat [that's probably] (ph) how you feel about this job itself—which feels like jumping out of an airplane. Like, I mean, it's exciting, and what you love to do, but you don't know whether it's, sort of, kind of something that'll catch you, or you'll just keep falling. [00:13:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's more like—I don't—it's more like the disconnect between what I feel is going to happen and what I think is going to happen. It's just really expanded. You know, there's always a disconnect but ahh ... With this, I feel like (pause) realistically, I might get the job. If I don't, it doesn't have anything to do with me. And if I do get it, I'll do a good job and, you know, work out the logistics. And it'll be a good experience and it'll be probably a positive thing. What I feel like is going to happen is, I'm going to fail at something that I care really deeply about. [00:14:05] And (pause) everything is just going to get even worse. And the world will end. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like you knowing that your chute will open, but feeling like maybe it won't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I don't know, maybe, like, not that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, pretty much. It's—and I mean, I don't—I'm not sure what I'm looking for from you here. I'm just (pause)—this is what I gotta talk to—who I have to talk about today. (laughs).</p>

<p>You know, I don't (pause)—I don't think anybody can help me with any of this, so (pause) I don't—[00:15:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not—I don't think it's—I generally don't think it's possible to feel something very, very intensely, and not want somebody—want something from somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fair enough, yeah. It's like, I want you to fix it, but I want everybody to fix it. (laughs) But the things that I want don't happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's (pause) a real problem, that it doesn't mean you want them any less, I guess it's (inaudible at 16:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I know—I guess what I'm kind of getting at is that I feel like if I tell you this, and if I want you to fix it, that will make it not happen. That will make it so that nothing—so that I don't get better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree. I'll make your chute doesn't open.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I'll be a bit (inaudible at 16:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) You're fine. Yeah, but it's not you. It's just the way my life works. (pause) Everybody's trying to help me. (crying) [I know you're helping me] (ph). Which is not truly true, but it feels like that a lot of the time. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's say it's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) You know, I do feel like meeting with you is really helpful for me, but I don't feel better. [00:17:10] And I don't know why it's helpful. (pause) Yeah, I have to just keep going, but it's not like I'm going anywhere. I don't feel like there's any place for me to go, you know? James said, last night, like, "We'll get you through this Tanya." And I said, "No, I don't believe you." Then he said, "That's OK." (laughs) "You don't have to." Which was the right thing to say, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of the reality of how you feel at the same time. [00:18:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Do you have any more thoughts about (pause) how I'm not helping you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it seems unfair to take this to you, because you're helping me more than anybody. (laughs)</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not surprised that's your first thought. But I appreciate your (inaudible at 18:47). (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (laughs) (pause) I just—it feels like none of this touches what's actually wrong, like, none of what we talk about. And sometimes we talk about what's actually wrong, but that doesn't (pause)—you know, it's like walking around the Washington Monument three or four or seven or ten times. The Washington Monument is still there. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 19:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very good, not at all. (pause) But, you know, I mean, and then there's no clear cause and effect. Because a lot of times, I leave therapy and I spend the rest of the day feeling worst. But sometimes I feel better, and often, you know, if we go, like, five days or six days between meetings, I feel worse in that time. But I also feel like there's something I'm should be doing here and I can't figure out what it is (crying). And I'm, like, I'm not doing it right, or (pause) it's just stupid. But that's how I feel. [00:20:43] (pause) You know, it feels like nobody can help me because I am the only depressed person in the world who is beyond help. Or who is untouchable in that way. (pause) It's just something I don't like to say out loud (laughs) because that feels very selfish to me. And it has no basis in reality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) you're really feeling, really, kind of (pause), I guess guilty and at-fault. And maybe a bit aggrandized (ph) in a way that nobody would necessarily wanna be aggrandized (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Well, you know, it's nice to be special for something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. But (long pause) [00:22:11]. I wonder if, you know, in addition to feeling guilty—cuz you don't wanna make other people feel bad and other people are helping or trying, or trying to be there—that you also—you're angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am. (pause) I'm more angry that people told me that I could get better, and that I'm not getting better. You know, I'm angry because everybody says, "This is the thing that works," you know, everybody has the treatment that they believe in. [00:23:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, everybody's gotta like something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's great, but I (pause), you know, unless I agree with you because you say, "Oh, I don't know what's wrong." (laughs) That makes me feel a lot better.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Correct (ph). I believe that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what, I'm angry at the people [on my plane] (ph), because every time I told them, no, this CPT (ph)—you know, what is it, this is thing about changing your thoughts—this doesn't work for me. This is not working for me. They said, "That's just because you're not doing it enough," and "That's just because you're not doing it well enough," or "That's just because you have to wait," or "Maybe it's just helping a little bit and you don't notice yet." I'm like, no, bull, it is not working. It is, in fact, making me worse. (laughs) I mean, I know I kind of, over a while, that it is making me worse. Or at least the way that I have gotten used to it. [00:24:48]</p>

<p>(crying) Yeah, I kind of just want everybody to leave me alone and let me die.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>(inaudible at 25:20)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 25:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to die. I want to, and it's hard to love yourself and all of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you can—clearly, you can have both. You know, you can have the wish to die, the wish that everybody would fuck the hell off, and let you just be gone. And the knowledge, or the—that's actually a (inaudible at 26:00) to do— and that in addition to wanting it, you also don't want it. I think you can—I don't know why I feel this way—but I think you can pull through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that is exactly what it feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you got very private intensity. Have you wished for that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just—I'm also just really angry that I can't have that. That I can't—that I know what this is, and I'm going to (inaudible at 26:50) and it's never going to be kill myself. But I am just gonna keep going. (pause) Like I said, I don't see myself with a future, but I'm gonna keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, that's the thing, that if you were really gonna do something for yourself, that you would do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now, anyway. But I mean, I can't hold on to (inaudible at 27:37). You know, there's always a 50 percent chance that in two hours, I will have forgotten that I felt this way today. And that makes me angry at myself because it's like—that makes all of everything less real, if it doesn't last. You know, how could anybody take me seriously as a depressed person when, at least a third of the time, I don't feel like there's anything wrong with me. (laughs) I don't know. Then also, why is nobody taking me seriously? (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are we failing to take you seriously?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're not. (laughs) You're just not. I think it's... People tell me to try this, people tell me to believe, people tell me, "Oh, maybe your vitamin D deficiency has something to do with it." People say, "Oh, how you considered the fact, you know, that your (inaudible at 29:08) there's a thyroid problem? Maybe that's why you're depressed." To me, that's sounds like not taking it seriously.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think these parts of you really go away. I understand that you feel completely different at different times, and not only that, but also don't have access to how you felt before. But I don't think that means they're really gone. [00:30:09]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to say to that.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think [deep in there] (ph) this part of you is always there. It's not usually that far away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really not that far away. [00:31:02] (pause) But then, by the same token, I mean, the part of me that really loves my life, it's still not that far away. You have to say it works. What? (laughs) You do. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I'm not necessarily [attesting to] (ph) that, there was just something about how you asserted it that I guess struck me. [00:32:01]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, I mean, I know—I can predict—if I get an interview for this job—I know that I'm going to in there, I'm going to be very confident, and I'm going to very bubbly, and they're going to like me. And it's going to go really well. (pause) And every time that I tell somebody that I'm depressed, what they express is surprise, you know. And well a lot of people think, "But you're always so happy." Less so recently, but just kind of as a [life-long thing] (ph). (pause) And it's not like I'm being fake, I don't—it's not as though I'm pretending to be happy. [00:33:09] (pause) I guess one of the things that I'm just afraid of is that if I stop being so sad, will I also stop being so happy? You know, the thing that's been really scary to me about the last few months is kind of thinking that I'm just not feeling much of anything. That's worse than—that's the worse. I don't want that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said that. (pause) That is the worse, when you're not feeling anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's much more bearable, but it's... [00:34:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't make it manageable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's, like, that's not who I am. That's not who I want to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually, there's sometimes isn't, but out of respect for you and (inaudible at 34:45), that's because (pause) there's something going on inside that's intense you can't bear it then, for some reason. Kind of already said that, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. And certainly, I mean, when I do feel bad, it feels like I'm not going to be able to bear it. Like, it feels like I'm going to go insane or die. (pause) But I never do. I doubt that part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (audio skips) (inaudible at 35:40). And it seems to get to a point where, like, something in your mind just [sort of] (ph) shuts it down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more like it's—I see it coming (inaudible at 35:55). And, like, I just don't think about the things that are going to make me sad. Or I just don't—[I was able to bear] (ph). And then I find that I can't [really bare] (ph). I don't know. (pause) I'm such a mess. And, you know, I feel like how dare I apply for this job, how dare I (inaudible at 36:47), I'm not gonna be able to handle it anyway. (pause) But I have to. (pause) You know, I don't choose [for shut me down] (ph). Even though, I mean, sometimes it does and I don't get the chance to choose, but I don't want that. (pause) Sorry, now I'm going in circles. I guess some of them didn't make it out. (laughs)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's hard to stay with how bad it can feel, especially when you're with someone else, and then talking to someone else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I shut it down when I'm with other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, even if we're talking and you get upset, like, I feel like either, you know, you kind of say something on the other side of me, or take a more positive view. Or you say something I feel like, uncommonly, is bit of a bid for me to say something like that. And which people in your life probably very kindly often respond to very sensitively. Like a minute ago, you said something about, you know, "How dare I," something like, "How dare I apply for this job." I imagine that, you know, (pause) socially, people usually respond with (inaudible at 39:22).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that kind of reassurance really doesn't help. (laughs) It really just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. We both wish it did. But I think it's—my point is—[if I make you do that part] (ph) like (inaudible at 39:44). (pause) Really hard to stay with it how bad it feels, especially when you're with someone else.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I (pause)—I want you to help me. There is nothing to be done. [00:40:58]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I'm like, it stinks to just say, I'm putting this away now. [And take it away somewhere] (ph). But what else am I gonna do? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 41:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, why put it away? I mean, I can imagine if you have a reason, [but you're only 20] (ph) (inaudible at 42:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, nobody other than me is actually interested in seeing it. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad we're clear of that. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Spirally (ph), I just can't hold on to it. It just goes away. (pause) It comes out when somebody else is around. It comes out and it stays (inaudible at 42:37) with me when I'm (inaudible at 42:38) by myself. And I can't get rid of it. But other people are more interested in it. (laughs). Like, I would be just having a conversation—with my (inaudible at 42:52).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no, no, I (pause)—I think you would and you wouldn't. I mean, I think there's a way in which you don't really want the people close to you to really know, but really, like, as much as you don't, and as much as you, I think probably, like, shift things or change focus, or put it away because you get responses that I think are quite hurtful. I mean, in other words, kindly meant but not helpful, and that are actually probably sometimes really hurtful in that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because if somebody's trying to help me, and they say something that makes things worse, whose fault is that? In my mind, it's my fault. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What? No. Yeah, sure, your fault, and you feel guilty. You're probably always gonna feel a little frustrated about it. Makes you feel even worse. Yeah, I mean, it's just—so, I—granted (ph) this whole (inaudible at 44:26) had something to do with why you... We're gonna stop for now. We'll talk more on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have a good weekend (background noise)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm not going to be here Monday, because this stupid lady made plans to go out of town and come back on Tuesday. I think we'll reschedule for (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not very necessary, I know, thanks for just [putting it out there] (ph).</p>

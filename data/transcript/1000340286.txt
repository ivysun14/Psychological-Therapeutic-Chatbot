<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (10-minute silence) I'm finding it hard to start because what's on my mind is something that I don't want to say because it's something I'm sorry I did.  And I foresaw I'd do it and I still did it, which makes me feel even worse about it.  Because I can see how I could have prevented doing it.  And when I first started thinking it, when I came in here, I was sort of annoyed because I guess I had tried to just put it out of my mind.  And then I began to think of ways that I could say it so that, I don't know, I could sort of excuse myself.  So there must be something about saying it and it's not only what I think of myself but what you'll think of me that bothers me about saying it.  But it's related to, uhm, the fact that I had the boys in the other class yesterday.  And today I saw the teacher of that class.  And I had decided that I wouldn't say very much to her about it because I knew if I said much it would be for the wrong reasons.  And she asked me how it went and I just went ahead and said everything that I had decided I wouldn't say.  And although I could admit and see where I had made certain mistakes, my attitude was more that the children were not being handled too well.  And I was being very subtle in my conveying this to her.  And, and even when I was doing it I wanted to stop and I just couldn't seem to stop myself.  And I sort of built myself up and put myself in the position of knowing more and giving her advice.</p>

<p>And the only good thing about realizing this is later in the day she was depressed anyway about the class and this, I might have made her more depressed by what I said but it didn't have any, that much to do with it.  And she wanted to talk to me about it and I restrained myself, that time, from launching off into all sorts of advice and just asked her what was troubling her.  Because usually I don't even do that, I'll just start giving advice because it makes me feel good.  (Pause) And I often do something like this when I, I can think perfectly well how I'd feel if somebody did it to me and yet I know I can get away with it because it's being done subtly enough so that the person can't really think you have such horrible motives.  And then I just despise myself for doing it, that I'm so weak that just the things that upset me that other people do, I'll do back.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose the other thing about giving advice — I don't, I haven't really thought about it and I'm, might be making something out of this that isn't there but when I said aloud that I just wanted to give advice, it made me think of my father and how he loves to give advice for everything.  And I was just thinking of my reaction to the way he does it and how, so much of the time now, it annoys me, partly because his advice might have nothing to do with it and partly because I know why he's doing it and it annoys me that he's pretending it's for another reason or that he's even fooled himself.  And I just, because this annoys me, I don't want to be doing the same thing that he does that annoys me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So then there are 2 things, at least, that trouble you about what you did to the teacher.  One of them, that you did say some of the things to her that you were telling me about yesterday.  And if I hear you correctly, then the other one is that you were subtle about it and hid your motives.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, making, making it seem like I was just being very nice and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Sort of giving her a little advice and my greater experience, which isn't really true.  We've a—, we have about the same amount.  (Pause) I don't know, perhaps I'm fooled but I think she went away thinking I was trying to be helpful and, and that wasn't at all why I did it.  Although I made it seem as if that was.  (Pause) And at the very end of the day, when she wanted to talk to me about it and, and this time I waited until she told me what was bothering her and I didn't jump her on talking about it.  Uhm, and, and then when I made suggestions that she was asking for, I could feel how I just loved giving this advice and how I was just kind of, it was again getting out of hand, that I could have gone on forever, way beyond what she really wanted.  So again I was just, I began to just think of me and satisfying myself and not really helping her.</p>

<p>And I think, I don't know, I just was thinking about this and it must function in what I do with her, too, to some extent.  When she began at the school 4 years ago it was my first year there too.  And we were both assistant teachers.  And at the beginning of the year she was much more relaxed than I was and was much more successful with the children.  And in her relationship with her, the teacher she worked with she was much more successful than i.  And so I imagine I've always been sort of jealous of her even though by the end of the year I was doing as well.  And then the other thing is that she used to go to the supervisor then and often say, "Well, look what I've done and see my wonderful ideas."  And she had her own way of defending herself and getting attention for things she did.  And sometimes they were things that she had seen us doing and then had copied.  And I didn't realize this during the year but the girl I worked with was very upset that the credit was going to somebody else rather than to us.  And sometimes they were ideas I had initiated so she made it seem like she was trying to protect me, although really it was for her own, it was because it was her room and these ideas were being credited for another place.  But I just began to f—, get this feeling about this girl that the way she, I don't know, plays the game, I guess, is somewhat differently than I do.  And I hadn't, except for maybe feeling she had been more successful at the beginning, I hadn't really felt that defensive with her or competitive.  But this, when I knew she'd be coming back as the teacher this made me dread it a little bit because I was afraid it would make me feel quite competitive.  And anyway, I would have just because of the fact she'd be the other teacher, and I always feel I have to kind of prove myself too in comparison to her, whoever it is.  And so with this background, I think it might have made it even worse.</p>

<p>And yet on the other hand, I want to fight this because even if she is doing things that are a little bit behind my back, I don't know whether she is this year, but even if she were, I don't really want to play the game the same way.  And yet I'll keep doing little things like that to kind of make my position stronger and weaken hers.  And I'm, well, it's not constantly but there are times when I have to stop myself from doing something which would be just so I can feel I'm in a more advantageous position.  And it, it, sometimes it confuses me too because I like her and, and there are times when I sincerely want to be helpful and where I don't want to feel competitive and where I'd like to feel that both she and I can do what we feel is best for our own rooms and that nobody is going to compare us.  But then some little thing will happen and I'll start feeling the other way.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And somewhere, confused in this, I don't know exactly how, is an attitude I have which I think comes from an attitude my mother has of, ah, being, if, if you are standing for what you believe and saying what you believe, then people should take you on that face value and, I don't know, somehow simplifying things.  And, I don't know, she was one day talking about Mrs XMH in PNOTS and how she used to be in favor of neighborhood schools and then everybody crucified her, is my mother's words, for this position.  And now of course everybody that once crucified Mrs XMH is now in favor of neighborhood schools.  And I could see when my mother was talking and other times, too, when she talks that she is simplifying it in that it depends partly on how you say something or how Mrs XMH said it and the fact she might not have considered other groups and, of course, also her motivations anyway.  And I think I'm doing something of this simplifying too in expecting if I act in good faith others should realize this and treat me accordingly.  And somehow I have this feeling that really what I would have done, or do do at times, is just act in, in a sort of naive way or simple way.  And so I'll swing from being like that where I am not trying to do anything to affect anybody else, to being very defensive because I'll realize that something's not quite right.  Or maybe it's that I would like to act that way and I don't ever, I don't know. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just thought of something that bothered me the other day too.  I realized it after I'd left here.  But sometimes I feel very unhappy about what I'd been saying and I think it comes from a vague sense that I'm just kidding myself with what I'm saying.  And then I think of the fact that you must see through it all and here I go on and on and eventually I see through it too but it just makes me feel kind of stupid.  Because really, when I think about it, I act most times out of feeling very defensive and not for any other nice altruistic motive at all.  (Pause) Because I was thinking even when I'm fairer with my assistant and sort of hold back a lot of the meaner things I could be doing to her and let her do more things and sort of restrain myself, then of course things become more pleasant.  But, I don't know, it just seems to me I'm doing it more because then things are more pleasant and I enjoy it more than for her sake.  Or I might think, "Well, I have been awfully unkind to her or I haven't been letting her do things so I really should do it now or else she'll begin to think me awful."  And so it's to keep her from thinking things that are too terrible about me. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I don't know whether this is really true but I sometimes will tell myself this is my attitude, that if I do do something nice for a selfish reason then it will bother me.  And it will seem to me that that's all anybody ever does, however nice they might be or unconcerned with themself (sic), that they're really doing it just to please themself (sic).  I remember it used, when I was younger it used to really annoy me that people would praise Albert Schweitzer so much because it always seemed to me that he did what he wanted to do and what gave him pleasure.  And, I don't know, I suppose I distinguished then and made it a good kind of selfishness but still, that's all it seemed to me it was.  And for some reason, this whole thing has always disturbed me.  (Pause) And I (laughs) think that sometimes I try to get off the subject of myself just to make it seem I'm not so stupid.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You're worried that I think you're stupid too.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Sometimes I am, yes.  (Pause) Because I was thinking about how I reacted, I guess it was Monday.  And I don't know whether what I was saying was a little bit worse than sometimes I say as far as deluding myself or just rattling on.  But for some reason it bothered me very much that I was talking that way, and I was just very self-conscious then.  And then other times I can talk on and on and I won't be at all self-conscious about it, then, and that for that reason I won't even think about how you might be reacting.  Or else I'll think maybe you're reacting with disapproval because I was bad, but not stupid.  Maybe it was a hangover from the weekend too because that is sort of the feeling I get when I'm home, that everybody's watching everybody, waiting for somebody to be stupid and then everybody else can make fun of it or notice it or think to themself how stupid.  And I imagine I came away feeling I was stupid.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And again, there's something that often bothers me.  I was just thinking about, well, how did I get to have this attitude and I know perfectly well that it was something my father often said about anything any of us did.  If we made a mistake or something he didn't agree with, then we were stupid.  But then I think, well, what good does it know (sic) where it came from really, because if you know that it's there, it seems to be all that really counts.  And yet I'll still feel stupid when I'm around him or around anybody.  (Silence) I suppose that's basically what bothers me too about thinking if people look at me that, when I'm waiting outside here, that they know I'm having analysis and that, or even that they have heard what I've said and then they'll know how stupid I am.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How would they hear what you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think I still sometimes think other people would hear the recording.  And they always seem to look at me as if they know something more about me than they could from having just seen me sitting there.  And they're very, they always look to me as if they're being very curious.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you feel when you imagine that someone else has heard you?  I mean, you say, out there you feel self-conscious, but when you think about it now, how do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know exactly.  I feel I have an emotional reaction but I don't know quite what it is.  (Pause) I suppose, defenseless.  I don't, it doesn't seem quite right but — (pause) and it sort of makes me feel like crying.  I don't now, but I did when I said it.  (Pause) And I think there's something, too, in — I was just thinking how I would feel out while I'm waiting and how I'll sort of think, "Well, there's nothing I can do now because they know."  And I kind of accept this verdict that I assume they have, that I am stupid.  And then I'll, this, then I'll think sort of vaguely that I can't believe I'm really as stupid as I must appear.  And yet everything I do seems to make me appear very stupid.  And I suppose that's why I feel so upset that I'm as old as I am and am only what I am, that, I don't know, just that I could be something more and I'm not.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

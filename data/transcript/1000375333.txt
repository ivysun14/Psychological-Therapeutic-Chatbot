<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the fact that I came here is something we can discuss. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Puts it more together with the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's-I think I really meant-well I don't know. Because honestly to me is a vague and undefined term because I'm so dishonest so many times. But, I think really to me when I initially came in here it was that, the feeling that I... I was being dishonest with other people and that bothered me. But now, I think that really my whole purpose in coming here, was to become good at being dishonest. Rather than to stop. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it seems to you now that, you thought you were coming here for one reason but really you were coming here for the other reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's hard to say. It's been a while. And my head's been really twisted since I started coming here. And, it's hard to remember back exactly how I felt initially. But, yeah I don't think my motives were what I made them out to be. And now the question is what are, what are the alternatives. I mean how do I approach a thing now that I can look at it in a new light. I don't know if this is, new light number 36 in this conversation and there's going to be new light number 37 is going to throw it out the window. But I have to go with what I have now. [0:01:58.4]</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to assume that a person of 25 years old, cannot change much of his really deep life. I mean what really matters to him. I think it is reasonable though, that a person who's of my age, can begin to realize more and more his motives for why he does things and to live with them better. But it's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The terms of the way you are (inaudible at 0:02:33.8). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, so I think, rather than trying to-yeah I should realize why I act the way I do. I should be pleased with it, somewhat. If I'm not-then I've got another 50 years or however what the life expect-maybe five minutes but... that I could be miserable. Because I think it's very hard to change a lifestyle, completely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're-one of the things you're trying to figure out is how much can I change my lifestyle, and how much do I want to go the way of accepting the way it is. [0:03:12.8] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I-I don't know if-the first question is, is not, how much I want to accept it how much I want to change. But what are, the real alternatives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much can I.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah how much can I change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the feeling that you really can't change it much beyond a certain level. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I think there's this last little, thing that I've come up with this realization that this just fits in rather than fits out. What we're doing here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just it reaffirms a belief that my behavior patterns in my approach, my outlook is pretty much ingrained and hard to change. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems yeah. But this shows, that you can't really change it beyond a certain level. [0:04:02.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But that doesn't mean of course that, I can't be healthier, by looking at it in the right way and realizing what it is. Which is now I think probably the best thing I can do. So, just to, to realize that I'm going to behave in that particular manner and I'm going to always be cognizant of what other people think of me, either consciously or subconsciously. And to live with that. And try to decide what is a healthy way for me to act with that attitude. And try to decide what is, the way it's going to be the most comfortable for me and for other people. I think that's the task at hand. I don't think the task at hand is to change any motivations or, deep feelings that guide my life because I don't think it can be done. [0:05:17.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The task at hand is to, work with how you are basically and accept that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well a couple of really good examples is, the people I was with yesterday. I know a couple of them, and a little bit the other people. And they aren't really much like me at all. But I sort of fit into that pattern. And it was getting along pretty well. I don't think I ever had to come out and really lie. Just avoided any discussions that would make my true feelings come up. They were fascist rednecks is what they were. </p>

<p>But, you know I just tried to avoid-we talked about the Cubs instead of about, politics, which just can't be done. But I think that was just an example and now that I have time to think about how I interact and that I still do, this sort of dishonest interaction with people. Because my true feelings didn't come up, they didn't know what my inclinations. [0:06:26.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still do the dishonest-so what are you saying -  "I haven't made change?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah yeah. It's just another... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must be like you think, "I've been fooling myself all the time. Here I thought I was really doing something meaningful."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I was fooling myself-I just, I'm just amazed at my ignorance at not seeing how this fits. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems so clear now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It seems-well you see the thing is you can keep taking a set backwards, and looking at other thing that this transpired, and that it will all fit together. And when I first came in here I was taking a step backwards of everything outsides these doors, this door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not what was inside the room?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not what-"Why was this happening? Why are we-why am I discussing this? Why are you... Why?" But now, rather than doing that, I sort of sit back and say, "Well, let's look at everything." And now this fits in. And the fact that this fits in, lends new light onto everything. Everything outside the door and we in it. [0:07:44.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It changes the nature of the way you look at the whole thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah to a certain extent it... It-more-well it shows me that it's really hard to change a person, deeply. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's discouraging, in that sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if discouraging or encouraging are good words to hang onto it. Because see I don't know enough about it. I don't know enough about why anyone acts the way they do, much less myself. And-I look at it more as an observation rather than, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a new fact you learned. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About how you operate. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Operates a good-yes. A good word in that case. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how-it's like seeing something about yourself that you just didn't see before. How difficult it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now you see the thing is-maybe next time I'll come in and I'll go back another step and say, "Wow, look what happened last time." And I'll analyze what's happening this time, and that will all fit in. Then we'll just have to have an infinite number of sessions. But unfortunately that's not the case-well, fortunately or unfortunately I'm not sure which, that's not the case. But I think I'm pretty much back all the way now. [0:09:09.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think you have a pretty good understand-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think-yeah. I think the last thing that I could've looked at was us, what transpires here. And now I have looked at that. That's-I don't think there's anything that I've left out of any consequence. At least I've tried to make that effort. And I've made that effort honestly, because this is an honest effort to please other people. I mean it's just another hurdle. See it was a thing I found in my life that, that I didn't like. I wanted to show people that I was accomplished in human relations, too. It's just another accomplishment that I was driven to, achieve. So... [0:10:01.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well are you feeling more subdued in the way you're approaching it today? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see-I don't know if subdued is the right word. I think, I really approach it more comfortably. I enjoy the order of it. I don't-I'm-.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That fact that it fits in is where you're pleased. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't know, things, it would-that line has been said before. But... different levels of fitting things together. But I think this is, this is-makes things fairly complete.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and that feels good to have that complete.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hm. And now that it's- at this stage relatively complete, and motivations are clear, that is a good point to start to say, "Well now, what does one do." That hasn't quite, hasn't gotten square in my mind yet. I would be (ph) sort of pleased with figuring it out. What was I going to mention? Oh yeah I just-I don't know if it really matters a lot. I thought I might bring it up. Yeah, since the exam is over, I have imbibed somewhat and got stoned a couple of times. It was, it's a lot of fun. It really is. And we had, had some good times. </p>

<p>But afterwards when I was alone, I did notice the, this-I call the sexual problem creeping back into my life. And I don' t know whether it's, because I came here and decided it only happens when I'm stoned, or because there is something physiological that sort of, takes away inhibitions. But it-the fantasy did recur and there was the same sort of thing that happened before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it worried you. [0:12:23.0]</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not too much. I mean I'm not (inaudible at 0:12:25.6). So. I don't know if - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it didn't worry you then. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it bothered me a little. But, it seems so clear what the solution is. Just don't smoke. It's not big thing. I can get along without it. It doesn't matter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like that would be, easy just to stay away from smoking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But then, then of course the problem comes up, is what I'm really like, brought out because of the fact that I'm smoking? I mean if it were something that were, just happened that once or twice, I could see that I could usually write it off that it's something strange that is going on in my head because I'm all messed up. But the fact that it generally happens when I get stoned-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you say, "Is that what I'm really like? And it just comes out when I'm stoned." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are two possible answers. Number one that's what-what you just said. Number two, it happened once or twice when I was stoned. I came in here and decided, that's what caused it. And now I have it in my mind that that will happen whenever I get stoned. And therefore, whenever I get stoned, it happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it might be because you expect it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But - [0:13:40.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the more comforting way to look at it, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's more comforting. But, there is a more-well. Two ways of looking at it. Number one, the more comforting way is, what you just said. Number two is, that this is not really the best way to solve the problem is just not smoking. Well yeah it is the best way. It is the best way, as far as one shouldn't mess with one's mind, and things like that. But, it's not necessarily the best way it's going to make me feel, (inaudible at 0:14:19.4) with my solution. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't ease your mind about the whole problem-</p>

<p>CLIENT: No-see I can write it off somewhat this way, and go back to normal heterosexuality and not worry anything about any strange fantasies I have. But, I haven't really worked it out, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So somewhere it lingers (inaudible at 0:14:42.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Although, it bothers me not so much as, part of me as rather just that it's just another unsolved problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither am I really. Because it seems to be you know I have to bring something into my system in order for it to occur, it seems to be something that I can write off as not part of me too much. [0:15:21.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something strange or foreign. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and so, in that way, it could be just, those two cells in my brain happen to be close together and this chemical will join them. It's, perfectly reasonable explanation. You can-tell how much I know about medicine. It seems that could be the type of explanation it is, and if that's the case, why should I worry about some small membrane that some chemical is, moving up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should you be concerned about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah when all I have to do is avoid that chemical so... so, yeah. That's-I just thought I'd bring that up, not that I'm-I want to-I don't want to not discuss it because, I'm afraid of it or don't-can't think-well. One of the reasons I don't think I can figure it out. Number two is I don't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, that's one of the reasons you don't want to-</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a minor reason. The major reason I don't think there's any point in discussing it is I don't see it becoming a major factor in my life. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it isn't important. Or it isn't -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I-I don't see myself smoking much in the future. And therefore, I don't think it will occur. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then there's a little part that's sort of like really discouraged [I guess and that's saying] (ph), "I really can't do anything about it, even if I talk about it." [0:16:37.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not only can I not do anything about it, that's part o f it. The other part is that, I can't really figure it out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you can't-understand it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's, basically-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it's more, sort of beyond you, something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Beyond not only me I think, beyond medical science. Or, not even medical science. Beyond, well, the type of work you do. So, yeah, we're not going to figure out anything.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it's still kind of bothers you at the back of your mind, if not-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds like you kind of want it to bother me so we, have another, deeper problem to discuss. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well, it sounded-I guess it sounded to me like, I had the feeling that it bothered you more than you were saying I guess. Are you saying that's not true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'd like to think about this one a while. I hadn't even thought of bringing it up. But it has happened and that's why I brought it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But by thinking about it for a while you mean you'd like to, not talk about it, but-</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. We'll talk about it. I'll give you all my thoughts on it. It's just that I don't think we're going to come up with anything. It's... well I sort of... well. Well I mean, let's backtrack just a little. This would, this -the second half of the talk by the way was going to be another part of, another something that happened. I think I said I might as well do it now and then it will draw in better. [0:18:29.7]</p>

<p>June, got a hold of me and wanted to know how I did on the test. And she's taking a course that has some math in it. And with-the only intention of going-well we went out to the point, out here, at 55th street. The only intention was to help her with her math, exclusively and entirely, nothing else in my mind. And I haven't seen her in months and months and months. And, I.. and she ended up inviting me up for dinner. And lo and behold we ended up in bed again. Well, that-I don't know how it happened. I really-because there was absolutely no intent... in either of our minds I don't think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what are you saying, it surprised you or? [0:19:13.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, yeah because I thought it was, you know, I had this affair straightened out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it made you realize that you didn't feel so clearly about it as you thought, or if it.. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah or yeah. Yeah I mean I-I guess I just haven't got my sexual self all figured out is what it boils down to. That-see, when I can look at it rationally and be away from the problem, there's a logical solution that I'm not really being fair and honest to this girl. So I should not really in any way lead her on. There's just no way anything's going to happen. And yet, when we get together, something gels and I don't feel good about it when I get home. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like, somehow all your resolve, not to, do so-and-so when you're with her, changes when you're with her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you regret it after you leave. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because I feel so much like I'm taking advantage of her. Now especially. I've mentioned to you that I'm leaving in a year and going to Germany. And wow, there's just no way in the world that anything that's going to become serious. It just-that just solidifies it, period. There's just no way. Whereas before it's 99 percent sure, now it's like 100 percent sure. And so I really feel bad because I get the idea that, that she feels that way. She-I get the idea that she should feel that way. [0:21:04.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should feel what way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Should feel as though this would mean something. That this you know there could be something developing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean she should feel that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, yeah. I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. She's, somewhere in her early 30s and she's, not the type that messes around too much with guys. And, that I came into her life and it seemed as though, for a while she was much more serious about it than I. And then I sort of left it, and now we're back again. And wow. That's-although it's hard to do, visualizing myself as a single girl of that age which was pretty well off. Well, she's a bright girl and she's got a good job. And, I would think that, one of her intentions-and she really loves kids. I mean just, she's got nieces and nephews that she just talks about all the time. And she-I would think that one of the important things for her, would be to think about settling down. And there's just no way in the world that- well - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's going to work out. [0:22:24.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: With us. Yeah. And yet we're-we're really-well I suppose I'm the closest thing she's had to someone to whom-with whom she might settle down. I'm pretty sure about that. So, I feel bad, about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it makes you feel uncomfortable-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be in that kind of situation, and guilty, I guess. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other reason I wanted to bring that up now, was, that evening, and it's only-well yeah. I'm trying to get all the days straightened out. It's only been a week since the test. That particular evening, my mind was clear and straight and everything. And everything went fine. I mean and I just-nothing bothered me then (ph) sexually. And, the next evening, wasn't that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The (ph) next evening, things did bother you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, again had, problems with my mind, and had the same sexual problem recurring. It's not as though it's a problem when it occurs. It's a problem the next morning when you think about it, what you thought about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're thinking about it-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right now it's a problem. It isn't necessarily a problem when it happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it happens you're, enjoying it or (inaudible at 0:23:56.5). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah yeah yeah, it's... so you see I see two sides of me. One completely normal side, and the other side that - that can bother me. But then again I can just avoid the problem. Very easily just avoid it. So, as a matter of fact, I'm almost certainly going to-well, I see no-when-after I get to Germany I see no desire to get in trouble, being a foreign student in a foreign, in another land. So I'm not even going to-I don't think I'm going to speed much less try to - </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In any trouble? Any trouble?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I-you see there's always a risk of-there's always a risk of getting nailed for having some grass. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Getting busted. Having the police come in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh for grass you're talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so therefore, I see now that like-I'm not going to smoke much in the future and therefore I-and I'm certainly not going to smoke when I get to Germany so it's-it' s not something that's going to, happen. So... I can sort of write it off. [0:25:02.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can write it off and stop smoking and that will be the end of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Is that a good solution? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I-I guess you're wondering if it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm wondering what you think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wondering what I think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or is that pretty much like an easy way out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you think-it's an easy way out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I-I have two very strong conflicting opinions. Number one is that I really shouldn't be messing around with this stuff, and that serves me right. Number two is that this stuff is, is, is breaking down any inhibitions against 'normal' sexuality, that I have in my mind. And therefore that's more like me. And therefore, really, I'm avoiding something very very important. So either I'm avoiding something very very important or I'm messing around with a bunch of kid stuff and I should forget about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kid stuff meaning the grass? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I can't decide-and there's-[0:26:07.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't decide how seriously to take it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah although I know the solution, I can't decide whether or not it should (inaudible at 0:26:14.8). And now the point is-well is that the right way. Well I just wondered. I'm torn. I don't know what to think about - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You go back and forth. Is this just from the grass, and doesn't mean anything really about me. Or is it something really about me that just comes out? Or (inaudible at 0:26:38.7). </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just thought I'd wondered if you had an opinion as to, that. Because that-those are two are very different answers to a problem. I mean is there any, indication that one would be... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's see. I think the only way I can answer that is I think, how I would feel if it were me. Which is, I think it would be... I don't know. It's a complicated question. I think if it were me, personally, I would not be totally comfortable with just letting it drop. But on the other hand that would mean that I thought it was, a big part of me, that I'd want to explore it more, I think. If it were me. And I wouldn't - . [0:28:06.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just opens up so much more to explore, that's the problem. And I think that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's already too much or? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah there's a lot. I don't know if it's too much. Another thing about opening up more to explore, is that, I haven't, really dealt with-well I don't know if this is specifics versus generalities. No I guess that's not important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is there something about it's too much to explore all at once?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's just so-first of all, I think with, you know we could have a bevy of psychiatrists here, and they'd come up with-each one would have a different answer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're saying in all this, a lot of exploration leads to is just confusion. [0:29:21.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But then again, avoiding it is no solution either. As we've both pointed out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But very tempting I guess to avoid it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very easy. Well. That's-if I were-another thing. Here we go, here we go. I forgot. Here's motivation number three. Maybe I'm afraid of what I might find.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you're afraid to really look at it, afraid of what it might say about yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd see if I were just in Samoa now or somewhere I wouldn't have to worry and could just, behave sexually honest all the time and it'd be no problem. But, I just can't quite confront myself with, the sexual honesty involved. I mean if I really had to, figure it all out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The point in what you're saying-are you saying, "If it really turned out, that I wasn't just heterosexual, that I had other feelings, then, what on earth would I do with that?" [0:30:52.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good point that I used the world 'honest' there too. I think I have a lingering suspicion that avoiding it is not being honest. So, yeah but I mean, look at-since when is the last time we talked about this? Months and months and months ago. And, so, and it-I really think it's-there's a causal relationship between messing my mind up and having this recur. There's no doubt I think-well you see it could be causal because, yeah, it is causal. Granted it's causal. But is it causal because I expect it to be or because there is something chemical that causes it. I think we're really getting-maybe we wouldn't have this trouble if I weren't a scientist. Maybe I could look at it a little, a little better. But see, the stuff we've been talking about, seems to be pretty far removed from any, not necessarily scientific approach. Certainly it isn't. But, from any really basic understanding of the workings of what's happening. [0:32:32.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I - - what you're saying is like, this has more to do with chemistry than... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah this has more to do with-yeah see the other thing is in my head. And it's something I can straighten around in my head, something that we're not going to get to, really. Other than by talking about it. We're not going to be able to figure out why the brain does this particular thing. But now we're getting down to something that's very-we were talking more about feelings, previously, right? And attitudes and approaches. But now we're talking about actions, you know. And we're talking about-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're talking about actions? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh certainly. There are actions involved in-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just didn't know quite what you meant. You're talking about-what you would do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And we're also talking about introducing a, a matter-a (inaudible at 0:33:27.8) into my system. And what that does to me. And therefore it is now bordering on something that's-something that one could delve into with-well the [Masters and Johnson] (ph) approach rather, you know, rather than more of a scientific approach rather than - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you saying, something about, "Well I could talk about this in terms of - ." Well it's got to do with-the question is, "What does that drug do to me?" Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's not it. That's part of it. It's part of it. It's really hard to, put my feelings into words here. You see that-when we, all right, look here we are. It would, not be possible, for us to work together, on other parts of my life, what we've been working about before this last 20 minutes, without my being completely honest with you and telling you everything that's going on in my head. I mean I-however it would be possible, for a person to not talk to me, and give me this chemical and observe what reactions, take place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't depend on your being honest. [0:34:51.6] </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's a physical manifestation of something, that's going on in my head. And, It's- it's more-I think that, with the state of the art the way it is now-at least in my lifetime. It's something that insoluble, to figure out what happens. But it is something that I can visualize, people figuring out what's happening in there. What certain things to do certain people and why I'm behaving this way. However the, the other part, that we've been talking about. I can't visualize that being, put on good, firm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scientific basis. [0:35:45.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, scientific bio-chemical basis. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's something about the fact that this could be put on the basis-</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me want to stay away from it. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which makes you want to stay away from it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know what it is. Maybe I enjoy the, the other part. The fact that, you're really depending on me to tell you. Actually you're depending on me exclusively aren't you. You need to depend on me for, what happens to me, sexually. I mean it can be observed. It could be observed. It's physically possible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It somehow changes, our relationship? Or it changes something about, how important you being honest is or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Keep going. You haven't hit it yet. I don't know what it changes but it changes something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It changes something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then too maybe I'm just afraid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid because it could be objectively shown or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah afraid that, I'm not normal and I want to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And afraid that that might come out. You might realize that (inaudible at 0:37:11.2). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It's really confusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, it sounds like this area is a lot more charged. You might find out worse things-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or scary things, if you delved into this one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean-yeah. I could see, ideally I can see what's going to happen now is, it'll never happen again. And we have five more sessions left and everything will be straight and squared around. And I'll walk out of here, not necessarily a new man, but at least living with the old one. And, yeah, everything, you know-you get a gold start to put on your wall for having straightened me out. You know, I'll be really happy. I'll remember it forever and ever and indebted for life. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I could go into this and just get messed up more. And I could keep smoking and never figure it out. And, let it bother me and gnaw at me. Is it so bad to do the former. Is it so bad to avoid something like that, when everything else really is straightened around. When everything else makes sense, and everything else-[0:38:47.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't it maybe okay just to leave that one part-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I can just, by living a normal life, have a perfectly normal heterosexual life, with no problems at all. Why not just do it, if I'm comfortable with everything else that occurs. And I can avoid - . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like why not just do that, and put this way, seal it off somewhere. And go lead a heterosexual life and not worry about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wouldn't that be okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Seem perfectly reasonable. And I would-I think, that I wouldn't necessarily, have to feel as though it's a skeleton in the closet. I don't think that feeling would predominate. I think that I could come to the conclusion as I nearly have, that it's-there's just something in there that either-that I can't quite figure out if it's going on. And it's merely a chemical reaction, in my brain. </p>

<p>Or, another perfectly valid explanation that would, make me not feel bad about the skeleton-not make me look at it as a skeleton in the closet, would be that-it was something that got into my head once that this happens when I smoke. And once it got into my head, every time I smoked it happened. And therefore you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either of those two ways of looking at it would really be satisfying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or okay. [0:40:21.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Contrary-wise? (inaudible at 0:40:28.0) I could forget about it close it up and, let it gnaw at me the rest of my life. Merely as an unsolved problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you could know that it was there, but choose to leave it, unlooked at. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking, "The rest of my life is in order, and I know that this isn't solved but, I'll just leave it there and not pay too much attention to it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's... the fact that I feel a little bit bad about it now is not comforting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the fact that it, it worries you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a little bit bad about it-maybe I'm not sure what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the-the fact that, I'm having trouble with my head right now. I can't figure out what to do with it. That kind of bothers me. Well, I think-I'm sure what's, I'm sure I know what's going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to-and as far as the next few weeks and months are concerned, I may not deal [with it] (ph). I'm just incapable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't deal with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too big. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just ridiculous. Yeah. It's ridiculous. It's a whole new problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too much to face, you mean right now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so either one way or the other, yeah-let's, so what's going to happen is number one, I'm not going to look at it as a skeleton in the closet for some reason. So I'm going to, the two alternatives I gave you before, so it won't bother me. Or number two it's going to bother me. And maybe five years from now I'll be back. Another 20 sessions. Or someone else. (inaudible at 0:42:50.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it the fact that it's only 20 sessions that you're deciding that you can't deal with it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so, I don't think so. I think that, I'd like to look at it in a few more years, and hash it out a little. And see if I stopped smoking if it just never occurs. I mean you know. If it doesn't-if I stop smoking and it doesn't occur for two years, why should something like that bother me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that it would stop bothering you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The longer between the problem. I mean if you've got a stomachache, and it goes away-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you forget about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And if it just doesn't bother you for years and years, why let it bother you at all. Yeah, time can easily (inaudible at 0:43:44.1) problem. I might, I might, without resolving it, see how it fits in a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you might-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Without resolving-without deciding why, the whys of it. Or am I not deciding, what I will do with it, other than avoid it. I can see, how it might fit into everything else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that would be more doable to you. That would be a smaller piece and maybe you could do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really amazing how little people know about everything you know that? I mean I'm finding that out now, I'm not just saying that-I'm not just saying it because I'm a natural scientist. And, I should-because I, the same thing happens there. You're confronted by ignorance all the time. And now, I can see how it would be a really futile thing to, to-or not necessarily a futile, but a discouraging thing, to not know, what's really happening in a mind. [0:44:51.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you're feeling discouraged? Or you think I'm feeling discouraged? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just-no no. I guess just-well. No one should feel discouraged. I mean, I just can see now, a strong parallel, between the type of, lack of knowledge-ignorance, that I can confronting. And that type that you're confronting. Mine is just about, well - . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can see the parallels, is that what you said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's just the same type of thing. There are problems now, you just have to wait years and years and years for someone, someone's going to come up with the solution, or certain parts of the solution. Everyone's just working on some little small part of, of how everything is going to fit together. And even when you get that to fit together there's going to be something else that doesn't beyond that. And the same thing is happening to you now. I would-I feel anyhow. [0:45:50.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that I'm, feeling-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I don't understand this. [0:45:56.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know that you don't understand it. I'm just saying that-yeah yeah I mean-I'm cer-I guess maybe that's right. That you don't really necessarily-no one understands what's happening, how the brain works, how it functions. But as you get farther along and realize how it functions and then there's something else that one doesn't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never really figure it all out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now that that-it's something about that being applied to you, this morning. Like you've got something that your mind does that you can't figure out, that brought that home to you more? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not-not just - . Yeah, you see the thing is, one of the sad things about, about studying anything, about being a student. Is we are, I guess, not 'nine to five-ing' it but (ph)-and punching a clock, is the fact that, we're going to die with the art-our respective arts, in the same relative position. That is to say, we will have advanced, our level of knowledge. But we certainly won't-there will always be something beyond that we wont' know. And that one is condemned to that, when one decides to be a student. And I don't mean a student student, I mean a student of something. A student of physics a studying of psychology. [0:47:33.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, condemned to never really knowing anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Now, one of those things that one will never know with me is, why I behave sexually the way I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying nobody really knows that now, and won't know it, by the time you die. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think it will ever be straightened around. So, I don't want to work with -  for that reason. If I were born, 2000 years from now, and people could put the proper electrodes in the proper places and figure out, what brain waves were causing this and that and the other thing. And then say to you, "Well this causes it." And then I'd say, "Well, thank you. Fine." But we're not going to get that far. We're not going to get close to that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems useless to you, to really even, try to solve it at all because you know that, you can't have that kind of information. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's... okay now that we've completely, gotten that out of the way, we can forget about the sexual problems. Eh, the fact that I call them 'problems' though isn't. I guess I'd be uncomfortable with leaving that alone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It sounds] (ph) like you have mixed feelings, the way it sounds. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they're mixed now, but I'm sure -  I'm sure that they're not, a year from now they won't be mixed. That I will say, "Oh, that was just something. That happened then [you know] (ph). No big deal." I'm pretty sure I'll ride through that one all right. It might, might be worth my while to fit it in. [0:49:24.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To think about, how it relates to, other things you're feeling (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I-there have been and there are societies when this should-you know wouldn't or shouldn't have bothered me. I think, you see that-well just to complete it for you. The, I-the fear I have, you know when I, the next morning fear is, that, I am becoming bi-sexual. I don't know if that's-I, well that's the term I use, or use that term. There have been times and places, when that is not necessarily a fear. [0:50:05.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that would be all right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be bi-sexual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe, you know, big deal. Why should I care that the 20th century is just that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean maybe, "If I am bi-sexual, that's all right."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "And maybe I shouldn't let the way other people feel about it bother me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But at any rate, I need not confront the problem anymore, as far as the problem is concerned. As far as other problems are concerned in my head and how this, might help me solve them. I think, that would-I might confront it. I might re-confront it. But. Well I want- (inaudible at 0:51:06.6). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We really have to stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What... can I-is 9:00 your earliest appointment always?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What-what do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was thinking, you know because now, well-what Dr. Lobe said was, he said, "Well, I'd like you to work really hard this summer so - ." Because he has some people leaving at the end of the summer. And he wants me to be familiar with their work. And he'd like me to put in full days. And I'd like to be in before 10:00. Or come in-either come in late or early. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay I could come early. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh great. How about Monday next?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Monday next?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that all right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now-well let's see how early you were talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh 6:30. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No! (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: 8:30?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That would be fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 8:30, Monday next.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Bye. [0:51:55.5]</p>

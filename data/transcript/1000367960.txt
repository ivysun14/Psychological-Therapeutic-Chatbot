<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) I'm thinking about the reaction I had to Friday's session and I, I had a very strong reaction which I didn't, I found it hard to even think about after I had it.  And I still find the whole possibility of having been angry at you very hard to even think of or to talk about here.  In fact, it's so hard that in a way I see I probably, that was probably what was on my mind on Friday.  But in another way I can't, still can't really admit it or feel the angry feelings.  Because even then, I think you said, "You must have been very angry at me."  Or, "You must be very angry at me."  Or something, immediately I knew it was true.  But yet I, I wouldn't allow any of the feelings that would come with realizing it.  It was almost as if it were somebody else that I was thinking about. (Pause)</p>

<p>And at the time I, I think on Friday after I left, I, in feeling upset, I was upset that it seemed so unreasonable that I would feel anger at you and I couldn't understand why I had.  And so I seemed to be upset at just being confused over it.  But when I think about it right now, I think I must have been afraid that, because I was angry.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you say you felt upset, ah, how did you feel?  I mean, ah, eh, can, can you describe what that feeling upset was like?  You said it wasn't feeling angry.  So it was something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it made me cry but I don't know —</p>

<p>ANALYST: After you left here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You didn't mention that.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I suppose because it, I don't know, there's something about admitting I cried that makes me feel very weak.  And, uhm, (pause) it's almost as if the fact that I was crying over my reaction to having been angry at you it, I twist it around so it's almost, by admitting I've cried, like saying you could make me cry.  And that means that anybody who could make me cry has a great deal of power over me.  (Pause) I suppose that's one reason why I don't like crying, because I don't want anybody to have any power over me. (Pause)</p>

<p>Another reaction I had, too, right after I left was being very upset that, uhm, well, almost as if by not having said when you asked earlier or, or you suggested I was resisting mentioning something and I almost felt as if I, on purpose, didn't say that.  Although it hadn't even c—, I, I wasn't aware of having had that on my mind.  And th—, and this upset me terribly, that you might go away thinking I had purposely not mentioned it and that therefore somehow I hadn't done what I should have been doing.  (Pause) And for some reason on Friday it just seemed very important to me that you know that — I mean it's al—, I guess it's almost like escaping responsibility for feeling it — that if I can say I didn't know it was on my mind, then it's almost like not having even felt it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking of the fact that it still seems unbelievable that I could have felt, it must have been a strong enough feeling of anger so that it could upset me that much and make me hide it from myself that much and why I would feel it.  And, I don't know, for some reason I connected this too with the fact I cried and therefore you had, whether directly or indirectly, power over me to make me cry and, and because it made me think of my parents and the people who had power over me.  And I suppose I've been angry practically the, my whole life at them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I wonder if the, uhm, — I mean you make, make it very plain that, eh, you didn't actually feel angry with me on Friday.  So whatever was happening or whatever I said, eh, it's not that you felt angry so strongly.  You felt something but it wasn't anger, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, while I was actually here on Friday?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.  If I understand you correctly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I just don't know because every time I try to think about it — right now I'm trying to recall what feelings I did have and I, I just know I'm resisting admitting it or feeling again what I felt.  I can remember that at one point I thought you said something impatiently and I had this terrific feeling of, at that, right at that moment, of being in your power and having to be here that whole time.  And it was an awful feeling and I think maybe right then too I felt angry that I felt that way.  And just some of the things I felt I had to say, I was just wondering why I had to say them.  And perhaps I was led somewhat by what you said.  But in another way I felt that it was true, that I was angry and yet I couldn't even, I could barely admit it.  I think I was angry at the thought that you could ask me what I was going to do and, and yet I couldn't know what you were doing that you cancelled.  And I think, I don't know why I was hesitant to cancel for tomorrow and whether or not it was, my anger came partly out of the fact that I didn't want to cancel and yet somehow something you did was more important than my coming here so that you didn't mind not cancelling.  And this is assuming that you didn't, which I don't know. (Silence)</p>

<p>And whenever I've thought about it, it always seems that it's an escape for me to think, well, I'm not sure whether I really was or not.  (Pause) And I think when you made that statement after, I think I was talking about how I would, how so often during Friday I felt like crying and I compared it to my, my saying I felt like crying, compared it to my saying "I'm asleep."  When my mother would come in to spank me.  And then you said, "You must be very angry at me."  And my initial reaction to that, as far as I can recall, was again feeling there was no escape, I had to admit it was true.  And yet I couldn't understand how it could be true.  And so there was that confusion right then.  And that's what I keep feeling. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I know I tried, right from the time I knew you had to cancel the 2 times, to make myself look at it reasonably and if I had to do that, then there must have been a reason, something I was fighting that I had to look at it reasonably.  And the comparison just came into my mind of how I used to feel when my mother would often have to go out to meetings at night and leave us, all of us children.  And sometimes my father would go with her or if he didn't still, it wasn't the same, the fact that he was there and she wasn't.  And sometimes she would just make a tv dinner which to me was the ultimate insult.  Or else we'd make our own supper and again it was something else was more important than us and of course me.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think whenever I've felt weak in any way or less important or unwanted or stupid or being made to feel ridiculous or whatever, my reaction has always been to feel anger.  But I never have dared show it.  I've always been sort of meek and — up to a point, I suppose.  Sometimes I've shown it.  But I was thinking of something that happened today which seems, I didn't relate it when I was thinking about the 2 separate things earlier.  But I don't know, somehow they seem to be related.  I was having lunch with a girl that I hadn't seen for a long time.  And I felt sort of nervous with her at first.  And when I feel that way I, I'm, I suppose I get very self-conscious about what I'm saying and the fact that I might say something stupid.  And I often have trouble hearing and I, I don't think I have any physical trouble hearing.  I think it's just I'm so worried about things that I'm not really listening very well.  And she said something that I didn't catch.  And I always just sort of sit there agreeing when I'm not sure if I heard or it takes me a while, I have to think of it, what word she said after, or, or anybody what they've said after they've said it.  And then I can hear it, when I play it over in my mind.  And so after she said it and after I'd sat there agreeing, looking really stupid, then I realized that it wasn't something I wanted to agree with.  And so I had to contradict her.  And she was very quick to pick up the fact that I'd sat there agreeing and kidded me on it.  And, I don't know, I think in a way I felt it necessary to excuse myself.  And I couldn't just admit I hadn't heard her correctly and know what had really happened.  And, because somehow that would be weakening myself.  And I think in a way my inclination is now to find fault with her and get angry at her because for some reason it's her fault that this happened. (Pause)</p>

<p>And yet, if I, the approach I'm aware of is, is being very careful to be reasonable with myself and point out how it was my fault I didn't hear her correctly.  And I've also been thinking about the fa—, when I thought of being angry at my parents and my mother in particular made me think of, again, how for the, well, at least for all the high school years, how, and into college, how I seemed to always feel angry at my mother.  And it was true that we could almost never be together but that I would have such angry feelings at her that I would be very unpleasant to her.  And also the fact that — I don't recall this — but she says when I was a lot younger we didn't get along.  And somehow I have this vague feeling that I used to have to always be trying to be reasonable with myself when I was younger and sort of telling myself I couldn't expect too much from my parents, that they were other members of the family. (Pause)</p>

<p>But the feeling of not being loved or not being very important in my parents' life and the anger that results from feeling so weak is all directed at my mother.  I don't have any awareness of feeling that type of anger at my father.  (Pause) And I was just wondering, too, I was sort of thinking about, well, I wonder who else I've been angry at.  But the thought occurred to me how I've often had trouble getting along with supervisors or somebody, anyway, that's in a more powerful position than me.  And if it's a job then they're telling me, in a sense, what to do.  And I think the situation has been that I've had some bad supervisors but there also seems to be this inclination on my part to find fault with them.  Because I, again, feel in a more defenseless position or weak, or there's something about the situation that I, I just can't adjust to. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking too: so often, if there's a criticism made of me by my supervisors I'll, or by teachers or anything, I, my inclination is always first to give excuses.  Because somehow there's this fear of having made them angry.  And there was, when I thought you were well, really, just angry at me I suppose that's what it comes down to, on Friday, there was again this fear that I'd made you angry.  And I don't know which comes first, my being angry or just being fearful that I'm going to make people angry and then a fear of the unknown, what can they do to me.  And I somehow have this feeling that I guess they can do a lot to me if they're angry at me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What are you afraid I can do?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.  I was just thinking about it and all I could of think of then was my father putting me in closets and calling me stupid and just sort of a total rejection.  And I guess that that's what upset me about your using the word, "Your time is up"  rather than "Our time is up."  And maybe I connected that somehow with you cancelling 2 of the times.  Because I remember thinking it made me feel left out or less important or rejected.  (Pause) And it's all part of this compulsion I have to not do anything that will make people not like me, not taking a chance or — (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it occurs to me that you must feel in, eh, quite a bind, eh, specifically in this point you've been talking about today.  On the one hand, eh, if I say, "You must be angry with me,"  then that must make you feel as though you somehow you have to work things around so that you are, one way or another.  Eh, otherwise —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You'll be angry at me (laughs) for not agreeing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: For not being angry with you, right.  On the other hand, if you really are, then you're afraid of that.  So it's as though you, either way, can't, when you're cornered, in one way or another you're going to be in danger from something I'll do.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But then, when I know from my reaction that I'm afraid of something that you'll do either way, which means that you're going to do it either way in my thinking, I still can't work out what actually is happening.  (Silence) I think it just, again, getting back to my reaction to your statement, it comes down to a sort of a feeling I have whenever you say anything.  And sometimes I'll have the feeling well, maybe it's true and I'll try to see, well, it must be true because you said it.  And then in the end I will feel, well, it really isn't true.  However strongly I disagree I might not disagree very strongly.  But I know inside that it's not true.  And when you said that, "You must be very angry at me."  I just somehow felt that I couldn't deny it.  But it, it was almost like an explosion that it was if it were a completely new thought.  Except I knew that wasn't true. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it also puzzled me why, first of all, I was finding it hard to come back those 2 days and why I had to tell you that I was.  Except for the fact that I somehow felt, not being so important, that I could be hurt more and also maybe getting back at you by telling you I don't like coming, either.  And having to think that made me feel very upset on Friday, too.  (Pause) This is afterwards, when I left and thought about, well, what was I talking about and why didn't I think of it earlier if I had felt angry and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: I have the impression you've spent a lot of time thinking about these things since, in the past week.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I did on Friday.  I couldn't think about anything else.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And after that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, then after that it was, I couldn't, I think it's been on my mind but if it ever came consciously to mind I would sort of put it out of my mind and say, well, I'll think about it later.  But I think I've been, it must have been on my mind somewhere.  (Pause) And I think I felt quite nervous about coming today because I knew I'd have — well, it was on my mind so I would end up talking about it.  But I didn't want to.  Again I felt very childish about having these feelings and embarrassed and, I don't know, just admitting that maybe I was angry was hard.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

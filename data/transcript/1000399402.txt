<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, Sighs, 2-minute silence) Hmm, well I guess I'm thinking of enough things, so I'm not sure what to chose.  Ah, I, pretty much have this feeling of choosing what to start with and uhm, (Sigh) a—, i—, uhm, I think I have that feeling because the thing I was thinking as I came in, uhm, probably is, is more important than I want to admit, so then I, I'm, wa—, thinking other things right before I came in, came back onto my mind, and I think well, I can choose now which to talk about.</p>

<p>And uh, the thing I was thinking as I came in was, I think uh, well, I don't know where to begin, except I had the feeling that you kept the door open so that anybody in the hall, mainly the fellow I was talking to, I don't know his name, would see where I was going.  Although, I mean, he knows, except he could actually see into this room and see me come in here.  And I don't know, because I don't think you did anything differently than before, but I had this feeling you're holding the door open so he can see, and uhm, I didn't like the feeling.  Except, on the other hand, I guess I'm thinking, well, maybe I really liked it.  You know, sort of, if you were going to share with everybody what we do in here while I'm lying down on the couch.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Mm, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I, I, I, I don't know, I don't —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You stopped sort of in mid-thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well there's something I can't quite get hold of about it.  Uhm, and it might just simply be that I, I don't want to think that I'd really like to have him see me come in and lie down, and then have hi—, hi—, have him start thinking that something intimate happens in here, which is what I w, would want him to think, because it was what I would want to have happen.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know because, I don't really think this is true, but I was thinking of the fact that before you j—, I wasn't waiting that long, but while I was waiting we were talking about AVP, and he was saying something, just about the legal part of it.  A—, I found out, I guess for the first time, that he was a lawyer.  And he was saying something I didn't know.  And I haven't thought a lot about it, because right after I found out that AVP had resigned, uhm, I was waiting for a girl to come back today who had come last night, and she was late.  So I was thinking about that, and wondering, was she just going to drop me and never show up again.  And then she did come, so I was busy with her. And uhm, but I realized that I really don't quite know what I think.  And, you know, so that was kind of on my mind.  And I was interested in what we were talking about.</p>

<p>And so, but I think I'm kidding myself actually, when I think about feeling, when you did come out, sort of having to leave something I preferred doing.  Uhm, and also a feeling of, you know, similar to the other day, when I had that feeling about (Sigh) MLWZ, and, and whether or not you'd be angry with him, or, or reprimand him, or something, because I didn't have a chair to sit in.  You know, that whole feeling of the two of us being on one side, and then you being on another.</p>

<p>And there was a similar feeling today, I, i, in some way of uhm, I don't know whether it would be we could just talk about some things, so d—, th—, doesn't occur in here, or just simply, he and I are both coming here for, I, I don't know whether he's actually in analysis, or what, but it's uhm, I think so.  And, in any case, you know, we're going through similar experiences, and we can talk about things that you and I don't.  And just somehow a feeling of —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) I don't know, like politics.  I mean, I could say what I think, but it would be one way here, in here.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, you'd like it to be the two of us having, so we can talk about anything, right?  Converse.  You find out what I'm like and what I think about things.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, i—, this might be partly what's making something that probably is very simple, hard for me to handle right this minute, because I also have this feeling that, I mean, that's what it would seem as if, would have to be the basic feeling.  But then, I also have this other reaction of, no, I want to keep you very much, you know, apart, and uhm, in your place.  You know, in the role that you had been in.  Uhm, (Clears throat) I don't know, I just have this f—, i, it seems to me, it's exactly the same thing as when I've come close to the fantasies I have, or feelings.  I mean, i, it's even, I'm less close if I call them fantasies.  And uhm, and then I'll say, but, they're just fantasies, and I really wouldn't want them to happen.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you did have this idea, you uh, might enjoy the idea of the fellow uh, seeing you come in here, and then thinking that we're being intimate, and close.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uhm, well even with that, I, I'd, I don't know whether I did, or whether I'm denying that I did, but uhm, I was thinking I was feeling as I came in, that I have to keep coming.  I cannot stop until you've closed the door.  And, however much I may wish you could close the door before he could see me come in here, I still have to keep coming in here.  But, on the other hand, it did occur to me, that that might be what he would think.  Or, you know, I mean, in a way I know it isn't what he th—, might think.  But uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It's what you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And you keep trying to get around it.  It's your idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The other thing that's very much on my mind right now, and, and at first I just thought, well maybe I'm trying to avoid thinking about these things, you know, that have, we've already started talking about.  But somehow I have a feeling it's connected, too.  Uhm, because I kept feeling very distracted, and, and, started thinking about this girl that I was seeing today.  And one thing that MSCZ had said he thought I should make clear when I saw her again, uh — and I was seeing her again partly because I, I just, I hadn't seen her with FSO, and, I, I don't know, she's from out of town, has no references, and I think she's probably fine.  But somehow it scares me to, you know, put the kind of trust we would be, and to have absolutely no way of really being sure.</p>

<p>And uhm, then MSCZ said — well, I think, because she had been just with us last night, and we had talked, and I found her easy to talk with, and, and pleasant — uhm, MSCZ said, "I think you have to make clear to her that that kind of intimacy is not to continue."  And, you know, sort of, we're not just going to be her friends, and s, substitute family, and that she can now be with us all the time, and you know, just sort of continue a feeling.  Because last night it was uhm, I mean, she was there interviewing for a job, but still there was not a formality there that uhm, MSCZ wanted to have put back in, I guess.</p>

<p>And I didn't say anything this time, partly because she came very late.  And also I find, I just feel very awkward dealing with it.  But now I'm thinking about, thinking, what am I going to do?  Am I going to allow her to come between us, really.  Because that's kind of the way it could be, if she, if we don't handle — I, I actually think there might not be any problem, because her sister is in the city, and uhm, they would get together during her off times a lot.  But uhm, you know, it's almost like right now, the way I'm thinking about it is, I have to make a decision if I'm going to let her cut down the amount of intimacy MSCZ and I can have.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, well, it's obviously connected.  Because uh, what's really interfering is uh, what you want from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) I can't get over it.  I do—, I don't know how to deal with this.  Because I, I immediately think again, it's not, I, I can't see it as interfering uhm, unless I keep looking at it as, well these are just fantasies, and I really don't want it.  And yet, that seems to me, the longer I look at it that way, the less I'm really facing what I'm feeling.  And uhm, and then if I face what I'm feeling, I can't see it as just interfering, but simply, you are going to take MSCZ's place.  And even if you don't agree to take his place, admitting that those are my feelings, then, then as far as I'm concerned, you will have, and uhm, well, I don't know, I guess I, I'm, d—, had the question yesterday, and I don't know anything more about it now, or haven't any other ideas about it, except wondering what will happen if I uhm, I sort of feel as if I have to decide what will happen before I admit those feelings.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm gone on to thinking about school, and uhm, some problems that, I mean, nothing serious, just some situations that I want to change somewhat.  But, and I don't even remember what particularly, I started thinking about.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, why do you think you're denying what is obvious from all kinds of indirect things you've said?  That you want a close, intimate relationship with me.  You want it sexual, and you want it very much.  And it comes out in all kind of indirect fantasies that you have.  The closest you've come, is over and over to say that uh, it means to you uh, if you feel that strongly, giving up MSCZ.  Why does that follow?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I've probably been doing it anyway, but it seems like it follows, because uhm, if I admit that that's what I want, then I will pursue it single-mindedly, I guess.  And, and I will exclude MSCZ, I mean, that will just be a natural part of it.  I d—, I d—, I mean, I don't know why it is, except I can't imagine it being any other way.  (Pause) And, somehow, uhm, well, I don't know quite why I'm having such trouble admitting that's what I want.</p>

<p>And Z,,,, I've really, gotten so now I can't even admit fantasizing these thing about you, the way, for a while I could admit as long as I kept telling myself well, they were just fantasies.  And probably I can't now, because I realize that I can't keep that kind of distance, if I admit it at all.  And uhm, but still, I don't, I don't know whether it's that I'm, that I don't know what will happen, and therefore I, it's uhm, something I feel I can't handle, or and also I, I guess I'm wondering right now, if really I haven't been pursuing it anyway, except I think I have this feeling about it that I haven't been.  But if I admit it, then I will have to.  Uhm, (Pause) and it involves in it an unknown relationship with you, that uhm, (Sigh) well, I just, I d—, I don't know, I just don't know.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said you feel that you can't stand to not have what you really want.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I know that was something that I was thinking yesterday, and I suppose in a way, I've said it just now.  But when you said that, all I could think now was, but the other side that I keep doing is to keep thinking, I can't stand to think I might get what I want.  But maybe that's just because, in imagining getting it, it's all part of admitting that's what I want, and that that's what I can't do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Yet, uh, well, I was just thinking of another part of this too, because uhm, I mean I think I was thinking a bit this way yesterday, that it seems like it would be so simple at this point to say, "Yes, that is what I really want."  Uhm, because you know it, and I know it, but yet I'm not actually directly saying it, so it makes all the difference in the world, to me.  Uhm, but how it makes all the difference, I can't quite see, since we both know.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was ending up thinking about the girl that I saw today, and how I cannot pronounce her name, even though it's really not a hard one to pronounce.  But because I wrote it first, I keep visualizing what it looks like written, and it's not the way you pronounce it.  And uhm, and then I was just thinking about, I often need to write, to remember.  And uhm, that I have to learn to write this name phonetically in order to say it correctly.</p>

<p>And uhm, but I think before then, I was thinking about, right after I was quiet, about at school today, we saw a movie that Mrs BBF wanted to show on parents' night, which is next week.  And (Clears throat) all during the movie, I had the feeling that it was presenting some very good points, that a—, that i—, are some of the points Mrs BBF wanted the movie to present.  But it's quite an old movie, and it's set in the home.</p>

<p>And, and I kept feeling the parents at our school will be feeling it's out of date, and also that it has nothing to do with them, because it's all about home.  And they might even get angry and feel we're trying to tell them something, or feel guilty because the parents were absolutely ideal parents in dealing with their 3 children, and, and the ways that play could be constructive and helpful, and learning activities, and so forth.</p>

<p>And uhm, yet when we were talking about it afterwards, the thing that was bothering me, was similar to that other night at the dinner party, that I could not even formulate in my mind exactly what I thought.  And the only way I could say it was, if you do use the movie — feeling as if I had nothing to say about the decision whether it would be used or not — but if you do use it, I think you have to, in the introduction, cover this weakness of the film.  But I could not say, I do—, I don't think you should use it, because I feel this weakness is a very strong one.  And eventually somebody else said some other things about it, and, and then I felt I could say that I really felt it was a strong weakness, but I couldn't at first.  And I couldn't even assume what I had to say would have anything to do with whether or not it was chosen.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, your words are magical.  You can slay people with them, you can seduce people with them, you can make me do anything you imagine, with them.  It's no wonder you're afraid to say things, when they're that powerful, can have such far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I guess, first I was just thinking about how I know I've had that feeling about saying anything negative, where it might not be well-received.  And uhm, I mean, as if some horrible consequence would be the result.  Except, then I was thinking, but how, but I know that that's not true, too.  So how could I feel that it is?  And then the next thing I was thinking of, is uhm, well I guess I was wondering well, is it something that happened?  I mean it must be something that I was experiencing when I was much younger, or feeling, or, I me—, or I just can't quite imagine how I'd retain this feeling of power, unless for some reason I was encouraged to feel that it would be so.</p>

<p>And then, the only thing I could think of was, with FSO, uhm, if she's really uhm, being bossy sometimes, because then she's talking in a way I don't want her to talk to me, or MSCZ reacts this way.  And we'll say, you may not talk that way, rather than, you know, sort of saying, well you can tell us to do that, but we won't do it.  Y, you can't make us do it.  Or, you know somehow, anyway, to give her the feeling her words don't have the power.  Uhm, and, I guess, wondering, well, by telling her she can't talk that way, is that another way to say, because if she does, then she would have the power, and we're not going to allow her the power.</p>

<p>And (Pause) I don't know, I just, well, I, I just got back to thinking, I know that it's not true, but I feel as if it is that uhm, saying things directly, mainly, well, uh, I guess almost anything, I don't like to be very direct in almost any way.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And I think, you know, that's part of the reason that you're so often silent, and quiet, and don't say anything.  Because you're trying to get control of the words before you say them, in case something comes out that uh you don't have control over, and will have terrible consequences.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  I don't know if that's true right, just at that moment, but I know sometimes I do try to think ahead to what will the effects be of whatever I say, and then how do I say it.  I think just then I wa—, I was th, thinking about the girl again, that uhm (Sigh) — I d—, I don't know, it's one of my old dilemmas in trying to find somebody, of do I make up my mind just on the basis of having seen her, or do I take the chance of losing her, and, and see who else applies for the job.  You know, I like her quite a bit, but, on the other hand, i—, y, you know, she's just totally unknown.  There's no way to check references, because she's come from the PCR.  And uhm, well, and also I, you know, as MSCZ keeps saying, "You're afraid you'll miss something."  And so I want to know who else might a—, be applying.  And then there's also this CHN girl, that uhm, might be interested.  But then, at this point, I really am so eager to get this settled, I'm not sure I want to wait, if somebody else comes along who seems good.</p>

<p>And uh, and so just now I was thinking about this, and calling, I asked if I could call the person that her sister works for, because it's about the only way I can check up and make sure that what she's been telling me is true, and you know, get some feeling of uh, I mean, it's hardly a reference, but i—, you know, sort of the only thing I have.  And so I was thinking about calling the woman and, and I don't know, just anyway, it seems like it is just now, the way I was thinking, it was very much an escape.  Because I could think of it, well, it's something I have to decide about, but it's more comfortable thinking about that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But it is true, I don't know, I was just thinking again that uh, I mean, th, the point is, I often do that, and I don't say it.  And uhm, and I'll often think a lot of this type of thing, which in a way, does seem like I'm escaping by thinking.  But I ju—, I still don't say it until after I've thought it all out.  And you know, sort of escaped for a while.  And I could escape more openly.  But then, maybe I wouldn't find it was escaping, because I would be letting you know, well I was doing it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, (Coughs) excuse me.  Our time's up.</p>

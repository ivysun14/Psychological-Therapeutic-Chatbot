<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(silence) [00:03:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, c'mon in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. Whoo - It's so nice out. I feel so bad for those poor marathoners today. It's gonna be awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I have a lot of friends running.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God, well the problem is with the training, like, none of them have been training in this. Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot of out of towners. . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . but not enough. But it's not a good thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. My mom texted me this morning saying "So happy I'm not running this year." I don't blame her. (laughter) It would be awful. Although it (unintelligible) (laughter)</p>

<p>Sadie, the older girl that I watch is on vacation this week so I didn't even take them down. I'm excited to do - we don't get to do, like, her schedule works so that we have to pick her up at noon every day and then the girls are napping, you know, eat lunch, then we're inside from noon to 3:30 every day. And I'm excited to have kind of, like, "less". They don't have a schedule with nothing really exciting. [00:04:39]</p>

<p>We started to potty train the little one last week and my control issues are, like, I leave and I get, like, tense 'cause even though it's their kid (chuckles) I've been the one at home all day working on it with her and so the other - last week - I showed up, it was the second day, and they had said they were eating breakfast and mom said, "Ohhh, we've had a really emotional morning." I said, "Oh? She wanted to poop?" She won't poop in the potty. She only will poop in the diaper. Totally normal. It's what kids do when they're potty training - whatever. I just thought that must be it. And so she was like "No, she wouldn't put her underpants on so I put a diaper on her." And she said "You know, like, I figured you can get one on her." [00:05:31] And I said, "Isn't that was what happened with the older daughter?" And I really a lot of times feel like I'm kind of put in the position of being the bad guy. And I just sat like I blurted out "Well, I'm not going to be Underpants Bad Guy and so if you put a diaper on her this morning that's what I'm going to go with today because I'm not going to be the bad guy here." And I as soon as I said it I felt really guilty like that was so out of line for me to say and, like, this is my job and it's my job to be, like, kinda, like, get Hetty, the baby into it, like "C'mon here we go", you know, like, talk her into it. I felt really guilty that I had said it the whole day like (big sigh). I also wasn't gonna have this whole battle with Hetty and make it this whole thing when she's already, you know, it's already an issue. [00:06:32]</p>

<p>And so I just let it be and, I don't know. I don't think they had even thought of it that way. I think they thought like "Jenny will probably be able to," probably in their head they probably thought like "Oh, Hetty will come around to it and she'll want to put the underpants on later." You know what I mean? I'm sure they didn't think of it that way but my reaction was just like, um, (pause) I don't know. I felt, I felt bad, but at the same time like I don't think, I still don't think I should have felt that bad because I don't want to be put in that position and I said that later. We talked about it again later and she said - we were touching base about it again - and she feels - she does the thing that Chris does that (chuckles), like, always drives me crazy. [00:07:29] We talk about the same thing over and over and over. So we talk about potty training twice a day, but not in a way where it's checking in and "how did it go?" In a way we're in the morning in the afternoon when she picks up we're talking about, like, "Do you think this is a good idea?" Like, "What do you think about this?" "Why do you think she's afraid to poop in the . ." and like all the and like nothing's changed from the and I feel like she can tell that my patience is wearing thin and then I feel guilty because it's my job and I need to have - it's her kids. If she wants to talk about this thing twice a day like I need to have patience to let her do that, but I don't have a lot of patience (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, she kind of obsesses. [00:08:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Very much so. Her job is she's running a research study currently and I feel like since that's kind of her job to collect data information and then analyze it and put it to some use, I feel like she does that with her children as well and it's, like, for a lot of stuff I just don't know. And Hetty, the baby, doesn't know - and you - none of us know. Like, she doesn't want to poop in her diaper because, er, in the potty 'cause that's scary and it's new and like nothing has changed about that (chuckles) from last night when I saw you. So I just don't know what else to do. Like she's gonna get it one day. My whole thing is like she's just gonna get it. Like one day, she's gonna be more comfortable with it. She'll have a lot of accidents and one day, just like every other kid, it's not gonna be as scary anymore. She's just gonna go. Like, I don't know, like for me, that's my kind of attitude about it and, like, we can do everything we want. We can incentivize, we can, you know, distract her, we can give her toys to put, you know, we can do the whole thing. But outside of that, like, we have no control. They're her bowels. She's gonna do - like, I just don't have - I know, here I am talking about it I'm so focused on this kid's bowels. (chuckles) Um, anyway, so I get, I think she can read my lack of patience. Maybe she can't, but I feel like she can. And then I always feel like, and then I beat myself up with "you need to be more patient" "you need to like let her - this is her kid." [00:10:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how do you feel your control issues are coming up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I get frustrated when I get there in the morning and they haven't done it the way that I want them to do it. Like, why would you - I get pissed - like the morning that I got there and Hetty was refusing to put on underpants, so they just put a diaper on her. And it's like, well, yeah, she's gonna do that. I don't think force underpants on the kid, but you're the one. If you, you know, it was their idea. They wanted to start the potty training. I didn't really think Hetty was ready, but they wanted to do it. And so now I'm the one at home all day long because we, those few days, wouldn't leave the house because she would just pee in the - you know. So I'm the one at home all day with her sitting there. It's like just don't you just showed her that she wins. If she, like, screams and cries and throws a tantrum and then you put the diaper on her, you're just setting that situation up to happen every day now. And so then I get irritated and, and, like, I wouldn't have done it that way - so you did it the wrong way. And so then I, like, you know, usually I come in and I sit with - they're all eating breakfast usually - and so I sit down and I like chat with them but then those mornings when it's like, "Ugh, why'd you mess that up?" I just get, I'm like (cheerful voice) "OK, sounds good!" and then I just busy myself with things around the house, laundry or cleaning up or dishes or something and it's obvious that I'm frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:11:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it's, I don't know (sigh), and it's like why am I frustrated? Why do I care that much that they've set up a situation for them and their kid. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do care. I care because I care about Hetty and I care about the work that I've put in with her for, you know, like saying only I've told her for days diapers are only in the crib. And I've told them that over and over and I've said like Hetty and I have conversations about it and we say "Oh, diapers only in the crib" and when we say bye-bye to the crib, we say bye-bye to diapers. And so now, like, everything that I've said to her and that she understands is void because mommy and daddy don't, you know, 'cause now "I'm wearing a diaper." "I'm out of my crib, but here I am wearing my diaper 'cause I screamed and cried." (chuckles) And I just get like arghhh. Anyway, I don't know. (pause) It was a long week last week. (chuckles) I was feeling really frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you certainly feel upset when you feel parents aren't really doing their job. [00:12:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, or when I feel like I'm the only, like, "We're ready to do this. We want to do this," but what they mean is "We want you to do this." And it's like, well, then if you're gonna want me to do it then these three hours you see her awake I need you to do these things that we've set up for these three hours that you have her. Do you know what I mean? It's like if you can't do that then I can't do what you've asked me to do the other 10 hours. I don't know what else to do. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that they're essentially undermining you - not intentionally - but?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not intentionally. And then I feel like when I draw their attention to that I feel like I hurt their feelings 'cause I don't think they mean to, but that's the other thing. I don't think they mean to do these things. That's not their personality. They're not, like, intentionally trying to undermine me. They're not intentionally - they're just afraid of making their kids upset. They always have been and I know that about them, but the kids are gonna get upset no matter what, no matter if it's you or me or whoever it is so the thing that hasn't kicked in with them in the last three years (chuckles) is that, like, by you taking the easy road and fixing whatever it is that needs to get done and making them not upset, I'm the one who always has to go back and kind of like clean it up and has to be the bad guy and has to say like "No, you can't, like, wear your nightgown outside again 'cause it's disgusting and dirty and, like, we need to wash it 'cause it's laundry day." It's things like that. And I'm the one who always has to say "no", and it really bothers me. (chuckles) [00:14:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well one thought I had. I mean I understand why the situation bothers you. It sounds like a frustrating situation but I was also thinking about how you describe with your family like sort of being the person who yells "Fire!" in the theater. Like you're always needing to point out what's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong, and everybody else is going "La, La, La."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, like, yeah. I guess that is. And that's my impulse. My impulse is to say like "This is what would be wrong with that." My impulse is to always say like "Well, I see the flaw and the flaw is here." A lot of times with kids, like, you just need to let the situation play out and it's harder for me with other parents being the ones with control, allowing them to let it play out how they want to, 'cause I let it play out a different way. It's not, I don't know. (pause) (sigh) [00:15:45]</p>

<p>And then I get like, and then in my head I'm like "I only have two more months at this job and I start just saying like "Eh" (verbal shrug) and it's terrible because it's these kids and they don't know, I mean I'm not like, I'm doing it in a way that it's just like "do it or not". You're happy in this moment, so I'm just like "whatever - that's great", instead of my typical approach which is kind of like, I take kind of a harder line because I know that in the long run it's more beneficial, but I don't have a long run anymore. And so, I don't know. I'm starting to get not lazy but more like "have fun now 'cause I'm not going to be here in a few months." (chuckles) Like "let's have fun and be happy and everybody just do what they want to do." [00:16:43]</p>

<p>It's harder to get me to, like, sometimes I just think like "whatever". I don't think she's ready to be potty trained, and these last two months that I've spent with her are her crying and frustrated and me frustrated trying to do this potty training thing. I don't want to do that these last two months that I have there, 'cause it's frustrating, it's hard, and she's not ready. I'm crying about potty training. (pause, cries softly) I don't know, I just wanna, I just wanna have fun with her the last two months that I'm with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel you're not ready to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I don't want to leave her, but I do want to leave this situation because it's not something that makes me happy anymore. I'm always happy to see. . this is kind of terrible. Sadie, the older one and I, don't have the same relationship that I have with the baby, and I don't feel that excitement that I feel when I see her - that I have when I see Hetty. And I have a lot of guilt about that. I feel really guilty about that. And I feel, like I wonder a lot of times like did I damage this kid by not, like I love her because I've been taking care of her for the last three years almost. But there are parts of her personality that really irritate me and I see a lot of her similarities. [00:18:38]</p>

<p>She reminds me a lot of me when I was a little kid and there's parts of that that frustrate me. And then I feel really guilty because I think like, 'cause you know, she's very timid and she's very shy. She's very cautious and I really encourage her to be more adventurous and to be more, you know, outgoing and to be more sure of herself. And a lot of times I'm pushing her to be something that she's not and pushing her to be too much out of her comfort zone a lot of times. And then I feel really guilty, like, just let the kid be. Just let her be who she is and I'm like . . . uhh. Anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She sounds like you now, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I have all this, you know, it comes across as really harsh though because I'm saying like, "No, you're a big girl. You can say hello when somebody says 'hello' to you. You can say 'hello' back." And I say all these things that sound really harsh when I say them out loud to her. I think like "Why did I just say that?" Like if she doesn't want to say 'hello' then she doesn't have to say 'hello' to that person. You shouldn't push a kid to be social if they're not. But then I have this other - I don't think there's a right answer - but then I think, like, she's 41/2 and she should, like, it's proper social favor to like if somebody says 'hello' to you she can say 'hello' back. So then I beat myself up because I'm just not letting this kid "be". Just let her be. And, um, I don't know. [00:20:26]</p>

<p>So in that sense, I think it's time for me to leave the job. Just because I don't . . . I always feel like I'm doing something wrong with her and that I . . . that it's not a good match, it's not a good fit. Somebody else could be doing better. Somebody else could be encouraging her in a better way or really appreciating, I don't know. I just don't feel that like "click" that I feel with Hetty, the baby, and part of that is because I was there the day Hetty came home from the hospital. I've been with her the whole time through, but I feel really guilty like I'm doing something wrong. That I'm like permanently messing her up (chuckles) in some way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're permanently messing you up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to permanently undo mess-up (chuckles). Change that. Undo permanent mess-ups. Or trying to - do you mean by the job? Doing the job? [00:21:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I was just like in terms of you're sort of describing treating her the way you treat yourself, and so you're saying "I'm messing this up. I'm messing this up." And that's where my comment came from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I have done permanent damage to myself and I'm trying to undo it or to make it better. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that damage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of the job or just my life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you. What damage do you feel you've done to yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just beating myself up and not letting myself be (pause), like just happy for what I have or, I don't know. Always being more concerned with what's going on with other people than what's going on with myself. I feel like just setting up that mentality. I feel like getting into certain patterns of behavior that I don't like. (pause) Yeah, just setting up certain ways of being that are like, well, that's not a healthy way to live and to let's backtrack and let's fix that. (pause) So I feel like those are kind of the ways, I guess, that I've maybe really damaged myself permanently. (pause) [00:23:27]</p>

<p>Like this weekend, this is one of the patterns of behavior that I mean. This weekend Chris and I went to New York, just for like a fun day trip and it was really fun. We were out at a baseball game and, you know, I have my doctor's appointment for my check-in next Friday. And so I'm supposed to be on this like restrictive, just no chocolate, just no alcohol. And so I was like, just no chocolate, just no alcohol. And so I was like "this is a really nice day for a beer". Outside, at the baseball game, and I'm like "I'll have a beer". And so, we had a couple of beers at the baseball game and then we went to dinner and I had a beer and then yesterday Chris's sister came over and we were having lunch and she's like "It's sunny outside. We should sit out back. Do you want to, like, have a beer out back?" And I just have no willpower left now. It's like "ehh". (verbal shrug) Alright, I had some beers yesterday. Whatever. And so Brittney and I sat outside and had a beer after lunch. And then Chris and I were taking a walk in the Square and we had like time to kill before meeting friends for dinner. I said, "Let's sit outside and have a beer." And now it's just like I've totally lost all my willpower. It's gone. [00:24:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did it go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I dunno. Great question. (chuckles) But now I'm just kinda like, oh, like it doesn't hurt my stomach. My stomach's fine. I'm not having reflux and that's kind of the goal and so "ehh". (verbal shrug) No big deal. Have a couple beers. But I'm pissed at myself because I wanted to do this the right way and now I'm, like, now I'm pissed 'cause I (pause) like didn't do it the right way, they way it was supposed to be done, the whole seven weeks. Go to the doctor and say like, "I didn't do it these whole seven weeks." (pause)</p>

<p>And those were two things where it's like, first of all, I set up this way of being where it's like I just . . as soon as I . . ugh. It's like I fall off the wagon, I don't know. (chuckles) I'm not an alcoholic but you know what I mean? It can be for anything, for eating healthy, for anything. And I fall off and it's like "ehh". (verbal shrug) "Just stay here. Oh well." [00:26:09]</p>

<p>And then the other pattern that's terrible is that I just beat myself up for it. When I think about it, it's not that terrible of a thing because the whole goal of this 'taking time to let my stomach heal' was to make sure that I wasn't having reflux and that, while removing these things I wasn't having reflux, I don't know. And I'm not. It'd be one thing if I had a beer and then all of a sudden my reflex kicked in and I was feeling terrible and was doing it anyway. But I'm not. And so when I think about it, you had three beers on Saturday and you had whatever, like, at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like quite a gulf. . . [00:27:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hunh</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . those different feelings between feeling like it's really awful and feeling "eh, no big deal". But it's a big gulf.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's huge, yeah. And then, ya know, because I didn't do it the right way . . and that's what always . . 'cause it just feels like I can't follow through with anything and I just have no follow through. Like I can't even take care of my body. You know, it goes along with that whole other thing. It's like I'm not taking care of my body well and I'm not like . . (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really upsets you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, 'cause it's like I have all these other things that I'm frustrated about that I complain about but then what is this? I say that I'm upset because I'm not losing weight, but then drinking beers at a baseball game isn't gonna help that and, you know, (pause) I don't know. And I know I have to, like, let myself live a little. I know that I can't be this rigid. (trails off) But at the same time, like, which is it? Do you want to take care of yourself or do you wanna just do whatever you want? And I know it's not that black and white. And I know there's shades in between there, that there's a very happy meeting place, but it just doesn't feel like that a lot of times. [00:28:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think happens to that happy meeting place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that I always only see the negative and that I only always - unless I'm not doing everything exactly perfectly right, like eating oatmeal for breakfast and greens the rest of the day - then I'm in a bad place and I don't, like, I'll just pick apart the fact that, like, "oh, and then you had like mac & cheese for lunch with the girls". And then you, like, you know, I'll just pick apart all these little things instead of focusing on "well, I did a good job the rest of the time" and that these other things happened and that even though maybe I had a few beers this weekend I still didn't drink for five weeks which, I'm sure, gave my stomach plenty of time to heal. You know, it's not like I went on a bender (chuckles) and like lost, I don't know. But it feels like it. It feels like I might as well have just gone on a bender and lost total control because I'm beating myself up the same. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you kind of go back and forth between these poles of feeling deprived and feeling indulgent or overly indulgent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Overly indulgent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it definitely sounds like the mom you work for or with that you get frustrated that she's so indulgent with her children.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no limits or boundaries.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Throw a tantrum. Get whatever you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And that is hard for me. And then I find myself being not indulgent at all with them, like, you know, we'll have treats and lots of things like that and we have fun but I'm strict. I feel like I have to counteract. And that's how it is. I'm with them the same way I am with myself, which makes me very nervous about happens to my own kids because I don't treat myself very great. And if I'm gonna treat children the way I treat myself, that's not a good thing. That's not OK. And it's a huge part of me being here. It's that I'm not gonna treat, here I am saying I treat these other children like I treat myself and I hate it, but like I'm not gonna raise my own children and treat them this way because it's totally unacceptable. [00:31:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you also have a lot of love for these children.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I love them. I mean, I absolutely love them, but I know I could do better. And you know a lot of times I just feel worn out. I've been doing this for almost 10 years. These aren't the first kids I've watched. These are, I feel really close to the finish line, and a lot of times I just feel like I'm over this and it's not fair to them (pause) cause I just don't, I mean, I used to be so much more fun. (chuckles) And I just don't wanna, I'm really afraid that I've used up all my best kid energy on 10 years of kids that weren't mine, and whenever we do have kids that I'm gonna be over it and I'm kinda terrified. [00:32:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the "over it" that you're gonna not want to care for a child?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I'm gonna be like, that I have, that I'll have these, because I've done especially the toddlers, like I've done the toddler's age for a different toddler for the last 10 years. I mean and so I feel like, yeah, I'll just be like kind of "how do you not get this - come on". 'Cause in my head, like, I've been doing this over and over. I mean I'm not afraid that I'm gonna be neglectful or abusive or anything like that but I feel like I'll be so bored that it'll come off as, like I don't wanna be bored with my own kid. That's a huge fear. I don't wanna sit there & be like thinking how dull this is and how "over it" I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you imagine feeling disconnected. [00:33:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and not having this, like, profound connection that you hear about everybody having, but then I'll be like, well, is everybody saying that because they've just never seen a child grow and develop? You know, been with a kid? I dunno. (pause) Yeah, I have a lot of fear about it. I mean no matter what, I know that I'm not gonna be a terrible parent, like, it's definitely within the realm of possibility, but I don't think that I'm going to be and I just want to be engaged and be "into it", just really "into it". I don't feel really "into" my job right now, and it feels like that's all it's gonna be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that these aren't my children, but if I feel right now how I feel about my own kids, I'm going to be really unhappy. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're leaving. It's in the context of "you're leaving".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But it hasn't been for the last year. You mean in the sense like I've always known I'm leaving?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just putting it in the context of two months, but maybe that's true, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. I mean I felt disconnected and like "I can't wait for this to be over for over a year. I've just gotta get through this next year." That's not a good feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of the dynamic between you and the parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of that and just because I'm tired of being, I'm isolated, I feel alone, I feel like I don't, I'm just tired of taking care of other people's children. I feel like all I do is take care of people, and this has no long-term payoff. I mean, like this is short term, like I'm putting in a lot of work for these kids and sometimes it's hard at the end of the day when I leave and I realize like this has no long-term payout (chuckles) and that's a terrible thing to think as a nanny. That's terrible. Because it does. It has long-term payoff for those kids but not if I'm doing it wrong, first of all, and not for me, and that's awful. But it gets tiring and I want a little bit of a break. [00:36:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I can't help but think that this is also related to your family and talking about all this investment you feel in them and they're just the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some of them are just sort of more than happy to jump off a cliff, like your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's all this investment and it's like "where's this gonna get me in the end?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. I'm pouring energy into it. I'm pouring energy into everyone in my life and I feel like there's nothing, I'm not getting anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel, I think, really depleted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm exhausted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you nervous about leaving here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Should we talk about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm nervous about (pause) a lot of things. Change is hard for me. I have a really hard time with just adjusting. I had a really hard time when we moved here. It's when my anxiety all started, at least my panic attacks started. And I'm really nervous that that's gonna happen again - really nervous. (pause) [00:38:05]</p>

<p>I'm really sad to leave the girls, even though I complain. I complain a lot, but I'm really sad to leave them. (pause) I don't really like their parents (chuckles) so I don't really want to continue a relationship with their parents, but I have to in order to keep seeing them, but it's really sad to think about. And sometimes I'll be with the baby and I'll just start crying. And she doesn't notice, especially with the glasses. They make it much easier, luckily. She's the one thing that makes me not nervous about having kids. I've been watching her for the last two plus years and I don't have the same feeling about her. I feel like I could be with her every day and have no problem. But, yeah, you know, I'm comfortable here. I know what to expect. I know where to go to get everything that I need. I know where to go if I want to take a sewing class I know where to go. If I want to get a particular cheese that Chris likes I know where to go. You know he knows things in New Hampshire, but I know what I like to do on Sundays here. I know where we're gonna meet our friends if we wanna go for a cheap dinner. And I know everything is so comfortable. [00:40:17]</p>

<p>I have a lot of fear about moving back to New Hampshire. The last time I lived there I was really unhappy. Chris says you know, like, there's been times that you lived in California and you weren't happy. There's been times I lived in California and I wasn't happy. It doesn't matter where we live, 'cause you can be unhappy or happy anywhere. Even though I still have all these associations with New Hampshire and I still think I just get really afraid of living there. And when Chris says things like, "Well, you know, we had talked about checking in five years", but it doesn't really make sense so, I mean, we could end up there for 10 years, or we could end up there if we really like it, you know, and I'm happy at my job, you know, we might just end up staying there. And that scares the shit out of me. [00:41:17] When he says that we might just end up staying there I think like there's no way in hell I can stay there. Like I'm already putting all this expectation that we'll be even going to California and that it's gonna be hard and I'm not gonna like it. I need to stop doing that because if I set that up in my mind that way, that is how it's going to be. If I can just go into it without these expectations and with more of a logical plan that it could be good, it could be bad. There could be good things. There could be bad things. It's going to be different no matter what. It's not going to be the same. And if I could just come from a more logical headspace, it would be better, but I'm having a really hard time with that. (pause) 'Cause in my gut, we weren't going back there. We were going back to California. We were coming here for a few years and then we were going back to California. (long pause) [00:42:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you just thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I was thinking that even if we were going back to California I know I'd still have all these same feelings. I'd still be thinking like he's already made the decision. I'd still have a lot of fear, and I think the reason that I'm so into the idea of going back to California is that because I have this whole idea of California that doesn't exist anymore. You know, a lot of our friends have left. I have this idea of how it was when we were 21, 22, 23. I can remember restaurant jobs and we were going out every night and, like, having a blast and everyone living together and that just doesn't exist anymore. I have this image in my head of California and it's like fun, everybody's hanging out, and that isn't there. And that wouldn't be there because logically that's just not the phase of our lives we're in anymore. And so I have to also let go of that. [00:43:34]</p>

<p>I have to let go of the fact that, even if we were going to California, it wouldn't be what I think it would be. But I associate California with the place that I first felt independent and I felt confident and I felt proud of something that I had done. And part of that was moving there. And that's what I was proud of. That's just how I see myself. That's the person I see when I think of living there. And when I think of living in New Hampshire, I think of this person who's, you know, sad and sucked into family stuff and too "missing things" over and over. Like even here I feel like I'm a different person than it's the "I'll try" thing. You know, I'll take a sewing class just because I feel like it or I'll, you know, I don't know, do whatever - try different things. And I want to keep being that person in New Hampshire. Chris looks at me like I'm crazy when I say that I'm, he's like "why would you be any different?" I don't know why I would be any different, but it's just my fear of losing parts of my person that I like when I go back there. [00:45:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where would they go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good question. (pause) Wherever. I don't know. Wherever the old bad stuff went.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just goes, or comes. I just don't want to move there and be depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmmm. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened to the person who wanted to move there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She saw better things. I love New Hampshire, but I know I'm happier away from my family. (pause) So, I don't know. (pause) I don't know. (yawn) I mean it's not that bad. I feel like I'm making it way too big a deal out of this. I've moved before, it's not . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do that a lot. You're very upset about something and you're, like, "You know, it'll be not that bad" And sometimes I think you're trying to soothe yourself. Sometimes the soothing kind of goes to beating up on yourself and you just stop talking. You go from trying to make yourself feel better to kind of being very harsh and critical of yourself which is what you were talking about earlier that you were afraid that you were treating the older girl that way. I'm not saying you are, I'm just saying you're afraid that you are. [00:47:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Yeah, it is. I mean that's totally (chuckles) 'cause I can talk myself out of either side of it and so, unless I'm getting like harsh, I know I can talk myself out of either side. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean that part of the question is why do you need to talk yourself out of it? Why can't you have both sides?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can't you just feel both things? We are going to need to stop for today. So I'll see you on Wednesday. And I wanted to let you know the first, I think it's the first Sunday in May, which is the 7th, I'm not going to be here that morning. I'd be happy to look at another time for you, but I wont' be here that morning. We can talk about it on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Great.</p>

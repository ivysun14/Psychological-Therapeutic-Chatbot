<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hi.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm good.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how come?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, it's been kind of a, a rough couple of weeks.  Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could sit and talk.  Do you want to shut the door?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Can you shut the door?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why has it been a rough couple weeks?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, just, um, so we tried to get [PATIENT NAME] into [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did he agree and everything is set to go or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, no.  They, they didn't admit him.  And they, they didn't admit him because of his, um, well his grades from [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, the admissions director said that, um, you know, when [PATIENT NAME] came to school it wasn't that he was, I mean he was polite and everything but he didn't, um, he didn't convey a strong sense of interest in going to the school.  So, I mean, their, their feedback was, you know, he's at [DEIDENTIFIED] because he got the capability, he did well on his entrance exams.  But, um, you know, we're, we're a college prep school and it's a privilege to come here and we need him to realize that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And they don't want to coax it out of him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So now I've talked to him about [DEIDENTIFIED] and they, and they said no, same thing.  You know, it's really, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean doing the year over again?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.  Um, so then, um, I, he called me back, um, because, you know, I was, I was pretty disappointed and, um, and then I really think that [PATIENT NAME] needs that different kind of environment.  I really, you know, your only options out here are parochial school -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what about summer session?  Do they have a summer session?  They don't?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.  And I asked, asked about academic probation and different things like that.  So he called me back and he said, "You know, I'd love to see [PATIENT NAME] here but he's not ready.  And he hasn't demonstrated the maturity and, um, but you know, one thing that you may want to consider, if you're seriously considering having him repeat [DEIDENTIFIED],"  he recommended [DEIDENTIFIED], which is up the road in [DEIDENTIFIED], which is a one, or kindergarten through eighth grade, have [PATIENT NAME] go to [DEIDENTIFIED] there.  And repeating [DEIDENTIFIED], um, because he is young for the class he's in.  And so we decided to explore it.  And so [PATIENT NAME] went there, um, we went there for a visit a week ago Thursday and then he spent this past Thursday and Friday shadowing, um, the school.  And he, he likes it.  He would prefer to go to public school but you like it, right?  I told you you couldn't play that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now tell me what, what it was like, you know, because I remember you shadowed the people at [DEIDENTIFIED] too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was it different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] makes you do lots of work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what about this school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's okay, I'd be, rather go to public school but I'll still go there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And did they accept him or we don't know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We don't know yet.  So here's what we got to work on, "[DEIDENTIFIED] makes you do a lot of work, I don't want to do a lot of work."  So, you know, it's, it's been, you know, I work full time.  So I'm trying very hard to give him options and arrange my schedule to give him these different options.  And it's, it's not easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't have any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about, what about looking into a summer session that, um, addresses maybe some structure and, you know, behavioral issues?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> May not be a bad idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean we have, boy, between [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].  You could call [DEIDENTIFIED].  You know [DEIDENTIFIED]?  It's actually, it's a military school up in Wisconsin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, it's quite good.  And it's, um, very structured.  They may have a summer session.  I don't know if they would have it for somebody going from [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED]  But -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't, I don't think that [PATIENT NAME] has demonstrated the maturity or the ownership for the, his academics, right, and that it's important.  And an example of that, and I got upset with him yesterday when we were talking about how the day went.  Um, you know, the first day, he said it went well.  And I said, "Why?"  And he says, "Oh, because they don't, because they don't work here.  They don't do academics."  I said, "Oh really."  Um, and then, and apparently it was, you know, one of those lighter days when they were in between subjects and it wasn't very intense.  And then, Friday when I asked him how it went and the math teacher giving him problems to do Thursday evening without parental help so that he could assess where he was in math.  So I asked, you know, what they math teacher's feedback was, he said, "You know, I did good.  He corrected some problems.  Then he told me to work in the math book in whatever section that interested me."  So [PATIENT NAME] was very proud of himself when he told me that he went to chapter one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just thought it was funny.  I did not say I was proud of myself, mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no.  That -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, but the attitude you conveyed, and I think the attitude he conveyed to the teacher -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sarcasm and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, it's, it's, again, I'm going to try and get away with this -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He laughed too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to try and do as little as I can.  He laughed, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't think about, this is a kid who doesn't want to do his best.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well maybe it's true.  Well if that's true then why shouldn't you accept me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I, I didn't -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think we have to have to listen to what they said.  What they said is that he's not ready.  So maybe what we have to do is respect that and figure out ways to get you ready to be in a place like that.  After we do that, now there are other programs, there's also [DEIDENTIFIED].  Are you familiar with [DEIDENTIFIED]?  It's a special camp for ADHD children.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wonderful, special camp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's not, no.  I mean, it's, it's ADHD.  It's not for people who have, you know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> ADHD is not the desired component that you are dealing with.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's, I think the, I think what I would do is explore these summer programs.  I mean, I don't know if it's best to keep him back a year or not at this point.  But I would want to see how much movement he had in an environment like that.  And I don't know if these camps are two weeks, one week, a month, I don't know.  But you could look them up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I would look at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I would look into [DEIDENTIFIED].  Uh, I think he's too young for [DEIDENTIFIED] experience, we had talked about that before.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He can do the [DEIDENTIFIED], um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] experience.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With your stepdad we talked about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> With his dad, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  I have, you know, his school social worker did recommend him for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And so there's a meeting Thursday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to take him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's not, it's not too late in the year for that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Apparently not.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Because they go next month.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  So we're going to go Thursday night and we're going to see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That would be ideal for you.  That's only eight days -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think so too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight days, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's only four nights, actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they cut it down -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To four now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's the, it's the [DEIDENTIFIED] that you would do with other kids your age that have the same kind of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  They go off to the boundary waters in Canada.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know what.  You can look at me like this, okay.  And you can sit like this.  And I'm going to tell you one thing.  I am done.  Okay.  I've given you every opportunity.  You no longer have a choice, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To go to a camp.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.  You no longer have a choice on anything.  I'm just done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Send me to a camp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now this, if he, I'm surprised it's only four, they cut it down so much.  But, because it takes a full day to drive up there.  They go by bus.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum.  Okay.  I get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless they go to a different place -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know what they're doing.  But anyway, yeah that, what I would do, I would, because I've seen kids his age literally tell me it's, it's a -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Life changing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A life changing experience, yeah.  Did they mention that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER], the social worker at the school told me the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's true and I've seen it firsthand.  So, and it's intense, it's, yeah, if he can get in there, uh, so you talked to [NAME OTHER] on the phone?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You have to apply for it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's the same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you're going to force me into it like [DEIDENTIFIED] and you'll tell me to do my best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Now this is only four days, I mean, this is, or five days, it's, it's really -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a great opportunity [PATIENT NAME].  Plus it, it's free because the township pays for it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Everything I'm doing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The camp -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is to try and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The camp -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Help you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Doesn't apply any academics so therefore I don't need to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know what, you know what you need.  You need, you need -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This won't help me with my future, mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  It might, [PATIENT NAME].  Because what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It might, it won't</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm telling you, it's a very, it's a very intense experience.  It's a bonding experience with other students.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a canoeing experience.  I mean, it's -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know, you don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I just hope they will take you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  [PATIENT NAME], you know, everything -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If they take me, I'll [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Don't interrupt.  Okay?  Everything is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, after Thursday if [NAME OTHER] wants to call me I'd be happy to talk to him as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, well, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd do anything to try to get him in so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME] everything is about you trying to avoid getting involved and we're trying to show, to try and help you get over that fear.  And whether it's academics or, or whether it's [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to go with other people, mom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd do it with people I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well maybe they've been referred too, who knows.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Maybe when we go Thursday night there'll be people there that you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You think [NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER], do you think [NAME OTHER] would go there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't know, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why wouldn't [NAME OTHER] go?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, you know what, I'm, you're not making -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not, I don't fit in to that crowd, mom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That crowd is just like you.  This is for -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They all have ADHD?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The majority of them do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, this is for people that's struggle with school, that don't take responsibility, people that are exhibiting the same behaviors you are.  Yeah, it's not for like people that are into sports and get good grades.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's people -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That have, are struggling to figure out where their place is in life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They have to be referred.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't, I all ready know where my place is in life and that's where I want it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are things at home?  Bad too, or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, his behavior's been fine.  Um, he's just, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's just the motivation and the direction?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  You know, he just, he doesn't get it.  He doesn't, everything is, you know, coaxing.  I mean, it's a constant, it's if you're constantly vigilant and, you know, make sure you get all of his books and his homework assignments and you sit down with him.  But I mean, but that's no way for him to get prepared for life.  I, I can't do that.  One, I can't do it because I can't, I got other things I have, I have a [AGE], I, you know, I cannot baby him like he's [AGE].  He's going to have to do it on his own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I would look into those programs.  And if, you know, he does get into that, that's a start but I would also look into these other programs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  So you said the [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] or what was it, what was the second one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What was the camp?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I was going to say, he's a football player.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's right.  I think he was [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he was from Illinois actually, he went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  No, [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  All right, so you'll -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they have different length sessions, you know, sessions, you know, summer, maybe a week or two, I don't know.  But if he can do all three of them over the summer and see what kind of changes we see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I, I think if they feel that way at [DEIDENTIFIED] then that might be, definitely don't want to push him in because -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll set him up for failure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  So, and I mean, I understand the hesitation to have him repeat eighth grade from, he, he the same age -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] did he pass eighth grade?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's not passing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.  But the public school system still -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Will graduate him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Will graduate him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many classes did you fail?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> All of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You failed every class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He doesn't know this yet?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I didn't know you were failing every class.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.  No I told you.  But, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.  That's a problem.  So the medicine isn't help, he's still taking the medicine right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  It's not a question of, um, being able.  He's not, he's not bringing his homework home.  He's not doing his homework.  He's not studying for his tests.  He's, he's totally withdrawn.  And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about that, I added the Lamictal and increased the dose.  What does that do?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's helped his mood stabilization -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mood.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When his, his anger or his frustration is not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's up to 100 mg now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 100.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The full bigger pill, right?  The full bigger pill?  I don't want to go higher on that.  But he's on enough medicine, you know, to help it.  You're still taking the Strattera?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I just take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He just takes it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who knows what they're putting into me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's not on any medication now.  So you're seeing the full attitude.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's [INAUDIBLE], is he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  I just didn't, forgot to give it to him this morning.  So, I just, I got to go, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you see a difference when he doesn't take it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Absolutely.  He's belligerent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the school isn't recommending holding him back then?  The public school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, which is amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They can't hold you back unless you want to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, even if I want to it's, I know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They push him through?  No child is, the, the no child left behind thing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well he's not ready for high school, I mean, if he failed everything in [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no way.  So that's not appropriate even to think about unless -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  And they wanted to put him in the alternative program, which is, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, the [INAUDIBLE] program.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's not [INAUDIBLE] but it's, um, it's an alternative program at [DEIDENTIFIED], which, you know, it, smaller group, slower pace, same material but that's not his issue.  You know, you go back to his performance on the entrance exams at [DEIDENTIFIED] and you go back to his IQ, intelligence and capability isn't the issue.  It's, it's desire and motivation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, we had talked last time about maybe finding something he loves like tennis or -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And he's doing great at tennis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, he's really enjoying that.  So every Sunday he plays for an hour and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you getting better at tennis?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I'm great at tennis, no one can beat me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm serious.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Wait.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, is, is it, is, is he feel that he has a -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Potential.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about looking into like a school tennis program?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They have them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In Florida.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am not going out of state for something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, they have these special programs, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Train kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sports.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That have potential.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything that's structured, yeah, they don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not, I'm not good enough to go to a camp because all the people there, they are over achievers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's true.  They're all, I mean, the kids, those tennis people really want to make a career out of it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would fail miserably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about a camp like that?  A tennis camp?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know, I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought we just agreed that they're all over achievers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a possibility.  An intense tennis program.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not an over achiever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's look, add that to the list of things to look at.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then tennis, they have these programs, you ever get tennis magazines or something?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or online -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mom -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could find one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What?  You know, [PATIENT NAME] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will get my butt whooped.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME], look, we're, [PHYSICIAN NAME]'s just throwing out options, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, if you love tennis and it's something he's good at then, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not good enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For those people.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Here's the thing I, I get concerned about, is he, he likes the idea, he loves the idea of being a great tennis player and he likes going to his lessons, but we were just discussing, this is the, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] summer program and he doesn't like this, the, um, coach at [DEIDENTIFIED].  And I don't blame him, I don't think he's very good but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The tennis coach?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  But I was, wanted to have him participate in the [DEIDENTIFIED] junior tennis program during the week and he can still go to his tennis coach on Sundays.  He doesn't want to do it.  So, you know, you can't have everything perfect.  Right?  You, you got to be able to tolerate some things that are less than perfect because it helps you get to your end goal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And anytime that it doesn't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's your end goal, mom?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> To help you succeed in life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And when I, when I do succeed in life, what's your end goal then?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to sit back and go, "Whew, thank God."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then after that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'll take a vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you'll deal with it with your own kids.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she'll watch you.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'll love every minute of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well what about if I don't want to have kids?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh well.  Then I'll, I'll be somewhere in the Caribbean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, I'm thinking some structure setting over the summer and just see how he responds to it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What if I marry -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some famous celebrity and we're rich but we don't have kids and I'll beat you to the Caribbean?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I'll be like, "Ha."  I'll send you a postcard saying, "Na, na, na, na, na."</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Nothing would make me happier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I'd have a picture of us in a Lamborghini saying, "Yeah, you wish you could" -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Isn't that amazing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "You wish you had this, yeah.  Eat your heart out."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, let's not change any of the medicine.  Do you need refills on anything, or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, you know what, I do need Concerta.  You know, I never did, I had asked you for a reduction in the Concerta because of the experience we had over the summer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, vacation.  I actually never filled it, so he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he's still on the 54?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, he's still on the 54.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now, over the summer, like on the weekends I'll tell you that I don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought we'd [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's the old one, I don't know if you want -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 36?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You see [NAME OTHER] at 1:00, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What time is it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's 12:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's only 12:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're going to, just try and calm down, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See the [INAUDIBLE] increases without the Concerta.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, clearly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still want to try the 36 or you want to just -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I want him for this, I mean, I'd like to, I think for school, oh, school's shot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we got another month, why don't we keep him on the 54 for another month, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then why don't you do all this research and find something to get him in and we'll talk before he goes to one of these programs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sounds good.  Where you going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] so if I could just get a 54.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifty-four, okay.  All right, but that's what it sounds like.  Some structured setting for the summer, see his response, and then we'll decide about where he goes, eighth grade, ninth grade, what school or?  Because it will make a different depending on his response to this summer program as to what's appropriate for him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he's open to repeating it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It means repeating -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> More or less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> More or less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More or less what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Open to it.  I'd rather go to high school, but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> High school and the alternative program.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  That'd still be high school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Huh.</p>

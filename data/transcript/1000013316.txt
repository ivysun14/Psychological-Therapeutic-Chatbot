<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: My notebook. I've got my notebook.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have your notebook with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I had such a lousy weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was even; I went to the country, country house. And we're having problems with the plumber.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then the neighbors on either side who we don't connect with. One couple doesn't answer our telephone. When we asked if the plumber had dug up the driveway to lie in the sewer. So I was feeling like that was our friendly place and coming back here I wasn't my usual grumpy self about the people on the subway and everything around me. It felt comfortable compared to other times when I'm walking along and feeling crowded and antagonistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you were glad to be back here, you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Except when we first came through Lincoln Park there were all these trucks going by. Of course, we live on Edgewater Avenue, which is a connection between the Clark Street Bridge and the Parks. Going in the backyard is always peaceful. So I was hanging up clothes and that a therapeutic activity. (chuckles)</p>

<p>When we were talking about drinks and you know how to get that release. I guess that has to do with letting yourself be yourself. And feeling, doing what you feel comes from you and is comfortable for you, which is a tall order for some people. But I guess you could do that to some extent I guess as long as you don't tread on anyone's toes or upset them in some way by being yourself. I mean, can you be yourself regardless of how people respond to you and not give a damn? (chuckles)</p>

<p>And you know, some people say, "Well, they can either take it or leave it." And I have a brother in law who is completely selfish about what he likes to do and what he doesn't like to do and he doesn't care who that hurts. 0:02:24.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, and people accept him. He says, "Well, he's that kind of jerk. You have to take it for.."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They accept him as being that kind of a jerk. (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that if you were to be yourself that you would create problems for other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. Well, here's one thing that happened this weekend. Which caused me a lot of stress. We went to this plumber's house because he's been stalling us and lying and we found out he doesn't do all that much good work. And it's horrible. And we gave him 600 dollars, which is we walked into that stupidly. Stupidly done.</p>

<p>So we went to his house in the morning, well, we spent the day going there three times. In the morning, a neighbor was walking her dog and she says she's a real estate agent and she knows about deadbeats like this. And, you know, she's sorry we got involved like this. But she said, "Don't, I'd be careful about knocking on his door. Because you don't know how he'll react." And she was warning us. And it didn't occur to us to even think about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was warning you about confronting him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And so, I guess I got angry and I showed my anger. I didn't know I was doing that, but later Todd told me in the car, "Hey, she was only trying to be nice. You shouldn't be angry."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, what did you say to her? 0:03:54.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't realize I was saying it. Maybe it was just my tone of voice. I said, "Oh, after he's treated us so shabbily now we have to worry about this added possibility?" Or some, you know, I didn't really realize that I was doing anything. She didn't respond in an insult, she wasn't insulted. And we didn't leave at odds with each other, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I think in a sense you were saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just got kinda pissed off. (overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:04:30.8) It wasn't something you wanted to hear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To hear about confronting him. Because he's already ripped you off, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Of course there's the other advice you get. "Well, before you take any action, you go and you talk it over with the party that your having a grievance with." So that's what we were going to do. So here's somebody else who has their advice. And I'm thinking all I need is more advice and something else to worry about. So I sort of said, not in so many words, thank you but I don't want that advice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Todd, my Todd who likes to be liked. He needs to be liked. Maybe I do too. He was, he responded to that later in the car. And he said," Oh she was only trying to do, to help. Why were you so mad at her? Why were you so angry?" So literally he criticized me for showing my anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So then I sort of got overwhelmed and I'm thinking, "Well, there are all these people who are against me. The plumber, the real estate agent and Todd. And they're all telling me I'm wrong in some way." So I started to cry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that our reactions are wrong. (overlapping) 0:06:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Todd was the last straw. The last straw because he wasn't with me. He was criticizing me because I might have hurt that lady.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. When she was telling you something..</p>

<p>PATIENT: When she was being so nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she was telling you something you absolutely don't want to hear at that time, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. And also, it's really unclear whether she was in fact insulted. It may have been Todd's oversensitivity, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. And I told Todd, "Gee. I'll go over and apologize to her. If this was really some bad behavior on my part, I will apologize." But at the time, it's what came out of me. And I didn't censor anything. Eh, it's funny that what's comes out of you is never the right thing. You know, you always react true to form somehow. You learn a certain reaction and you never you never act differently. Even in your own interest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is the thing that you learned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I learned? (chuckles) That I don't learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:07:15.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, here's what we learned. I mean, I motivated. It's on the car dashboard. Never take anything at face value. Never hire anyone that has only a post office box number. (chuckles) Don't put any money down until after the job is done. But then after we talked to the guy, Todd hadn't met him before. Finally at the end of the day he came out of the house and we talked. And he gave us another line of bullshit. He's not the kind that gets angry and shoots you. He's the kind that gives you delaying tactics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the real estate agent was wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, because there are people that you shouldn't confront. Like you say, they get angry and they shoot you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he didn't do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But how are you to know? 0:07:59.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And since he did work for people on either side of us. So he didn't shoot them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He does, I guess, some kind of work of some quality or of some caliber. It's not quality and it's not quick and it's not week. And people wind, a homeowner will wind up helping him because he gets short.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He ran into a problem with a cement wall. And like, he didn't know what to do. The owner finally went and got a drill and helped him. So he's not the kind of guy you just pay money to and on the phone you say, would you do such and so. But I guess it was too much for me. All of that coming at me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sounds like a (inaudible at 0:08:49.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I hate it when Todd gets, is critical of me. He usually isn't. And that seems to be like, well the last straw.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's seems like I don't have the strength to hold on to my own convictions. And he chips it away. And I dislike him for doing that. And I get mad at him for doing that and then I start crying. Because he's chipping away my only self-determination, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why you said (inaudible at 0:09:32.6) you don't know if can just be yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of what people expect of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you sort of were reacting, your natural inclination was to react a certain way and Todd was saying that's wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. And we had, we were..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You doubt yourself. 0:09:50.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: He made me doubt myself, yeah. We always talk about it afterwards. He always apologizes. And, but he's true to form too. He keeps going along in his own stupid direction. So he met, he had never seen that guy face to face. I saw him once before. And he says, Todd says, "I'm going to size him up."</p>

<p>Well, the guy was a big baby faced overweight youth who was giving you the benefits of all kinds of doubt. He says, "Well, I gave the money to the diggers and if they're not there Monday or Tuesday I will send you back the money on Wednesday." Tomorrow. And I think that judging by his past behavior that's all lies. And Todd doesn't want to hurt anybody. And he said, well. He wants it to go ahead and say, "Well, I want to give you the job." And I was saying, "Give me the money back." And Todd was saying, "Oh, go ahead and do the job." And I was hoping he wouldn't have anything dug because it's just going to go on and be another six months of aggravation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So here we were, both confronting this guy coming at it from different angles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Todd has already told you that you're wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He sees you are angry so you're already doubting yourself now because you can't do what you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Of course he has to, I guess, learn after meeting this guy how he behaves. And yet, after making, before Todd met this guy, after making many phone calls and not having it returned and not having the thing dug up as he said he would. You know, Todd checked to see if it was and whatever he said didn't come to pass. Then Todd got angry and called him and left a message really coming on strong. "Like nobody makes a monkey out of me. If you don't do this job, blah, blah." And so over the phone he like tore into him. And I said, "Great, that's the Todd I like to hear." But then when he confronted him, he backed down. 0:12:04.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He backed down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So he goes back and forth. Sometimes he's tough sometimes he's not. Sometimes he's tough on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes he's not very tolerant of your being tough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wants you to be all-nice too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And I every so often let him have it, that he's cramping my style. (chuckles) That this is what I want to express and what I want to do, so. But he's amenable to learning. (chuckles) He's not, I mean he's probably got his problems there too. Not letting go. He's sorta hashed them out. But..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you sound like the two of you can talk to him about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, being yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, on that, on not being yourself I think it's kind of interesting. Because when we talked about it last week about you and you're having this glass of wine and feeling you're happy. And feeling relaxed with yourself and you could talk with other people more easily. And you knew how to talk to people. Like you knew, well people are always interested in telling about themselves.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. So you ask about their lives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You ask about their lives. That was kind of what we were talking about in terms of feeling relaxed and being yourself and being relaxed with others. But as we're talking about it this week it seems to be more like you're saying, "Can I be myself? What happens if I'm a bit grumpy and I say something? Is that all right?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so I was grumpy yesterday in my answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's a rotten situation. (overlapping) 0:13:58.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. Yeah, right. I have cause to be grumpy. The ideal way to respond is the way people speak on channel 13. (chuckles) There are some diplomats that are talking about the most horrendous things and coming back against terrible accusations. And they just sit there as calm as can be and just explaining themselves away without any emotion and any anger. That's perfect. That's beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know but is that attainable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Some one, Shumar, this guy Shumar. (sp?)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder how the diplomats, ok I wonder how Shumar (sp?) is about his plumber? (chuckles) Know what I'm saying? When it's a personal situation you're in, and it's your house and it's your money and you're the one being personally ridiculed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know that stirs up a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a whole different story. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:54.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Personal attack. An undermining. But that martini, I was thinking of, there's something outlined in red. I feel something like that when. We go to Colorado a couple of, like a week every year. Of course we have this friend who had a cabin.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you go in Colorado?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Aspen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, I don't know where that is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's in the non-tourist area. And especially this last trip. We went with, the man who had the cabin died and we went with his widow who lives near us. And it was such a pleasant trip overall. The feeling, I guess, when you go away is you leave everything behind. Like this wine takes everything away that is negative and unpleasant and you're free to direct yourself outward and feel comfortable. So I guess when you go away you're free to direct yourself outward to tourist attractions and things around you. And all the garbage you leave at home. So I guess that's why people go traveling. 0:16:24.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:16:27.1) you can leave all the garbage</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like all the garbage was left here. And we just motored through and just wondered how to have fun. Every day you wake up, "Well how am I going to, where am I going to go today and have fun?" So that must be what traveling is like. And we haven't done much of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do, what do you do for fun when you're in Colorado?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you always have to ride for miles to get anywhere, number one. (chuckles) We went to a small town and read the bulletin board and found out there was a fireman's lobster dinner. And we bought tickets and went to that. And go into little dinky stores and look fun things that they have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kinda window-shop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but there were some museums. There are the granite quarries. I saw those long ago but I should see them again. You look into a deep pit. We road around a lake. Went to Denver and took a ride. That wasn't so terrific. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I remember that it was fun to like come upon quaint situations. We went to a little Post Office, store, and hardware. It was like a combination everything. General store. And it had all kinds of sections and things. Anything different from what you're used to seeing here, sort of like. And now this last year we went to a microbrewery. You know, brew your own beer. So we found a great, the Starr Hill Brewery has a great lunch. 0:18:28.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's always a big thing, isn't it? Food and drink.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah so I guess. You know, people always say you should travel more. We should. But we've bought this summerhouse, which has been a millstone around our neck. Of course that's what you, you go there and it used to be fun because we used to know people there. And now they're all dying. Even this young fellow who was our best friend and his family. He died of Crone's disease.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my God.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just, the people that we joined the local beach club. And it's like a complete turnover of people because the older folks have died.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so this weekend trip, besides having the hassle with the plumber. We had to visit one of the old timers who moved to like a nursing camp facility. He used to be our neighbor and he helped us a lot with the house when we were fixing and building. And the first time we had to deal with the house management. Which is how (inaudible at 0:19:39) pain in the ass.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when did you (inaudible at 0:19:39.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the seventies. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A long time together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we have. Late seventies. We lived on Ninth Street in this little nothing apartment and we used to go there on weekends. So it was great then. But now its just maintenance. All maintenance. And I don't recommend a summerhouse to anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't enjoy it anymore? 0:20:01.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's too much work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To keep up the house?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To keep up. It's just a lot of work. And the same trees just keep getting larger and larger. And every year you've got to cut them down. And I used to love trees. I was a not cut a tree. I would save every flower and every plant. And now, you know give me rocks and give me..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After a while (inaudible at 0:20:27.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Give me these nice set ups where the landscape architect will come and put in the right kind of shrubs among pebbles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I think you're right that you need more fun in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe if you concentrated on becoming (inaudible at 0:20:41.6) (overlapping) You're selling that hopefully?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah hopefully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could get something else like a condo or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something yeah. My sister in law keeps saying, "Get a condo. Get rid of everything that you have to take care of."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to maintain it and whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Just a terrace to grow a few things on will be enough. Even though I like the backyard I have now. But that's a lot of work too. Even though it's not..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well sometimes-even condos have backyards. And sometimes townhouses and that sort of thing. And they maintain the garden.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's ok. I'm even getting tired of the plants in my house, you know. I have plants and I have to water them. And then I just lug the geranium indoors. From outdoors to indoor. And then that's just adds to all the other junk that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem to be kind of weighed down with responsibility.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but all these things I used to like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fussing with the cats is a chore. Fussing with the plants.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it's this drive for simplicity you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think. It's something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because as well as that you've talked about wanting to get rid of the stuff you've accumulated. 0:21:54.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of this stuff is just lying on my head. And then when it's not, when it doesn't disappear. For instance, we have ten boxes of newspapers. Complete newspapers, which we're selling to newspaper archives in Montclare And they're all packed and ready to pick up.</p>

<p>The UPS guy came. We had labels on they were addressed properly. But he had special labels that this company who was buying it had ready made up. He says, "Put these on and I'll be right back." He never came back. Now he could have taken them out one by one and just slapped that thing on. And so he didn't come back. So that was Friday. And then we went away and came back Monday. And I need to call UPS now. Some of the boxes are still like right in the middle of everything.</p>

<p>And I feel like I should complain and get pissed off. Although I see how people complain. Some people when I hear them complain, I admire how they do it. Like this woman who questioned the senior, the director of the senior center in my neighborhood. She like very bravely, or seemed to me bravely, just brought up the things and confronted him with certain basic questions. As to how come the center's not open yet. You told us it would be open. You lied to us. And you have every right to say that and to make statements like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How was her manner when she was doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her usual calm matter of fact approach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's true that if you can be, if you can remain emotionally calm yourself and actually remain somewhat respectful of the other person, you know, that you can say those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You can't let him feel that you despise him. 0:24:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It's not easy because if you're feeling, if you're taking it personally, you know. If you having, or if you're just having a personal emotional reaction to the fact that your plumber screwed up or somebody did something that wasn't good for you. It's hard then to calmly discuss it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's why I sort of say replay things in my head first. Like I could say to that UPS guy is, "You've inconvenienced us by making us hold on to these packages for four days. Ten packages for four days." And I would tell him I called UPS and they said, "Oh if he said he'll come back, he'll come back." "But you made a liar out of yourself." You know, something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's been four days. I mean that's the crucial thing. If he said he's coming back you don't expect it to be four days.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're all in the foyer in the way of everything. It just adds to my other accumulations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was so pissed off this weekend that I didn't even feel like picking up any junk. And we passed a lot of junk, which I would have responded to if I hadn't been so involved with people dumping on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the plumber and then Todd and all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then we had to follow this through. So we went to the sewer authority in that and talked to them. And found out that another plumber took out the permit. And then we went to Town Hall and I took out a summons, a small claims court thing. I'm going to start things rolling and somehow make him know that he'll pay for this. And went to the consumer department, the consumer fraud department, consumer fraud there. I have a form for that. And I think I'll try to contact the plumber whose name is on the permit. Which is not the same as this fellow, this young obese guy. 0:26:24.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you have already a good idea of how to set things right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. That's our only recourse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless he actually comes through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Which I hope he doesn't because he'll just dawdle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm and it will be a long..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there's a house at the end of the block that he's doing. And the soil is still upturned. The pipes are in but the soil is upturned. If that freezes you won't be able to replace it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it should freeze soon, won't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it will freeze soon. And he didn't drain out; he's supposed to pump out the septic tank. And we looked in and there's a whole septic stuff still in there. And then I understand, one neighbor that I talked to, he takes away some of the soil. Soil that's like valuable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, top soil?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or fill. Clean fill. It's not topsoil. Yeah. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's striking though that it did manage to ruin your whole weekend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I felt, I felt..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's a horrible situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like the new neighbors, there's a young couple,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did not return our calls. And Todd said to me, "Oh my mother always said that young people don't like old people." So this is a new couple that, they have a sailboat. They go out in their sailboat and they have fun, fun, fun. And the fellow on the left I guess wasn't as neighborly as we wanted. He was new to the scene. He just bought the house on that side. 0:28:04.8</p>

<p>So I felt like isolated and unloved. And really unloved to the point that I went to the supermarket and I saw a black fellow there. And I sympathized with him. And I felt, "My goodness. He must feel what I'm feeling now." Like no one has any positive direction. There's nothing positive directed at you. There's just a, like a virgin and just not wanting to get involved. So instead of enjoying the neighborliness that we came to expect in that area, we had these two new homeowners on either side of us who made us feel quite the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know you said a little earlier something that it's always the same thing that just comes out of you. You know, your old reaction that just comes out at any situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think that that's this feeling of being unloved, that there's nothing really positive directed towards you. I think that's your old reaction that you've felt for years. I think that you would change. And that when certain things happen in your life that feeling comes up very strongly again. Like what happened this weekend? (inaudible at 0:29:43.3) make it right with the plumber. Todd wasn't very supportive. He usually is but this time he didn't seem so. The neighbors, whatever reason didn't just weren't returning your calls. And all of this just triggers all of these feelings in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. The old feelings of being rejected and unloved. 0:30:01.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So somehow you should not have these feelings. Or hopefully have them put to rest and come up with some other response.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean I suppose the feelings are going to come up anyway right? Because that's your history and that's you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then you have to what? Go on despite them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. Well, for example. I don't know that the neighbors didn't return your calls out of some maliciousness. I mean maybe they were busy. Maybe they were away. Maybe they weren't returning any calls from anyone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But we went over and walked over to the neighbor. And he was in the car. And he waved and took off. And we expected him to stop. Because we went over to talk to him. We went over to the house. We walked over. He was pulling out in his car and he waved and took off. So he didn't want to stop to talk. He's the one that recommended that plumber. So I don't know what he feels. Because we have complained to him about the plumber, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But your neighbor though, your neighbor didn't really love you or hate you, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They want to be alone. They want to have their fun. They don't want to be bothered with us. That's the feeling. "Don't bother me. I'm not going to return your calls. I'm busy with my life. I've got fun to do. I've got work to do. I don't care what's going on with your life."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's really hurtful. But at the same time, these are not really important people in your life. I mean that's sort of what I'm saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You end up feeling really unloved but these are not important people to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess we just made them important because we needed their help just to see and report to us was there any work done. You know that's, that's their only importance. That's their only importance and we needed them for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of reached out to them. Hmm. So you were developing a relationship around that. Kind of reaching out (inaudible at 0:32:01.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well the other thing that hurt us too. In the summer when they were out in their sailboat, the two of them, and they had a house full of their in laws. And I guess it was a Memorial Day barbeque or whatever. And we were on our side. And they hadn't returned and it was getting dark. And the mother said to us, "Do you see them?" We were on our deck looking out at the water. And the mother said, "Do you see them? It's dark already." And she was concerned. And we said no. And so the concern, we offered to go look for them. You know because they would have stopped at some point along, there's a restaurant where folks pull in. And somehow it came up that they might have been there.</p>

<p>So we took off and went looking. We stopped there and asked around, asked people. You know, we did the neighborly thing. Only, just because, I don't know. We were concerned because the mother was concerned. But there was no retaliation. So they could care less about us but we cared about them. You see? So we will make them completely unimportant to us then. Which is what they want. And that's not a neighborly thing. That's why you don't want to live in a place like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They make you feel like (overlapping) (inaudible at 0:33:18.7) Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, one reason that makes turned off to being there. It's like an unpleasant. But there are other people that we still know so we went and talked to this other woman. And felt, you know, she sat us down. And we've known her a long time. Because there were other people. And there was a, we have to talk to another plumber. Who is more of a friendly person who we've used before which who we should have seen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are, I mean, there's other people you just don't know, people who still sort of like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah who know us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what stands out about the weekend is the rejection you felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it feels like it's not really balanced by the fact that there are people who didn't reject you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because the people on the other side are completely into their own thing. The two young people with their games and fun. And the fellow on the other side who is redoing the house. He's making the roof taller and what not. So he's got his hand full with that. 0:34:29.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean I can see why you would feel rejected and hurt you know. And I think most people would.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so different from the people who were living there before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially when you had better relationships with the people who were there before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just, I guess my reaction to it is, I'm still feeling like there's certainly a good reason for you to be upset about it. About the plumber and Todd and the neighbor. But my sense is that your reaction to it also contains like elements of your past.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not just about what's going on today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Also old feelings are being unlodged and triggered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they maybe kicked in and made me feel a little more than I should have, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Or more than was necessary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More than was necessary. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I think, I mean I think that happens to everyone depending on what the person's issues are, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this feeling of you being unloved..</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if I'm aware of that, I will respond in a better way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a not so overtly active, you know, way. Yeah. I have to write that down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. That's just my reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think about it? About this old feeling? Is it something that you feel (inaudible at 0:35:58.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's why I started to cry. Because then that old feeling really kicked in with a punch. And I'm feeling it now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's talk about it for a while. Can you tell me what it is you're feeling? Try to describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like it's overwhelming. It makes me feel so impotent. And, well it makes me feel like a little girl who's just helpless. Helpless. And that's why at the same time I try to think of, you know, what the adult would do. Like you go to court and you get the, you see this Office of Consumers. And you do this and you do that. That's what, you know, I'm grabbing for anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that come to you right away in the moment? As you feel like a little girl and you feel sad or overwhelmed, do you also right away start to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not right away. (chuckles) First I wallow in this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's stay with this first one. This feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard to say anything more about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where do you feel it's stemming from? There's usually some kind of physical..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of like in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like in your chest?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It all sort of comes out here. And a little bit in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In you head? Under your ears or your head?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, like back here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it numb or tingling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like a tingle. Like a pressure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pressure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a pressure. I hope I have a tissue in here. I probably don't. 0:38:04.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's some tissue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yeah, so that's the old feeling. All stored away somewhere and it just comes out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And physically it kinda comes up and through..</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's triggered, yeah. It sort of comes up from here down from here and out through here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sort of makes you..</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I'm choked up and I feel, "God, what's happening." Or this awful thing is making me feel so awful. But I don't know what my feelings for other people are at this moment. Probably that they're all against me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that I'm all alone and helpless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Helpless and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alone and helpless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no one here helping you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And I don't know how to deal with it. You know if only I could deal with it. But I don't even wonder if I can deal with it. It's just I'm drowning in ineptitude. (chuckles) Ineptitude. If I had some eptitude I could swim out of this thing. But this is like just washing over me. These negative incoming messages. Everything negative. And then inside is triggered the pain. This feeling and that feeling and pain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're charged with like negative messages.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that fixes the pain</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and it just releases all that backlog of stuff that I have ready whenever this happens. If there's enough people telling me, "Hey, you didn't do this right." So I guess Todd triggered it by telling me, "Why were you so, why did you talk that way to that woman?" 0:40:25.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the plumber had already proven that you're vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then Todd for the rejecting you or saying that you weren't doing something right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The feeling is, I think you know, it's not just about what's happening with the plumber and the friends. It's a very old feeling that gets control of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess it has to do with my mother. I have a feeling that you know she didn't give me enough positive vibes and love me enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you know a child who doesn't get enough of love feels rejected and then doesn't possibly get control because of the feeling of being rejected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. Because they can't learn at that point. They have to deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you know like if the kid goes to school and everyone teases him because you know he can speak Spanish or something. And he comes home and Mom helps him with that. Then at least he learns how to cope with feelings of rejection. That even if people reject you, you're still good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. You get some positive input so that you can counteract that other stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Someone who loves you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if you hear enough good things about yourself as you grow up, that's your tool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It helps you when these come.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It helps you hold your composure when other people reject you. 0:42:04.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if your mother wasn't there to help you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if she was the one who was rejecting you. You know, (inaudible at 0:42:21.8) another child.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I imagine that you were just the child who just (inaudible at 0:42:35.6) around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I wonder what I got from my father. Because he was always caring. So I guess I would have even been worse off if I didn't get something good from my father. He made me feel important. He had me help him chop wood or shellac something. Or he'd always give me a nickel, you know, when he was coming home from work. I guess you need to be talked to a lot. I don't know. These were actions. He used actions to show that he cared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to know now. I mean we could try. We could talk about your mom and we could try and reconstruct it. You know, what happened. But I think that..</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's unnecessary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no, I don't think it's, but I think that what's evident now is that you do seem to have; you get the feeling you've talked to them before. The feeling of being really unloved. And that in your life that feeling (inaudible at 0:43:45.8). Usually it's triggered in situations where people are being, you know, (inaudible at 0:43:47.3) to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so those situations become really painful. You know, instead of like Todd and the plumber and the neighbors being upsetting, it becomes really painful. 0:44:04.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Something more than it really is in reality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It becomes like deeply painful which I mean it doesn't have to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe it isn't just about the neighbor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So how do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) (inaudible at 0:44:29.0) Are we out of time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, we have two minutes left. (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Luckily we're out of time. In two minutes you'll tell me. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think, I mean that is what is it? The six million dollar question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Well just give me two cents worth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that knowing this first of all. Being really familiar with the feeling and understanding this is the old feeling that is triggered in me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just knowing when it comes up that, "Hey, this is not the reaction to this situation. It's the reaction to the past."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. It's not only in reaction to the situation. And that this feeling isn't always valid. Because what happens is I think that you feel this and so then you feel like everyone hates you or everyone is rejecting you. And that's what's not necessarily true, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know Todd was critical of you but he wasn't necessarily rejecting you. Maybe you were too sensitive, maybe who knows.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that, at least knowing this I think that's, knowing that any moment that this reaction is old and is not just about the present can I think have a little bit of take control of (inaudible at 0:45:43.5) to get a sense of prospective.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say, "Ok, when I feel like this I feel everyone hates me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: But don't give too much credit to this feeling because this doesn't really apply to the present situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. Like maybe everyone isn't against me as much as I think they are. Because you know that you sort of bring bias into the situation. I mean actually I, it doesn't sound like that might make that much difference but I think it can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I remember to remember. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm, well that's the thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Well, now we do need to..(chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just want to write all this down in my book here. 0:46:25.0</p>

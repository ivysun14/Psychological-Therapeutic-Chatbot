<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Long time, no see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (sigh), (chuckle), I'm sorry. I feel really bad for being so late. (Sigh), (sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stuff happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh), (pause), (sigh), still catching my breath, (chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, go ahead, catch it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm terribly out of shape. I don't (ph) have anything to feel embarrassed about. (Sigh), (pause), let's see. The Friday that I went home from work sick and skipped our appointment was also when they announced layoffs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were cutting 15 percent of the workforce.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yikes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (chuckles). [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a couple of administrative things, but I can do those now or we can do them—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, let's go ahead and get those out of the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let's see, the first thing is I think they won't charge you for being out when you were sick. I guess it does seem reasonable to charge you for last week, because usually I require 48 hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We haven't been over that at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was 24 hours but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, (pause), let's see, tell you what, I mean in that case, I can charge you for the first one and not the second one, and now you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I know, have it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing, (pause), a little more significant—so I am getting off of Blue Cross as of January 1.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which (pause), might have two applications for you because your plan [picked up that] network.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess the two things there are one—three things. One they'll send the check to you again. [00:02:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two, you may have a deductible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't apply with, (pause), someone in network—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As I have been. And three, I'm going to balance the bills, which is the main reason I'm getting out of network. But for you with the recording, (pause), it should be like 25 bucks a visit, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's probably the most significant [inaudible at 00:02:35], but I just wanted to tell you that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I forgot, [off the bat] (ph) if I have been telling people [maybe in the last week or something] (ph), but that's all the stuff I have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can talk about any of that or go back to the layoffs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:03:00] record.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, the week after that was really terrible because everyone was nervous, but my job is safe. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One person from my group was affected, which kind of sucks for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How big is your group?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have 50 people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, (pause), so it's not like a group of four.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, my subgroup of five, we were all safe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, (pause), but it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were actually four from the group of 50, but only one who I know. The other three, I've never even heard their names before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you, (pause), right, but it affected everybody's morale.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it affected everybody's morale.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're reorganizing and the vice president of our division of the company left. And it's unclear whether she was fired or chose to leave or where it was going or which pressure (ph) was used to resign—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not clear, so yeah, that sucked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that mean, (pause), everything's sort of up in the air as far as who works on what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No because this project we have to get done and we just can't afford rearranging anything—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This close to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, to the end.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Take out, but there will be a rearrangement. The second we send our data to the foundry for production, everything's going to be turned on its head. (Sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's that to look forward to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause), oh, there was a concert that night that I went home sick that I was really looking forward to. But I just felt like crap and didn't go, and then I felt worse that I missed it, but I was just, (pause), pretty bad.</p>

<p>(Pause), yeah, and then visiting Dave's parents last weekend, that was, (pause), minorly irritating and trying, but not traumatic, as usual. [00:05:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're on the shore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't heard from them, so I'm starting to worry. I assume they've just lost power and have no way of contacting us, but (pause), it is a little worrying. (Pause), yeah, Dave's mother, she hoards stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it used to be when we would go visit we would stay at their vacation house on the shore, instead of at their main house, which is, I don't know, about an hour from the coast. Because their main house is just so full of crap that they've gotten rid of all of the beds in the house to make room for the crap, and there's nowhere for me and Dave to sleep. [00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really is—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it's [inaudible at 00:06:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's pathological—so we used to go to the beach house—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which at least had some room, but they've discovered, to no one's surprise, that their main house has black mold growing in it, which go figure. If you never clean because there's too much shit and (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they've been living in the beach house, which has now accumulated shit and the beach house is a one bedroom apartment. And there's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's not enough room for five (ph) adults and (ph) shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just, (sigh), (pause), and (pause), I was, in theory, telecommuting on Friday, but I was in—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was going to take the day off, but with this deadline, I just couldn't afford it. (Pause), and there was nowhere to put my laptop, because there were no clean tables.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just, (pause), it's incredibly stressful, but not because anyone is being a terrible person. It's just the environment is so—[00:07:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad, so yeah. Let's see, what else new is happening? I have a date tomorrow night. We'll see how that goes. (Pause), a friend had a party this weekend,—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I was really excited about and then work crashed down on me. And I didn't have time to think about it or plan for it or anything, and now I'm realizing that I have two days to figure out what I'm doing for food and drink.</p>

<p>(Pause), (laugh), I'm starting to stress and my choir's big, like two hour Russian choral concert is a week from Saturday, and (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:07:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, as was demonstrated, much to my chagrin, yesterday at my rehearsal, I can't hit any of my high notes and it was very embarrassing. The choir director kept singling me out for—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You need to fix your pitch. You need to fix your pitch. You need to fix your pitch again. I mean our choir director's really nice and he's not mean about it, but (pause), it was still really embarrassing. (Pause), (clears throat), (pause), so those are the highlights of what's been on my mind the last two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckle), (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot. (Pause), what else comes to mind at the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), it's a little embarrassing. I kind of don't want to talk about, but it has been bugging me. (Pause), so there's, (pause), this pattern, (pause), in kind of, my sexual fantasies, where I often find myself fantasizing about, well, people who would be completely inappropriate to have an actual relationship with, but who are also, (pause), significantly older than me, and in kind of positions of authority and/or mentorship with respect to me. [00:09:38]</p>

<p>And it's a little bit distressing when I think about it. It's just [inaudible at 00:09:47] Freudian or something, are usually the genders are flipped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean the genders are flipped?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well when people talk about like—your Freudians sexual obsessions, they're usually talking about obsessions men have towards women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least in the colloquial sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what the technical—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The Freudian kind of [inaudible at 00:10:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All sorts of ways actually, (pause), do you, (pause), do you want to talk about the who and what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come? That's not meant to twist your arm. It's just meant to inquire as to why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm really, really embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. (Pause), do you know what makes it so embarrassing for you? [00:11:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), well, (pause), part of it is that most of the individuals in question are not what the average person would describe as attractive. So there's that and then there's, (pause), there's a couple of mentor figures who I see socially that I don't know from work or from school, who are part of my network, either through alumni association or through my church. </p>

<p>And so (sigh), (pause), I don't know. It doesn't—it's completely irrational that they—I have this fear that if I name names and say them out loud then someone might figure it out. And then everyone who knows both of us, (pause), would know about my, (pause)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you say it to me, somehow it's gotten out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's outside of my head and now—[00:12:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, now they could know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause), (sigh), (pause), which I mean, it's not about you or my trust in your ability to maintain confidentiality—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or anything like that, it's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I'm not hearing it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you sound really embarrassed and also (pause), terrified about it. (Pause), and I guess mostly it's a fear of being horribly shamed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), I mean, and this has been something that's been bothering me for, (chuckle), a very long time now, but (pause). So I ran into one of these people yesterday in dress rehearsal for this Russian choral thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have it on my mind today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), and Dave actually said something about it when we got home. He was like, I noticed you were avoiding so and so at practice. Is it because of that weird thing his wife said to you four years ago? I was like, okay it's obvious that I'm avoiding talking to him because of that. [00:13:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, so that made you quite self-conscious?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause), in terms of the what, are there also things that make that, (pause), do you know what makes that, (pause), difficult to talk about? By what I mean like what the fantasies involve the two of you doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), (sigh), (pause), fantasy's mostly involve, (pause), this is so embarrassing. (Pause), we're working on a project together where I'm seen as an equal and having that lead to a sexual relationship. [00:14:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause), okay, the way you put it before made me think this is mostly with men, but is it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, largely because of the dearth of women or—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that whole—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Generational rooming in my field, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (Pause), so if that were not the case it might be women as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know. There might be a weird gender component to it or it might just be you have a net effect of leaky pipeline and lack of representation. I'm not sure actually, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause), it feels weird and Freudian to you? [00:15:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't know if this helps, and it certainly is predictable from someone like me, but (pause), some of it's relatively common and tends to, (pause), not in exactly the same form, but in the fantasy about the quasi parental figure, and tends to be very difficult (ph) and embarrassing for people to talk about.</p>

<p>And I'm not surprised, especially when it's coming from me, but also true [words were] (ph), (pause), are there things that are coming to mind about it at the moment that you can say? [00:17:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), I'm drawing a blank.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I'm willing to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't think of anything more to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Are there, (pause), I'm going to keep asking questions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And feel free not to answer them or to say you've had enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles), okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Clears throat).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are, (pause), are there other similar characteristics that these folks share? I mean, (pause), men, mentor figures, positions of authority, people with whom you could work on the project, not necessarily conventionally attractive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're all equally (ph) smart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause), in particular ways or just in one or another? [00:18:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), no just generally really, really smart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course that can also be said about everyone I've dated, also (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what's appealing about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), people who aren't at least as smart as I am are boring to talk to and spend time with, (chuckles), a little arrogant but (pause). [00:19:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause), I guess we're sort of circling around this but are they reminiscent of your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), (sigh), (pause), no, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if I tried I could force the similarity or comparison, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean are a lot of the characteristics are similar in what you're describing but—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's some people that doesn't have like have that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:20:06] Freud, but (pause), that doesn't feel like they're similar?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (pause). I mean when I think—if I had to just pick a handful of just personality characteristics that describe my dad, I would describe him as, (pause), uncompromising and (pause), thoughtless, and cold, which is not—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It may be the uncompromising part would apply, (pause), but not the thoughtless or the cold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or harsh, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's a quiet? Is it like, (pause), working together leads to, (pause), or is the fantasy mostly focused on the sex, on like the relationship that develops, on the scandal that follows, or is it on things about intimacy, of being together, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), mostly on sex, maybe a little bit on the relationship and intimacy. (Pause), not so much on scandal, or consequences, or other people finding out, or anything along those lines. [00:21:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess also it brings up it seems like it's pretty intense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes you pretty uncomfortable here on this slope (ph). (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean with one of them in particular, the one who attends my church, his wife is, (pause), bizarrely possessive and territorial around him or around, (pause), all of the women between the ages of about 25 and 50, at our church. I don't know what's going on between them or with their marriage, but yeah. (Pause). [00:22:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have thoughts as to what might be going on between them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That might be kind of disconcerting, even if you know, that actually has nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (Pause), about a year and a half ago I had this project for a class I was taking that was—and he really heard, and he—in his field of expertise, like the sub-field he'd spent the last ten years working on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you mentioned him a while ago when you were in—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: School and having been able to talk to him about your school work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so we just met for coffee after church one Sunday, for him to go over my notes</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like go through a paper that I didn't understand would mean, and I mean it was—I mean fantasies aside, it was completely on the up and up. But—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:23:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She showed up to pick him up towards the end of our scheduled time and she was just really—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you may have even mentioned this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you like—were you in their car or something? Am I vaguely remembering that? She was weird—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she was weird about the whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause), well we can stop for now, but we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I'll endeavor to be on time. It's in my outlook calendar that I have to be leaving by 4:10, and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's hard to—</p>

<p>CLIENT: People just don't respect that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good night.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And thank you very much -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not a problem ma'am -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For participating today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever, whatever you need done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you were saying he's been having troubling getting access to your medications and there's a lot of things -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the system that need improvement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and, and like and, and, and the sillies, you know I can like understand like certain drug walls being the way they are especially with like things like the opiates and some of the barbiturates are out there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And all like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And but, and um, like some medicines I can't take with this medicine because I get bad reactions.  I have very bad reactions -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With certain medications like you know, I've, you, you would, I told you about some and, and doctors and stuff like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're serious reactions too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There serious reactions, now um, now and we had our talk about with, with the Marinol and dronabinol because I, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, pain exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] stuff like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Couldn't get approval for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And couldn't get approval -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For it and, and it's like you know and, and when I did, and when I, when I am prescribed it, it costs as much as I get from Social Security a month to get the medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and it's like you know I tried all the um, for the, all the chronic medicines for like when I was younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know before it got I mean before it got like got to the point now; because like in the morning I have like, I have a half hour routine just to warm up just so I can, can get dressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You now what I mean and it's like um, any where from the sacral, like actually it's down in the knees now.  Like I would have problems with my ankles when I was a kid -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gosh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had bad legs -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now it's down the knees all the way up to the sacral area, iliac regions where, where the sciatica nerve goes and all -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All from there and it's like all the way up to like, to like up about here on the back -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On the back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when you're in pain that affects your attention and concentration even more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we've always been trying to get that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's been affecting my moods, it's making me pissy, oh man my boyfriend's going to throw bricks at me.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's rough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's to the point where it cost so much for you to get this medicine out you have no choice but to break the law and take it the way you're not supposed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, boy and that's not good -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's not good -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We don't want that to happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I don't let that happen to often because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's just not good looking.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's like you know, and it's weird it's like you can make it man made but then the cost is a $1000, $1400 a month for the prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are kidding me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No $1000, $1100, $1400 a month -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Holy Toledo.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At Rite Aide.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And if you take it in increments you can buy it at $300 increments at a time.  I don't have that.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean, it's cheaper to go and hit up the neighborhood thug on the corner for a dime bag and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Smoke it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Smoke it and smoking's bad for you so it's like the systems causing you to do wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not a good situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that's the corruption of the system.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not at all, you're right, you're absolutely right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean all because someone needs to make money off of it or tax it or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean, it's, it's, it, it, it hurts, literally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I did some more research in terms of the chronic pain situation.  There's like going at it a totally 180 degree opposite way.  With naltrexone, have you ever heard of naltrexone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's actually something that is used to help people maintain abstinence from alcohol.  But, it works at the same opiate receptors that opiates do.  But it actually seems to somehow dial down the bodies tendency to respond to pain and it's a, it's usually at pretty small doses too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so that's a whole different way of going about the problem if your plan will cover it we can, we can look at it, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I might just do it because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the only other benefit about the um, that the Marinol plan -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can eat good.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because look, when, when I'm in pain I don't eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin kind of takes away your appetite too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to, it takes away my appetite -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then when, when I start going through these withdrawals from not getting my medicines in time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like, it's like it, I feel like I am a legal drug addict.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's the problem with the short acting stimulants, you get more irritable on those -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know we're just trying to find the right dose of Wellbutrin to help with the attention and concentration and not add to the irritability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's uh, I, I come to realize you know, with my own reading up and my own self, you know self experimentation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've done and you've done a lot of research on your own, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had to because man, I got, I like knowing what I'm getting in to; because when I got in the Marines they taught me counter intelligence.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's like I'm, I, I read everything about the medicines.  I know what receptors they stimulate, everything.  I mean I might not know the technical terms because I don't have 4 years to 10 years of college behind it but I have my research and computer about it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good you have your computer at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Look in to the low dose -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Naltrexone, I have some information for you too -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I'm going to write is the daily dose, but the smallest pill that's available in the US is 10 times what you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what they recommend is dissolving it and it will tell you exactly how to do it and, and uh, you know certain number of milliliters of water.  Strain it up and sipping a certain amount.  Usually at bedtime everyday -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At bedtime that would be even great -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because would it help you sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's right because what my hardest thing is and I keep my wife up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then again my wife keeps me up with, with that snoring -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see if I, it's like to the point where trazodone is not working for me to sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] up I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, because you prescribed trazodone -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You prescribed temazepam, I can not sleep my insomnia is driving me crazy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean even, even and, and even when I break the law and smoke pot, I can't even sleep on that either and people sleep on that, and when, when I want to take the Apresoline that's doesn't even help me sleep for nothing, it, it, it does calm my, my rage feelings and my, my anxiety -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like and it's weird -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because when I get anxious, it's not the anxious where, where it incapacitates you.  It sends me off in a rage -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like what is this shit, you know what I mean I just, like yeah go through it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been through some turmoil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, and uh, I'm just, I'm just glad I got people around me that understand, that I don't mean to be snappy it's just I go through like, and it's not like, you know and it's like all my life I've been told to suck it up but how long do I have to keep sucking it up.  I've been sucking it up my whole life, like I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Was born in pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know all the way down to when they had to fix my leg when I was all the way up, man I, I used to have to have to go down to that um, foot doctor down on [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened to your leg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was born with club feet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they, they had to um, [INAUDIBLE] infant means the bones are small enough they put them in casts -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I remember that they used to do that now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I was also born with a genetic um, uh, disease that gives you arthritis.  I forget the name of it is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How come I never knew this about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not in your files; it's in my other files.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you find that reference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I just got to find it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, I always tell the doctor, I, I tell every doctor, like every physician that I go to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm looking back at the evaluation we did -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You told me about shortness of the breath -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You told me about feeling panicky, trouble with attention and concentration, seasonal allergies.  You didn't mention the arthritis thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The reason why I didn't because I did think that had anything to do with the bipolar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And of course we've been talking about um, uh, chronic pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pain yeah, it's chronic pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we just haven't talked about the source of it quite as much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But there's days where I don't feel the pain in the, in the arthritic areas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean because it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of waxes and wanes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah just like the phases of the moon and the rainy days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that's always when they hit the worst.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The rainy days and it's weird because if I warm up I work out and stuff like that it leaves it alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's the, if, if it's uh, because of my joints are swelling and stuff like that and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lubricated from that and so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me see if I can find the name of it here on line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I know it's chronic um, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they call it like, um, juvenile arthritis or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah that's, it's juvenile arthritis but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They said it's genetic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, yeah like not to, yeah something like that or it could be genetic, that's what they said.  But this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you know what I was, I'm wondering if they were thinking of um, you know the fact that some of the auto immune disorders like rheumatoid and stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Juvenile rheumatoid -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis that's ba, that's what they say the 1 with the R.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I mean it's a juvenile arthritis you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does anybody else in your family have that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh people on my dads side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My moms sides the diabetes, my dads sides diabetes, my side, my moms sides the um, yeah it's the diabetes and all the cancers.  My dad's side is diabetes, cancer, and arthritis stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your family has a tough situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Must be that European -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing that we can't deal with, we can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Must be that European inbreeding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, well a lot -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of fighting that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those guys got around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right so let's see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to look at juvenile, are you in pain right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, uh a little bit, like with the last 2 rainy days we had -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it was tough, really tough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now I got a good reference on that.  Let's take a look -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when I was a kid I had uh, an acute, acute version of this leg where it could like by the time, they said by the time I age I would have problems with it.  I don't have it bad -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> God bless your heart, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have it bad because, I don't have it bad like I think the pain it's, it drives you nuts and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's been really got to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes you irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And like you say you've got the mood situation, you have the um, attention deficient problem -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it just doesn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So many things going on and we have to try to find a balance of 1 thing that doesn't aggravate the other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what we're trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, we're going to keep after it to that is for sure.  Now um, during the course of a typical day do you take Motrin, do you take Tylenol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I drink a lot of water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever take medication for pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no not really; because it don't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It don't ever work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Never works -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It might stop swelling but the pain don't go away.  Like if I get swollen knees -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or swollen ankles, I mean if I take an ibuprofen that were, I can't take aspirin or, or acetaminophen -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it, it really don't do nothing and if I take it in high doses it's not yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can damage your liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like so if I take um, you know so what normally would work when, like you know 2 acetaminophen for somebody -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would have to take 6.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean just to feel, just to get it to you know, you know acutely do it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm afraid to take opiates because half my family -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's how they started up heroin addicts; they started out taking Percocet or something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tramadol or something like that eating them to get through it and then next them you know they're doing Oxy's and then next thing you know they're snorting and doing heroin and you know I don't want to end up like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the naltrexone is the polar opposite but interestingly it helps the same pain receptors kick in for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's really a different kind of an approach and I don't think you're going to get, given trouble about filling that prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean if anything most people think that's a good thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think the reason why the whole maro problem is because the laws and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All that bull crap man, just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And someone's charging that just because they can get away with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Away with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think it's disgusting man.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is, is it very, very much of a bummer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is a [INAUDIBLE] bummer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have feet swelling too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Feet swelling and, and my hands swell too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like all along here.  See that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes I do.  Numbness and tingling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any rashes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no rashes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No rashes, right I just saw you scratching.  Are you itchy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Scratching, yeah, that's just from dry skin because sometimes I'm around cement and stuff and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It get's in your skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know there's like, it's all from cement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I work with cement from time to time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that's what I know how to do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever get really bad itch attacks?  Like would almost keep you up all night and that kind of stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes and right around here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And sometimes in the boy parts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But and it's not like and it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No fungus or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So nothing there, yeah, jock itch or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no jock itch I had to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about your ears any hearing problems or ringing in your ears?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Deafness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah I have that.  That's why I [INAUDIBLE] so I'm making sure I'm, I pronunciating right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever take ciprofloxacin, Cipro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ciprofloxacin?  Yeah I took Cipro before when I was a kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That agrees with you okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Azithromycin, azithromycin always works for me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That always works for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you even put me on that prescription of that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That worked, that even took down swelling sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need it again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No you gave me enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I actually had to stop taking it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it starts hurting my stomach sometimes taking it.  Like especially -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a long period of time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what's weird about all these pills.  I guess I take too much, it hurts my stomach more than what I did before I had the problem -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Started taking them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could come down to you know, if it turns out you do have some chronic lingering infection aggravating that arthritis -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially with some of the symptoms you're describing.  You might be able to do couple of months on Zithromax, couple months on ciprofloxacin -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if I'm on all these antibiotics.  Won't that just like do all the weak germs and all the germs that can combat, next thing you know they're getting stronger in my system and end up killing me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably not that.  But you do have an excellent point that it can kill off the good bacteria.  People will sometimes go ahead and take probiotics, like an acidophilus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where, where you eat -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yogurt yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You eat that yogurt [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah Activia yogurt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've been eating that lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and that's good, excellent.  Keep that up, very good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I eat, because I like cheeses and stuff like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And probiotic cheeses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not lactose intolerant that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I am but it ain't to the point where it bothers me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, like yeah I've got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got a lot on your plate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It loosens my, it loosens the stool a little bit -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it doesn't make it to where I can't hold it in.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you didn't get really bad diarrhea on the Zithromax or the Cipro before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Zithromy, the Zithro, azithromycin I didn't, the, the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Cipro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Cipro -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it did not agree with me.  I even think I got a rash with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, that's interesting.  Really bad rash or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no just like a flaky rash -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where I sweat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like right under here, behind the knees -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Around by the feet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Behind the ears, like right around in here, I mean and blotchy skin.  Like almost like hives but not that bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, did the blotches have a pattern to them.  Like circles or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like um, huh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Draw it for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of like, kind of like camouflage.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just picture the white spots -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the colors -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were they round, like a bull's eye -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Here you go I'll make a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of, oh I can't, kind of like blotchy like this.  See how you see the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Blotches of red -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes I do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you see little points -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of like white in it.  Like that all through it like, like I can make it.  Yeah something like that, see how that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Goes like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I sure do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I show you like with the skin like that.  With the ear when I irritate a little bit -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everytime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And at what point in your treatment does that tend to happen.  Like after a few weeks or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Couple of days after taking -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Couple of days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah like 3 or 4 days after taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did it ever start to go away after that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, just kind of stayed there really irritated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See that's why I finished it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'm one of those guys I will tough out hives and stuff like that as long as my throat don't swell up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because sometimes suffering through hives, they have biotic, to have the antibiotic work sometimes is worth it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'd rather, I'd rather have blotchy skin than be down and out in the bed for like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a good point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Days on end.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean as long as it don't kill me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have 3 kids to worry about.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a wife.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know I hear you.  I'm just going to write down after a few days about the blotchy skin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I get blotchy skin when I take, have a lot of folic acid stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ahh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, one time I took some niacinamide because I had a deficiency in that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From a blood test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That gave me the blotchy skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, did you ever take magnesium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Magnesium does it too.  Magnesium, folic acid, and that give me the blotchy skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, let me just tell you about something and we can keep this in the back of our mind and see if at some point we want to take it on.  There is a chance that you got infected as a child -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It aggravated the arthritis and a lot of the other stuff going on and then it never went away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's been living in your system all this time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's possible that the response that you got to the Cipro was because it started killing off the bacteria and the toxins are coming out, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The things we were just talking about.  That you were deficient in and then you took them and actually you had that reaction to.  All of those things support your immune system fighting infection.  What if the infection was starting to get killed off but there's so much of it.  It's giving off this toxic junk and so when you take things to support your immune system you actually feel worse for a while -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you could consider at some point -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want to try you know riding it out for a couple, few months that's called a Herxheimer reaction.  When in the old days when they used to treat people with syphilis -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they'd had it for a long time.  They would feel worse before they got better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They see the exact same thing with Lyme disease -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With , with bartonella, with a lot of the chronic infections.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bartonella, bartonella is that infatigo?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can aggravate infatigo, yes.  Usually [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had that a lot as a kid.  I even had that all the way up until I was like [AGE] I was getting it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That suggests to me that you were immuno compromised, you had a long standing infection so you're more susceptible to other things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because look even until today.  Like you know, you know when you have fecal matter in your toilet?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mine always has a green hue to it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your kidding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All my life my snot had a green hue to it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even sometimes my urine has a green hue to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Green?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Green, not yellow, greenish.  Like um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be billirubin, you know that's just not clearing your liver properly or something.  Let me see about green urine.  Now that's unusual.  Now you're saying green not red, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not red -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because a reddish -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I had red re, I had red urine before when I got hit in the kidneys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's understandable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean.  But and it's nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't get it that it comes and goes; because like malaria can do that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No and I um had shots for malaria when I was in the Marine Corp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think that got it?  Do you think that took care of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, I hope so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they give it to you for preventive or did they give it to you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Preventive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they thought you had -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Preventive, preventive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, you've had a lot of exposure to things.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah man.  [INAUDIBLE] I was in foreign countries and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which ones?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was all every, practically every South American country that we're in cahoots with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you go to the Middle East at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no I was, I never got a chance to go uh, over in the Eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What other shots did they give you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Did they give you a lot of shots or just mostly the malaria shots?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, man they gave me so much shots I thought I was a pin cushion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pin cushion or one of, I, I , I or a balloon; because you know how they'd stick, it was all air pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, oh I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I seen some dude move, when I was in the Marine Corp move from that when he, when he got scared.  It cut his skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he moved.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My gosh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he got scared when it went and it cut his skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me these years again, you got, you were there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From '95 to '99, '95 to '99 yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From I finished boot camp then, uh, [DATE] and I was discharged July, uh, June or July [DATE], yeah [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My enlistment date is actually in '94 though, but and they started giving me some shots.  Whenever I went to these uh, Reserve meetings, that was when I was a pulley and then, being I was going they figured they get some of my shots done and over with and these people are coming back from wherever they were coming from when I was there; because they used to do humanitarian stuff.  Well, because remember when I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That stuff was going on during the Clinton era.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what were people coming back saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They were coming back with stuff and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They were saying they were sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sick.  But see all of them where the first Gulf War veterans.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they were sick all the time anyway.  The Gulf War sickness half my, half my reserve unit at the time had that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you know that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before I went on active duty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you know they got contaminated vaccines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I think I had, I think for some reason.  I think I got pneumonia during boot camp due to a bad contaminated vaccine.  I've been having problem my, with my lungs ever since.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay with and I'm going to document what you're telling me and keep every record of anytime you've ever reported anything about that.  We do have a little bit of a precedent in terms of the Vietnam vets were exposed to Agent Orange, for a long time the military.  There's no way that didn't do anything.  Now they actually are giving benefits and treatment to people who were exposed.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hopefully there will come a time where they'll be able to trace and figure out what was [PATIENT NAME] exposed to.  Is it something treatable you know, we're going to treat people who have it and I'm hoping that they will.  At this point, you and I can just keep in mind there are some generic antibiotics that you can at least tolerate.  They're not perfectly comfortable but some of which you may have been seen.  Could have been signs that it started to get killed off and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you need to take them there's a new approach with people who have the kind of condition we're talking about -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes what we do is take the antibiotics at a lower dose.  You know you probably took the Cipro twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people take it once a day.  That can lower the amount of bacteria to a more comfortable level in their system and what we try to do is let their own immune system kick in and try to also keep it at bay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's a whole different way of looking at it.  It's long term treatment with antibiotics.  The, the bug is already resistant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right you could take this for 6 months and it might not kill off the bug; because it's resistant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if it's more comfortable for you to take a lower dose.  It can have some anti-inflammatory effect it can help lower it.  It's just like treating HIV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Look at the people with HIV -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They take their medications faithfully -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know one guy 20 years, he's healthier than I am.  You know because it keeps it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At bay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At bay enough that his own immune system is working for him too -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it could be an approach that we could consider and if you're more comfortable with, there's a group of Lyme literate medical doctors they understand chronic infections better, you know you could have someone like that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sort of managing it or I could work along with that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would this be found in blood?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's very hard to detect actually.  It, there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How about muscle tissue.  I wouldn't mind someone taking a quarter size chunk out of something to find it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The problem is a lot of insurances don't cover it and the problem -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't want to know, they don't want to know because they don't want to pay for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't want to pay for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's not a good situation at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See that's disgusting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's some urine tests that can pick up if there are DNA traces of you ever having had an infection with Lyme and some other things in your urine.  They may not be 100% either.  They're a little more reliable but it's hard to get anybody to pay for them.  So some of those tests may not be so expensive though, I think there's 1 that might be $150 couple of 100 bucks.  You send it to a place in California.  So if you know, again if, if it ever seems like we need to know exactly or whatever.  But since you're allergic or have had such difficulty with certain antibiotics at least we know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think pretty much all of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only ones I can take, the only 1 I can take, where I can function where it doesn't put me down or make me sick is azithromycin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the erythromycin, erythromycin not azithromycin, erythromycin not the one you take the 5 pills -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or 2 at once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With your infatigo way back when, erythromycin treats that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah they give -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They used to pump me full of that and to switch it up they used to give me something else to I didn't get immune to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my doctor from birth -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Told my mom I have one of those immune, not immune systems.  I have one of those systems in my body where if you give me a chemical long enough my body will build up a tolerance to it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To the point where it's useless for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow and no doctor could figure that out, that's amazing.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, this is coming from a doctor that was um, at [DEIDENTIFIED], down [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED] or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for, good for him, I mean I think he was ahead of his time.  You know anticipating you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Might need to be on something for a while but it wouldn't it would stop being effective.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you ever hear of [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], down there [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was one of his colleagues.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That the pediatrician that he talked to because, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was in cahoots with him down there on [DEIDENTIFIED] I think it is, or [DEIDENTIFIED] whatever it is down there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take the, I used to have, mom used to take the L down there and I mean because I had a lot of health problems as a kid, starting with the legs; because I was, I was supposed to be born [DATE], or [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was born [DATE].  I was a premie -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And to look at you, you look so healthy.  I mean the thing is nobody would know how much you're suffering.  But, I believe you, I mean I know you are and you have, you've been exposed to a lot of things and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When, when I get I get up you can hear, like my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, hear it cracking, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just moving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean like, like when I just move my head normally, I hear all kinds of grinding and popping.  When I, when I go like this, I feel, I feel like as, as if metal against metal.  You know how it vibrates?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My whole body vibrates when I just do normal stuff.  If I do it fast it's not that bad.  But when I if I do it slow like this movement -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like, it's like I get so much friction inside my body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And if I do it in a certain way it sends like that chilling.  Like as if someone, you know how you get that zap in your tooth -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a nerve pain, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like a nerve pain, picture that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everywhere else on your body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there's days when it's, when it's snowing or raining or it's just damp out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My whole body feels like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have tried Neurontin right, and as I recall it did sit that well with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now a lot of these things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you've tried them -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They either -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they didn't sit well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Make me lethargic, they make me sick -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They make, you know what I mean it's like I can't eat.  It's like if for half these medicines you'd have to put me in a hospital and put me on a feeding tube.  Nothing stays down, I get the runs, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why with the low does naltrexone you may like the fact that you know, you're getting a dose.  You dilute it and actually at a lower dose it's supposed to help more with the pain.  So, maybe let's tackle that this time.  See how that sits with your whole regimen.  Um see if we can improve your attention, concentration and you know, lessen irritability by treating some of the physical symptoms to help you; because we've got the Wellbutrin dose of the, the dose that gives you the most benefit with the least drawbacks.  Um and some of the other categories aren't a good choice for you.  But, uh, this may -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> These may help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's fine.  All these stuff that stops the pain, why you, why you have the pain, you be, you know what I mean it, these medicines react with your body so much where it depletes self, your, your water.  You know what I mean it depletes you of your and, and it's and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need to stay well hydrated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well hydrated and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you work outdoors so definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when you are on antibiotics you have to wear a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to wear -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really strong sunscreen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> FDA approved naltrexone in a low dose can boost the immune system helping those with auto immune diseases which they had thought that your juvenile arthritis might be and they have the HIV AIDS listed.  So we're looking at un chronic infection too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that is definitely -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's 1 things that's been proven, I don't have any then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to print that for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have any of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those chronic infections?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The um, I don't have AIDS or HIV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have definitely been checked for that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that is a blessing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got some very [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, I'm so lucky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's not the cause of your immuno compromise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then again I'm so lucky I have put my sell in the position to get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you've been careful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everything that you could control you did.  There was somethings you were not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Given control over like how many vaccines you got when and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't have a say in that.  But, uh, the things that you could control you did the right things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The other -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Naltrexone helps fight kleptomania.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah it's interesting data here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wonder if it will stop masturbation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know actually.  You might feel a little less aroused.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because [INAUDIBLE] think kleptomania.  They're all compulsions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean, like and, and masturbation would be a com, compulsion.  Um, scratching com -  But you see the thing is you hit one compulsion you take, sometimes it'll affect all the good compulsions you have like working out, cleaning your house.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's maybe why you like the fact this is at a relatively lower dose too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it treats opioid dependence -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see I'm not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know it's a, it would help protect against -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Against it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wanting to use them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh all right -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could really appeal to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'm afraid of them man, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's an anti-opiate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if someone with opiates would take that it would, it, it would counter -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they just wouldn't get an effect from the opiates.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there would be no point in doing it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's almost like the [INAUDIBLE] to, to the people that are taking the, to get off of OxyContin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly and it helps some people with alcohol too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Man you should give this to my brother [NAME OTHER].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well I wouldn't tell anybody if you decided to loan him some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no I wouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Actually there is a 25 mg.  Let's, let's go with the smallest because you're going to want to be diluted it probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Although if the 25 sits okay with you, you can take that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Try the lowest dose first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the lowest, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll do that and I printed out -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We've got to do something about the alprazolam man; because I got, everytime I start running out, I go through withdrawals from that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now was the alprazolam.  I remember we tried to look at what was the least expensive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and, and that was it, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was it right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah that was it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, what is the problem, is it that you need more than you've been getting so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking extra?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's almost like I'm getting addicted to it.  Like I'll be running out like, instead before I used to run out like maybe 1 or 2 days before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now I'm running out almost a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before it and this, and like you know and sometimes I don't take the full doses at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean; because I don't want that.  I don't want to flood my system too much with the stuff; because all these medicines I'm taking are bad for your innards.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the good thing about alprazolam is it's in and out of your system pretty quick.  But that could also be working against you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did we ever compare um, lorazepam, Ativan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't take that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, you've tried a bunch of these too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm, I'm addicted to Ativan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we don't want that to happen and the interesting thing is you know, most people have an addiction problem with the Xanax.  But you've been working with that for a pretty long time and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been monitoring it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been using it to control panic symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Panic and rage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Panic and rage, it mellows me out to the point where I can collect my thoughts and, and be the Christian man I want to be.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if I wrote for it 5 times a day instead of 4 times a day you could still afford the prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then let's do that, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So at least you'll have that option and not have to uh, have the added worry about "oh my gosh I'm going to run out."  So, so let see for 5 times a day that could be every 4 hours, all right.  I think that's what we need to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then what happens if that doesn't work?  Then we, then, then we, then we start weaning me off and trying something new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Vallum, have you tried Valium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't take Valium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you've had most of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, all these, all, all, all of them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've tried a lot of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All the Benzodiazepine I mean after a while they build up in my system and they become useless.  They work a little, don't get me wrong.  [INAUDIBLE] worked but it's not working the way it used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I need more of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we're, I'm going to go out on a limb now, barbiturates?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I won't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I won't even touch them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Phenobarbital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I won't even touch them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever tried them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> People in my family [INAUDIBLE] and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not a good situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not a good situation and they end up getting the adverse reactions and, and I come along the line has the adverse reactions a lot of this and they end up over taking them.  Dying in their sleep or committing suicide, I don't even want to try it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we're not going to even go there, you're absolutely, you're gut instinct on that is right.  Now, I will say this though.  With the Revia the low dose naltrexone.  That may answer some of these needs too.  You may find you need less Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because man it's just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You may find your prescription is way more than you need at that point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't want to be one of those guys I see in my neighborhood going to the corner because they don't got a Xanax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean they're out there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your situation is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm afraid, I'm afraid -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're truly using it for panic and that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to hide my Xanax in my house for when relatives of mine come over -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're right.  Don't let them get near it, don't even tell them you have it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have younger relatives that, that, that you know got, fell in to that scene.  The drug scene and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Were taking them for fun and the next thing you know half my medicine cabinet is gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been on the same dose for years, at this point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah this is, this is my second -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was treating a panic but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or third year on these -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now it's like getting bad.  Like it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, and the problem is your physical symptoms are worst too, so that's an extra source of stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and like my hips hurt the most lately, you know what I mean my hips and my, my hips and my knees.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We've got to get you some relief.  Let's give the naltrexone a try and if that isn't giving enough relief let's get some serious stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What are the side effects or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Alternating and antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What are the side effects of this do you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There can be some sedation that's why people, I've got it up here but that's why people usually take it at night and remember it's a low dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, at night's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If 5 mg is too much cut it in half, if that's too much melt it, you know take uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and you think that will help the arthritis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wait until you see what's on line.  People with MS, people with Lou Gehrig's, people with arthritis, all kinds of chronic pain syndromes.  Fibromyalgia it's helping them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, and there's scientific studies supporting it too and it's a complete surprise to everybody that at a dose -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That low it's making the receptors kick in where before people might have had to take big doses of opioids -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know and still not get relief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, because yeah, a, a, a friend of mine from church and I told him I was, when I was talking to him about my thing and he, he had, he has HIV, he, he was, he wasn't born with it but um, his kid was born with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With what?  The HIV?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> HIV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he gave it to his wife -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And his wife, yeah so him and his wife and his kid have it.  But they've been living with, living good for year and he never -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He got it, he got it in the '80s, he's an older gentleman.  He caught it in the 80s through a blood transfusion from an operation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The poor man.  A lot of people did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh what a disaster.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I told him I was getting prescribed Marinol -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Over [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what did he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I couldn't afford it, he gave, he gave me about 4 of them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I took, and this was like last month -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it worked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  The thing is if you could afford it, it would work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then, or my insurance company would pay for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  Well, that's why, I mean they could help you afford it but they won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's funny like you know, it, it, it, it discourages me man, it really does because I'm an American -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I did -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've more than paid your dues, you, you joined the military for goodness sakes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And got [INAUDIBLE] because of it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, man.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't worry we're going to get on top of this.  We will find a way around this, whatever it takes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So instead of 120 we'll do 150 a month.  Okay for the alprazolam.  Now Revia, naltrexone has not been shown to cause significant increases in complaints in most studies when people have not been taking opioids prior, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, studies in the alcoholic population and people who have tried this sometimes experience mild symptoms of nausea, abdominal cramps -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get them naturally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some, some joint pain and nasal symptoms it's usually mild and it usually goes away after the first few days and then it shows you like fatigue 4%, anxiety 2% on those, 2% that's not that bad and-</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's not bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It usually doesn't last very long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now people by nature have 2% anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, kind of it's pretty close to Placebo -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Placebo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is when they got a fake pill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and you'll get the same printout probably from the pharmacy.  But I have a feeling that that might be okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll go ahead with, you know start with the 25 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was going to ask you.  Being it's summer time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm out in the sun all the time, start, like cutting, cutting, cutting back on all the other psych meds like a couple of mg or whatever and wean me off for like a month or so and start back up from small to large again.  Just to give my insides a break?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> None of these though seem to be taking a bad toll.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No but I've been on these for years you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but they're helping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're helping, yeah, they're helping the brain -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But what about the kidneys the liver.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But when we check them they're healthy, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bare in mind, okay I'm just going to go through the doses with you.  The Abilify okay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's out of your system in a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So each day you're taking a new, you're starting with a fresh leg -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Starting with a fresh start yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  The trazodone that's a pretty low dose you're taking that on an as needed basis anyway -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're good with that.  Alprazolam that's in and out of your system within a few hours -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that isn't building up, it's Prozac would build up -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Build up yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Marinol would build up frankly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah Marinol would -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because marijuana is like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that builds a trait of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but not most of things you're taking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that goes to the fat cells.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this um, this naltrexone that's going to start at a pretty low dose and that out of your system within 24 hours too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not taking something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It filters through the liver [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That builds up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All this stuff filters to the liver -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, most of them, but then again to alprazolam is a simple molecule -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, your Wellbutrin dose isn't that high -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no Wellbutrin is pretty good -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My wife likes me better on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It really has been a good balance for your particular situation, you know needing the support for attention deficit and some of the depression with bipolar and just doing double duty with so many things.  But really your attention and concentration improve so much when that was added.  But now the pain is taking away from that.  So, we're trying to get on top of that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I ain't getting help at all with that and my, my, my um family doctor she's new because me, the one I was seeing she, she left -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That group and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This girl took over and she, I, man -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's a suggestion for you.  Um, I know you don't like to take the acetaminophen because it's going through the liver with everything else but ibuprofen goes through your kidney.  Consider taking some every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ibuprofen?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Motrin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Motrin, Advil, generic ibuprofen -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just 200 mg a day would be allright?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With your pain, take more like 600, 2 or 3 times a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You need a prescription for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah 600 mg a day -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe that will make it more affordable for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's possible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Six hundreds a prescription dose, 800s a prescription dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take them at least 6 hours apart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if you keep the inflammation under control you might stay on top of the pain.  Between steadily taking an anti-inflammatory and since it's going through your kidney it's not getting in the way of any of the other medicines going through your liver.  Just make sure you drink plenty of water -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it upsets your stomach take it with food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the only thing right now that's really, really getting to me is the eating part; because like look, I, I, I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're thin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm thin, I'm working, I'm still strong but after a while it's going to start cutting into my muscles.  I'm not eating good enough; because I'm, I'm getting, it's weird it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does ibuprofen upset your stomach?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My intestinal tract starts hurting, like sometimes it hurts, at like the bottom stomach part, where I go to the bathroom out of, you know what I mean.  Like from here and sometimes all up in here hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You may have a chronic infection.  It's taking its toll on you.  However, I do think that everything we're talking about, especially adding, does ibuprofen upset your stomach usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, a lot, a lot of the over the counter pain killers do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bummer then tell you what.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, I can't take aspirin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can't take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  Okay I'm writing for 600 all right -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, what we can do if that upsets your stomach even if you take it with food or milk.  Try cutting them in half at least you can get the prescription paid for at the prescription dose then you get a 300 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In stead of taking, you probably would have taken 2, 200 that makes 400 before.  So, maybe it helps save you some money and you can still at least have a little bit in your system.  Again like we were talking about with the other drugs, turn down the inflammation and the infection so your, the rest of your immune system can kick in, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay and, and especially lately, especially over the last month or so and like I get, I used to get it from time to time where I have like um, like uh, like this like, almost like a hunger type pain but I'm not hungry.  I ate and stuff like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any rectal bleeding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I haven't had [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the heavy objects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that a lot of bleeding though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no bleeding at all just a lot of pain -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, like you would -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it would hurt there whenever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could have an ulcer that worries me a lot too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because like when, whenever my hemorrhoid hurts -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My stomach hurts, my lower abdominal area hurts uh, but lately though I um, it's like right up in here will get like, like it, like as if I'm, I, I, I, and it's like it, ate as if I'm going to throw up and like, like I gag a little bit like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could have GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease or an ulcer.  Did you every take anything um, Prilosec or Protonix or even Benadryl -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Benadryl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Makes me sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then take it at night.  Why shouldn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it makes me sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Too sleepy in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, too sleepy in the morning, like the thing is I can't have that too sleepy in the morning feeling -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're between a rock and hard place you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, naltrexone will be perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope so because look, because, because the reason why temazepam works for a little bit then my body got used to it.  Like I had to stop -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've had [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Taking that and I had, yeah I had you to give me the uh, char, trazodone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see the trazodone I get weird nightmares -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I don't wake up from until the morning, like I remember -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Them and then um, when, and then I'm groggy for, until like 11:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's like ah, it's like, it's like I'm in a haze and if I'm in bright light it hurts my eyes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a tough road.  But you know what we're going to find the thing that gives you the most benefit with the least side effects.  Whatever it takes and there maybe times you know, you take one antibiotic for a little while then you take a break and then you take another one for a little while -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where, wherever you feel like okay my body is getting control of this.  We'll do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, but you've got the mood, the attention, the panic under control.  I'd hate to see you go cold turkey off these medicines -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have a recurrence and then you're behind the 8 ball again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I am still moody, don't get twisted because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, I'm hearing you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My wife, my wife will give you the run down on that if you ever need her to tell you how mood and pissy I get and, and ramie, I get ramie.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why you want to stay with it and I'm telling you it's not building up in your system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know not these.  If you were on Prozac okay yes it would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you stayed with dronabinol, it would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, because the only thing that ever gave me like real like at least where I could feel the pain where it's not annoying me or distracting me.  But I know it's there so I don't hurt myself -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Was the Marinol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  Well maybe there'll be some changes in healthcare that people can get it and use it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even, even if they realized that we can make salad out of something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like normal, you'd be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know I'm sure you know from being in certain South American countries -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The ones at the high altitude, cocaine leaves on every corner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You chew them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You chew them [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In some tea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, know what it is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's treating the headaches and the altitude sickness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is those human beings that ruin it for the rest of us -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That don't have discipline, that abuse shit, and it's like, you know and it screws it up for the rest of us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know and then in certain societies, certain countries they recognize we need it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's a whole tribe -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think we're going to get it, you know and it's not abuse it's, it's actually helping people get better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In the Peruvian Alps, all right there's this whole tribe of um, people that they live off of just the leaves, they eat, and, and all the herbs and stuff that they have and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're read about them right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I saw the whole special on that, you know they have a whole society that will eat these leaves and eat grind up, ground up seashells stuff -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the, for the calcium -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The calcium, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they live off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're no fools, they figured all this out through, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Years of trial and error.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, eons of experience.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know and it's like, even though their theology might be a little bit difference than ours but it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Come on,  I mean if it works for them, why ain't it working for us.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't we let it work for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, why exactly.  You know, to, some people are to liberal and too puritan to be in between.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you know even with things that a physician is supposedly monitoring like the opiates and the OxyContin.  Then you find addicted physicians get exposed and corruption and then they ruin it for everybody else and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know there are risks and you know you just try to find that risk benefit ratio where the fewest people are hurt and the most get the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Benefit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get the most benefit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's hard in this so, you know what it is we live in a affluent country to the point where, you know that's all we know how to do is over consume.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It used to be pretty affluent.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We need a little reform.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah I mean I'm optimistic about the future.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We've got to figure out how to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm moving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get on top of the you know, the fact that people need healthcare and medications and things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get it to people so they can stay better and not get as sick and then you'll be better off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.  Not just wait until it's so bad there in an emergency room and then you know you're trying desperately to keep them alive.  Do more preventive and keep people healthier, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which I know is, is what you're trying to do.  So the Abilify, Wellbutrin, you need the Cogentin right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Benztropine?  Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, and what about Trazodone again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm s, I still got plenty of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still got plenty of those, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't take them that much because they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They help me sleep but then it's like, it gets weird it's like, it has one benefit -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then it has the side effect and sometimes the side effect is more prevalent then the benefit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well maybe -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least I get to sleep good, rest but then I have this weird dream and it's like wow man -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe naltrexone will step in to that role that you need, you know that could really help to fit, to fill something that's missing.  Plus you have an extra alprazolam available to now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's weird -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For when you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like my bodies not making the right chemicals to the point where I have to pump my body full of it, it's, it's, it's the scary thing you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what though you're saying that but remember you're taking understandable prescription doses of things.  There's nothing here that's off the charts or you know, unusual -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know think of someone with HIV, think of someone with diabetes.  They need medications everyday -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's their maintenance each day it goes through their system and the next day it gets replaced and it keeps them as healthy as they can be through each day.  That's what we're trying to do here too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and let's grab you the printout on the low dose naltrexone that I sent to the back and we'll have you come back next available.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And thanks for doing the recording.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) When I came in I, I first started thinking about Friday and what was on my mind when our time ended.  And I was thinking I had the feeling that I was kind of relieved that the weekend was coming up so I could kind of get away from the question of why I'd been feeling the way I had toward you.  And I remember thinking that I wanted you to be the first to say things and, I don't know, to see through me, but then to do something about it.  And I remember there was more to it, but it was, I think I was feeling very much that over the weekend I could get away from thinking about it.  And then I found here,after recalling that, that I started thinking about all the things over the weekend that got me away from thinking about it too.  And I wasn't, I don't know, it was ki—, I went through a series of thoughts before I realized that I was getting away from what I'd first thought of when I came in.  And then I wasn't sure if they were important things in themselves or whether they were just things to think of so I could stop thinking about what we were talking about on Friday.</p>

<p>It was mainly things like we went out to dinner last night, or went to a friend's house.  And I wasn't just recalling the dinner.  It was more uhm, MSCZ knew MNO, the husband of the girl I was actually thinking of.  And what I was thinking was that his wife FRA and I are not really completely relaxed with each others.  And we met a couple that are friends of theirs uhm, that she met through her teaching experience when she was a teacher.  She's no longer a teacher.  But then a lot of people were mentioned.  And I was sort of thinking that if I had been teaching with her I would have an entirely different relationship, a much nicer one.  Because I found that it's been slow to — I don't think we dislike each other, or anything like that — it's just been a slow friendship to get going and — but then I found I'd rather think about that than about well, how I was feeling about you last week.  And I, it's, I'd rather enough so I find I'm very vague on it even though when I first came in I think I really did remember everything about what happened at the end on Friday.  (Pause)</p>

<p>The other part of what I was recalling about Friday, that I seem to continue to have a reaction to, which I did then, which — and it makes me feel sort of uncomfortable.  I don't think it makes me feel much more than that.  But uhm, I remember when I was talking on Friday, I got to a point and I said something like, I was wondering if you were going to say something to show me that I was off.  I can't remember my words, but essentially that I was off the track or that the things I was saying didn't really mean what I was thinking they mean.  And I remember you, you said well you thought it would be more to the purpose of being here to think about this attitude I'd had toward you.  And when I think of that now, I don't know, in a way it was, I was asking you to say something.  But on the other hand I think I keep feeling it was almost like a reprimand.  Or I think that's the part makes me feel uncomfortable is — (pause)</p>

<p>And, and it's a funny, I don't know, it's, it's more clearly I'm reacting now to remembering those words and not to the other feelings I had.  But I do recall on Friday that when I said what I did something because I had a feeling that I was getting off a point, and I wasn't sure what the point was.  And so I was really asking you to tell me what I should get back on to, which you did.  And yet now I'm thinking of it, and I know I, it was part of my reaction then too, that instead of taking it, you just told me, I took it as a reprimand.  Because I wasn't, I don't know — I guess thinking of it, you were saying I wasn't doing what I should be doing somehow.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence) I wa—, I was just trying to remember what you had said when you said you thought it'd be more valuable to direct my attention to what I had been thinking or how I'd been reacting to you last week.  And I was finding, I couldn't, a_ aside from remembering the feeling I had about your seeing through me — and I know you referred to it in some way — I couldn't recall what else you said.  Until I remembered your saying something about, and I don't know whether it was that time or earlier, that what I was doing was enough, in a way controlling you when I was talking about the fact that I — it seemed that I — assumed you wanted to control me.  And then I was thinking well I don't have to look at it that way.  And I don't know how I took it then, but I think I took it differently.  But just now when it occurred to me,i was thinking,just the fact I kept talking about that and sort of thinking what things might be like if I didn't go around thinking you or everybody wanted to control me, how that would make things different for me.  But it was — well, then it seemed quite meaningful to talk about.  But now I can see it was sort of conjecture and it was sort of empty, sort of imagining in a way that it's not happening yet.  And, I don't know, it was a way to keep talking and control you by talking about something else than perhaps you'd want me to and as long as I kept talking you wouldn't be saying anything to redirect me.  (Pause) You know, it was sort of a double control because it was more pleasant to think about that.  And therefore it was controlling my thoughts in a way too, as well as — I was going to say as well as you — and then I sort of have the feeling that even now I'm, I don't know what I'm doing but —</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I don't seem to want to think about well, the question of,that remained from last week,of why I was feeling the way I was toward you.  Because I find again I'm thinking about last night.  And sort of, I don't know, it was, it was — sometimes I forgot myself and I had a very good time and other times I was I guess in my old way of wondering how people were reacting to me and what mistakes was I making, and that kind of thing.  And, but I found that reaction and that feeling was stronger yesterday or last evening than it has been for a long time.  And, but now when it comes to my mind it seems I want to think in that way and sort of pull apart what I did and what I didn't do, rather than think about my reaction to you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so what it comes down to quite literally, and what you seem to be saying is that you started out wanting me to tell you what to think about.  And so it seemed as though I did.  And it seems to you as though you ought to then pursue that, but you find unaccountably that you can't do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I was just wondering if that is just another way I'm fighting you.  Because at first I was thinking, well, I can make it look like I'm trying, which I seem to be doing.  But on the other hand, if I don't let myself do it, I still won't be doing it.  So that's like covering up that I'm still fighting you and yet trying to make it look good somehow.  (Pause) It reminds me of — I mean my asking you to tell me what to think of and then not doing it — reminds me of MSCZ's always saying, "You always ask my opinion about something and I tell you, and then you do the opposite."  It's almost as if I want you to tell me so then I'll know specifically what grounds I can fight on.</p>

<p>(Silence) I keep thinking though, that if I could remember what you said it would somehow change things — that when you were describing my reaction to you last week and the only thing I still can remember is mentioning that I was reacting to you as if you could see through me and you were stern, I remember that.  But you also phrased things in a way that — I mean there were, it was what I had said, but you used your own words and it somehow made it seem somewhat, well it ma—, put a new slant on it that I hadn't thought of.  And I don't recall what it was but I think maybe whatever it was, I didn't like it.  Because it, I don't know if it's because of this, but it wasn't the way I had been telling it to you.  You were presenting another side of it — I guess, that would be it — that I hadn't mentioned and I don't know whether that has anything to do with it.  (Pause) Well, it makes me think of whenever it was, it might have been the week before, of, or fairly recently anyway, my reacting when you'd tell me something about myself, however you did it, indirectly or directly, that I wouldn't want to hear.  And even if in a way I wanted to hear it or if I wanted to, if I had to admit it, I would still be antagonistic to your telling me something about myself.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I think I was sort of recalling that during that week that I was fighting — I guess that is really what it was, your telling me anything about myself — I remember that at the end of the week you said something to the effect that this is why you come here.  So, as if it were sort of ironic that I was feeling that way if that's why I'm coming here.  And, and then I switched around and I was thinking, and I don't think I verbalized it all, but sort of, "But I do want you to be doing that.  I do want you to be helping me."  And I was feeling very much a different kind of attitude toward it.  But now when I was thinking of it, I was just wondering again — I don't know how much that switch of mood is, I, in a way a reaction to thinking I can only go so far and I better be careful.</p>

<p>And then I found something I haven't thought much about uhm for a long time now, was seeing faces in the material on the wall.  And just when I thought that, I, I just was looking at a certain place and I saw what looked like an indian head, sort of partly turned profile.  And it just made me think immediately of all the indians in dreams I had that — when I was little.  And indians were always something threatening me.  And there was somehow — wasn't anything that I had done something personally to them and they were going to get me, but just they were a force that was hostile to me.  And then I, and, and below that head I saw what was just really half a face almost of a man just sort of looking through me, which makes me think of what I was saying last week.  And I don't know, the, the expression was kind of, well again it was almost as if I was there.  It didn't have to be me personally.  But there I was and the face was looking at me and it was going to destroy me, but not from anything personal.  Just, I don't know, almost the attitude I wasn't, I was just a thing, and if, if whatever belonged to this face wanted to destroy me, being this thing to him then he would.</p>

<p>And (pause) the more I think of it, I think seeing those faces, which I can barely see now — I can't even find one of them now, the one of the half face, the man looking through me — it, it just made me, I don't know, think again of the question I had of was I reacting the way I had that week, several weeks ago, when I was thinking about reacting against your telling me things?  Bec—, in, in thinking I'd gone too far and then seeing these faces as sort of what would happen to me if I went too far or something like that.</p>

<p>Or it makes me just think again of all the times I fought my father and argued with him and was unpleasant to him and everything.  But, and this is something that's always bothered me, that essentially I was very obedient in a way to a lot of what he stood for, what he wanted his children to stand for.  And it's almost as if that's how I didn't ever go too far by — might be nasty verbally, but still I would do the things that were essential for his daughter to do and so I never went, I never quite stepped over the line.  And the line, I guess, I'm thinking of, is all this fighting is to assert myself.  And it just seems that as much as I wanted to, on the other hand, I didn't really dare stand alone.  I didn't really think I could.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It makes me think back to this past Friday of right, right when I had said something about wondering what you were going to say next about what I'd been saying.  And I don't know, I was kind of thinking — and then after you said something I was thinking too — of the fact that I'd enjoyed having those feelings that I was describing.  And even if they weren't, I don't know, really purposeful to go into them, or getting me anywhere, I was enjoying having them.  And on the one hand I wanted to just sort of say, even if you don't think this is a worthwhile thing to be pursuing, I feel like pursuing it right then.  But yet I was afraid of what you were thinking.  And I didn't really, I don't know, it became a thing where I'd have to flaunt you or your authority or your control or something to do it.  And, and then it lost its enjoyable character to me and I wasn't sure just how far I wanted to go I guess, or — (pause)</p>

<p>Or else somehow I ended up feeling at that point when I, when it occurred to me to wonder what you were thinking of what I'm saying and if I'm off the point or if you're going to tell me well these feelings aren't really true feelings, you're indulging in something that — somehow that was the time when the fighting entered into it.  Or the feeling there was a difference of wills or something.  And my choice was either to follow what I wanted, however foolish,and to take the consequences, to be ready to stand alone and sort of say I don't care what you think, or to be obedient and agree with you I guess, or to do as you said.  Or — which gets me back to what I said earlier of feeling as if I were making it look like a good show of trying to be obedient to you but yet really not wanting to.  But not being open about it.  So (clears throat) — and then I ask myself, well what be—, I wasn't being open because I didn't dare.  And I was thinking well do I think you'd do?  And I don't know, it just — one, one feeling would be that somehow you're more powerful and so somehow that would hurt me if you wanted to use it or just you'd be disapproving.  And somehow that would hurt me, if you were disapproving.</p>

<p>And also I keep — this thought comes to my mind today of this — in, in recalling in the past too the desire to assert myself, if I find I'm thinking of something then the fear comes in, what are you thinking about what I'm doing?  And the_ then I just become more conscious of, then or later, of wanting to assert myself.  And, and, but I'm choosing to assert myself over are all foolish things.  I mean they aren't really meaningful things.  (Pause) And then when I think that, I sort of lose perspective on how much I should want to assert myself anyway.  But if I think of not doing it I feel as if I'm nothing.  I'm just following people around and being very dependent and obedient and not thinking for myself and all that kind of thing.</p>

<p>(Pause) In fact, I suppose that's why last night more than any other time recently, if this has been on my mind from last week, I started analyzing what I'd done in the company of other people.  Because it does seem to revolve around asserting myself too.  Or did I make, it, uh, sort of a question,did I make an impression on the people who were there, of being a separate individual somehow, without being too aggressive about it?</p>

<p>(2 ½-minute silence) I was just beginning to think of one incident in the evening that — well I can see from what I've been talking about why this might occur to me to some extent but I think I'm not too sure what my feelings were about it.  Because I started to tell, we were talking about MNO's name which is a family name and it happened to be the last name of the other couple there.  And they were just sort of exploring if they were related at all.  And it was making me think of the fact that my uncles used to call my father MNO.  It was, for some reason to them it was kind of a joke as well as a nickname.  But it, it was an intimate kind of thing too.  And then my father was in some,i think it was one of my uncle's weddings, and the minister started calling him MNO, not realizing.  And it struck people funny, as I guess any use of a nickname does when the person doesn't know you at all and doesn't realize he's using it as a nickname.  And this talk had gone on, and I'd remembered the story, and it was striking me funny and I knew I couldn't tell it the way it was striking me and I was thinking, I shouldn't really bring it up at all, because it, whatever was funny about it is kind of, well, at this point I'm not even sure why I find it funny.</p>

<p>And, but then I, but I still brought it up.  I prefaced it by saying, I'm not sure why I still find this funny, but then anyway, but then I got kind of involved and mixed-up because I knew it wasn't going to come across.  So MSCZ took over, which he often will do when I start te—, well, usually it's stories we both know.  And I don't tell them as well as he.  And, but he changed this one and he made it into my father's wedding.  And I was just, it's, and which made it funnier.  But I was just thinking, I don't know, I think last night when he did it I was kind of relieved he got me out of something that was going to be sort of embarrassing.  It was going to be a story that would fall flat.  Or I didn't know, I didn't know how it was going to end up.  But he took over and, and now when I'm thinking of it, I'm thinking sort of that if the story had really been connected with my father's wedding it made me look kind of foolish that I couldn't remember the details enough to remember that.  And so I think I'm feeling right now antagonistic to MSCZ for having taken over.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Our time's up.</p>

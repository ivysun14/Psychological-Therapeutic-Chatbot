<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see you filled out some mood charts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're fantastic with those.  I went to, uh, a meeting recently where, um, where doctors were talking about how to, uh, you know, gauge diagnosis better and so forth, and there was some really good materials on mood charts, and most of the other doctors around the table were saying patients will never do that.  And I said oh, actually, you know, someone really resourceful that I know went to a web site, found a good chart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the reason why I like this one -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You kind of helped design that, didn't you?  You, you modified what was on the web site.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, this is the way it's set up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is the way it's set up, but the reason I like this is because they send you a reminder email every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And granted, I don't do it every day.  You can see I've missed days more, more so lately than ever because I've been just having a hard time lately, but, um, getting that reminder email -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, has made me do a better job of doing this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Without the reminder email, I would never do this because I tried to do mood charts in the past and failed at them miserably.  At least with this, I'm not 100% -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm a lot better at it than I used to be.  I'm a little bad about keeping up with the medicine parts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you've got on there is very useful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They let you track the medicine, your medicines like when you stop and start them and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm not as good with that, but, um, that daily email is what is the key for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the email is nice because you get to it when you get to it.  A few years back I was aware of, um, a project that had to do with telephoning people with bipolar disorder remembering them to take their medications, and I don't think people really liked it very much.  I think they found the telephone very intrusive, uh, but with email, you look at your email when you're ready to look at it and at least see what it says.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well today I actually went to it and it said that I did such, I've been doing such a good job completing it that they actually asked me to participate in another, like a little study where they track my, I think they called it, they didn't use the word biorhythms, but they used another word like sociorhythms or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they ask you 5 questions a day like what time you got up, your first contact with another person, what time you started doing any kind of work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What time you went to bed and what time you did something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And apparently they track that for 2 weeks, and then they start you in this program where they try to actually help you improve -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Those measures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm going to try it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's great.  I know this is the kind, uh, research they do at universities.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to try it.  I figure I have nothing to lose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been losing some weight too.  I can see every month -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've gained, I've gained 5 pounds if you look at my charts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really because this says you go from, oh, wait a minute.  I'm going backwards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going upwards.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I started at December.  Okay, wow, and that's since the Concerta even.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  How is the Concerta affecting your attention and concentration?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't think it's helping that much, but I'm not sleeping as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, I think it's helping a little bit.  I think it's actually making me a little bit hyper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some days, but only at times, like I noted in there and I don't know how much this is the Concerta or just my moods changing.  I'm having days where one minute I'm crying hysterically over nothing, and then the next minute, I'm laughing hysterically over nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then one minute I'm talking a mile a minute and my friends are like why are you talking so fast?  What's going on?  I never shut up, and the next minute I've got nothing to say because I know if I open my mouth, I'm just going to burst into tears or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, my mood is all over the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it seems much more, um, drastic -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the Concerta in place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you tried taking just 1 Concerta because I see you're taking 2 daily which are the titration instructions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well with the 1, I had that reaction -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remind me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the first couple of days.  The reactions I just described.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that, that volatility?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the first like 2 or 3 days, and then it didn't seem to have no effect on my whatsoever and I went back to sleeping all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I said well, I did not take it for the next 4 days or whatever, and then I said well, I guess I'm supposed to go up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I went up to the 2, and I've been taking the 2 and, um, and it's not every day, but it's mostly, it's mostly is my moods like just going up and down like crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here is the 25 mg and maybe that, if you think the Concerta otherwise has helped your attention, your concentration, I could take it to the 25 and give that a try.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we always try to find just that right balance for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I know you tried the amphetamine salts, the Adderalls.  Uh, there's also short acting methylphenidate too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, we tried the, um, the Adderall XR, right, that's the only two you're talking, I mean, um, just regular Adderall?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly, yes.  I think you tried XR and that gave you trouble with your sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, um, the shorter acting, it seemed like it helped you somewhat in the short run, but had some drawbacks as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It didn't seem to be doing anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, exactly, and that was on 20 mg 3 times a day.  Um, this is really for that daytime drowsiness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'll be honest with you, I started thinking about the Topamax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wonder if I'm getting that, that, you know, stereotypical dopamax, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's an interesting question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As much as I hate to go off it because, um, that's the only thing that I'm taking that has any mood stabilizing properties.  Also, um, you know, it does help with my migraines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  Where do things stand with your migraines now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, uh, they're a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm still getting them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I do get them, they're very severe -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yikes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And nothing helps.  I mean the neurologist has given me four different medicines to try and none of them have helped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like when I really get a bad one, like it just seems like nothing helps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, you know, so I'm concerned that, you know, taking away the Topamax will take away my prevention of the migraines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you definitely don't want that to happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But at the same time, I'm very frustrated with this feeling of not being able to do stuff, not being able to think, not being able to concentrate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I used to be the kind of person that could knock out 8 hours of work in 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I can't knock out 3 hours of work in 24 hours -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now.  I just, I can't do it.  I can't, I can't, you know, I'm trying to read a book now, and I'm lucky if I can read 1 or 2 pages a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so frustrating because I know you love to read.  And you have the Concerta and the Provigil in place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Provigil doesn't, I'm taking that, but it doesn't seem to have that much of an effect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have tried Provigil before because of the sleep apnea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it never has seemed to have had much effect over me which is very interesting because most medicines affect me very strongly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that one seems to not have much effect at all, which is very odd.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've had a lot of courage to keep trying.  You are also still taking, uh, some of the Neurontin, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't taken Neurontin in a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's been out of the picture for a while?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wrote myself a big note about that.  So you're right, in terms of anything with mood stabilizing properties, it's really just the, uh, Topamax and maybe a little bit of your benzodiazepine.  The, uh, clonazepam and lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm not taking any, um, the clonazepam is the Klonopin, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, I am not taking that anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I took, I took 2, 2 doses of that when I ran out of the Ativan -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my mood dropped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sorry about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people do find the Klonopin kind of depressing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, simple nervous system [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mood went in the toilet so bad -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's a really valuable observation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought to myself, I will never take this again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so we will not go there again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No Klonopin for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I mean I was, I mean I noticed it not the first day, but after the second day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I was, even after I stopped taking it, I was still really depressed for a couple of days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought I remember, I remember, I had remembered you saying that before, and that's why you switched me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly to the lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I, and I thought, you know what, I've never taking this stuff again because I had forgotten that you had said that, but I remembered very quickly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm glad you called me about the lorazepam too.  That was no problem to call that in.  So, how are things with your physical symptoms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not good.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got a text message problem.  I'm not quite as tired, although today is an exception.  I'm pretty tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you seem pretty tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm really tired today.  I don't know why, but, um, my hands have been hurting really bad.  Um, I, I made a comment in there like I haven't, I went to play cards with my friends a week or 2 ago, I couldn't even like shuffle the cards.  I, I literally, like I was trying to shuffle and the cards were just going everywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been a card player since I was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know how to shuffle cards.  I couldn't even shuffle the cards.  I, my hands sometimes just don't, aren't working right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, the prickly feelings of the.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, it's one thing to get numbness and tingly, but this is like somebody, this is beyond numbness and tingling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is like strong prickly like someone literally stabbing large pins in my hand like, uh, just not just a tingly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you're having herxheimer reactions like crazy.  I think your body's releasing toxins.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, but it's starting up again where my fingers in here, and my toes literally feel like they're going to break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They just feel like they're going to break in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've complained about that for years, and my old family doctor used to just say, oh, it's probably from your neck.  You know, because I have herniated disc in my neck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's probably from your neck.  Well, I'm sorry, but my finger feeling like it's going to break, I don't see the connection.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this waxes and wanes in a very -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unpredictable manner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something that might be incredibly helpful is track your pain symptoms as well.  You've done a great job.  I see some notes on the side as well, which is great.  What they say with the kinds of chronic infections that live in the cysts is that, um, they tend to have a monthly life cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I read that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if, um, it's being released and you're feeling the symptoms kind of on a regular basis from month to month, it's probably flushing it out.  I just think you have a lot in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I did read, I read -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you did excellent.  That's phenomenal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I printed these 2 out from that web site you gave me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent, excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, um, I did a lot of highlighting of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I want to, well first, I, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, you got the labs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went and got the labs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can you make copies of these -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I can get this back?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and I don't know if they did the right smear test, but all they wrote was this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's have a look.  I'll just review and I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even know what that means.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I believe, and it's been a while since I looked in the medical dictionary, but I think it means misshapen cells in some way.  So what I'm really, what I would like to know is did they see inclusions because we were wondering about the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I told her -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With your fevers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I gave my doctor your note.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they didn't, um, it doesn't say on here specifically that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like yes or no, but it makes me wonder -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If they specifically looked for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But anisocytosis means misshapen cells.  So are they saying that because they saw, you know, something there.  That's a good question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would like to know what that means further.  I mean personally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely.  Me too.  Well there's a phone number.  How about if I try calling?  It says for [INAUDIBLE] contact branch lab.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm going to try calling the lab and just see if there was any additional -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it would be helpful.  Sometimes you wonder if they actually read, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Please comment if there are inclusions in the red cells.  [DEIDENTIFIED].  All right, that's the lab itself.  Oh no, I think I got on the wrong, oh, operator assistance, yes.  Finally, yay.  I like it when you can get a person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Same here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Hi, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I got back a, uh, lab report from a patient and I have a question about one of the findings, and I was wondering if somebody could give me some more information.  Thank you.  That was the operator, so we'll see what happens.  Eleven digit specimen number.  Well, here it is.  Okay, 326, I tried entering it, and then it started ringing.  Hi, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I got back a lab report for a patient and I'd like more information about it please.  There's something on it that is not clear.  The specimen number is [DEIDENTIFIED] and then there's a dash zero.  Uh, yes, I work with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Um, it's the very last, um, result.  It says [INAUDIBLE] consult per smear and the comment is anisocytosis present, and I'm wondering if the pathologist who looked at it made any comments.  What I'm inquiring is whether there are any inclusions in the red blood cells.  I'm trying to rule out [INAUDIBLE] for this patient.  Yes.  What's their number?  Fantastic.  Okay.  Now, she's paging hematology for me.  So we'll see if we get anywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I appreciate your help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no problem.  At least I can get the number for you so [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] could save some time on hold maybe if he ends up wanting to follow up on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well he is going to follow, well he might, I don't see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], but she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have an appointment with her next week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I saw her when I got that blood work done, she said, you know, it's probably time to go to a specialist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She thinks.  She's like because I'm not smart enough or well equipped enough in knowledge about this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And fair enough.  You know, it's good for people to know what they know, and know when -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hi, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I'm calling to follow up on, um, a lab report that I got for a patient.  Um, I have the specimen number.  Um, it's [DEIDENTIFIED] and then it's dash zero, and, um, it's the very last result that's noted, [INAUDIBLE] pathology consult per smear, and then there's a comment anisocytosis present.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.  I'm writing down for you as well, um, uh, contact info for, uh, someone locally who I know is pretty well versed at treating these kinds of infections.  I think I might even have his number stashed away somewhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She recommended I go to an infectious disease doctor [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's exactly right.  Thank you.  Yes, with the anisocytosis that was seen, I have a, uh, question about what they specifically saw.  Oh great.  Hi, there.  This is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], how are you doing?  I just called to ask more about, um, that, uh, that blood smear where the, uh, yes, exactly, and where the anisocytosis was present, do you, yes.  Oh, thank you very much.  Now, a question that I have and I'm wondering if you visualized this in the smear at all, I'm suspecting [INAUDIBLE] with this patient and I understand it can have malaria like inclusions in the red blood cells.  Uh, it's [INAUDIBLE] which is related, yeah.  Are you seeing anything in, oh, okay.  So you sent it along to microbiology and they're going to, yes.  Okay, do you know if that test was sent to microbiology?  Uh, I requested to rule out [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  Okay, and what is the, uh, the rest, the area code and the extension, I mean the exchange, [DEIDENTIFIED] and that'd be extension 2234.  Okay, great.  Okay, or [DEIDENTIFIED].  Okay, thank you.  Somebody was knocking.  Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].  All right, if you don't mind listening in case somebody picks um, I just want to let whoever is at the door know that we're stuck on hold.  Hello.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hello.  Hello.  [INAUDIBLE] it sounds like they hung up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Like a girl just disconnected me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, hello.  You're right.  Well thanks for trying.  Uh, the patient who was missing has been found.  So that is a gigantic relief.  All right, well so what I think happened was, for whatever reason, your blood test went to the hematology and not the microbiology department.  She thought maybe it's still in the microbiology department.  They're the ones who would look for the inclusions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the fact that it says final report really makes me wonder.  So what I'm guessing is it probably ended up in, you know, their department.  So if you're probably going to see an expert with, um, infectious disease, they may have a way of ordering your battery of tests to say send to microbiology and look for, but that at least is something to bring up.  Apparently they'll need to do it again most likely because I'm guessing they probably didn't keep the smear, but there could be more, you know, that the infectious folks may be looking for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the fact that this was found.  That's not normal they're claiming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's some abnormal shape of the cells, yes, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there wouldn't be unless something was wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually.  Usually.  I mean usually, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it could be something different -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But there's something going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  I mean another place that one might see that result would be in someone who's asymptomatic that was sickle cell [INAUDIBLE] you know, how with sickle cell anemia that, um, there is a [INAUDIBLE] where the people is healthy, but enough of their blood are shaped, they almost look like little bananas, on the smear, and that helps resist getting malaria.  So it's just interesting.  You know, there would be one case where there's a protective -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I wouldn't have sickle cell, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Most likely not unless you have African ancestry, which, you know, we all probably do ultimately, but it's more rare for Caucasians.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I probably don't because both my parents are Italian.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the like, the chances for me are pretty slim.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But not impossible.  Who knows where they've been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and then when they trace the genes all the way back, we probably all came out of Africa, but that's way back.  So that might be something, you know, to follow up on with a future work up, um, and I do know that this doctor, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at [DEIDENTIFIED] is very pretty well versed with this -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And also at the lympa.org web site, you know, obviously it sounds like your doctor is dedicated.  She's looking into things.  She's listening.  That's huge and if she has a team that she likes to work with, there's no reason not to give them a try.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she said she didn't know, but she just said, you know, it sounds like you might have to go to a specialist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She said we'll talk about it after these results come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm going next week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've also heard that there's a big lyme clinic in New Jersey.  So I could try to find out more information about that.  Um, but if you want to stay a little bit more local, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] would be a reasonable place to start, like if you needed IV antibiotics or something like that, you know, he, I know that he has been able to give those to people who have needed them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I did read that, um, this one document that's very thick -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They have like protocols -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm definitely a candidate for the IV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've had it longer than a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, blah, blah, blah, but what was interesting was I went through this list -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of symptoms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had swollen glands a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had sore throat a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fevers.  Not high fevers, but low grade fevers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's usually a low relapsing with, you know, often with a lot of perspiration.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's the thing.  I used to be the kind of person that was always cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And literally it was all overnight now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm always hot, and I sweat profusely and I never used to sweat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The feet were hurting, joint pains ungodly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, all over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Joint swelling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really get unexplained back pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I do have major stiffness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have muscle pain.  I have muscle weakness.  I have twitching in my face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have confusion, difficulty thinking, difficulty with concentration, reading.  Um, I get this frequently, word search and name block problems, forget [INAUDIBLE] disorientation, mood swings, anxiety.  Although I've already had, previously have had anxiety panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I get tremors.  I get tremors in my legs.  My leg will just start -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Shaking.  I've never had seizures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Headaches galore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I do get light sensitivity.  I do get sound sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get vision.  I've had problems, um, I read it somewhere and I didn't, I forget where I read it, but it said something about it can hit your optical nerve.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Last time I went to the eye doctor, he told me I have damage to my optical nerve.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He even made me go get tested for glaucoma and some other stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he said I was too young to see that kind of damage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's the thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have ear, well I get ear pains, but I think that's something I've always had.  I don't think that's, um, I do get a lot of buzzing and ringing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I get motion sickness.  I get off balance.  I get lightheaded.  I get all this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't had any facial paralysis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do get a lot of dental pain.  My teeth have been hurting a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then when I go to the dentist, she tells me there's nothing wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The antibiotics could be flushing it out too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a lot of neck pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get insomnia.  I wake up a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I get, sometimes I get excessive nighttime sleep.  Sometimes, I nap a lot during the day, unexplained weight gain.  No unexplained weight loss, unexplained hair loss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hair loss.  That's been plaguing you for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I didn't know what they meant by pain in genital areas.  So I just kind of left that because I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] pelvic pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get pain like right here, but I had hernia repair here, and it's just been hurting me constantly.  So I don't know if it's just from that surgery or this is, it's, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't had, actually my periods have gotten more normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I haven't had any of that.  I have had irritable bladder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, had, uh, cystitis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't have erectile dysfunction.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually not a big issue for women.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit of loss of libido, not a lot, but a little bit.  That was attributed to my medicine though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A lot of nausea, heartburn, a little bit of constipation, a little bit of diarrhea, low, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No heart stuff other than chest pains.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had chest pains, but I had an echocardiogram -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had a stress test, but then I was reading in here that the traditional echocardiogram doesn't catch the type of heart problems that this lyme disease can, that can, it can, that it can create.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  It's really tricky.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And night sweats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're horrible.  Um, I don't drink, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know about the symptoms, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Symptoms flaring up, yeah, and that's one thing since you're so good about the charts [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well they have a chart in that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's a chart in this one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think.  So I can always make a copy.  I don't know.  There's, I have a chart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can print it out and start using it, but this one was pretty much the same thing, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like almost all of them are checked off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus I've had so many of these symptoms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and it's like I'm having so many of them because maybe I actually really have this thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and the antibiotics may be flushing it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, today I feel horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I have a headache that goes from my eyes all the way through the back of my head, and I'm tired.  I'm really tired today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever use the Excedrin Migraine at all or the generic version?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It doesn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It just doesn't really touch it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  It's frustrating and I have [INAUDIBLE] at home.  I've got Motrin.  I've got, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take Maxalt at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just gave me a prescription for Maxalt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I've heard some people say the Maxalt makes a big difference where nothing else did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just gave me a prescription for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm hoping, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, to be honest, I haven't gotten it filled yet because I, I'm a little short on cash, but, um, I should be able to get it filled this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I hope so.  Yeah, and sometimes prior authorization, you know, can be a pain, especially if everything else they have on their formulary hasn't been working.  So, well I would like to make a copy of this blood work, make a copy of your responses there on those sheets, which is fantastic, make a copy of your mood charts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if the highlighter will come up on the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'll see if I can set the contrast so it does, but that's fantastic that you did all this.  And I know you'll take it with you, you know, when you go to your consultant's appointment too.  Is it okay if I take the staples out and then put them back in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you can keep them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, thanks.  This was a spare copy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I can print them off anytime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great, thank you.  And how about the other one?  You filled out the other part too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You want this one too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think I can set the contrast so that that'll turn up.  And we can set our next appointment, and then do you think we need any prescriptions?  Probably we'll try the Concerta 25.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Ativan, I won't get it filled right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could use a 90 day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let me go ahead and do that.  Yeah, because I just called into the pharmacy last time for the 30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the Pristiq.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going, if you have any samples, that would be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, definitely.  Let me get a bag.  Yeah, because I know you're trying to make ends meet right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not quite to the end, but I will be in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I don't want you to run short, and the weather's a little iffy, and we don't want you to get caught if you can't get her in bad weather either.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so funny how many doctors haven't heard of Pristiq.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I go to a new doctor, what medicines are you taking?  Pristiq.  Pristiq, what's Pristiq?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  I'm going to see if I can get you like a brochure with this, so at least you could say here.  Once they see the Wyeth advertising, they'll go ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well it's like Effexor, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, derived from Effexor, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they go, then they go, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then same thing with, I'm taking Patanase.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I haven't heard that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's new too.  Uh, it's, it's a, it's a nasal spray, but it's, um, it's got an antihistamine in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's kind of like one of those dual, I think it also has like a nasal spray component in it.  It's like a dual thing, but it's, it's better for me because it's doesn't cross the brain barrier like the, the, uh, pill versions of the medicines do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.  Yeah, because you want it to stay at the sinuses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, but it will affect all my other medicines.  That's the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, allergist's concern [INAUDIBLE] effect.  All my other medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's like this doesn't cross the brain barrier.  So, you know, and it's, it's been wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it doesn't dry it out like using like Nasacort or Rhinocort of any of those other ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remind me your lorazepam dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Point five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Just one a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I'm going to write for 2 a day in case you end up cutting down on the Topamax.  I don't really want you to do that until you find something else that helps with the headaches if possible, but when you're ready, if you need to, after mood stabilization, or, you know, you need to tune down racing thoughts, um, then I want you to have an extra dose available.  So I'm going to put twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that'll be 180 tablets, uh, for a 90 day supply.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  So</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, for now, try to keep everything -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am a little uncomfortable that I'm not having like a good mood stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why I'm saying I wouldn't take away the Topamax just yet because with all the other herxheimer reactions you're having, it could be affecting your cognition too.  You're still getting the work up.  This may clear as the infection is, is, um, is treated.  We're going to be changing your Concerta dose, so that's a difference with the way that's sitting with the amount of Topamax you're taking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes Concerta can aggravate headaches.  So maybe the 25 could lead to some overall improvement.  You do have the lorazepam given for sure that you'll take one daily.  You have a back up if you need it for severe anxiety, racing thoughts or additional mood stabilization, but with the change in the Concerta, I wouldn't change anything else right now.  You're going to go with the Concerta 25.  You're going to try the Maxalt.  You know, once you feel like oh, I've got something else that's helping the headaches.  The headaches could be herxheimer too.  I mean you're still taking the antibiotics and they may continue to be flushing this out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I also, um, I forget during the day sometimes to take it, but what I'm doing at night is I'm taking 2 at night because I read that it was more effective to take 2, to take, like they said if you were prescribed 400 mg, it's more effective to take it 200 mg twice a day than to take 100 mg 4 times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I've been taking definitely 200 mg at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I try to remember to take 200 mg like at lunch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't always remember though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because sometimes that's around the time I get tired.  I end up just going to sleep.  Sometimes I don't eat lunch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a really tough time of day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my hard time of the day is the middle of the day.  That's when I tend to forget things, like yesterday I just totally forgot to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, I saw that noted in your chart.  Yeah, the mood chart that you have.  It may be too that a small dose of shorter acting methylphenidate around then might boost the Concerta.  The Concerta might not be kicking in for a little while.  So like say a 5 mg of Ritalin.  I could write for it now if you think it might help.  It's cheap in generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I  mean if you think so.  I mean I, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm going to write it.  I'm going to leave the Concerta and the Ritalin undated, and then you can just, even the lorazepam is undated, you know, because that, that's for a 90 day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, just remember to fill in your dates, um, but yeah, why don't I write for a 5 mg of Ritalin twice a day, and you can work with that as well if need be because if what's really happening is that infection is getting flushed out and it's getting treated, your needs too may change in terms of, you know, ability to concentrate just naturally, um, and you may want to be able to fine tune these adjustments like that.  It's just so hard not to have anything really definitive, but given everything that you're describing and what the blood work and what you're pursuing, I think it's on the right track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just been hard because like you say, it's been going on for so long.  And I'm going to get you Pristiq samples as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.  I just really -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Feeling crappy now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well the headache alone is enough to make you absolutely miserable.  Would you like, I have here in the office, would you like like 800 mg of Motrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't take that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't.  Yeah, because it's too aggravating to your stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard when it's not an option.  All right, so if you want to take a look at the prescriptions.  I'm going to copy these and get you some Pristiq samples, um, and I'll set the contrast so that your highlighter will show up and I'll be right back, and we'll see a follow up appointment too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problem.  I'm just going to just, uh, turn that off so that you don't have to look at it blinking -</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of want to stop today, yeah. (pause) I'm not sure that I'm accomplishing much. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you say that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not sure. It, (pause) I feel like I (pause) feel pretty anxious. I stopped doing (inaudible) I don't know. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:01:51] to [00:02:18]) </p>

<p>I don't know. Anyway. (pause) My friend Gerry is coming to visit today. So, I hope that, I hope (pause) I'm not really sure what to expect. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:02:47] to [00:06:47])</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:06:46] to [00:07:28])</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what to do. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:07:30] to [00:08:42])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you are feeling somewhat frustrated and also perhaps pretty worried about frustrating me, because we are having such difficulty finding things to say. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's about right. Yeah, I'm not real sure what to say. (pause) You are right, I don't really know what to say. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:09:45] to [00:10:35]) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (pause) think part of you just feels that is very not okay with me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not okay with me anyway. (chuckle) </p>

<p>(pause from [00:11:00] to [00:14:04])</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very frustrating to be held back. Yeah, just not that much fun. (pause from [00:14:18] to [00:14:35])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine that captures the feeling pretty well. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very frustrating. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume that what you are referring to, is held back on your way here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is why I think is what you have been feeling like when you are here. In a way, like, when you can't talk. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes that's frustrating.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe I'm belaboring it, but probably, but in a kind of similar way, where it's like, you want to be here but you can't quite be here[00:15:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's like, it's probably frustrating because it's not when you are at home, but not here, I might feel like being here. Like, something held you back, and got in the way, and it's imminent, but you aren't here yet. Or you are sitting here and you could have things to say, and you can't think of them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Makes sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause from [00:15:48] to [00:19:12])</p>

<p>CLIENT: My friend Gerry is coming to visit soon. Did I tell you that already? Oh. I'm not really sure what to think about that. (pause) I think I have (inaudible). </p>

<p>(pause from [00:19:42] to [00:24:16])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have about five more minutes, and I just want to check in about, how it went this morning? Like with the ECT, the impression I got hearing from the doctor yesterday was that, you know they were going to reconsider dosage, and give you memory testing, and, I just wondered what happened. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not entirely clear on what happened. They seemed to think everything was fine, but I think they, I think they did redo the dosage. I think they gave me less. But he seemed to not be worried. I'm not really sure. [00:25:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, is this (inaudible) care as well? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it worth having (inaudible) any heads up? About what happened, it's seems like</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, probably. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's time for you to go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: James can tell that they've figured out that your memory has been impaired. </p>

<p>(laughter) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's about right. Okay. Do you want me to ask him to call you? Or </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He can just send me an e-mail or leave me a voice-mail, whichever one is easier will be fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I will do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to e-mail you to remind you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be good, okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was I going to ask? Just how you are, I mean, I know you are frustrated, but, how is your mood? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not as good a couple of days ago? [00:26:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's not terrific, but it's not bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Suicidal thoughts? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Suicide, are you having suicidal thoughts? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, no. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not acting, because like, I have an impression you should be like, not really worried but more just that that, also seems like a reasonable gage of how you are feeling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, I've been okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Do you know why it was a long visit? I, you said the appointment this morning was, I'm sorry, a long appointment, the appointment this morning was at 7:45. I'm sure it takes a bit to get from there to here. But it sounds like they also kept you longer than usual? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not, they definitely kept me longer than I was expecting. I'm not sure why they kept me longer than usual. But I, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not upset, I'm just sort of wondering what was going on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not really sure what was going on. I, if anything, I think I would have been, I was out for longer, like, I wasn't, I just wasn't expecting it to take that long. [00:29:03] Because we didn't, I didn't really get a chance to leave until after 11:00. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you upset that you are having these routines? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause from [00:29:29] to [00:29:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I will, is it okay if I send you a text? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I will do that today. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:30:05] to [00:31:00])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, take care. See you on Monday.</p>

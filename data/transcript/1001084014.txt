<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, three significant things have happened since I'd last seen you.  One, is that I had an interview with [DEIDENTIFIED] for a position with them starting in the fall of two thousand and seven.  I had this interview Thursday before [DEIDENTIFIED] weekend.  They wanted a response as to whether I would accept the full time position with them by the following week.  I emailed my acceptance back to them, but I said that I would need them to consider some accommodations because of the fibromyalgia and the chronic fatigue.  Based on that correspondence, they withdrew the offer.  I then asked if we needed to speak with the personnel officer to see if we had an equal employment opportunity issue here.  At that point, they would not return my phone calls, would not return my email, um, and basically said, that if you want to work part time, you can, but not full time and that it really wasn't an official offer.  Now, this is after I had an exit interview with the hiring dean who went over tenure policies, who gave me the salary offer and also I had a packet from HR for full time employment.  So I've been discriminated against because of my illness and needing accommodations.  They still have not confirmed whether or not they would hire me part time.  And I tried to get a commitment from them and no one responded even at that level.  That was painful.  That was painfully disappointing because that's exactly what I was trained to do was teach math in college.  And I had been in communication with them off and on for the past two years looking for work with them.  And they were aware that I wanted to work with them.  So, the personnel officer didn't even know what fibromyalgia was and didn't even know how to spell it when I told him that I had this condition.  So that's pretty much a dead issue, I guess.  They're not even gonna contact me again.  Um, I was pretty certain that I, you know, I was gonna get the job because they offered it to me.  So in the meantime, I went ahead and got a couple of things in my home that were pricey items that needed to be replaced.  Our garage door and a patio door.  Then the next week I realized that they weren't gonna hire me.  So now I've got this debt that I have to repay to [DEIDENTIFIED] and I don't have any idea how it's gonna happen.  Um, so that's kinda upsetting.  Fortunately, I did it on a twelve month loan with zero interest so I pay back a little bit at a time, but when the balance is due, I must pay it otherwise I get a nineteen percent interest rate.  Um, that was upsetting.  You know, to know that I had the job, but because of this illness where I was asking to negotiate accommodations, I was refused the job.  Second thing that has happened was yesterday.  I went, I was called into a meeting by my singles pastor whose also in charge of missions for the church, [DEIDENTIFIED] his name is [NAME OTHER].  I had been on two mission trips prior to [DEIDENTIFIED] to a vacation bible school with, uh, children in a very small church up in coalmine area.  After the first mission trip, I did not get any feedback from [NAME OTHER] until I applied to go the following year again.  At which time, he made some issues to me about following his instructions implicitly, that he was in leadership position.  I was not to question him in any regard.  Um, that I had embarrassed two of the members of the team because there had been an argument between them and I thought there was some hurt feelings and I had brought it up in one of our group meetings at the end of the day during the beginning of the time we were there.  And I just wanted the air to be cleared, um, and he thought that was inappropriate of me.  So I was warned that, you know, I was, my performance was, um, not pleasing to him.  And of course, this was within two months of the end of the trial for my daughter and granddaughter's murders.  And I felt like I needed it for therapy reasons.  I needed to get away.  I needed to be with children, um, to not be dwelling on what had happened. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So the next year I went again, and of course, you know, he had give me this stern reprimand about my behavior, so I heard nothing for another year until yesterday when he said he would bar me from all further mission trips.  He said that I had been harsh with the children as a craft supervisor, but he would not be specific about it.  He said that we had a personality clash and he said that I had challenged him in front of the group somehow.  Um, there was a day in there, in the five days that I had forgotten to take my morning medication.  And in the trip where we were staying at night, to the church was approximately twenty to twenty five minutes.  The plan that day was to leave directly from the church and go on to a fun activity.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At some point during the morning, I remembered I'd forgotten to take my medication and I knew I was going to have to let him know that we needed to go back to the housing area before we went on to our recreation.  He claims that because I waited to do that at our closing meeting with just the people in our mission group, because I did it publicly and said that I needed to go back and I, I had forgotten my medication, that if I didn't have it at least by lunch time, I would be dead by evening.  He says that was confrontational, that I should have done it in private.  I don't know when I would have had a chance because of the schedule and the fact that he was very scarce, um, during the Vacation Bible School because he was a float.  I don't know when I would have time to pull him aside and tell him that.  I didn't see it as confrontational at the time.  I just felt that it was in need that I needed to make him aware of before we proceeded out the door.  Um, I was in a lot of pain because it was rigorous trip as far as I was concerned.  We were on the go all the time.  We didn't get to bed until ten, eleven o'clock at night.  We had to be up and out of there by seven thirty in the morning.  Um, and I told him, I said, I did not forget to do this on purpose.  And it was not intended to be a confrontation with you.  He claims that when I got back into the van after that incident in front of the group where he nearly lost his temper about me forgetting my meds, that I said something about his personality type being an A personality type.  I do not even remember what I said.  I was not allowed to know who my accusers were and what they said that I said second hand.  And I felt like he was holding a kangaroo court, that he was both the judge, the jury and the prosecution and that I had been called in to be barred from all missions regardless of what my voice was.  Regardless of what I had to say.  I know now that I will never, ever go to another meeting with another pastor unless I have somebody with me.  I was in tears during most of the meeting.  I cried most of the way home.  I felt like my world was shrinking was again.  He said I couldn't keep up because of the fibromyalgia.  He didn't know much about fibromyalgia, but he felt like I wasn't an acceptable member of a mission team because of it.  And then, if my medication was that important, and that if I forgot it because of the fibromyalgia does tend to make you forgetful, that I shouldn't be allowed to go on any other trips.  I definitely wasn't allowed to go on international trips and I was pretty sure, he was pretty sure I wouldn't even ever be allowed to go on any stateside trips.  </p>

<p>The other thing that has happened is that my daughter has left the biological father of my grandson, [NAME OTHER].  She has moved in with the sister of the biological father who's been recently divorced.  She stays there through the week and goes to work and leave the child in daycare.  Previously when she was with the father, the other grandparents would care for [NAME OTHER] in their home.  As it stands now, she's with a man who's nearly twenty years older than her.  Has been divorced, who is of German nationality, who does not want to become an American citizen.  He drinks like a whale.  He smokes like a fiend.  He's polite enough, but I think that he tolerates the baby just so that he can enjoy the sexual intercourse he has with my daughter.  I think she's gone from the frying pan into the fire now because the other grandparents have basically cut off her from the family.  They didn't invite her to [NAME OTHER] birthday party at their house.  Um, they're not willing to watch the baby and she's starting to reach out to me as a result, which is good, I guess, but it's just a very strange to see her keep choosing poorly.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's a grown woman, you just have to, again, I understand what you're worried about, but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, my grandson, I know, my grandson's trying to emulate him as he chugs his bottles of beer, [NAME OTHER] would to grab for bottles of water and chug them and he would get choked.  You know, I don't want him to grow up with a man who drinks and smokes.  A man who is not attending church.  I, I pray constantly that my daughter will just turn back to the Lord.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's all you can do, just pray and not, try not to give your two cents worth because you're going to push her more towards him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just leave it alone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she called me a couple of days after I was down there to visit for his birthday, second birthday in May.  And she wanted to know what I thought of him and I said, well, it's not important what I think, it's important what you think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But she kept pressing me and wanted to know what I thought and I said, I'm not gonna answer that.  And she got angry and hung up the phone.  I asked for prayer in my Sunday School class for this situation.  And my class basically said that they would pray, but they could understand how I was discouraged.  I said, well, I wasn't discouraged so much, it wasn't out of discouragement that I asked for prayer because if I were discouraged to the point that they seem to think I was discouraged, I wouldn't have even asked for prayer.  I know they get tired of hearing about her, but she's the only family I have left.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So now, she's coming down.  Last time you told me that she had -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Written me off, well, I guess she knows how it feels to be written off now that [NAME OTHER] family has rejected her 'cause of her choice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She made a move or you called her?  What happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She called me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She wanted to know if I wanted to come down for the birthday and I said, well, I had a client that I was tutoring until twelve and I wouldn't be able to drive all the way to [DEIDENTIFIED] and drive back that night.  I needed to spend the night somewhere and could she please make some arrangements.  I ended up sleeping in the office at the house where her new boyfriend lives with a roommate.  Um, so that was okay.  Nice to have a place to stay.  And, uh, gave me a little more time with the baby.  He's so cute though.  He's walking now.  He says a few words.  His favorite word is, mine.  And he has the ability to use the fork and the spoon when he eats.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is he now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].  Drinks out of a cup.  He can get up and down the stairs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, they're twelve stairs on the back deck to go down to the backyard at the boyfriend's house so he can navigate himself.  He's trying to sing now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Aww.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, he's singing some songs he must've learned from his other grandma, I imagine.  Or at daycare, I don't know, but, and he's learning to count, but not in order.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh well, it doesn't matter.  To him, it's in order, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, we practiced counting as we walked up and down the stairs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about your medication?  Are you taking them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You still take tow Xanax?  How many do you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking one at night, but I'm finding that I'm having to take another half a tab in the middle of the night because I'm waking up between three and four in the morning.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  I've consistently done that for the past week.  Last week was probably one the hardest weeks I had in terms of fibromyalgia, which was I had made the trip to [DEIDENTIFIED] and Monday morning I knew I was not gonna feel good.  And then I had another bad day Wednesday morning and another bad day Saturday morning where I wake up in the morning and I just ache all over and I feel so tired that I can just barely move.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you do take Cymbalta, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 90 mg or 30?  Just one, right?  You just take one of the 30 mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  At night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So one Xanax and one Cymbalta.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Do you think I need to change that to two Xanax?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or either that or maybe we need to go up on your Cymbalta to 60 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> See if that will help this depression and the crying and the pain and all that you're having.  What are the other medication, you don't take Wellbutrin, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you take for your pains and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take Ultracet, which is a combination of acetaminophen and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many do you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take two in the morning and two at night.  And I think you have those dosages, if you don't, I've got them here in my purse.  Let's see what has changed.  Cymbalta 30 mg, um, occasionally I put on Lidocaine patches because I just ache.  I have had increased pain in my feet so I had to be careful about wearing shoes all the time, not going barefoot and getting arch support.  I feel like they say, they say it's probably plantar fasciitis, but I think it's just fibromyalgia in my feet now.  Um, Ultracet which is the acetaminophen and Tramadol, Hydrochloride, 37.5 mg of the Tramadol Hydrochloride with 325 mg of acetaminophen, two in the morning, two at night.  Still taking the 4 mg of Tizanidine Hydrochloride at night.  My allergies are bothering me, um, I think I'm gonna have to switch my allergy medicine from Allegra next time I see my general practitioner.  Taking my Neurontin twice a day 100 mg, testosterone 1 mg twice a day.  I've been on Fluorouracil cream off and on this spring to, uh, treat for actinic keratosis.  There's a history of skin cancer from my father.  And I have sun damaged skin so I've been taking some treatments for that.  Also my Zocor 40 mg once a day.  Lisinopril for blood pressure 10 mg once a day, saline nasal spray for allergies, Fosamax once a month 70 mg and of course, the Xanax 1 mg at night, which I really think I need to take more that one.  I need to take one and a half or two now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That'll be fine.  We can do that for a while.  That will be okay.  In fact, last time I gave you two.  Do you remember?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did.  I have about 15 tabs left so I need to get a script.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can use that extra if you want.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I need to get enough so that I have some left over before I see you again because it takes them about two to two and a half weeks to process mail in scripts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mean the Cymbalta?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anything that I take, I have to</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't take Xanax for ninety days.  They give you ninety day supply of Xanax?  They don't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you give me one month supply for two tabs a night, I usually can get through the thirty days even if I have to take a little extra.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's how I did last time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think that's what you did, which was good because I have enough that if you write a script today I have a chance to get it.  </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: One thing that I've kind of noticed this week is that I feel kind of disconnected from—normally I would think of it as kind of feeling not in my body, except I'm very conscious of my body and things. I feel disconnected from how I'm feeling. When we've been talking it sort of feels like, not like I'm talking about someone else, but that there's a filter or a foggy window or something. [00:01:13] I thought it would go away but it hasn't and it was very frustrating. I was kind of thinking maybe it was just from calling my mom—like disassociate a little bit—or the election; but all of those things are over. Tonight it was weird. I kind of felt neutral about it. I kind of didn't get too into it until 8:00 or whatever. I just wasn't very engaged. I wasn't paying attention. I did have a brief freak-out when I called her about it but, other than that, I was just "mehh". I woke up this morning feeling very much like I wasn't sure if that all happened. I didn't feel connected to it. [00:02:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The election stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything that happened. The election stuff, yes; but I also felt like I didn't feel very connected to anything, like to what had happened this week. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you starting to think it does relate to what we've been talking about or have you been feeling it more so in here or are you saying it's kind of global?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's global.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And surprisingly doesn't seem as contingent on calling mom or election stuff as you might have guessed or thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which leaves us to wonder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. It's very much variable. It makes sense that it would be connected to my mom or connected to the election, but I'm out of dramatic events happening. This morning I went to see the specialist I'm seeing for my hip pain. She came in and sat down and she's like, "Okay, so you're ready for the trigger-point injections?" which she hadn't mentioned before. I don't like needles. I mean, no one likes needles, I don't like getting shots, but I had no emotion about it. I was just like, "Oh, I didn't expect that." I didn't feel nervous or worried or upset or anxious, I just felt like it was happening to someone else almost. (pause) [00:04:55] I don't know. It's definitely I don't find it incredible. Yes, it's totally snowing. No, no, no. It started around 2:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank God for my powers of observation. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was at a friend's house and we were kind of like, "It's raining." Then we went outside and we went, "It's snow." I wasn't happy about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Keep talking. What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About what I'm feeling? Stuff?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any other thoughts that come into your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other thing I was thinking about was that I work outside a library class and she's making us work in groups; but she had made us work in groups for all our previous assignments because she thought it would be helpful. And it's honestly only helpful if you live on campus or are a full-time student. If you're only on campus one day a week it's really irritating. So we had an extension on it because half the class was having a melt-down about it. Two people said they were in tears about what was going on in the assignment, so we had an exception. I haven't started it. I kept putting it out and I'm working with other people so usually that will get me to work on something if I don't want to screw over the other people I'm working with. [00:07:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not this time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Again, I just don't feel urgency or immediacy. I'm like, "Ehh. There's a homework assignment due." The thing is actually due next week. But I'm just kind of like, "Ehh. That's happening." I was going to work on it tonight but now they need me over at the school early. I'm going to sit in the library so I have less of an excuse to not work on it. I can procrastinate about homework like nobody's business, but usually I'm aware of that procrastination. (laughs) [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really unpleasant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just like, "Oh. I don't want to do this. I don't know what to do." I'm just thinking about it and all the reasons why I can't do that because I have to mow the lawn. And I'm not really thinking about it. I was thinking about it last night mostly because a friend on Facebook said that she was having a hard time working on her homework since the election. I was like, "Oh, yeah. I have homework that I should be doing." Some of it is the reason that she wants us to work in groups is that the exception is none of us has ever done anything like it before—and I have, so I'm kind of like "Mmm." [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:57) assignment at work. Give it to someone else to work on this. That's weird. It's also like class 1:00—4:00 and then I have physical therapy until 7:30. I thought just because that was the only time I worked that hadn't stressed me out yet. I kind of realized that there are only two busses I can get home on, blah, blah, blah. I could take a cab. Today I went over to visit a friend of mine, Jersey. She has a prosthetic leg. She's not been wearing her leg and has only been in her wheelchair, so it's very hard for her to leave the house for the last week and a half. [00:10:14] I figured she was at home and I'd go over and hang out talking to her. I felt like pretty much into her and the conversation we were having, but still felt a little distracted. I enjoyed visiting her a lot. I always like seeing her, but this time I was also feeling like I wanted to go home and take a nap. "I really want to ride home because it just started raining and I don't want to take two busses and walk." Blah, blah, blah. The last half-hour of the visit I was just thinking and counting down wondering if she'd actually give me a ride so I could just get home and do whatever for a little bit. I was tired and I did take a 45-minute nap, but I didn't feel sleepy. I more just felt like I wanted to lie down for a little while, if that makes sense. [00:11:42] It wasn't like I wanted to fall asleep, it was that I wanted to not be doing anything. I didn't want to read or watch TV. (pause) [00:12:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things in the back of your mind now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. I was thinking about what to make for dinner a little bit, because it's cold. Then I need to do the physical therapy exercises today, but that's kind of about it. The other thing I was thinking about was when I first got over to Jersey's and was talking to her, I was talking about the trouble the STI/STD class—how intense it is. It was a class about STDs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: STDs and sexually transmitted diseases?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It was really terrible. I was telling her about it but I also felt a little like I couldn't even joke a little bit, like I was over talking about it even though we were busily mocking it. The reason why it was so terrible is that it is something relatively new to the area, someone who Paige who has been looking and talking to grants groups to teach classes about STDs. She perched SMOB. She perched I think all the local groups. My friend and I were like, "Let's go." She's $25 per person for the class. Let's see what she's like as a [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:46). [I hope I have the time for] (ph) my two STD classes. But, whatever. The setup was crappy. It was at her house, which was a coop and people were still eating at the shared coop brunch/breakfast when we got there, which was confusing because I didn't know who were residents, who were people attending a class, if we were supposed to eat some of this food, like what was going on. They didn't really have seating. It was weird. It was one of those moments when she started rattling off her credentials. She was rattling off a bunch of medical procedures, among other things. She was like, "Oh, I've done this and I've done cardio and I've done pap smears and I've done HIV testing," blah, blah, blah. [00:15:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Meaning she has done those to other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked for clarity. I was like, "That's a lot of things that you've done." She really read off like 15 things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she a nurse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that was what I was thinking because I was wondering, "Were you present? Were you arranging it? Did you do that?" and she said no that she had performed paps and had done HIV tests. There is one type of HIV test you swab so anyone can swab. I just felt pretty sure you'd be a nurse or some other person like that, in which case you probably wouldn't be out of a job right now. Also what is your medical background? She said she's worked for the State of Michigan, she's worked for Maine but, again, it was kind of unclear like, "Are you a counselor? Are you an educator? What are we doing?" She started talking about herpes one and two like, "Herpes one is really common. It's a cold sore. Most people have it." I'm like, "Yes, okay. I'm with you on this." And then she was saying the State is stupid to try to not get Herpes one because everyone has cold sores and you can just get a cold sore. Blah, blah, blah. I'm like, "I don't really agree. I'm not super concerned about it either, but it's a thing that you try to avoid." [00:17:52] The next sentence was, "The medical community isn't concerned about herpes, therefore none of us should be concerned about herpes one or two. Besides, they are both really common so there's no way to avoid getting one or two, so you might as well just accept that," which I definitely talk with people who are already paying for themselves that they're both really common. They're both really easy to transmit. Most people don't know if they have HSV two or one. I'm not concerned about it, which is fine for an individual to be saying that, but for an educator just a blanket statement, she didn't qualify it at all. She said it was the same as getting a cold and it's not. Then she was explaining that she doesn't tell people that she has HSV one but that she has cold sores because they freak out if she says she has herpes. I'm like, "Well, okay, but you should maybe tell [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:10) that's misinformation." At the rate she was talking she made it sound as if, "You know if you don't want to get HSV two, you just have to wrap yourself in plastic and never make out with anyone ever again." [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:31) I kind of pushed back and she, again, was like, "No. It's just things." I then went on to ask her about transmission rates because the way she was speaking, it sounded like if you make out with someone who has HSV one or two, that just happens instantly. She wouldn't answer my question. She had this long like, "Medical studies are corrupt and people always lie about their sex lives," and on and on. I'm just like, "Great. Okay, but I'm sure someone has some statistics somewhere." She went on about it some more. What she was saying is that she doesn't feel that the studies actually have accurate information because people tend to lie about their sexual behavior which—sure—but they can say that much more concisely and there are still the statistics. [00:20:38] There is still information even if you think it's flawed. She spent 45 minutes talking about herpes and her end game was that it's just like having a cold, like if you have a cold you don't really know that you're infectious. Her point was about shedding (ph) like whether or not you're having an active outbreak. She was like, "Well, you don't really know necessarily like when you have a cold you are contagious for two days before. You don't really know and maybe you go to some party and then you're like, 'Oh, shit. I have a cold,' and half the party caught a cold." I was like, "Yes, but, your herpes is for life. A cold is not." She was like, "Yeah, but [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:30) unless you're immune suppressed or pregnant." Even if that were true, you can become immune suppressed at any time in your life and pregnancy happens. I think her class was supposed to be geared towards kinky people, towards queer people, towards [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:54) people. One of the things I was asking about was, "This is not a typical population so, even if you're telling me the medical community in general isn't concerned about the average person's exposure to herpes, no one here has an average sex life." Stuff like gay men are having crazy syphilis outbreaks that no one else is having, so gay men need to be more aware of that. Blah, blah, blah. It was great. The friend that came late ended up passing me a note saying, "Do you want to leave early and get pedicures?" [00:22:40] And we did, (laughs) which probably was [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:46). The class was such a shit show and I just had this sort of feeling of, "I really hope everyone else in this room already knows something about STDs because, Jesus Christ." Also she was giving this little STD pack to take home which had three condoms, as always, and a pamphlet from the government about BSM and safer sex. It was a really nice pamphlet and there was an unlabeled baggie with some wipes in it. I was like, "What is this?" She explained that they were antimicrobial wipes. I'm like, "That you grabbed out of a big container and shoved in a baggie?" That's disgusting. I don't want your creepy, used . . ." I don't know. She was just like, "Yeah, you can just take this and disinfect things with them—your choice." So that was probably the most (chuckles) engaged and involved thing I was in really, and that was mostly because I was just like why are you telling me and all these people this information, which is crap and why did I pay money for it? [00:24:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thought I have is that sounds almost like something that would happen at work. (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which otherwise—not this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is great. The other thing was that on Wednesday or Thursday Chet sent an e-mail to me and copied Harry saying, "Some professor wants to do some live streaming of election coverage and show students how to capture video and everything. Are either of you available?" I was like, "Well, Chet, I'm not going to be at work. I'm on disability." I was both pissed and kind of amazed/impressed. He has two full-time employees and . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of them is out for six weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he'd been flipping out about it. We talked about it the day before and he couldn't remember that. I was like (sigh). Part of me didn't feel mad as much as resigned. I'm like, "Well, he's a sucky manager. Here's another example of that. Wow." (pause) [00:26:32] But, yeah, the class did have that alternate reality that you can't argue with, except that the educator was really good at using language to make it seem like she was listening. Like, "I really [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:55) on that question." All of that. That's nice, at least. It's nice to hear some "I" statements and whatever because my workplace doesn't do that. She also was using them to appear like she was listening to my critique a lot more than she was. I was like, "That's annoying, but I don't really care in the end because I don't have to deal with you. You're never going to speak at anything that I'm going to, probably. Somehow I doubt you're going to speak for any other group. P.S. you can get people to do this class for free and there are people in the area who will do it for money a lot better and have nice hand-outs and seating. She made sock puppets, HSV one and HSV two; but it didn't seem like the socks had been necessarily clean when she made them into sock puppets, which was also revolting. And the pamphlet from . . . [00:28:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:20), isn't it? Like, "Ehh. HSV one and two don't really matter. Washing my socks doesn't really matter. (chuckles) Handing out wipes this way doesn't really matter." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Also the pamphlets from the government—the pages stuck together at two points and I'm confident that it's just my stirrer or whatever, but in that context I'm like, "This is so disgusting."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You know what? A pamphlet about STDs isn't handed out with pages stuck together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. You would have been better to throw those out because it's revolting. Also there's something about people casually eating on the floor that's just—I just felt like it was so very unsanitary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It felt gross.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much. And the seating was very uncomfortable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet—I was there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:29:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For 40 minutes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That and it sort of engaged you more than most things this week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Because I have a lot of feelings about the topic. Theoretically, I don't think the idea of [harmoduction] (ph) when it comes to STDs is really interesting and amazing, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [harmoduction] (ph) So like Australia, one of their STD programs is basically like okay teenagers, you're going to have unprotected sex because you're teenagers, so oral sex is way less risky than vaginal sex. They've managed to reduce their STD transmission rate, especially for HIV by just [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:23) engage in unprotected oral sex. I'm like, "That's awesome. You shouldn't have unprotected oral sex." In theory it's amazing; in practice I'm just like, "Don't do that. God." Arggh. [00:30:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of what's interesting about it is that even though it's in a sense not the best advice, maybe it kind of is the best advice and it would be hard to get a reduction in the transmission rates that big from any other means—not so big that it's sort of ambiguous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really like the idea of meeting people where they are and recognizing they're just not going to do that. [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:10) exchanges or encouraging people to have unprotected anal sex to use more lube so it's less likely to have tears by fingers—these are all amazing programs that I just have a really hard time with engaging in. With friends of mine who have unprotected oral sex I'm always like, "Oh. That's a little—that's kind of risky. Maybe you shouldn't. You're an adult and it's less risky than other things than you could be doing." Arggh. I always feel I don't want to be judgmental, but I am a little bit. I am glad they're having unprotected oral sex than unprotected anal sex. Arggh. So, yes. [00:32:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So your theory about why this engages you is because it's about sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's about something I've thought about and am super conflicted on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. My theory was more that there's something (laughs) about the way that it was ridiculous and annoys you, as work often is/does. That's sort of the most striking thing about the speaking thing to me is the amount of work where that stuff happens all the time; and so this week you're feeling distant, but the one time there's something like work, you're kind of into it—not into it, but engaged. You know it sticks together conceptually for me. Maybe that doesn't seem right. I'm not trying to argue for it, I'm just trying to clear up what I think. [00:33:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it does. And it pretty rapidly became to me asking her questions wasn't going to get me anywhere; and yet I was like, "Well, but . . . stuff," and [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:51), which I think is pretty much a work pattern. I just like asking questions that are really dumb; trying to pursue things I'm pretty sure will not work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Which gets them mad at you for a couple of reasons. One is because it's sort of more therapeutic than not saying things that you know are right because you know it would be really frustrating later to not have said that, I think—so you don't have to feel shut down by the situation. Also I think there's a bit of satisfaction in continuing to demonstrate how ridiculous whoever it is, is being, which I think you feel entitled to because of how ridiculous they're being and how crummy to you. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also there are situations where I've been to a lot of classes about sex where I disagree with everything that's happening here, but I just kind of disagree. I don't think this person is saying anything that is insane—not insane—dangerous, if that makes sense. When she went on about herpes I was just like, "You're really encouraging people to not be concerned about it; and you're kind of encouraging people to not be fully honest with their partners or to pressure people into not using barriers." [00:35:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. She's acknowledging being deceptive herself—intentionally deceptive—right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and seemed completely like she was that advocating people do that. To me, that is way more troubling than if it were a boring class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If she had said, "I'm personally not concerned about it," I would be like, "All right. You don't have to be personally concerned about it"—but to say it for everyone? (pause) The other thing that is also somehow related is that I was thinking about travel. One of the things I always find very frustrating is when someone takes a devil's advocate position or their arguing position isn't really agreeing out of principle or—I don't even know—mostly devil's advocate. I find it super annoying for a variety of reasons, but also there is almost never a time when the devil's advocate position needs to be made. What I'm thinking about is someone talking about a personal situation and the other person is like, "Well, let me just take the devil's advocate position and what if . . . " forty bazillion things. I'm like, "Well, okay. Sure. I guess this person could have suffered amnesia, but I'm not really sure that's relevant." Like they take sort of a "what if everything he said was wrong" position. (both laugh) You know . . . I'm like, "Hmmm." [00:38:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The sky wasn't blue and the earth wasn't round and we weren't orbiting the sun . . . And then, what about if that . . . Like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yes. I feel like I don't know why you did that. I don't think it's interesting. It's not helpful, and I feel like they're telling me that I'm a crazy person. I've been thinking about it, in part, because of everyone talking about politics a lot and also my position I have with my friend, Zoe, where—I don't know what I called her about, but it was something I was upset about. She actually said she was going to take the devil's advocate position and I was like, "What?" Part of me thought it was basically like, "What if you're wrong about everything?" I was pissed; in part because she seemed to . . . "Well what if you're just wrong?" Also I was really upset and she didn't seem to be taking that seriously. [00:39:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, especially the part about what was upsetting. If you'd been talking about something unusual, but not in the same way as you telling her you were upset about something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also feel like in political arguments, usually the person playing devil's advocate is in the position of power and they're trying to be like, "Well, but the devil's advocate position—what if it's just awesome to most people or what if you just don't get rights or what if . . . " I can't think of a good example, but like advocating for gay marriage—"The devil's advocate position . . . " blah, blah, blah. "What is the benefit to society of this?" I don't really care. I've already thought of that and you seem to be acting the role of an asshole in this discussion and you acting as if you are an asshole versus you being an asshole are pretty much the same thing at that point, so I feel okay. (both laugh) I never do that. I know some people love doing that and it almost always pisses me off. [00:41:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a kind of obnoxious way of negating what you have to say or where you're coming from, which I think most people don't like but you also have, unfortunately, a lot of experience with at various periods of your life. I'm not trying to say that, therefore, it's kind of illogical that you don't like people being the devil's advocate, I'm just saying I think it's something that may have a little more charge for you because of how the past was for you. [00:42:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess there are a lot of arrogant people at the university and some of them really love to argue and hear themselves talk. Some of the things I've heard as a student, I've heard around me at work at the school a bazillion times, and it just strikes me as kind of mean. I feel like the person who is taking the devil's advocate position doesn't acknowledge that their argument might—they aren't taking it personally so they didn't do this like a personal position. The person they're talking to might be taking this issue personally. Also they kind of act as though there's something wrong with you for having emotions regarding whatever issue. [00:43:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The implication is that, "Well, if we look at this objectively, you emotional, hysterical, crazy person, and we consider the other point of view that there is no legitimacy to what you're saying, then we reach a very different conclusion." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like guys opinions on abortion. (sniggers) I don't really care. I'm speaking more about men who postulating about women's health. [I'm like honestly, I've actually done that, because you're not having a baby, so fuck off.] (ph) I was talking to several friends of mine who were unable to vote because of various like if [you're a person with syphilis] (ph) it really fucking sucks to vote even if, in theory, it's all [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:44) [ ], it's not. And if you're trans-gender, it can be all but impossible. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's uncomfortable if they don't understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even if you don't have to present a . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still have to have something in your name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To say your name and something in your name, usually a utility bill or whatever, and someone disagrees with your name . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's got to be a lot of fun to be in front of a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. I'm not sure what else to say about the sort of dissociative sort of thing, but let's keep an eye on it until we understand what that is and [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:41).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be nice, kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Until Monday.</p>

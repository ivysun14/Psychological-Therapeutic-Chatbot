<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I'm thinking about a couple of contrasts to our, I don't know, I mean, this one just was on my mind because MLWZ told me today that he was taking a vacation now.  And uhm, and on the one hand, I suppose I feel sorry, you know, as, as you do with any good-by.  But in a way, I'm kind of relieved.  Because it makes the last day easier.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then I was thinking, well, this was not that difficult.  Mm, you know, I hadn't anticipated going through it, I suppose.  So I didn't work up any thought about how it would be.  But then when I think of how I still have trouble imagining, uhm, next Friday, you know, in contrast to this.  I don't know, and I was just remembering that that was particularly on my mind, uhm, either last night or the night before.  You know, just feeling I can't imagine it.</p>

<p>But I hadn't really been thinking about that today.  I was thinking about some other things that uhm, well I've just had, I haven't been certain that I, you know, can under—, real—, can really understand them.  Or uhm, I don't know, I still, I don't know where to begin with it.  Uhm, because I know when I left here, I still felt as if I either, I was working out a solution for myself to what I was talking about yesterday and the day before.  Or else I was tricking myself somehow, and I, I couldn't be sure.  But it just seemed to me there were certain things that are necessary for me to do.  And once done, it seemed to me that I would be free of this kind of thing.</p>

<p>But then I thought, well even if I just do them, maybe that's a way to trick myself into thinking I'll be free, and I won't be, just the fact I have to even need to do them.  And I don't know, uhm, (Sigh) what I was doing today, it seemed to me there was a clear line between things that I saved that were ridiculous, and things that were helpful to me for planning nex—, you know, the beginning part of next year, that has to be planned before I go back.  And uh, anyway, so I feel as if well, I have something that I can live with worked out.  But then I'm very afraid that I'm, you know, still clinging to, looking for something, and that that's my way to pretend to myself that I'm really not.  A, and I'm, I don't know, I'm just not sure.</p>

<p>I had a dream last night that, (Sigh) or this morning, that uhm, makes me wonder, you know, again.  Because it wasn't a particularly upsetting dream, but I just had the feeling it was going on and on and on and on.  I was very, you know, it was kind of, one of those things where uhm, I don't know, at some point I woke up because the alarm went off.  And either I'd been dreaming, and then the dream changed after I went to sleep again.  Or else, I started dreaming then.  But I was aware of dreaming while I was dreaming, and, and I thought I'd remember, and, you know, I don't really remember that much about it.</p>

<p>But uhm, I was at some, something that I guess I was thinking of as a camp.  And I was an adult with responsibilities, there must have been, you know, it was almost as if I was in the position that I am in, in my family.  You know, with a child and a husband.  But uhm, (Sigh) it was also as if I were a child, and I had to fulfill certain expectations, or obligations, that some other adult had who was in a higher position than I was, or somehow had authority over me.</p>

<p>So there was this, you know, double thing going.  I was filling somebody else's expectations, who was higher in command.  And uh, then I was holding my own expectations, and I don't know whether it was, you know, over taking care of FSO, or just what.  But uhm, i—, there was some kind of a strain, or conflict, or something.  You know, it was kind of like fulfilling the other obligations could take all the time, so I was trying to find time to do my own thing.</p>

<p>And of course, you know, this is just (Sigh) the kind of thing I guess I've been feeling lately, with these things that I've saved.  Uh, you know, take care of something that has been a need for me, and a necessity.  And, you know, I'm not so sure any longer, what of it is a necessity.  And uhm, you know, the feeling I want to find time to do what I want to do, and not being completely certain of what I want to do.  But it's harder for me to know when I'm, you know, doing this other stuff.</p>

<p>And, and then later, when I was trying to remember the dream again, I thought of it as, well no, I think maybe, this was the second part.  I, I don't know, because the details have really gotten vague.  But I don't know, at some point I remembered it a, as a search, I was searching for something.  And again, you know, that would fit right in.  So I don't know whether uhm, (Sigh) it's all tied in with a—, what I've been talking about.</p>

<p>But uhm, then there was something else that I haven't quite figured out.  Uhm, because MSCZ and I went to see "Chinatown" last night.  And before that we'd met to eat at a place that's just opened, fairly near the theatre.  And it turned out we were a bit apprehensive whether or not it would be what we wanted.  But it turned out to be, you know, precisely the kind of meal we wanted, and very good.  And we were very, you know, feeling very good after having had the meal.</p>

<p>Then we went on to the movie, and most of the movie was very good.  I uhm, found the very ending extremely upsetting.  And I kept thinking, well, what did I find upsetting about it?  Uhm, because I had sort of been, you know, kno—, having read a review that said some things, didn't give away the ending, but said some things, said enough so I should have suspected it would happen.  But I guess somehow I had just not really thought it would.  Because a woman is killed in the end, that uhm, the male lead character is attached to, in a way, and I think, I don't know how anybody else felt, but I felt I wanted her to have success in her attempt to do wha—, what she was trying to do in the movie.</p>

<p>And, but uhm, (Sigh) and, and it was kind of gory.  But I don't think that bothered me, I think it was mainly that it represented, I don't now, it was just the way the whole thing was in the end.  It was just sort of, there was no justice.  And uh, you know, just this sort of total lack of, absolutely no justice, I think I found very disturbing.</p>

<p>And then I thought, well there was something else that I could have found very disturbing, and I didn't think I did at the time.  Uhm, and it was a surprise to me.  No review I'd read had mentioned this.  But uhm, it turned out that this woman had had a child by her father.  And the main whole thing of the movie was that the father was trying to get this daughter, and he and this other daughter had nothing to do with each other.  And this woman, who had not seen her daughter for years, her husband had been taking care of the daughter, in a separate establishment, uhm, had decided she'd wanted to see her, and be with her.  And her husband was killed, and you know, so forth.</p>

<p>But anyhow, i, it finally developed that the whole thing was the woman trying to get away with her daughter, and then c—, you know, the father of both was, among many other things, there was a whole political thing involved, trying to get this daughter.  And uhm, so when she was killed, she was killed partly because he'd paid off the police.  And even though he was guilty of murdering her husband, uhm, the police still would not have ever touched him.</p>

<p>And the last scene is of his, you know, the dead woman, and then of his taking this child, who, I mean, she's a teenager, out of the car.  And uh, I found that, you know, I don't know which I found more disturbing.  That this woman had not succeeded in what she was trying to do, uhm, or you know, seeing this man, uhm, (Sigh) you know, getting to the daughter, who was distraught.  And then also, you know, what I'm wondering, is just the fact that it was incetuous (Sic) si—, incestuous situation.  Uhm, you know, one that I have imagined, but never thought, you know, imagined thinking I'm not imagining it, couldn't be.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know.  A, and I don't know i—, MSCZ was upset at the ending, anyhow, so it, (Sigh) you know, it was an upsetting ending to both of us, and I think it would have been, no matter what else I, you know, feelings I was bringing to it.  And that's one reason why I find it hard to separate it out.  But I was just keyed up after that.</p>

<p>And then uhm, when we were going home, I hadn't known that the 4 last cars on the trains would be closed, so when it hap—, we had, took 2 trains home, and it happened on the first one, you know, I just thought, oh, there's something wrong.  And then, when it happened, the second one, and I noticed that there were a lot of transit police around, uhm, you know I really got this eerie feeling.</p>

<p>And it, and I think I would have put two and two together right away, or not, I mean, I understood pretty quickly what must be going on.  But (Sigh) I was in some kind of a mood after this movie, and so I really began to feel nothing could be trusted, nobody could be trusted, and that I was in the middle of a situation that was about to explode and, I don't know, I just felt really nerved up.  And uh, there was nothing, you know, about anything that happened on the trains, or anything else to make you feel nervy.</p>

<p>And then when we got home, uh, a woman, older woman in our building was crossing the street, just as we were.  And she's very slow and had been hit by a taxi about a year or two ago, while crossing the street.  So I sort of walked with her, because it was just the kind of situation where she could be hit, when she was not going to make it with the light.  And uh, I thought two of us would be easier to see, than one.  Or I don't know quite why I stopped.  I just felt I should stop and go with her.</p>

<p>And, so anyway, on the other side of the street we started talking, and she was mentioning — oh I know, our door was locked, and it was not that late.  (Clears throat) Usually it's not locked until 12:00 — so she was telling us why, and apparently recently, somebody was followed into the building and robbed.  It must have been a time when the doorman wasn't right there.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Sigh) so I, I, I don't know, it just, you know, that was just one more thing that added to it.  And I felt really nervy and jumpy when, by the time we got upstairs.  And then I was greeted with a message that MME YMP had called.  And uh, I just felt, I can't handle that.  I'm not ready, I hadn't thought he'd be calling.  I, I can't talk to him yet.  I know what I'll do if I talk to him.  And I'll just do whatever I did last spring when I, you know, sort of fell apart, in my eyes fell apart.  And uhm, I couldn't understand, you know, I really didn't know why he'd be calling.  And I was afraid I wouldn't find out why, that I'd somehow jump in and uh, you know, become nervous and silly, and think he had expectations that he might very well not have.  And I don't know, anyway that really upset me.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then when we got into bed, MSCZ wanted to make love, and I just felt, I cannot do it.  That I knew if I made love with him, I would just lie there, mainly thinking about all these different things, and I'd become more and more upset.  Uhm, and, you know, I didn't know whether I, I had, previously to seeing this movie, or I don't know just when, but you know, thinking, well, I was beginning to feel I could handle things next fall, uh, you know, handle myself, mainly, in a way that I'd want.  And therefore, relate with MME in a way that seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Uhm, so that it was a contrast to suddenly feel this way, when he called.  Uhm, and I didn't know whether that j—, you know, that was just sort of a final thing, or whether that finally threw me into the state I was in last night, when we got into bed.  Or whether, it was to do with the movie.  I don't think the other things really did any more than add to it.</p>

<p>But uhm, and I don't know, I tried, you know, sort of willing myself out of it, and it didn't do any good.  I just felt, I have to, you know, i, in a sense, be alone and not think at all.  Uhm, and I just had the feeling, if I agree to (Sigh) make love with MSCZ, then I'll ha—, you know, I'll be there (Laughs) thinking, uhm, just what I don't want to do.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess then I was just thinking, but today, uhm, I didn't feel so disturbed, and I don't know what's left over, and I don't know whether I'm still deluding myself about these things that I've saved that I'm trying to get rid of, one way or the other.  And uhm, and then I was thinking that, I met, well, we were in the playground, FSO and FYHZ and I.  And then FEN appeared with FRL.  And uhm, she told me something that, you know, maybe I would have gotten upset at before.  But I didn't, I don't know whether I had expected it, so I didn't, or what.</p>

<p>But since the 2 girls will be separated next year, uhm, there had been some question over, you know, the school lets you put in a request on what room you'd like your child to be in.  And it may not be met, but uhm, Miss XTC tries to, whenever she can.  So, I was pretty sure FEN would make a request, and I was pretty sure that it could really mess thi—, you know, it could be an awkward situation if we both requested the same thing.  And MSCZ had said he thought I shouldn't request anything.  But there was — I'm sure I probably mentioned this — there was one day when I was going to be up there, anyway, that I thought, well I'd visit.  And uh, oh, in fact, Miss XTC had even said to me, "If you want to make a request, you should do it soon."</p>

<p>Uhm, so I visited both classes, and there are things I liked and didn't like in both.  And there were changes that were going to be occurring in both, and I didn't know what the end result would be, in either.  So uhm, you know, I really felt, well I wouldn't know what I was requesting.  And it was easier not to than it might have been otherwise.</p>

<p>And, then today, FEN told me that she had made the request that I had anticipated she would.  And uh, it was the, if I had made any request, it would have been the one I would have made, just because it's more of a known situation.  Uhm, there'll be less change in that room.</p>

<p>And uhm, but on the other hand, there were certain things that I really didn't, you know, I wasn't there long enough.  It was the room I saw the least of, and I know it's the one that all the mothers that I know, are requesting, which I suppose, has some influence on me.  And (Clears throat) but there were some things I wasn't sure whether I really did like what was going on.  And, you know, I was just as glad not to make a request.  But I suppose I was wondering if I would feel annoyed, if I found out that was the request that FEN made, uhm, because it makes it less a decision on the part of the director, who knows the children and the teachers, and, you know, the whole situation, better than I do.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, I, I, it seems like mostly though, it would be just that I had anticipated this, and it's happening.  And it just doesn't seem as if, you know, I really still don't know which I would.  I don't have any strong feelings either way, yet.  And uhm, so I'm not upset yet.  I don't know how I'll feel once the fall starts.  But (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and the other thi—, well, ah, I don't know, I was just thinking, well I don't even know why I thought of that, because it just doesn't seem like there's much to think about yet.  Until I know what situations really are.  And, and then I thought of, uhm, you know, just sort of generally, that I do feel as if I'm in the middle of something, that I'm not, that I am playing some kind of game with myself.  And uhm, well and then I thought of this feeling I also had when I found out MME had called.  He didn't want me to call him back, but he said he'd call me back before 4:30 today.  But he never did.  Or else he did after I had already taken the girls to the park.  But I was home for a good part of the day.</p>

<p>And uh, when, you know, I anticipated he'd be calling, my feeling was uh, oh I don—, I can't face it.  Why couldn't he just wait until — as it turned out, he did — until I've been here, and talked to you?  As if you would give me some secret strength.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was still, I was just thinking some more about what exactly got me upset last night.  Uhm, (Pause) and, you know, what kind of identification, I must have had a very strong identification with uh, the character Faye Dunaway plays.  Uhm, the mother of the girl, and the daughter of this man who's so powerful, behind the scenes.  And in the end, you know, I had such a strong feeling of, there's no justice, or there's no something, I don't know.  But in the end what it was, is the father being more powerful than the daughter.  Maybe could be, the man more powerful than the woman, I don't know.</p>

<p>But, you know, she had seemed to be so strong, in that she knew where she was going, she was attractive, she was wealthy.  You know, she had the other kinds of power that I've always thought, you know, it would be nice to have.  And uhm, but in the end, it wasn't good enough.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   She didn't have enough power.  What I notice is, that you mention a dream, but you haven't said a further word upon it.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uh, I don't know, I think I've had the feeling, since I, you know, was aware of having the dream, that it must, i—, you know, I felt it was very important to remember it, and I just, I kept sort of trying to think immediately after I woke up, well, what was happening in the dream?  And it wasn't even, you know, I was thinking, well maybe I should write it down, and then it wasn't even clear enough to me to write it down.  Uhm, but something was clear to me, you know, other than just knowing I'd had the dream.</p>

<p>And uhm, but yet it was kind of fuzzy, and there hadn't been a strong feeling of either happiness, or you know, anxiety, or terror, or anything.  It was just sort of, uhm, there'd been a conflict, and I think the feeling I'd had in the dream was, I have to just keep MSCZ, trying at it, and it will work out.  Uhm, and yet, you know, I can't quite remember the details in any kind of a way, so I don't know what to do with it.  And I g—, uhm,</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, what you don't do with it, is to uh, say anything about the main feature.  You were in a camp.  What does the camp mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You know, I didn't understand that.  Uhm, (Sniff) I mean, it just brought back memories of all the years I spent summers at camp, and uhm, you know, I was there, trapped, in a sense.  I felt I had to go.  After awhile I chose ones that I wanted to go to.  But still, there I was, you know, kind of trapped until I could get away again, and under somebody else's authority.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Pause) and I don't know, m,m, much more about what it's bringing back, except just that I was not happy at camp. Uhm, I think I might have been happy the first summer, I'm not sure.  But I know I wasn't happy any other summers that I went to that camp that I started with.  And then I changed to a camp that only I went to, and uhm, I was happier.  But I never really was happy.  It was just that it was better.  And I suppose it was also, it was my own.  Because by the time I stopped going to the first camp, everybody in my family was going to that first camp.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I don't know, you know, I, but then I was thinking, well I, each time I went to camp I was happier.  I was happier being a junior counselor — and I went to a different camp to do that — than I'd been at any of the previous ones.  And then uhm, I guess I didn't go to camp for a year or 2.  I don't, or maybe just the summer I went to PBV on the experiment.  And then I did go back as a full counselor, to another camp.  And that was okay, but I never went to camp after that.</p>

<p>And I, and I was just thinking, well I always felt that was something, you know, that that was my choice for the summer.  And it was not a choice that I really wanted to do.  But yet, it didn't seem like there were any other choices.  Until finally, I substituted, you know, first one summer, then eventually, uh, well I'm not sure every summer I did, but anyway, traveling in PBV.  Uhm, oh, I know what it was.  After being a junior counselor, my family went to PKD.  We all went to PKD together one summer.  And then, I went to camp again, and then I went to PBV.  And I think I must have gone to PBV every summer after that, until I went to PEC.  (Silence)</p>

<p>So then I think, well camp was, you know, meant to me that my parents didn't want me around.  And for 2 summers, I went to camp for just 1 month.  And then, came home, the last 2 summers that I went to the first camp that I had gone to.  You know, it was sort of, my mother, as I recall it, made quite a thing of being sure I understood that I was to expect nothing from my parents, you know, that I wasn't going to be entertained by them, in any way, and be taken anywhere, that I had to take care of myself.  I, I think that must be, or maybe not, I don't know.  At some point, I started taking piano lessons again.  Uhm, and I think it was one of those summers.</p>

<p>But in any case, you know, now I'm thinking of, when I think of how much I enjoy FSO, and how lately I found I can work things out that she'll leave me alone for awhile, and then we do something that's fun, together, how nice it is.  And you know, there was none of that with my mother or my parents.  Uhm, there was no, sort of, having outings or celebrations, or you know, actively taking pleasure in each other's company, or anything.  Except, I know I stayed home because I wanted to be with them.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, so it sort of sounds to me as though you are in all these ways expressing what you feel is your central dilemma, right now.  How are you going to be able to be an adult woman, enjoy it, and have a  husband, and a child.  Or, are you going to remain a lonely little girl who feels that only men have the important power in the world, and in the end that's the way it's going to be.  So, you feel frantic at the prospect of meeting MME.  You feel defeated by the story in the movie, because it just confirms your, what you feel you already know.  Men have what's important.  And in the end, they prevail.  So, it seems to me it's the same kind of conflict that we've been talking about that you're feeling and wondering about, which way is it going to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I don't know, I'm mainly just feeling anxious again.  (Laughs)  Uhm, but I was also just thinking of, you know — I was when you spoke — of you know, just how lonely I had felt at camp.  And how it just didn't seem like that was well, maybe, you know, a year or two of it would have been fine for me.  But I think I really feel it was wrong for me to have gone all those years.  Somehow, it just was not (Sigh) anything except an unhappy thing for me.  And, you know, after awhile I learned certain survival tricks, I suppose it could be.  But uhm, it was never something that was very good.  And I did feel lonely, and out of place, and you know.</p>

<p>Uhm, and that I didn't know myself for the world, you know, I was also thinking of some other things, how the couple of times I didn't spend summer at camp, or I didn't, or I was not traveling for part of the summer, and so I was home.  And I, how I'd find out all sorts of other things that were possible, that were just, you know, something I didn't know, just that you could be home.  And uhm, well, it was the summer I went to PEC I didn't go until late, and I was having a pretty good time at home until I did go, meeting new people, and going to parties, and just a totally new experience for me.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then I was thinking of at the end of the movie, the fact that one of the things that had upset me so, was the sight of the girl be—, who was in a distraught state, seeing her mother killed, and I guess she'd finally found out it was her mother.  And then the man that had taken care of her, I don't know what she thought his relationship was, but she'd already learned, let's say, the day before, that he'd been killed, or was dead.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then this man that her mother had been so frantic to keep away from her, was taking her out of the car.  And being very smooth, sort of in a very threatening kind of way.  I don't know exactly, it wasn't exactly lecherous, but uhm, well he was going to completely overwhelm her, was my feeling, I guess, that her feeling would be.  And, and I thought I was feeling much more upset over that aspect than would seem right, since we'd hardly seen this girl in the movie.  She'd figured in it in the plot, but, you know, you hadn't seen much of her.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Sigh) a, and so I s—, you know, I was feeling anxious, and I guess I'm just (Sigh) feeling what you said.  Uhm, and I, I think feeling anxious, because then I think, well if I know that much, then I can just, you know, I think my same old way.  And I don't know, I just don't trust this anymore.  But you know, kind of, get a handle on myself, get myself in control.  And, I mean, there are certain kinds of things I have to be able to control myself on, but uhm, but I don't feel confident, thinking in terms of getting myself in control.  Always seems like it's the wrong kind.  And you know, that I'll just sort of get myself really uptight, and w, withdrawn, and uhm, repressed.</p>

<p>And I don't know, and then I'm bothered because I don't know what these things that I'm going through at home, you know, exactly how they relate to this question that I have, because I know I do.  When I'd heard MME called, it was very clear I had that question.  And I, when I think of the dream again, it seems like it was very clear which wa—, I was being sort of pulled both ways, and which way would I go.  And I'd kept waking up before it was resolved.</p>

<p>Uhm, well then I think, well that's a new way to think about the search, meaning, you know, I thought, well, I remembered the dream as a search.  So then I thought, well, it must be connected with looking for a penis.  Well, uhm, I know I think of it in sort of different terms now, as could be just in connection with looking for myself, and feeling a strength that's just out of me being me.</p>

<p>Uhm, and I also, you know, I felt very divided on this.  In a way I was hoping that MME would call while I was in, because I wondered — I didn't know how I'd react — and I wondered how I would.  Uhm, you know, I could think of all sorts of things that I would do or not do.  But I didn't know what would happen when uhm, the call actually came.  (Sigh, Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and then I think, well I don't know the answer.  I don't feel as if I know the answer right now, and that scares me.  And then I think of, you know, again, how little time is left, and feeling the worst thing would be to go away scared.  But maybe I have to, I don't know.  I don't know, it may not be, when I say have to, I, I am thinking, maybe that's part of the separation, that you know, is just (Sigh) a part of it that cannot be changed.  And uhm — (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was sort of thinking about next year, and uh, you know, MME's calling again, and the feeling I have about — you know, sometimes I fluctuate now on my decision to clean the house, and how I find doing that, and you know, taking care of cooking, and the grocery shopping, and all the things that FTM did this year, uh, you know, and still do what I want to do in connection with school, and still handle myself I connection with, mainly MME.  And uhm, you know, just you know, I suppose it gets basically down to the conflict that you put in the other terms.</p>

<p>But uh, and then I just have this feeling, well, I am, I just feel the strong determination not to be the little girl, any longer.  But that doesn't mean that I have come to any kind of changed belief in where power lies, I don't know.  Uh, and then I think of these piles of things again, and am I, you know, still deluding myself, and having a feeling that well, I have to take care (laughs) of them in the way I have to take care of them.  But I'll take care of them.  Or, you know, whether that also means I'm still believing amy old belief in where the power lies.  Uhm — (pause)</p>

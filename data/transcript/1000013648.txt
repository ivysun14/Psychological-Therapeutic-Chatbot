<p>COUNSELOR: March 15th Interview 13. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still don't know where I'm going to be here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the end of the week. I think I've made up my mind. Yeah. I don't know. Friday I just thought that ... I was going from Saturday (inaudible) again. My parents called Sunday and they decided (inaudible) so. And today I feel like staying here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like every time you come to a decision you don't think (inaudible) your decision. You don't think of it as much as a decision and then you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's (inaudible). I don't really say anything because I really want to get out of New York. And I really - I really don't want to go - go back to my parents' house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well those are very separate things. Wanting to get out of New York the (inaudible). The only place you have to go to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible). Yeah like kind of like a difficult decision in a way. If there were other places to go, it would be - be a whole lot better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this brings up with (inaudible) like getting out of New York.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Talking to my father was like - I don't know. Not necessarily teasing me, he's not teasing me. He's trying - I like he's trying like hell to understand me. I don't know. And like he's like wishful thinking instead of just like being paranoid. (Inaudible). You know I'm sure. I don't know. Maybe it - if he is, it's good ... and it wouldn't be so bad going home ... but (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's hard to show up there free loading. I know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. The whole thing about going home is it goes back to what people (inaudible). There were all of us - all the people around on New Year's and (inaudible) and ...yeah, (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think it doesn't -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't (inaudible) people at all and ... I feel like this - you know therapy thing really. I sort of said something like that. Even my own mother. Like as a kid I use knock up against her and everything. Yeah, so (inaudible) pretty well at school and - I kind of - I kind of need - the (inaudible). On my - the last time I was home our next door neighbor remarked "I see your large haired son is back again" and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how do you react to all this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't react to any of the things like individually too badly but it just likes to (inaudible). I have a feeling I haven't been able to master them (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They see you (inaudible) like they see you very much and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you realize they never see me much. They don't usually because I'm (inaudible). And ... yeah, I don't know. I felt kind of a ... I get this poor attitude towards all of the neighbors like if I see them talking (inaudible) and turn around and walk away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you consider that a poor attitude in the sense that if you (inaudible), you should feel differently towards them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should ask them rather it's (inaudible) talk to them every week, but I don't know. I feel kind of some comfort to talk to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's awkward to because they're kind of looking at you (inaudible) things you're saying (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps. Yeah. It's sort of like I don't want to tell them - tell them choose (inaudible) how shitty I feel likes one of the things. And I don't really feel like - like lying to them because it's (inaudible) and I don't really feel like ... maybe (inaudible) the truth. Too bad if I wanted to (inaudible) you know by now you can sort of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) but at the same time you're still concerned about what impressions you're making on them and kind of having to balance out things to decide what is it you should be doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like thinking back (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and then some of the (inaudible) care about either. You know like ... you know if I put myself in an uncomfortable situation I really don't want to talk to them anyhow because they're not very interesting to me. (Inaudible) that - that in a way is like not - not too good of a feeling because I had a (inaudible) ... sort of like I'm being defensive all of the time. (Inaudible) well rather than just being myself and being - very pleasant in talking to them and worrying about they think or ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Watch your mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Why not just be myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're asking (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well being like ... the (inaudible) maybe. I don't know. If I accepted my parents then (inaudible). I tell them all these things that go on and if they can prove that I'm a lazy, ungrateful (inaudible) which is to say (inaudible) I'm afraid what everyone's going to think but I really don't consider myself that. You know the thing - the thing I was asked they were drawing the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't want to accept those because ... (inaudible). I mean those things so that they can draw (inaudible) to draw their own conclusions. (0:10:21.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I figured they'll draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know from the - their ... you know their whole position (inaudible). (Inaudible) I've seen and kind of be contributed for ... like (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's so bad about them drawing the wrong conclusions? Well I didn't really phrase that right because that makes me sound like I think ... maybe you should change from there to nothing (inaudible) so drawing the wrong conclusions. If they draw the wrong conclusion that seems bad to you, what (inaudible) does it hurt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't like anybody to think I'm ... (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's embarrassing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of both (inaudible). I don't know. It's sort of - sort of the whole relationship (inaudible) to me. I mean ... I don't know. I just don't like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like power.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). I don't know. I just don't understand (inaudible) people (inaudible) unless I have some good reasons (inaudible). You know if you (inaudible) people and you've asked them for favors and they might ask you for favors. The chosen people you kind of interact with and I guess or talk to them or something like that. Whereas in when you're like on bad terms with them, you just sort of push them away and then you're more - more alone and actually (inaudible) which is ... the normal state of (inaudible) and I don't want to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Might be like saying you need every contact that you can get. (0:13:34.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. People just (inaudible) good reason for that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like just the people in general.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Trying to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but (inaudible) like it's not some kind of (inaudible). If that's what you mean (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sort of like ... I don't know and also like if people think you're cool (inaudible). Like if people thought I was cool, (inaudible) help me convince my thoughts that I'm alright. But - that I'm not a (inaudible). I really ... you know like I was saying my parents draw the wrong conclusion most of the time. (Inaudible) or anything like that and I just that ... I come to another conclusion about myself but I don't know whether - which I really believe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sometimes it seems to me that I'm just deceiving myself by saying well you've got problems. You're not doing good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the deception?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could just be saying that because I don't want to face the fact that I'm (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That if like as long as you keep on saying you have problems, you thinking - thinking of yourself as potential and it isn't (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you think your parents feel (inaudible) that there's no potential. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also a bad thing or attempting problems or doing like a sympathetic thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But still (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of a moral thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can't tell whether you're just trying to convince yourself you're not a moral failure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or whether I (inaudible) and you know then having other people ... if - if everyone says that you're a no good and you keep telling yourself well I just have problems, it tends to increase (inaudible). So maybe - maybe I really am no good but what - what all these other people are seeing are normally (inaudible). Well (inaudible) he's okay and - and I say to myself oh I've got problems and that's not bad so maybe I really do have problems and ... (inaudible). (0:17:01.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like that social support helps support your own view of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your own view of yourself kind of didn't study enough to ... to be independent about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I'm not that sure of it. You know I know what I tell myself but then I have a lot of - a lot of evidence to the contrary (inaudible). You know well you can draw two conclusions from - from my behavior (inaudible) and ... nobody wants to tell themselves that they're no good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you mean that's kind of how you act. It's starring you in the face you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just - looking because I don't want to say to myself you're no good. You're lazy. Just because I don't want to say to myself like (inaudible) some other - some of the (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if it's just an excuse then that changes how you see - see yourself, right? (Inaudible) Society says that all of this stuff you say is just an excuse in how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). I don't think that I'd admit to myself that I'm lazy or whatever. And if I did I can't speculate (inaudible) because I just don't (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then how come you thought of - that maybe you should (inaudible) excuse. You said well it's (inaudible) anyways. Just kind of keep yourself stable (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well (inaudible) that it's not true and ... (inaudible). I - I don't know. Just ... I'm not saying it's right or anything like. I just have to keep living under all of these excuses but ... I don't see - see things as they really are. I didn't think it's good to ... be blind to the facts (inaudible). I'd like - I don't know. Just some people who (inaudible) choosing to admit to themselves that - that they're different or something (inaudible). They go all through their life trying to (inaudible) the things that everybody else or something like that and it - it can handicap you in a way and ... and hurt them (inaudible) because they expect too much of themselves. (0:20:56.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that must be you too. Wondering whether you do expect too much of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't very often ... because ... I don't know. I think that when I ... when I get rid of those problems then I really am okay (inaudible). But then I don't know. Another - another thing about ... I don't - I don't want to talk about (inaudible). It's not a lot of fun because I sort of get myself immersed in their problems to ... like ... (inaudible) with my father and my (inaudible) and then my father wants to retire and ... he never seems to like have enough money to (inaudible) about how long I'm going to school (inaudible). (0:23:06.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So those things kind of get (inaudible) to you again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Accused, I feel like the - like going back. It's hard for me to accept (inaudible) now that they - my father's pretty much told me we really want you to come back. They (inaudible) can't sort of do like I'm doing because I was told to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to do it less because you haven't chosen it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. It's more like I'm back in the normal ... I'm their child so they take me under their ... domination doing what I'm (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your experience is that way or it kind of looks that way to you from the outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's what I actually experienced. It's like ... to be (inaudible) authority.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like once they ask (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible) you experience that demand and the idea that you could decide to do it for your own reasons. (Inaudible) it's like saying -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you don't want to because they - they're saying you have to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I sort of wanted to show them that I'm independent and now is my chance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like - like you keep saying no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know. The whole thing about what am I going to do when I get back there? Sure it's nice that they (inaudible) but (inaudible) If I want to watch my program on a TV channel they (inaudible) but (inaudible). But then after that ... there's just absolutely nothing to do. I can't like hop on the bus and go anywhere or ... (inaudible) actually feel stuck out there and I get like that - I'll be compelled to think that (inaudible) there. (0:25:56.8) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because ... well it all depends on who's paying for me to go back there and it's always been him in the past. And if he pays for this vacation just the fact that he's going to pay so much to get me back there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you think he ought to give you (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I pay, it really doesn't matter. Then again I might think well while you're going back there you might as well get your money's worth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On your own money.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just very (inaudible) to travel some place and then travel right back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's (inaudible) and there is a question whether there are other values for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there are but I felt badly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: All depending - it all depends on how much you spent to go and that's like ... flying is a lot more (inaudible) than taking the bus. Taking the bus is very unpleasant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does all of that add up to saying (inaudible) you're not clear anyway that you - not staying there for the whole time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much. If I go there, I have to leave (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not really a matter of whose money you're (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's (inaudible) and then they want me to stay there and I sort of ...because (inaudible) get me to stay there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you won't see it for what it is or you will and (inaudible) or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They'll tell me what I was doing wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? That's not exactly (inaudible) manipulated (inaudible). That's not exactly being manipulated against your will then. (0:28:46.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I won't ... I don't know. My father's putting me through college even though he's putting on a little - act to make me feel like I should stay there, the fact remains (inaudible) the thing (inaudible) should do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're going to (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should be. I don't know. I am grateful for some things and I'm not grateful for others. And I've been grateful for the money he's spent - grateful that he had spent the money to put me through school but ... there's a lot of things that I'm not very grateful for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your decision is going to be on (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Actually but I figured maybe it would be easier on me for my trip home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You paid your dues. You know like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or some of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it's not like that. I expect that when he sees the report card that it's sort of - that he's not going to be too pleased. You know if I played the loving son when I'm at home maybe he'll be sympathetic. He won't be - upset (inaudible). (0:30:44.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He won't go down on you so hard because you're there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well does that kind of satisfy you so that's like - that's a reason to go home and go home for the whole time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way because I - by the time the grades come out I'll be back here and I think that if - if the grades (inaudible) I'm going to be home when the grades (inaudible). I think I'd arrange to be (inaudible) because that's pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually what I meant was that you just kind of laid out a way in which it made a lot of sense for you to go home to kind of save off (inaudible). You know couldn't (inaudible) everything I said and what I was wondering was that you made it seem like that was a - a calculated choice and were going to do it. Are you satisfied with that choice? Does it seem like a fair exchange?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but - and he won't ... he still won't accept things the way that I want them. It's like (inaudible). It's not exactly a fair exchange and I feel that they should accept the fact that I want to be a little more independent and I don't think really he should ... take (inaudible) the way I do in school - not as being evidence of me fooling around a lot because (inaudible). My mind's not adjusting to - more to the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish he was more concerned about like you and the situation of not getting good grades and that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish - I wish he understood me the way I understand (inaudible). Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What - what's the difference about you being? (0:33:25.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I come down ... (inaudible) why I wasted so much money (inaudible). My mother said (inaudible). She - she somehow thought I had one or two courses that I had to take ... after the end of the next quarter beyond the regular four years (inaudible). I told her it's around five or six and then she said well maybe you should (inaudible) and ... I don't know. That (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel after that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way sort of - why can't you - a little more time to understand it and ... I started getting agitated and I said (inaudible). I think she realized it. She said somehow she feels (inaudible) or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that ... I sort of think she - that she still believes it regardless of the fact that she said oh I understand. I didn't know that you were going back. So she (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish (inaudible) but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the fact that she still believes that. Would you (inaudible)? Would you say you have kind of (inaudible) left? (0:35:35.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. It's just - just that I don't ... I don't know. That's kind of interesting because a lot of times she asked me if I had reactions to things I think and I just don't think of anything. Like I made (inaudible) or reactions to those (inaudible). (0:36:16.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you make of that? What do you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe they're there. Maybe I just don't ... maybe I'm not (inaudible). I mean maybe I did have reactions. Maybe I just ... (inaudible) my feelings about it with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Maybe I'm not asking the question right or (inaudible) because I think what I mean is more or less while you say it bothers you in some way, what - what's - more or less what - what's your concern in telling me? What's your concern about just saying where you stand ... at whatever you're (inaudible) or maybe you don't (inaudible) and that's something (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I feel (inaudible) not that I don't want that. It's just another - another way of saying - my parents ... well I don't think they (inaudible) understand and ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't really see your position. You mean like they don't really see (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They keep on trying to make me learn from their experience or in other words, do what they say and like I've been going through that for just a long time and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem to you like they're trying to help you. It seems to you like they're just trying to take you from over here and just move you out there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Which is what (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's kind of the way they brought me up. (Inaudible). Now when I don't - when I don't - when I resist being (inaudible) like this I don't seem to be moving where they're pushing. Then they come out with these statements well you should have flunked it and then I feel ... feeling like pretty bad about the fact that ... you know like they're really pushing hard in one direction and I really just don't and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really experience that struggle when they say something like that. I mean it's like ... their one last hit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they're still doing it and ... it's just not too nice and I think it's a poor relationship with my parents on that. That makes me uncomfortable. I don't feel like I'm really spending any time with them. (0:39:16.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So what is it just like one - one time when they're just pushing you - pushing you in a way that you really don't fit and you don't think you want to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible) Well - well you're talking about this - this specific incident or are you talking about (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just (inaudible) talk to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're saying. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about going home (inaudible)? Is that the same thing for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's also - that really sticks in my mind about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what - what you personally want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if your only option really going there - staying there (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could be (inaudible). If I want to go to a hotel (inaudible) definitely be on my mind. And I don't have any money to spend so I'm trying to save up a little (inaudible) and ... you know there's - those are the only two options I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one day it seems more sensible to you to stay here and just not - not have to do the parents thing and the next day it seems like well you really owe it to them. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I owe it to them and I'd really like to get out of New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - and ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's between kinds of different aspects of - the things we're saying in New York are like how unfocused it's going to be after the first day there and what else? What's worth staying in New York (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's worth staying in New York? (0:42:10.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Most of the things are negative. You know unpleasant there. How unfun it's going to be (inaudible) after the first day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going to be unpleasant is it's so boring? It's going to be so boring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's going to be so boring. Wanting - I want to show my family (inaudible) and not only show it to them but show it to myself. I don't know. I just figured there were things to do and places to go. Something I've been too but I can't or I haven't really been (inaudible). And ... I just have a chance to fool around and ... enjoy something. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like you might like it - staying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it would show -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a chance to catch up on new things around here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of also (inaudible) the significance for you and for your parents about your relationship to them. Like it would be saying ... you know when (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). And you aren't really sure that you could do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At this point I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? Just out of your indecisions? You've got to be very decisive about it or kind of scary to think ... actually making that decision?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the whole thing is a big decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't decide just whether it's better or not? Whether it's (inaudible). Whether it's (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether it's ... which would be better. Which I'd like better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you'd like different things about each. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Each seems to be a conclusion in (inaudible) and the real question is how - how you weigh those different things. (0:45:05.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I really don't. I can't. I've been trying to and like some days it's like one way and some days it looks the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some days it seems more important to kind of keep up (inaudible) preparing. You do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether I'm thinking about that that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the things about going home the most?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not really through them and what's the virtues of going home?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting out of New York and changing environment - traveling. I can sort of let myself be under (inaudible) going some place new and really it's not but ... I think I could (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get to - it's kind of like getting excited and really getting some kind of change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having something change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah change. I mean like the boredom and the routine here in the same place all the time. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Just wanting to break out of that (inaudible) anyway. Yeah anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The more I think about it the more I think that it's (inaudible) so many things that (inaudible) do. I really don't know. (Inaudible) for a while. You know I feel (inaudible) after a while but remember the last time you were in New York saying (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of there really wasn't anything you wanted to bring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At this point yeah. And ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not so much that - that you felt as if there wasn't - there wasn't (inaudible) and it just seems kind of uninvolving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It hadn't been solved. Yeah and it was uninvolving and I don't think there was even that much more even said about it without like sort of rehashing. (0:48:01.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder (inaudible) to. I had one this weekend. It (inaudible) ... completely (inaudible) - well not completely but near completely ... to dematerialize (inaudible) - get rid of all the wrong (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) but just all of the sudden (inaudible) people like to come to it. This thing I like to (inaudible) and accumulate it and the first one is pretty rough but absolutely ... I (inaudible) decided to - to ship my stereo to my parents that way (inaudible). I feel really ... I feel really strange having expensive junk in my apartment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange like you shouldn't be having it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strange - yeah. And then there's also no (inaudible) like someone's going to break in and steal it and it's uninsured I think. Then I'll be out all that money and - (0:50:08.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well that could be - I mean is that a - again you're worried and thinking that that could be taken care of that thing. You know guarding (inaudible) could be taken care of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By insuring it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I can't afford it. I don't think. I mean to insure something here it would probably (inaudible) for two years and it'd be like paying for it again. I don't know. I think - I never investigated but I (inaudible). I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you put - okay so you're worried about losing and I don't see any way to guard things that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other thing is that something of that - feeling very confined or strange having - having things like is that an issue in your neighborhood or in relationship to your past or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strange. I don't know. I've gotten (inaudible) with my parents. They were (inaudible) I did but that (inaudible). It's sort of a strange relationship to the neighborhood and ... yeah, and the image I have in my (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The image you have of yourself doesn't fit into having an area where you've got to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They seem like luxury items or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the image you have of yourself is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not (inaudible) ... and especially if there's not a lot of purpose. (Inaudible). I don't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a moral (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking of yourself as not meaningless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't - I don't know. I sort of like - we got into the stereo, I just (inaudible) ... like for me at times it's sort of ... (inaudible) somebody said that delivering for all of the other people or something but music is like the ultimate experience - like ... and (inaudible) the reason why I was (inaudible) like there's people in there when I'm feeling like I should be studying and I should be doing something. I just work it out with them. I can sort of dabble in something and (0:53:44.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean (inaudible) really gotten to you in a big way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It takes your mind off of the things that bother you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm just too dependent on it really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too dependent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a habit and ... (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not just a habit. It's more like really need to (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's - it's in people who - some people - it's not (inaudible) but it's like alcohol - alcoholism or anything like that but it's somewhat similar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a matter of seeming meaningless and - well who's (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I feel very uncomfortable without it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. (Inaudible) you see it differently than food because I think you think you should (inaudible) and do something (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) and the thing about (inaudible) is the - it interferes with (inaudible) alcohol or something - alcohol and drugs. You know when it's on I don't really accomplish anything and it - the fact that it's on sort of ... eliminates the possibility of me accomplishing anything. Whereas if I had it off then I can write.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can't turn it off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel very uncomfortable if I shut it off so I can't shut it off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how is not having any keep you from feeling uncomfortable when it's not on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's great to have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just once and for all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. You know at one time I didn't have a stereo and I did fine without it. I figured I could return to that like if I sort of (inaudible) my mental decline because it sort of happened since I got the - the machine. Maybe not because of it but just the fact that the two things coincided.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of do think it was a cause in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it (inaudible) and what - what's the cause of (inaudible) exactly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I started listening to it while I was (inaudible) had something to do. I decided well I'd rather relax and not get tense about this. At the time I was thinking of relaxing (inaudible). It has - (0:56:40.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has a way of just ... it's almost like a warming feeling inside me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like it overtakes you. I mean it just kind of covers all around you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It blocks away the outside feeling. (Inaudible) feeling like my awareness is ... very (inaudible) to do or all these other things can sort of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forget all those jobs that you had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) that there's something scary in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). Which is what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well nothing ... take control over me or something. It's just relying on (inaudible) and (inaudible) I feel having my - my functioning (inaudible). So that - that's what was functioning for (inaudible) my desire to shut the (inaudible) or you know (inaudible) purposes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't see why you wanted to - the one thing is like you're asking me the question but what I think I can't figure out why given those that you want to ship it home instead of just selling it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shipping it. Like what -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well selling it ... kind of is an irreversible decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About that particular machine. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Should I ever want another one. You know I - it would sort of be a big lose of money if I were (inaudible). In a way I think - I've thought of selling it but (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the other thing is like being $300 in cold storage until you ever want it back. Feel like kind of this machine which you've (inaudible) at home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's (inaudible) but -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah whether it gets (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well but that's a kind of (inaudible) to say. That's like saying well in 10 years I won't have lose any money on it because it won't be worth anything and theoretically it's true but.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to be (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. I didn't want to before. What I was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it seems like - I don't understand why that solution - what's causing it if that's the best solution to you. That selling it isn't a solution to it. (0:59:46.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: By selling it's a solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just a general solution a little bit easier ... at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible) is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's an actual matter of - of effort and it's a lot easier to pretty much (inaudible) to give it to REA or something than it would be - instead of putting it in (inaudible) classifieds and talking to people about it and all of the haggling and trying to get what you think it's worth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh but I could say that to - talking about the REA. Finding boxes for it and tying it up and getting string and weighing it and making sure so </p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do you get more point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I really think that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well that gives you but you know -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To me it wouldn't do you good. It's like ... it's (inaudible) to get to the assumptions that you're making (inaudible) to say that - say things like not having that ready cash (inaudible) money in cold storage that - that kind of you're willing to pay that price for having the ease - the ease of getting rid of ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In addition to that because you like the (inaudible) I think like having (inaudible) to change my mind and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like really not wanting to make the move or the decision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I think I might have had - also like me - like what my parents said was right or something like that I'm not sure (inaudible) ... and I wouldn't want to admit to myself that maybe they're right because it was sort of as if they were right this time they might be right about other things then. Tell me that's occurred to me before but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait. How come it's offensive when they're right and just sending it home with not only - not - just sending it home, you can just admit in some way they're right exactly (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just the fact that it's sort of a temporary thing right now and at this point, I feel (inaudible) to have it. That's not the type to (inaudible). (1:02:46.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like restricting them. The whole range of what this decision means.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I (inaudible). In a way it would be you know exchange $20 for REA to send it back to them. I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you what it is. It's not really what I asked that. What is it - what would be the matter with (inaudible) at the same - of these decisions but like ... maybe just saying are there are grounds besides the economy of it (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I wish there were.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah maybe I should. Maybe it just isn't (inaudible). It isn't really worth (inaudible). I don't know. (Inaudible) I came to a decision of buying (inaudible) I use to buy a lot of their (inaudible) and (inaudible) successful in buying records which is also (inaudible) record player and I soon found out. I got really annoyed having to pay - to pay like $3 and $4 for a little piece of plastic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know because they (inaudible) advertising for records and (inaudible). I decided yeah, that they weren't worth it. Like I said when you're tired of listening to the same records over and over and over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that's not such a hot - you don't like the - everything about that decision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm satisfied with it. You know it's not - it's just created problems of its own. I don't think it was (inaudible). It was nice that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) that you held onto your decision?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Particularly ... I saw all of my money going down the drain in nothing and I sort of made the decision that it's (inaudible) because it saved me a lot of money and I stuck to it. Like I said it had - it saved me many of problems so. And ... you know maybe if I never intended to buy a - a whole bunch more of records it might be just reminding much longer than what I could so (inaudible). (1:05:52.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know if you're going to be here Thursday right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm probably sure that I won't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You won't. Okay. Let me see the schedule for next therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm almost certain - matter of fact I am certain provided I get to class I won't have a class from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. every day of the week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every day of the week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's because -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm going to flunk actually it depends on (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no. I think you're going to fail. Okay. I think (inaudible). I think you're really. Okay. Well we'll ... I don't know what's happening with all my clients (inaudible) in terms of other people shifting around times so why don't we just make upwards to the point of - you know by the time (inaudible) or by the time actually this will (inaudible) hear about what's happening (inaudible). So. Can you do 3:00 p.m. on that Monday or ... 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday or ... 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday or any of those kinds of (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope to be in Wednesday (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want one (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I'll write it down somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah? (Inaudible). Bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye.</p>

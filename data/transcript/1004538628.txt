<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Okay, and I'm on. Here we go. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... (pause) So I've kind of started getting the process going of sending e-mails out to everybody. But I haven't heard back from anybody yet, so I'm getting kind of short, you know? I keep having to remind myself that in the pre-e-mail age it was unreasonable to expect a response within 24 hours. So... and it's been slightly less than 24 hours. So... yeah. I'll be fine. I just have kind of thought about it, and written all these long e-mails and explained myself and I have to go and talk to people, and that's going to be a hard thing so... But I don't think it'll be bad. There's no reason for it to be very bad. I'm just a little antsy right now. That's all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you nervous? Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Um... (pause) I don't think I've been doing a very good job of communicating with people that this is actually a really serious situation. Because I've told a couple of my friends, and it's like... (pause) you know, you say you're depressed, and that can mean so many different things. And I think most people go through a period of some portion of mild to moderate depression in their lives. And I really don't want to trivialize that. That's really serious. I want to take that seriously, but at the same time I feel like that makes them say, "Oh, I know what you're going through." But it actually is very different, I think. Or, to me it feels different. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are some important differences. [00:02:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I just don't know how I'm going to talk to people about it. I'm anxious that I'm going to get a lot of judgment, but there's not really much I can do about that, so... (pause) yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. Will you be relieved to hear something from somebody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will you be relieved to hear something from somebody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, to have some acknowledgment from somebody in my department, or... Actually, I guess that I was talking about one thing, and then I started talking about another thing that I'm worried about. Both. I haven't heard back from anybody, so I don't know what anybody in my department thinks about this. I don't know whether the accessibility office is willing to help me with this. I don't know. But then also, when I tell people about it, just like telling friends, they seem very confused. Like one friend was like, "I don't understand. Why can't you go - why aren't you going back? If you're not going to be in school, why don't you go back home? And just fly out once a month to seek treatment?" Because I was like, "I need to stay here because my doctors are here." And I was like, there's a real gap here. What do I say? I actually need to see somebody two or three times a week, or I might die. (chuckling) It's a little awkward to throw into conversations, but... particularly as the time that I spend with other people is the time that I keep my best face on. And so, most people haven't seen me when I've been openly bad. (pause) [00:04:38]</p>

<p>But I still think it's right. I still feel really good about it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else is coming to mind about that? Is there something else or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That pretty soon, the relief of having made some kind of decision and having taken some concrete step that kind of boosts me back up and that's going to go away, and then I'll have to realize that deciding to take time off in itself is not actually going to make me get better. So it's hard to know how to be ready for that without anticipating it to the extent that I bring it on.</p>

<p>I'm really sad that I can't be with James. We talked last night about it, and about kind of how there aren't any really good options to both be in the same place. He had said - he's kind of resigned to his degree taking whatever time it takes, and so take a week off here and there to come be with me, he can do that, and that's good, but that also increases the ultimate time that he's not living with me. And I'm having a hard time with that. Especially because it seems like it's going to take longer than we had talked about. [00:07:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm not quite seeing it this way, but what I'm gathering is, I think the sort of main impediment to your spending more time there (pause) is me being here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and... Dr. Vaughn.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often do you see her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, once a week, once every two weeks. I'm sure eventually we'll find a medicine that works, and then a normal amount of time. Yeah. But also... It's you, but it's not just you. It's that I have a whole support network here, and my support network in Ohio is James and one couple that we're close with, and they're going to move soon. Her advisor is moving to. So if I go to Ohio, my life will literally be in James's hands, in his mind. And I just can't do that to him. That, and frankly, I just hate it there. (chuckles) I really just want him to come here. [00:08:56]</p>

<p>Visiting is good, but really what I'm sad about is that we're not going to be able to live together. Because it really is different than living - there's not really a place for James in my apartment. There's more of a place for me in his apartment, because I've spent more productive amounts of time there, but not really. We just need space for ourselves. (pause)</p>

<p>I feel like everything but James is involved. And it's hard for me to see, even if I were doing well enough that we could just talk on the phone, it's hard for me to see that not - I think I would resent him some, I just need him being the only thing keeping me. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of this is - you must really miss the hell out of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I do and I don't. That's the problem. In some ways, I'm just a different person when he's not around. Because we've spent so much time long distance that I cope. I don't notice that I miss him until I see him again (pause). But yeah, in some ways I do. (pause) In some ways I do really miss him, even when it's not - it's not like an open wound sort of thing, like when you first leave somebody. We manage, and then we see each other when we see each other. We stay in each other's lives as much as we can, but at the same time we give each other - we have to have more space and more independence in order to be fully in our lives when we're separate. Does that make sense? (pause) [00:12:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just (pause) If I'm thinking about James all the time when I'm here, I can't be here. I won't be - I can't be happy here. I don't feel bad about not thinking about James all the time, because it's kind of a coping. It's so weird that way, being married. I don't think - it's not easy to explain to people. My dad was not happy about our getting married when we did, because we were going to be long distance. He just couldn't see that as a model that was right, but it was kind of hard both to decide and to defend. For one, we're not in the same place but we are in a place in our relationship where this is what we want, this is what we're ready for (pause) and in some ways, this is what the relationship needs to keep it healthy. I think if we hadn't gotten married, it would be much harder for me to live without him, actually - here. In part because it's - when you say, "I need to go see my boyfriend," people take it differently than, "I need to go see my husband." People treat you like you're legitimate. (pause) [00:14:38]</p>

<p>I think I should probably tell you about Dan at this point. He just hasn't come up at this point. So, this was a - Dan Hyman, he's a professor at the university. And I fell in love with him while I was there, and he fell in love with me. And (pause) obviously, things got really messy. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is when you were doing your master's degree?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because he actually is the person who said, "Why don't you go to Ohio?" This is a long story, which is partly why I haven't brought it up. So, you know, we never slept together. We talked about it. We never kissed or anything. We talked about it before I got married. James knew I was in love with Dan before I did, basically. Before or as soon as I did. And I didn't keep any secrets from him, ever. And Dan tried to do the same by his wife, but it's more difficult for him to be honest than it is me, which is one of the flaws in him, I think - one of the things that's hard. He and his wife were having problems that had nothing to do with me, for a while back. And they're still together, and still managing and committed but they go back and forth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have they been married a while?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, 15 years-ish. They have two kids. His wife is a really, really wonderful woman. I've only met her once. I met her at - they had a party for his students at their house - he lives there, she's a student there, and he commutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he in your department?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he was really the reason I came to the school, he was a huge mentor. None of this came out until after I had graduated. I knew I was in love with him, but frankly it's actually fairly common for me to fall in love with my professors, so it wasn't a big deal. (chuckling) It sounds kind of off and strange, but that's who I am, that's how I relate to people. I have father issues, and what can I say? (chuckling) But I didn't know that he felt anything like that toward me until after I graduated. And I was helping him at a session that he's manager of, and we spelled it out and talked to me for each other, and there it was. But the point about Britnay being that I went to her house with my husband at this party - I didn't know this until much later, but at that point she knew that her husband was in love with me. And she was just so kind to me, and just very - just incredibly kind to me. It was right after I had gotten into Brown, and she had pulled me aside at one point and just said, "Dan is so proud of you." So in that situation, everybody was just really good people trying to do the best thing that we could, and of course everybody just really got hurt. And I didn't want that, and I tried to keep it from happening, and tried to do the best thing I could, and it wasn't good enough. Of course, I felt horribly guilty about it. But also I don't think it's reasonable for me to feel (pause) I think in some ways it's reasonable for me to feel guilty, but in some ways I feel like I've paid for that. You know? I've hurt enough, and I've done everything that I could to make it better, versus not much. Most of which is the whole time that we were trying to be in one another's lives in a way that was good for everybody. Both of us said, "If one of our spouses says, 'No, you guys need to stop talking,' that's it. We stop talking." And Britnay eventually did say, yeah, this is it. And then since - so at this point, we kind of check in once every couple of months and that's it. And I've been keeping him updated on this because he really loved me and cares about me and wants to know. He's the only person that I could - he's the only person I've met since I've met James that I could see myself with. But I would still choose James. And I did. (chuckling) [00:20:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had the choice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have. But before I got married. And when - this is really the only thing I haven't told James, but when he called me to say, Britnay said we need to stop talking, he said, "Okay, so yeah, this is it. If we stop talking on a regular basis, then we have to see when we can talk. We can sort of check up on each other, but -" and obviously we'll have to talk in professional contexts, because we're in very small fields - together. And he wrote all of my letters of recommendation. (chuckling) Obviously, I could never ask him for a letter of recommendation again. But the world still sees him as my mentor. So that's a little awkward. But he said, "It's this, or you could come be with me. And that's what I want." And I said, "I don't want that." (pause) [00:21:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it look like? I mean, what was it like for you falling in love with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I should have known better? Because he's not that attractive, so if he were hot I would have been on my guard and I wouldn't have fallen in love with him. He was kind of overweight when he started teaching, and he lost like 30 pounds that year, which I don't think had anything to do with me. But he says that, he (pause) I mean, he approaches teaching in kind of the same way that I do, and he pushes his work in the same way that I do, which is that it's a passion for him. He loves it, and he loves his students. All of them. Not just me. He just gives of himself to his students in a way that not many people do. And he's - you know, James is romantic in a way that's slightly different from the way that I am romantic. And Dan is romantic in the same way that I am romantic, in like the Yeats and Dylan Thomas sort of way. If that makes any sense. Probably that doesn't make any sense. (chuckling) He's a lot less realistic than I am, frankly. I think he has - I think him falling in love with me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By saying, "He's a lot less realistic," you mean Dan is a lot less realistic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Dan is a lot less realistic. James is a lot more realistic. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I thought, but I wanted to make sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was like finding an echo of my own dreams and (pause) ways of looking at the world, and ways of seeing beauty that I had never found, that I certainly had never had in common with another man. (pause) In some ways, it's much easier to talk to him than it is to James, because in some ways he just - the same image will evoke the same ideas for both of us, immediately. In other ways, James is much easier to talk to than Dan is. Because if Dan doesn't understand something, it's much harder to get him to come to understand it. It's been very difficult to get him to come to understand how this depression has been for me recently, because he has a long history of depression so he has his own experience with it, so it's hard for him to read what I'm going through, other than through the lens of what he's going through. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>But, I don't know, it's just (pause) you know, there's obviously a kind of power dynamic going on. But less than you would think. He's like fifteen years older than I am, and in some ways he's a lot younger than I am, emotionally. And I could kind of tell that. So there was never a point at which... I mean, I look up to him but there was never a point at which I was in awe of him. (pause) In some ways, I feel so bad about all this, but it really is one of the great gifts of my life. I can't feel bad about it. I can't regret it. I can't say I wouldn't do it again. (pause) Even though losing that relationship, and having to come to terms with that, it was like my sister died. It was awful, and I couldn't tell anybody about it. Except for James. (chuckling) [00:26:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much time had you been spending together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We spent a lot of time together when I was a student, because I was taking at least one of his classes every semester. Because he teaches all of the languages I was taking, so I was taking at least one class, sometimes two classes, with him. And then over the summer, after I graduated (pause) I would go up once every week or two for six or eight weeks, and spend the day with him and work on this sestrument. A lot of falling in love with him was just this joy of collaboration. We just work really well together, we're excited about the same things, it was really cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like it's pretty intimately tied up in the work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess it sounds to me like there's some similar feeling to the way you are devoted to and kind of give yourself over to your work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But then, after that we really didn't see each other at all because he was in the Middle East for most of that summer. And then I was at Brown, and he's blessedly on leave in all this year. So that we weren't at the same conferences this year. In some ways it's not blessedly, because he's not native, and had emigrated here when he was a young teenager, and is living back home for the first time since then. I think he's really getting his heart broken. I think he's finding that he can't support the concept of his people believe in it now, and he's just heartbroken, and it's something that he's held onto. You know, he's a romantic. It's the dream that he held onto. And so part of me is, that's me also, and part of me is, no, it's not. At one point he was like, "Oh, I wish I were 25 again, and starting at Brown with you." And I'm like, "No, I don't. (chuckling) I would not fall in love with you when you were 25. I'm in love with you now. After those fifteen years, as you are now. I don't want it to be any different." [00:29:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He can't help himself, he's - in other words, he's thinking about what he sort of wishes for, or how he would want things to be. Where he's not so tethered by the realities of things, and that information. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And part of that's really good, and part of that, I think, just means he gets hurt a lot. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you said being apart from him is like having your sister die? Or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It took about six months to be okay with it, to where - I mean, the reason I haven't talked about him before is literally because he hasn't come up, not because I haven't felt comfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't sound uncomfortable talking about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I've thought about it a lot. I wrote him letters and didn't send them almost every day for three months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After you stopped being involved?</p>

<p>CLIENT: After we stopped talking. Because I'd been - we'd been writing e-mails almost every day for the months and months before that. Yeah. (pause) It's just very weird to realize that I am just such a sucker for romance, like epistolary romance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is epistolary romance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's just like - like writing back and forth is just a really great thing. Yeah. (pause) So I don't know how it's going to pan out in the future. I think a lot of it depends on whether he and Britnay stay together in the future. I really, really hope they do. But the best possible scenario would have been for him just to not fall in love with me at all. Which... oh, well. Because I (pause) would not, he would not have known that I cared for him in that way, if he had not told me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, you would not have brought it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would not have brought it up. No, no, no. And by the time he brought it up, I could tell that he thought I was cute. But that's about all. But you know, you kind of can tell when somebody thinks you're cute. It's not a big deal. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had you fallen for him harder than you had fallen for other professors?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And I had (pause) at some point, about a year before this, I had said, "This is different. I need to not do this. I need to not be in love with this person." And tried to kind of put up those barriers, and I just couldn't do it. [00:33:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how long had you known him before that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew him for two years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How were you guys around each other? I mean, you took a class with him every semester?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I took class with him, and also there's a modern language reading group with some students who want to learn. So once a week, everybody gets together at the bar, and we read an article. And he's like, "The best way to learn a new language is to drink." (chuckling) Which, actually, I kind of agree with, as in helping you get out of your head. I was usually the only woman there, and then a bunch of male masters and Ph. D. students. But there just weren't very many women at that school, period. Their admissions ratio, I don't know how they managed to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's - you know, it's a very conservative environment. So yeah, it was fun. And we spent a lot of social time together, but not in one-on-one contact. Yeah. (pause) I think him falling in love with me was 80 percent me, and 20 percent what he needed. And I think he was in a place in his life where he was starting to say, "What if my life had taken different pathways?" And there I was, and I didn't need to fall in love with him. Obviously in some ways, I did need to (pause) I had a perpetual series of crushes on professors, which was clearly something I needed. And that, thankfully, I'm surprised I've stopped since then. So, that's the last of an awkward situation every semester for me. It was a big joke with James, and still is, but like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, I remember that. I remember that you said about your crushes, but I wondered if it was important, and related.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think just really wanting to be loved by somebody in authority, and seeing teaching as the authority. I have a hard time trusting women, older women rather. And I find it easier to trust older men. And in terms of - I am attracted to intelligence. That's what is sexy for me, much more so than physical things. And so (pause) I think I'm attracted to people who really care what they're talking about. [00:37:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, that sort of passion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think a lot of wanting the approval of authority is a lot of that. I think some of it I've grown out of, some of it I haven't. (pause) It makes my life awkward. (chuckles) But, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, falling in love with people making your life awkward? Yeah, I never heard of that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) So I mean, like I said before. I also just fall in love with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. My understanding is that's kind of how it happened. In other words, I assume by that you mean (pause) without your having planned, expected, wanted, or I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I fall in love with a lot of people. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just professors. I just love people. Which also makes my life awkward. Because most of my relationships, I care very very deeply about the other person in a way that they don't realize necessarily, because it would make them uncomfortable. Not most of my relationships, but a lot. Like I'm going to have drinks - I'm going to drink, he has acid reflux so he can't drink with me - with a classmate of mine that I've gotten pretty close to. And in some ways, I am in love with this person. I'm not sexually attracted to him. (chuckling) Particularly after Dan I've been really, really careful. He's married, he has two small children, his wife is - he wishes he spent more time with her, I've never met her. It's gotten to the point where he feels comfortable telling me these things, which is real trust for him. He's very, very, very private. So I've been very careful to be a friend for his marriage. But (pause) I am in love with this person. And I'm okay with that, I just have to be careful. I don't know if that makes sense. (pause) Also, women, also, if there was a question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There seems something a little sad about the way you have to be kind of furtive rather than (pause) being more celebratory about what you feel, and how strongly you feel for people. I think I can understand some concerns about that, but it seems like there's something sad about having to hide it? Or be quiet about it. Also, certainly, I'm sure you thought about how much how much you give to people and for yourself. I don't know about that at the moment. We're going to have to stop in a minute, but I wondered - would it be helpful to come in on Mondays as well? [00:42:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really would, if that would be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And actually, I have a completely open schedule now. So if the times that you have available are 7:30 or whatever, I can do that. I got up at 5 this morning to study for an exam and I realized I actually like getting up that early. (chuckles) I don't mind doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I have is probably more mid-day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's probably better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. This Monday, I've got 1:15. After that, I think I've got 12:30 if that seems feasible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the 30th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, let me write that down. (pause) Awesome, thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was actually going to ask you at some point about trying to shift twice a week to not twice in the middle of the week, because it actually gets hard for me to not see somebody for five days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's fine. We can talk about moving some things around in whatever way would be most helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, you're welcome.</p>

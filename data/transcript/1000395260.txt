<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I was thinking that well, it must be a carry-over from friday. Uhm, the first thing that came to my mind was making it very clear that I will be canceling this thursday as well as friday and monday, but I think I already said that. And I don't know, uhm, in some way I think after friday, things were on my mind all weekend. And well, 2 things came up with MSCZ that made me think they were connected with it. one was, I had known uh for some time that uhm there was going to be a trip to pog probably taking at least 1 night and, or maybe, maybe not, but certainly a whole day. And he had thought first that he'd be going friday and then it turned out he'd probably go this weekend. And I just kept hoping it wouldn't happen. And, and sunday he got a call saying he would have to go sunday, yesterday. And uhm, the whole thing was sort of confused because lawyer for the company that is trying to work an agreement with the one MSCZ represents, did not want this to happen. And so he kept trying to put them off and eventually the trip was going to involve a night, last night. And I got very upset and yet, and I'd known for quite some time it was going to happen or that it could happen. And I don't know, somehow when I first heard the telephone call and realized that he would be going, I mean it was, I wasn't really thinking this, except sort of my feelings were MSCZ should make a choice and the choice was between me or going on this trip.</p>

<p>And the other thing that came up, I, I still don't know whether I'm being unreasonable or not, I guess, I, (sigh) or how I'd feel if I could see the thing more clearly. But uhm, at some point, I think it must have been after fso was born, MSCZ said something about the fact he wanted to go to Florence (Italy). And I have been to florence and so his idea was that he'd go for maybe 5 days sometime in the late spring and I wouldn't go with him. he'd just go by himself. And this — when he first said it I just thought well, he'll, he won't do it and I don't like it. And i'll make it clear I don't like the idea and then he won't do it. But then he mentioned it again this weekend and this time I couldn't just say, think, well now i'll let him know I don't like it, because I already had let him know that. And I just felt as if,i don't know, if he goes I can make him feel guilty. But I still thought I had to sort of,i don't know, become, not neutral, but pass—, not, passive is wrong too, but I don't know, sort of as if, "look what you're doing to me."</p>

<p>And I can't, I don't, I think part of my trouble is uhm the feeling that he doesn't want me to go with him. And then I get mad, ah, uh, this is more for an excuse that he's taking some of his vacation time that we could spend somewhere together, doing that, and then we'll have very little vacation as a result. But I think my main thing is that he's not inviting me, that he's — I don't know what would happen if I'd say oh, I really want to go, but uhm — </p>

<p>(Pause) But I think there's also, I mean maybe it's so—, I thought this because of why, what we were talking about last week, but it seemed there was something about his saying well you can stay with fso and i'll go, as if he's rejecting both of us. (Pause) </p>

<p>But I think with both of these things uhm, I'm not sure. I, I just can't judge how I'd feel about his going to florence if other things were different. But I just had the feeling this weekend I was ready to be upset. Because uhm, I didn't sleep well friday night and I, when I got up saturday, instead of this time worrying about scheduling for feeding, I felt the same way, only about the question of play periods for fso. And was I — well i've been feeling I was sort of plunking her in the crib after she was fed and if she did any playing it was becau, because she just did it while she was in the crib but that I was making no effort to provide anything for her. And I mean, actually I was doing something but the way I was feeling that morning was simply that now that was all wrong and I better do something. I was being very inadequate. And well, the way I felt was uhm, I, In both cases, both times I got upset over the scheduling or the feeding or playing. I would read what dr spock had to say and I think in both times I remember, anyway, this time I was feeling very much,if I read it long enough and not even a lot of it, just the same old things over and over, the answer will come. And I'm sure it was an answer that had nothing to do with what I thought I was reading about, I mean what I was reading about, which I thought was what I wanted an answer to. </p>

<p>(3-minute silence) When I stopped talking I remembered that on friday — and I don't know now — I was sort of wondering if this had anything to do with it, uhm — we'd had intercourse. I had, I don't know, been in sort of an in-between feeling about it. well, he, MSCZ had to sort of insist. And then I don't know, I didn't mind, and I, It wasn't that I was thoroughly enjoying it, but I wasn't feeling the way I first did after we started having it again. And (sigh) but then I was just thinking now that then I had, I, this happened and then I had to feed fso the last feeding. And then when I came back to bed MSCZ wanted to have intercourse again. And I was just, I don't know, I guess I was feeling sort of, i've well, done my duty in a way, although I wasn't, I hadn't really approached it before, at least I didn't think I had,that way, but I didn't want to do it again. And then MSCZ wanted me to masturbate him which finally I did. But now when I was thinking about it I, I don't know, it was almost as if I was feeling angry because the reason MSCZ wanted to have intercourse again was because he enjoyed it so much the first time. I mean that's what he was saying. And he'd obviously enjoyed it and it's almost as if I were angry that he was enjoying it as much as he was and I wasn't. (Pause) But I think it's also the feeling that I wanted to enjoy it the way he was enjoying it and uh, of course that's impossible. </p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you mean? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess uhm I don't know, it just seemed as if the way I was feeling was that I wanted to be able to have a penis and do it as he was. I don't know, almost as if I were feeling, since I didn't have one I obviously couldn't enjoy it. </p>

<p>(Silence) You know, I was just thinking that, I don't know, something, I, I was just thinking about the whole weekend and how I was just keyed-up the whole time and that somehow I'd been feeling I'd been accepting more happily that I had a girl and have been having more fun with fso and all. But still something kept me all keyed-up over the weekend and it seems to be connected with the fact that I did have a girl and that she is, and that I'm a girl. And I don't know, even with the trip,when MSCZ went on the trip, I, I was thinking about it on 2 levels, I guess. I mean one, thinking that he really doesn't want to go and he is probably more unhappy than I, and at least I'm home and I can take it easy, and it's not going to be any fun for him. But uhm, on the other level I kept thinking, but at least he's the one that's going away. And it must be nicer to be the one to be going away than the one staying. (Pause)</p>

<p>And when, when he first got the call, the first call of the series about this, uhm, I think he was sounding cheerful for the benefit of the client, but it sounded like, oh boy, the boys are all going to get off together on this trip and he was really looking forward to it. And I wanted to take it that way in any case, even if he didn't really. I mean it sounded like that way to me, and,and it seemed as if that was the way I wanted to see it. (Pause) and I kept thinking about the, I mean initially, I stopped thinking about it after a while during the day. But uhm I mean the other side of seeing his reaction being what I just said would be, he was glad to be leaving me. And uhm, and it had happened that we had planned ahead. I mean generally when we do something like this we don't really plan ahead because we can often get MSCZ's cousin to baby-sit. And this time we planned ahead to be sure to have one evening when we got off by ourselves and went out to dinner and maybe saw a movie and it was going to be sunday. And I don't know, that — so it was almost like a further rejection of me that here we'd planned something where we'd be going off together and then he was happy to be doing this other thing. (Pause) </p>

<p>And then I had, I had this reaction. I (stutters) — part of it might just be natural, but uhm, I wanted to keep concentrating on it. when the weather got so bad last night I was thinking, well I'm glad we didn't go out after all. And then when I read about the tklo that occurred I'm not sure that the theater we would have gone to would have been in that area, but I could kind of think it might have been and then think I'm awfully glad we, or we might have been caught and I, we probably would have driven into ptt but maybe we would have taken a train and in any case, my, I wanted to think it's lucky we didn't go because we would have been caught in that too. And then also, then I can be glad too that it didn't happen. </p>

<p>(3-minute silence) Well, I, first I was thinking about, on saturday night we'd had dinner with uhm MSCZ's old roommate and his wife, who have a boy who's a year older than fso. And at first I was just thinking about the meal we had, and feeling superior because I know I cook better than feni. And, but then I, when I started talking it, I realized I was thinking about their boy and his walking. he'd s—, begun walking fairly recently and I guess I was wondering how soon fso was, will walk, and whether she'll learn earlier than he and as if I'm trying to now make me feel that she's superior to their child. </p>

<p>(2 ½-minute silence) That made me think of — some reason the fact that uhm well right around christmas time we heard of, from a number of friends who, some of whom we didn't know were expecting another child, who had babies, I don't — at least maybe 4 or 5 people who had babies right around the same time we had fso. And most of them had girls. I think just 1 person had a boy. And I was just thinking that i've really wanted to acknowledge their telling me and yet I haven't done it. so something makes me not want to. well, I did—, I was just wondering if it's just because I'm unha—, I was feeling unhappy about fso being a girl or if it's something else. And then I just began thinking of well, first of some gifts that she's gotten — she's gotten a lot of sweater and bootie and hat sets — and wondering what i'll do with all these. And then, then I began thinking of the things I bought before she was born, when tsb's was having a closeout sale. And I got, I was thinking in particular about one outfit that she would fit into right now — I mean now would be the time for me to put it on her if I ever do — that's blue. And I don't know, the question is, should I give it away or save it in case we do have a boy or let fso wear it or what? and — (Pause)</p>

<p>It makes me think too of 2 other things I got. that was the only thing I allowed myself to get that was blue and the other things, well they're the same type of thing but one is a bigger size than the other. One is white, I think and the other is yellow. But they have a little uhm object on them and they're both — I think one is a truck and I can't remember what the other is. But I couldn't find any that had a,a more neutral or feminine looking object. both of the—, both of them are things that you'd expect to see a boy in, rather than a girl, and I'm sort of wondering what i'll do with those things too. in fact, when I think about it, everything I got I was thinking when I got them,well a boy or a girl could wear them. But really, now that I have a girl and I'm trying to visualize her wearing them, I obviously I had a boy in mind. And, I don't know, now if I think of well, let so wear them anyway, because a baby looks like a baby no matter what sex. Uhm, I think, because I bought them with a boy in mind, I just I don't know, it would be like seeing a boy, seeing her as a boy. so I don't want to use them.</p>

<p>(3 ½-minute silence) I was just thinking more about her clothes. And it (sigh) seems like I sort of have this feeling that I want her to wear things that are definitely feminine because then,i don't know, it's as if it's a reminder that she is a girl or whether, I don't, maybe it's — some of the things are very pretty. And, and so then I can sort of think well she'll —these things are so pretty it can't be so bad to be a girl, or something like that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You're keeping a number of your ideas to yourself today. Do you notice that? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST: I wonder why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I, I was just, before I said what I last did I ha—, I was having the feeling that I'm somehow not getting at whatever really is on my mind. And that as a result, I mean it's not so much I don't want to say these things, as I'm just holding back some for some reason.</p>

<p>ANALYST: WHat reason occurs to you? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, first of all I was thinking well it's sort of leftover from the weekend when I felt so much that I was holding back something and very tense. And then I was thinking, when all the time I was thinking, there was something to do with the idea — I think it was friday I was talking about — that you would be rejecting me. And having the fantasy of your rejecting the girl that i've had fantasies being, that she's your wife and has a boy and all.</p>

<p>(Pause) But just thinking too that the first thing I thought of when I came here was telling you I wouldn't be here certain days, uhm, and then not — and holding back what I was thinking. maybe that's just another way to sort of leave you out or reject you first. </p>

<p>(Pause) And this makes me think again of how, well, of how i've often been with my father for a number of years,and especially that sunday again when he went to kiss me,and my reaction was to draw back and not respond. (Pause) because then I think of the fact that thursday I guess it was when,when you put into words the feelings I had about falling on the floor and your picking me up. And the strong feeling I had of liking to hear you or to recall hearing you say what you did and as if it were really happening. And I don't know, maybe I got afraid of, I don't know if responding would be the word, but allowing myself to feel that way. </p>

<p>(2 MINUTE SILENCE) I can't even remember what I was thinking after I stopped talking but I just now was, well I gue—, at some point I started thinking about looking for apartments. Because right before I came here I was trying to get a number uhm the kwsz hadn't printed and I wasn't able to get through in time. And then I started just thinking about the fact that feeding fso and — I mean because that was originally why I didn't have enough time to spend on the phone. And then, but then what I, It was sort of a feeling I was being aware of of uhm, I don't know, somehow the time that I can most uh, I don't know, feel like I'm special to fso and everybody else is cut out is when I am feeding her. And, and I, I was really thinking of cutting MSCZ out, even if he's not there. But somehow if he were there anyway, he would not be part of this. And, but that was something I wanted, to,to have something, a relationship with fso alone, that she would cut him out and I would be cutting him out. </p>

<p>ANALYST: In retaliation? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well it seems that way. we both, well I mean, everything —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Because you got him mixed up with your father? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was going to say because he's a man, but it seems like all men are mixed up with my father. (Pause) I don't know what I feel this about exactly, but the feeling I have after thinking about what you just said, is, it's all very futile. I guess, thinking I'm retaliating, trying to be defensive, but it's something's not working. And I guess what I think is not working, is, I can say alright I don't care and I don't need you, but I still do. (Silence) </p>

<p>Because this just came to my mind and it's been in and out of my mind ever since you gave me the bill. And I'm, well I just haven't been too sure how i've been feeling about it. uhm, because I, I think my old way was to want to pay you immediately and that was my reaction this time too, but I really can't until MSCZ gets paid in another week. And I don't know, it's been bothering me. And I'm not sure if it's because of my own feelings about it, or whether I think you're going to be angry because I'm not paying you right away or — and I don't know whether I, I feel I should be and I'm not, and therefore I'm doing something wrong, because I really think that. or if it's, I don't know, somehow by paying you right away I sort of get rid of any debt and -</p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

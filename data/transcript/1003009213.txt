<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [PATIENT NAME], how, how things are going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I was talking about Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, let me see.  Christmas I, eve, I was off.  I was home with my puppy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and we, I cleaned.  I was going to go to midnight mass, but I didn't go.  My boyfriend was up in [DEIDENTIFIED] with his family.  He's been up there since the [DATE], so he spent the holiday up there, which kind of sucked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm just trying to get through the holidays.  It's really tough.  This year seemed worse than last year.  I don't know why.  Uh, Christmas day, my brother and me and his girlfriend, which is weird because he just met this girl 5 months ago, and me with him 6 months -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Me and him had nobody last year, and this year we have somebody.  It's kind of weird, but, um, again with that word weird.  I'm always saying that word.  We went to the cemetery Christmas day and, um, it was kind of late so we were just hoping that we were going to get there, it was 4:00 and, you know, they have these people.  I'd rather go to the florist, but the guy sells, for the holidays, he sells outside, he sells nice things, but the florist, their flowers are bigger and thicker and they last longer, so I really like going to the florist, but I know they close at 4:00, but I remember my sister telling me that she went on her birthday, which was [DATE], and she brought some Christmas stuff and, um, so I told my brother if we don't get anything, you know, just get flowers, at least.  If we can't, at least she has the, they have the Christmas stuff and if she, so, um, we wind up getting the guy, and I bought 2 sets of flowers each and cups to put in the ground.  And, um, my brother bought this, um, wreath, you know, the Christmas wreath, and it says, "Christmas in heaven."  And I haven't been there in 5 months.  How horrible am I?  Which is strange because I'm the one that always goes and takes care of everything and nobody goes.  I make sure that everything's okay for the whole family and, um, I went and, we went, and, um, I just did my thing because I always bring gloves and water, and I put the cups in and I filled them up, and I put the flowers in, and, um, and I started really crying.  It really, really, got to me.  Um, I hardly really cry that much when I'm there.  Um, I try not to.  Um, sometimes I do, but, um, this time it really, I guess seeing my brother crying, it really got to me, and, um, his girlfriend and that was really sweet because she didn't even know either one of, my brother or my mom.  I thought that was really nice of her to come, you know, for, for my brother, and she's, she's really, she's really a nice girl.  I, I really like her.  I met her on Thanksgiving, and then she came to my sister's [AGE] birthday party, um, which was [DATE], and then, you know, I saw her Christmas for a little bit and, um, she was, um, she lost her mom last December, so that's good for them becau, I mean, not good.  Wrong choice of words, but, um, they can relate to one another -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In that aspect, so that's good for their relationship in that way because they can understand each other, and they can help each other get through it in that way.  Me and my boyfriend, it's, it's hard because he can't understand, and I can't expect him to.  I just ex, expect him to be there, and I know it's hard for him to understand that, and it gets frustrating.  Um, because he thinks I want his mother to be dead and, and that's not what I mean.  Um, I did my thing with the flowers and, um, my brother handed me the wreath, and I was like, "Okay, well," because my sister had these big things and, you know, they were all Christmas, and she did a really nice job and I said, "Well, where should I put it?  Should I just lay it down?"  And, you know, he didn't, he was all choked up so I was like, all right, let me just lay it down and then I was like, "Okay, you know, everything looks nice," and, um, I, I try to keep my self busy, but, um, now there's nothing left to do, so we're just standing there and we're just looking and I'm just thinking and, and all I think about, and I don't know why, it just sticks in my head so fresh is just the church and, and the cemetery the day of my mom.  I just, I keep rewinding it, reliving it, I don't know, I just, it's just always the church.  I just keep remembering them carrying the coffin into the church and us just standing there, and then just, when the bell rang.  I just never, I, you know, I saw the priest and the same one that, for my brother, and me and him have like, um, well, I think I do.  I have a special bond with this priest because he was supposed to marry me back in '05 and, um, I was going to church every week and confession, so I really liked him when I saw him doing mass and stuff.  So you get to choose a priest for your wedding, for a wedding and a funeral, which is really horrible, but, um, I chose him for my brother and my mom because my mom, you know, got to know him and stuff and, um, he's young and he's old fashioned, and, um, you can understand him, you know.  He's, um, he speaks different languages.  He does different masses.  He does Latin now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which, um, I've never seen, which I heard is really nice.  I've never seen him do one of those.  Um, he does Spanish, he does Italian, um, which I don't understand either of them, but, um, he just, you can hear him.  He's clear.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can understand.  It's just, he keeps it interesting, you know, and, and I caught interest in it.  He, he brought it back into it where it was interesting for me.  Um, so I just, I just, I don't know, when I see him, I, I, I kind of wonder sometimes if he thinks like, you know, and he remembers what he did for me and my family and, you know, at one time my brother was constantly going to the church, and he was doing all these recessions with him and carrying the saints and everything, so, um, you know, he was kind of close with them.  He stopped going.  We both did, which was wrong.  Um, I think it was just, um, an anger issue with God.  Um, I was very angry at God and, you know, I tell people, "You know, He gets angry at us.  When it downpours, we always say, uh, "Thunder and lightening, God's really angry," you know.  "The angels are crying."  "  Um, so if He gets angry at us, we can get angry at Him.  Like, who's to say, why can't we get angry at Him, you know.  He does things that we get angry with Him too and my thing was that I was angry with Him was because of the way He made my mom suffer, you know.  The way, I say, "The way He made my mom suffer."  I, I feel that He should have just made it a little more easier for her for the 18 years of abuse that she went through with my dad, you know.  Um, she took so much from my dad.  For 18 years, he beat her, and to have a death like that was beyond, and I just feel that He should have just made her go peacefully.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I thought it was [INAUDIBLE] and, um, that's what bothers me and that's why, I guess, I stopped going and then around the holiday season, the music, it just, it's a little too overwhelming, but, um, we did the cemetery thing, and, um, I can't watch my brother because he gets me so emotional, and I don't like to show him my emotions, but he, um, we did our thing.  And, and what he does is he kneels on the ground and he kisses the floor on my mothers side.  He doesn't do it to my brother, and I don't, I don't know why.  I didn't ask.  But when I leave, my thing is, um, doing [INAUDIBLE].  That's to say goodbye and to hug them and to kiss them is the flowers.  I get to kiss and hug the flowers, and that, that's my way of saying goodbye and that's the worst part for me is leaving.  Um, and when I was doing the flowers and then when I did, you know, the hugging and the kissing, um, I started to really cry a lot, and I told them that, you know, um, I told my brother to, you know, take care of mom.  Watch her for me.  Um, and I told him that I missed him.  You know, I miss him a lot because I feel like sometimes I forget about my brother because I'm so overwhelmed and touched with my mom and I, and I hope he understands.  I guess, in a way, you know, I think he does because of how I took care of her and stuff and lived with her.  And, um, you know, I told him that I loved him too and that I missed him very much, and, um, you know, Merry Christmas.  And then I went to my mom and, and she was the worst.  She's the hardest.  [LAUGHING].  It's like it took, everybody tells you, well, people, [LAUGHING] tell you it's going to get easier and, and you just wait for that moment.  And you, you, you so believe them, and you so want to believe them, but you just don't feel like it's going to, and, and you're just like waiting, like, "Okay, when is it going to get easy.  When is the pain going to stop?  When are you going to st, when's it going to stop?  When are the tears going to stop?  When are you going to stop thinking these things and these images?"  And it just, it just never goes away, and no matter what people say.  And then they always tell you things and then, you know, they never tell you how.  Um, my brother's girlfriend put her arm around me, and she said, um, what did she say?  She said, "It's okay."  She's got to be worse than anybody.  I mean, [DATE], [DATE], that's got to be worse than anything.  And I thought it was horrible with my brother in September, and I, I don't even know how she's sane.  [LAUGHING].  I look at other people sometimes.  I'm like, "Wow," you know, and they're so strong.  And then when people say that about me, I'm like, "Okay, you really must be high or something," because I, I don't see what they say.  I guess because I'm so in it, but, um, got up again.  My brother had a thermal thing and [LAUGHING] he's stupid.  He's like, "You want some Scotch?"  [LAUGHING].  He put Scotch in it.  So, um, I brought candy for my mom and my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I brought candy canes, and my mother loves the Hershey commercial with the colors where they do that, um, wish you a Merry Christmas -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they do the theme.  She always loved that commercial, so I bought the Hershey chocolates and, um, last year [LAUGHING] I went back to the cemetery and they were all, the wrappers were there, but the chocolate was gone and I told my grandmother's brother, I was like, "Oh my God, did they take it?"  So then, they're saying about roadies.  I said, "No.  Listen.  If, if anybody was, roadies or anything, they would just take all the wrappers.  The wrappers were there, but the chocolate was gone."  It was just so strange.  So I, I brought some of those.  You know, my brother and his girlfriend were standing there watching me, and I was getting so nervous when I was doing these flowers, and I never felt that like with my sister.  With my brother I just, I don't know, I do and, um, I'm, I'm taking the candy out and I put, um, the candy canes, and I, I took the chocolate candy out.  And I, all of these little mints too that I, uh, that my mom liked, and I gave one to my brother, and I put one for my mom.  And then, um, I switched the candy canes.  I made it into a heart in the wreath, which came out really nice.  And I left them each a cigarette, which I'm probably not supposed to do, but I said, "Well, they might as well be happy up there," right?  [LAUGHING].  And then again, we're just standing there looking at it, and, you know, my brother's crying and the Scotch thing.  I was laughing.  I was like, okay.  I said, "You, you have to be the crazy one to come up with that."  I'm thinking it's like soda or coffee.  [LAUGHING], he's like, "You want some Scotch."  And I had to work that night, so I was like, I just took a slug, you know, okay.  And then, um, I gave it back to him, and so we're just standing there, and we're all just like, you know, I'm trying really not to cry, but it's too late, it's happening.  And I just look at my brother and I just see him cry and I'm like -  And then when he kneels down, it's like, I just hate seeing that.  And I guess he hates seeing that in me.  So, um, we do our thing again, and he's like, "You want to leave?"  And I'm like, "Okay, I guess so."  Wh, what do you say, you know?  You know, you don't want to leave.  He's like, "You think we can sleep here and, um, do the thing again?"  And then we just, you know, we're crying more and more now, and now we're leave, and now we finally just get the nerve to walk away.  And I'm kissing, um, kissing the flowers and I'm hugging my mom's side, and I told her, you know, "You watch him too," [LAUGHING], "You take care of him."  And I was telling her that, um, you know, that I love her so much, and that I miss her so much and, you know, Merry Christmas and I'm so sorry.  And, um, now we walk away, and this is like maybe, I don't really remember if I ever did this though, but as I'm walking, I'm looking back.  And I don't think I really ever done that.  I just keep walking, and I'm just looking back, and I'm crying.  And now we're in the van and we're just sitting there, and I'm just crying and crying and crying.  I'm not even talking.  I can't even talk now.  Now it's the worst.  Now my brother's like, um, "Do you want to do something?"  I'm like, "No."  I had to go home, you know, my puppy.  I wanted to eat and just go to sleep because I had to go to work.  And then, um, I'm just really crying and crying and, and I'm trying not, you know, he's playing the radio, CD, whatever.  Neil Diamond, no less, and I'm like, "Okay, so this is good."  Um, and just listening to this, and, um, I'm just, I'm thinking of all, in my head, the church and my mom and different Christmas' and, um, good times, and that's the worst.  And, um, I'm just crying and crying and crying, and his girlfriend is crying, and I'm like, "Wow, this really sucks."  [LAUGHING].  And so now we're, we're home, we're halfway home, well, we're home actually, and, um, my brother said to me, "Do you want to come upstairs?"  and he turned around, and I just, I couldn't even talk.  I was hysterical crying.  And he didn't even say anything.  He just went into the parking garage, and just, like, took me upstairs because I had their gifts, and I guess he didn't want me to be alone because he knew I was really upset.  And we went upstairs, and, um, conned them into opening their gifts because they didn't want to open their gifts.  They, my brother's the worst.  He opens his gifts like in February, March.  He's just so horrible.  And he didn't buy Christmas cards, and she ordered me a gift from online and it didn't come in, and she felt embarrassed.  And I'm like, "Oh, please, stop.  Don't feel embarrassed."  And she was mad at him, upset, [LAUGHING], because he didn't get the cards, and she's trying to change him a little bit.  And I see it's kind of working because she lost her scarf, and she got very upset.  Her godmother bought it for her, and they started arguing when we were going, um, the cemetery, and I'm going, "Okay, just shut up, mind your business."  And I'm helping her look for the scarf, you know, and he's going because you [INAUDIBLE].  So we were in the house, and we're leaving, she's telling him, "But I don't want you going out of the house with lint on now," right?  So we were laughing.  He's like, "All right, get out of the house [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE]."  It was funny though.  We all, you know, they opened their gifts.  They liked it.  My brother liked it.  I bought him a few things, and, um, I bought her a nice, um, perfume set.  And I got him the one in men's and her in the woman's, and it was cool.  And, and he made me pick one out that he wanted, you know, for him to wear, and I picked one out for her to wear.  It was funny because they both got the same, uh, shirt.  It was funny.  And I didn't think it smelled that good.  And, um, hers was hard to pop out.  We were laughing.  And she has a picture of her mom on his table and then my mom, and she looks so much like her mom, and her mom looks like an actress.  And then I'm laughing at his house because you really have to be skinny to walk in this house.  It's just like so filled with like winter wonderland.  It's just amazing.  And, um, you know, we were just talking and laughing.  And then he asked me, "You want me to cook here for you and eat?"  because he gave me raviolis.  I'm like, "No, I'm going to go home.  I'll cook it."  And she's like, "You sure you don't want to eat here?  Stay here with us."  And I'm like, "No, it's okay."  And he, he was going to my dad's anyway and, um, I wanted something to drink.  He gives me wine.  [LAUGHING].  And we're laughing and stuff.  I'm like, "I got to go to work!"  So he's like, "Take it with you."  Then she gives me red wine and white wine to take home, and he's like "Oh, that's your Christmas present."  So, you know, that was nice, you know.  And I went home and, um, I ate dinner and my friends called me.  I, not forgot about it for a while, but I, I let it be for a while and ate.  I was with my puppy.  I played with her for a while and then went to sleep and then, um, had to work that night and it was pretty slow.  It was pretty good, so.  I made 19 years, um, [DATE].  So that was something good.  Got my sick days.  [LAUGHING].  One more year to go and the countdown continues.  And my friend keeps telling me, um, actually, my cousin's husband, "Ah, 6 more years."  I'm like, "Six more years, uh-huh."  Um, we got a raise, which was really a nice surprise.  Um, they retroed it too.  I didn't even realize that until somebody said it.  Um, Friday night I called out.  I didn't feel like going in, and, um, I had a really, like, emotional breakdown about my mom and my brother, I didn't think my brother was coming in my house.  He has the key, like, he'll knock or whatever, and he came in and I was like hysterical crying and I try not to show him, and I was going in the bathroom, and he's like, "You dressed?"  I'm like, "Yeah," you know, you're all clogged up, you know?  And he's like, "What's wrong?"  I'm like, "Nothing."  And he's like, "Are you going to work?"  I said, "No," because he wanted to see if I wanted a ride to work, and he's like, um, then I started telling him about my best friend's cat she was going to put to sleep, and the daughter wound up calling at work and said that she wasn't looking good, then she wound up not making it.  She died at the house and I was going to go with her to the cemetery to bring it up and all this, and I was telling him because he knows my best friend, and he goes, "Is this what this is about?"  and I was like, "No."  And he's like, "What's wrong?"  and I'm like, "Nothing."  He's, because I don't want to tell him.  And he's like, "Come on, talk to me."  [LAUGHING], I tell him, "I don't need to talk to you.  That's why I have a psychiatrist."  And he was like, and I was like, "It's just about mommy, that's all."  And he's like, "All right."  And then he comes over and kisses and hugs me.  He's like, "All right, just try to relax."  He's like, "All right," you know.  He gets nervous.  He doesn't know what to do, you know, and the same thing I feel too, like I don't know what to do when he cries either.  Do I go over, do I hug him?  I just stay there.  I just freeze up.  I just, like I'm frozen and, um, he's just like, he's like, 3 times he asked me, "Do you want to go for a ride?"  And I'm like, "[NAME OTHER] is coming over," which is my best friend.  She was working 4:00 to 12:00 and I was going to relieve her.  The one that, with her cat, but, um, she was coming over because she had to pick up a, a thank you card for another operator that I picked up and I wasn't going in, so she came over.  I said, "No, she's coming over," you know, "after work."  And he's like, "All right."  And I'm like, you know, I asked him where his girlfriend was.  He said in the car.  He was like, "You sure you don't want to come over?"  I am like, "No."  He was like, "You sure you don't want to go out?"  I was like, "No, I can't."  So then again, he hugged and kissed me.  He's like, "All right," he's like, "Just relax," you know.  [LAUGHING]  He was like, you know and it was cool.  And I haven't' seen him or heard from him since.  [LAUGHING].  That was Friday.  He goes, "I got your Christmas card, but I didn't write it out yet."  I was like, "All right."  And that was that.  Um, Wednesday, New Year's Eve, I'm off and we're all getting together.  My uncle and his best friend, my girlfriend and her husband, me and my boyfriend, we're going across the street from the house.  Um, it's at a bar/restaurant, friends I know that own it, and, um, it's going to be a 9:00 seating that's, um, a dinner, which is, uh, like a set menu, and then they'll have a DJ, you know, that they, last year I couldn't go because I was working, and I was going to go with my uncle and his best friend, but I have a mass for my brother and my mom.  They, um, they dedicate the mass to them.  Um, it's, we leave at 7:30, so this is a 9:00 seating, which worked out perfect.  So I'm going to go to the mass, me and my boyfriend, at 7:30, and, um, I told my brother Christmas day that I had a mass if they wanted to come.  You know, I don't know how he feels about going.  He said, "All right."  I'm going to call and remind him.  My sister's in Jersey.  I don't know.  My uncle was supposed to come with me when I wrote it, but he's going to be doing something else.  He said he'll go that day and light a candle for her, so I said, "All right," because when I did it, I said, "And you're coming," because that was the only thing they had available.  You have to go and do this real early to get certain dates that you want, and I wanted either their birthdays or their anniversary dates, but, um, they do it after Columbus Day for the next year.  And it's really hard, but that's all they had, so, you know what?  It's okay.  New Year's Eve and it'll be all right.  I know it's going to probably be really hard because what they do is they do a regular mass, and they, they say the peoples names that passed away that week and then, I'd rather the priest say it, and I'm hoping it's the priest I want,   [LAUGHING], I hope it is.  I really like it when he says it, but usually the girl that speaks [INAUDIBLE].  Then they'll say that, you know, um, this mass is dedicated, and it's going to be my brother and my mom so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "Okay."  To hear their names is going to be like, you know, I already did that once.  I had a, I think a mass for my brother.  No.  I think when they said his name and my mom they screwed up my mom's name.  I was so upset.  They said [NAME OTHER], they said [NAME OTHER].  Wh, that, that week when she passed away, they say the names, of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, the fallen heroes and everything, and they called her [NAME OTHER], and I was so upset and then the priest that I like was there, and I was just like so mad because they screwed her name up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's been horrible.  I've been dreaming so much about my mom.  Some of the dreams are where I know she's dead, and some of them I know she's alive.  Um, I had a dream this morning when I was sleeping about someone attacking me at the job.  My mom was alive in this dream.  I don't know who this person was, but my mom kept asking me what was wrong, and I would never tell her anything.  I would never talk to her like that and she kept asking me, and I wouldn't tell her.  Um, I guess, I don't know, I mean, I dream about her.  I've been dreaming about her often, so I guess, the holiday, the holidays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need any more medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just got them a while ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have any more prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can write it out with no dates.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like you just fill in the date, and just, you know, I take the antidepressant when I wake up, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The mood one is half in the morning and then half at, or the whole one at night, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Make sure I got it right.  [LAUGHING].  You know I had it wrong last time.  Okay, now I'm right, because that one's supposed to be with the migraine, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], when she wrote you that note, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Sometimes I get really bad ones.  Um, [NAME OTHER]'s been texting.  He's been working.  He called me, he got really confused about what I was texting him, like  a 3 page thing, and I was laughing because I knew he was going to text me, and he was going to call me, and we were laughing, but that's been it.  And actually when he brought his girlfriend for Christmas, he said, I said, "Oh, now it's his girlfriend."  One day it's his girlfriend, the next day he says friends with benefits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But so, it's not the same.  I mean when I talk to him, it feels the same, like I'm happy, and, you know, then when I hang up I'm like sad and I feel, like that, that gut thing like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When somebody punches you in the stomach, in your gut, but, um, he, I texted him Christmas day.  I said "Merry Christmas," and he texted me "Merry Christmas" and um, "Hope you got what you" - oh, "It was nightmare in the ER, and I hope you got what you wanted from Santa."  He texted me one night, "Do you still have the hots for me?"  Now, we were working together, and I'm like, "What are you talking about?  And he goes, "It's just a question."  I'm like, "Why you asking me this question."  He just [INAUDIBLE].  So he told me, "I don't think you still have the hots for me."  Then he started with the dragon dog bullshit, and then he was telling me about something with a ped's resident that    liked him.  I said, "Ah, please.  Here we go again."  It's something with the ped's attending told him that the resident liked him, that he was hot looking.  I said, "Oh please.  Yeah, okay.  Fine.  Whatever.  You're hot looking."  Then the other night I was reading him something about horoscopes and he says, "Oh you believe that, but you don't believe mine."  I said, "Because yours is stupid.  You ain't going to know until you try.  You believe something that's not real.  You don't' know that, but I told him, "You know what?  In the end you're going to see who the last person's going to be standing," I told him, "And you'll see."  "What does that mean?"  [LAUGHING].  I was like, "Shut up.  You're stupid."  Oh, he wanted me to ask you, I told him, I said, "You know what?  I think you need to have your head examined."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I was telling him I got the Christmas present late this year for [PHYSICIAN NAME].  We were laughing.  I said, "I got him a tie."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was like, "Stupid.  Thanks for helping me."  He goes, "Well, how am I supposed to know if he wears a tie or he wears scrubs in the ER?"  I'm like, "You know what?  You're an idiot because you're a doctor."  He goes, "And you go with him and sit next to him one on one and you wouldn't know?"  I said, "I don't sit next to him, I sit across from him."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he goes, and you can't remember if he wears a tie."  I'm like, "Shut up already."  He goes, "Well, who's the idiot?"  I don't know, I was talking to him the other day about you, you know, I always joke and stuff.  I, you know, always have to joke.  Oh yeah, can I joke?  Yeah, I can joke, right?  Yeah, it's okay.  [LAUGHING].  It's funnier with the recorder.  That thing's going to love me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He goes, I said, "You know, [PHYSICIAN NAME] really thinks I'm crazy.  You know that, right [NAME OTHER]?"  I always joke with him, right.  So he goes, "You need to ask [PHYSICIAN NAME] how long you're going to be going to him."  I said, "Why?  Why, you planning on calling and telling him to keep me or something?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He goes, "No just ask him long you're go, how long you're going to be going there," so I have to ask you how long am I going to be coming here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really don't, indefinitely because, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, wait a minute.  Indefinitely means for the rest of your life?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which means I'm not going to ever get like a summer break?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's really going to be up to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, I tried to explain that to him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, why, I said, "Why would I ask him," I said, "You want me to ask him so I can look stupid, right, because you know what the answer's going to be."  And he's like, "No, just ask him.  See what he says."  I said, "But [NAME OTHER], you know that it's really based upon me, it's on me because if I tell him I don't want to come here no more, then he's not going to say, "Well, [PATIENT NAME], you have to."  He's not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going to tie me to the chair.  He goes, "No, but I will."  I was like, [LAUGHING], "You're stupid."  I don't know, he just, I'm going to tell him, "I asked [PHYSICIAN NAME] and he told me it's indefinite.  You happy now?  He upped my meds."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  The night you were, one night you were working in the ER, I don't know if it was the last night, thank you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, I don't know if it was the last night you were there, or one night, he said, "I'm going to go up to him, and I'm going to say, "So how's, how's loony?"  She's loony, right?  She's crazy?"  I'm like, "Don't you dare!"  He goes, "I'm serious.  I'm going to go up to him, and I'm going to tell him."  I said, "Don't you dare say that I'm loony," I said, "Because if he finds, he's going to believe you, one doctor to another, and he's going to give me all these drugs.  [LAUGHING].  I'm going to be so drugged out."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I kept telling him, I said, "All right, go ahead."  So I was like, I was bl, I recalled his bluff, so I kept calling.  I said, "Did you tell him yet?  Did you call him and tell him yet?  Did you see him?"  "Nah, he got a lot of patients."  I said, "Should I go up there and be one?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's like, "Yeah, come up here."  He would call me, he was like, "Your doctor's here."  I'm like, "Yeah I know, I'm talking to him," you know.  I thought he meant him.  He goes, "No," he goes, "[PHYSICIAN NAME]'s here tonight."  I'm like, "Yeah, I know.  I saw his name on the schedule."  I'm like, "So what are you trying to say?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "So what do you want?"  I think last time I said, "[NAME OTHER], I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME], he says hi."  She says, "I know.  I love him.  I miss him so much."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "Isn't he nice?"  She's like, "Don't you just love his voice?"  I said, "You know, I said the same thing,"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, "I told him about his voice.  It's just something about his voice.  Even when I talked to him over the phone and I never knew him, you know, just by talking to him, he was just always so nice.  No matter what hour of the morning you beeped him, when a doctor calls you back at 3:00 in the morning and says, "Hi operator, how are you?"  and is not screaming at you, that's a good doctor."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was laughing.  I said, "You know what's so funny?  I told him, "All these years we worked together, who ever thought I'd be your patient?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told [NAME OTHER] that, so he was like, "Oh, my God."  I said, "Look at you, 15 years I been working with you.  Who thought I would be your best friend for 2 years?  But then again, I don't know about you getting smacked up a little bit."  Okay, not to be mean, but how was your Christmas?  I'm sorry, that was rude.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You asked me how mine was.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, mine, mine was good.  It was good.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I could see you again on [DATE] or [DATE], Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, Monday's good, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, anytime.  Afternoon, evening, whatever.  Whatever works for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two o'clock?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always say, "I love his last name, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  He reminds me of Madonna, Get Into the Groove, that song."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]'s like, "Oh, my God, you are so crazy."  I said, "You think?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Do these new prescriptions say your right address?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Cool.  I noticed that.  Look at that.  [LAUGHING].  I'm getting better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, the cards too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to tell, I'll help, I wonder when he's working?  Oh, I think he worked the weekend.  I'm going to text him and tell him indefinite, you happy now?  Okay, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, see you then.  Have a great New Year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You too, thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nice seeing again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

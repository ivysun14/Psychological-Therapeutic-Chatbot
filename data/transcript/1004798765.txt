<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Magic. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Only two months [ph? [00:00:36] to figure out. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm. (pause) So yesterday after I got home—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, I was (pause) still feeling weird about (pause) my friend potentially not (pause) [inaudible [00:01:11] thought my friends didn't want to hang out with me. Although, for whatever reason, this morning when I woke up, I was like, "Wow. So that was (pause) really not what was happening," which was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is good. </p>

<p>[0:01:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice to wake up and feel a little less crazy about it. Umm. (pause) So one of the—I don't know (sigh) so Ashby and I have our disputes as we do, and (pause) </p>

<p>So she has a bad toothache. She's had it for several weeks. It almost definitely needs a root canal. (pause) And the dentist that she's going to (pause) like she got the dentist through Groupon. Which I was like, "Mmm." </p>

<p>And she doesn't like them at all. Like she's always in a lot of pain and last time they were like (pause) you're [inaudible [00:02:30]. And so, I was like, "You know, you should maybe consider my dentist, who also takes your insurance." But (pause) she actually wouldn't talk about her toothache for a while because she's worried about how expensive a root canal is. </p>

<p>[0:02:48]</p>

<p>So that's been making her really [inaudible [00:02:50]. And then she talked to her mom and was upset that her mom didn't offer to pay for it, even though she doesn't want money from her mom. But she wants her to offer. </p>

<p>Then I was like, "You know, again, my dentist." And she's like, "No, it's going to cost like $4,000." The fuck... you know it doesn't cost that much. I'm really sure. But (pause) it's hard because I was feeling (pause) kind of down and not feeling great, and then (pause) she was like super, "My entire face hurts, and I'm really upset. And our dental insurance sucks." (pause) And so it was, I don't know, hard to interact or talk to her. I think for me—we just run out of [inaudible [00:03:46]. </p>

<p>[0:03:49]</p>

<p>And her other major area of freaking out is about cleaning when other people come over. (pause) And a friend of mine is coming over next weekend. (pause) So. (pause)</p>

<p>One of the things that's frustrating is I have a hard time getting her to communicate what she wants. (pause) As you know. And so she ends up saying, "Well, it just needs to be clean. There's just all this filth everywhere," which makes me not want to anything. "Well, if the house is covered in filth then, it's already ruined so, there's no point." </p>

<p>And also (pause) I'm just like—I know she gets melodramatic et cetera, but because [inaudible [00:04:46] and whatever I just want to I don't know—(pause) it felt more like she was maybe being serious. </p>

<p>[0:04:55]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Which I don't know. [inasudible0:05:06] always worry about. And I (pause) like I've got—I know that a lot of this about—she thinks people—her fear of being judged. But there's also—our apartment has been kind of messy lately. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:05:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you—are you worried about her not liking you anymore either?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't—we're not (pause) in some ways we're a good roommate match.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In other ways we're really not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And those being (pause) her worries that everyone is judging her based on how clean the house is. And by clean, she actually means cluttered. (pause) So if there's anything on the TV stand, it's disgusting and filthy. But if it's not, then it's awesome. The TV stand could be dusty and have cobwebs, but if it's free of things on it, then it's clean. </p>

<p>Which I don't (pause) I guess that's part of it. I don't really—she can't articulate to me what she wants, but she needs it clean. And things that I think are not clean. She'll say like, "I don't understand why you think that matters." And I'm like, "I don't know what you want, and you won't tell me." So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>[0:06:53]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we have a broken ironing board that is (pause) in the up stage, in the unfolded stage in the dining room. And I was like, "Wow. That's kind of—its' broken. We should really get rid of it." She wanted to get rid of it before, but that was only because Ashby's going to be upset that there's this ironing board in the dining room. And then she started going on about how that was crazy, of course she wouldn't be upset about ironing room—an ironing board. </p>

<p>What was bothering [ph? [00:07:27] her was the things on the ironing board. (pause) So... umm. That kind of discussion—if we're not [inaudible [00:07:39]. And I don't think we have very good argument styles. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like, together? </p>

<p>[0:07:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As well as individually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like with each other. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the fit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she likes to fly off the handle. And I really, really don't like it. (pause) And just sort of the general (pause) she's worried that no one likes her. Sometimes she'll get (pause) like really fixated on that, and then sometimes anything that I do is proof of how much I hate her. (pause) And she won't tell me that and so we're just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>[0:08:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... umm. (pause) I don't really know. But we get along with other things...so. But I do worry that she's—I worry that she's building up anger and resentment and it's going to just explode. In part because (pause) she's mentioned I think her last two housing situations kind of ended with her having a huge fight with her roommate. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her blowing out of there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I'm like well, "Then again, one of those times you were 23." Meh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long have you guys been living together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been four years. (pause) Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>[0:10:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, also I've never lived without roommates, which (pause) I think it was normal. (pause) But periodically I think, "Oh maybe I should experience life without roommates." (pause) I don't know like grownups don't have roommates or whatever. I actually thought that. (pause) So initially I was roommates with friends at college. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>[0:10:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I decided to experiment with people—like complete strangers from Craigslist. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you may worry about (pause) driving people away when you take up space. Like your friends, if I'm remembering correctly it was because you hadn't gotten back to them or you hadn't sort of I think maybe you felt if you imposed in some way (pause) or reacted based on kind of what you needed to do rather than taking care of the relationship in some way. </p>

<p>And I guess it's the same with Ashby. Not that it would be easy to figure out what you even could do, necessarily (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right</p>

<p>[0:11:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To take care of things with her. But in a way, it doesn't matter in that she sometimes makes it clear that there are ways in which you don't. (pause) And I (pause) Yeah. I think it sometimes it can be that way with how you feel about things as well. You're worried that putting those out there, having them take up space will cause problems, which at work it seems to do all the time, which is kind of a dilemma that you're so often there. Which I'm not saying it's your fault. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right</p>

<p>[0:12:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just saying it seems sort of in parallel. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do agree with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Taking up space emotionally or physically does feel (pause) difficult. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you worry about that here? I'm not imagining you take up space much. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't (pause) think so, but (pause) I don't know like I have a hard time conceiving about how that would look. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something that occurred to me is that sometimes (pause) presenting or illustrating, (pause) knowing how a situation unfolded so as to like kind of demonstrate to me why you felt what you felt rather than just kind of saying it. And you know I think, in that sense, I think it can feel for you at times sort of, (pause) being worried like I will ignore or dismiss or criticize. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:14:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess then, yes in that that's kind of how I always feel taking—when trying to talk about my feelings with other people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So I guess yes and no, it's not unique. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My hunch is that you—in certain ways, it feels maybe a little less so here, but maybe I'm wrong about that. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just such a (pause) I don't know (pause) like that's pretty much how I talk about things. It's hard to (pause) figure whether it would be more or less so I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>[0:15:50]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although you know I am less worried about imposing or talking a lot about something depressive. (pause). </p>

<p>[0:16:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:16:52] why Ashby hadn't, or why I have a hard time talking with Ashby. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: When she (pause) she tends to express herself about most things very (pause) intensely. Like really hyperbolically and very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dramatically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dramatically. Loudly. (pause) Seeing how she's a sports fan and screams at the TV. (pause) and other things, but (pause) so (pause) I don't know. It's—partially I feel like I never know when she's going to suddenly get really—like they'll be some weeks she'll be really angry. (pause) And also just I don't know, it feels really like (pause) I mean, big for lack of a better word (pause). </p>

<p>[0:18:24]</p>

<p>I don't know. It's like a sort of big attempt—like desire for attention. Really, really loud. And umm (pause). </p>

<p>THERAPISTHERAPIST: Like taking up quite a lot of space?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also (pause) her life is never—like nothing satisfies. So </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not only does she take up a lot of space, like the more space—like if I give her—I'm like, "Oh I'll give some more space." It's like it will extend to fill. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:19:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm (pause). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think (pause) you being in relationships where you feel kind of I think somewhat hemmed in that way is very familiar. Like I (pause) my impression is that you grew up with that in a really major way. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. (pause) Your mom didn't really leave any room for how you felt. I don't get a sense that your dad took up a lot of space. I think from what you've told me, it sounds like he just (pause) wasn't much for (pause) talking about or expressing [inaudible [00:20:19] things. </p>

<p>[0:20:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I don't get the feeling that he sort of hemmed you in, it just kind of (pause) it didn't leave you a lot of room either. Where with your mom [inaudible [00:20:32] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mom was kind of—is very much like (pause) like she's very big, and then any available room is sort of like she wants at it too. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:21:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:21:03] do you think she might be a little paranoid about feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I always mean that in a sort of colloquial that's like (pause) very anxious. They feel unpredictable and dangerous and she has to have like a (pause) sort of categorically (pause) cut herself off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, (pause) I think that pretty much does describe it, her. I mean, the few times when she does get very like (pause) [inaudible [00:22:12] your feelings. It's like to me, I'm always like, that out of everything that's the things that hurt your feelings and it really bothers her for a long time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>[0:22:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. The way she was around her mother's death was (pause) (sigh) kind of weirdly, grimly closed off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Weirdly grimly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because it was very like (pause) I don't know. (pause) She just—I mean she was (pause) obviously no—she's obviously sad—it was just like (pause) it was really grim and just this like (pause) "We're not having emotions. We'll have none of this"</p>

<p>And like (pause) you know she wouldn't say that she was sad about her mother's death really. She was like, "Well she was old." Her response when I kind of asked her—her responses were mostly, "She was old. It wasn't unexpected because she was old and sort of a variety of things." </p>

<p>And at the time she was—got very angry at me once when I called and said I was thinking about, you know my grandmother. I was just being sad and kind of missing her. So I called my mom. And she was very intensely angry. (pause) And it was—something—you shouldn't feel upset because it happened. She was already dead, and she was old. And not to be sad because she was going to die. And if I was upset then I'd become depressed, and I can't do that So... (pause).</p>

<p>[0:24:46]</p>

<p>Yeah it was really weird. She's also like extra irritable and just (pause) me traveling for a funeral is never fun but (pause) it was more difficult. Also in part because she (pause) kind of wanted to do some things as if we were visiting—like for not a funeral. (pause) Which was (pause) I don't know—made me totally uncomfortable. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:25:44]</p>

<p>You know. (pause) It's such a weird (pause) When her father died, she was a little more expressive about it because it was more of a surprise. He died in his sleep. He was older and heart condition, but (pause) you know he was totally fine when he went to bed. (pause) So I was upset and also very shocked. (pause) But with my grandmother's death she was just—I don't know. </p>

<p>[0:26:41]</p>

<p>My grandmother's death I think she wanted to sort of (pause) have everything go like her way or a certain way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And then she was mad at two of her siblings. They had a totally typical sibling fight over (pause) whether one of my aunts respected one of the other aunt's kids for having nonacademic jobs and being sporty. Which I think is an argument they've had for like a decade. My mom was really mad about it. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:27:44]</p>

<p>I feel so frustrated because it's hard to get my mom to talk about her family in general. (pause) Usually she'll just drop random bombs and we're like, "What?" (pause) But this is more so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was also (pause) really weird about things that my grandmother wanted like me to have or my brother to have or my other cousins to have. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But I don't know why. She was just kind of intense about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>[0:28:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This can make it quite difficult for you. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like sometimes (pause) I'm sort of like, "Okay guys, let's have emotions." And my mom's like "No." And my dad doesn't really comment. And my brother's like, "You know. emotions can be good." (pause) His wife [0:29:39] is really expressive, but she's nice. I no longer feel like the lone crazy person feeling things. (pause) </p>

<p>[0:29:57]</p>

<p>But it's still scarred. Things get in when it's just me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:30:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was thinking about how (pause) my dad's health is not as good as my mom's. So [inaudible [00:31:08]. (pause) And thinking about him being sick or in the hospital and how it's going to be really just awful to deal with. (pause) Because my mom won't want to- probably won't want to tell my brother and I. Won't want to be upset or sad or just like "Uhh." (pause) I don't know. I think my dad would be more likely to sort of express himself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:31:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm also—I think, "What would my mom focus on?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh (pause) It hurts. (pause) (sniffling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't sound crazy at all. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:32:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being worried about my mom?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being worried and being like emotional and thinking about (pause) how she'll be and your dad sick or dying [ph?0:33:05]. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it just—it's hard to think about. Yes, with dad, but also because (pause) they both just don't want to tell us [inaudible [00:33:34] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or they'll like say something six months later. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:33:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like—I don't know. It makes me feel like out of (pause) this important thing that's going on that (pause) I mean it was like—I don't know—my mom sort of—the year after my dad first retired, my mom then told me that he was really exhausted and slept all day for like three months. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you're not hearing about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm (pause) So (pause) yeah I don't—I feel like my dad is totally someone who would still [inaudible [00:34:36] days forever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) It's like hard to talk to him about it, talking about his heart. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also (pause) when we have, (pause) my mom usually gets (pause) really mad that we're talking about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And we'll usually then talk about how she thinks it's stupid to have a gravestone or marker, because you're dead so who cares? (pause) And my brother and I [inaudible [00:35:22] really, "Well maybe we want to go to your gravestone." And she just sort of grumbled in [inaudible [00:35:31] fashion and I'm like, "Okay I guess that's what we're doing." (pause) </p>

<p>[0:35:40]</p>

<p>You know like—I don't know. I feel like she will, if she could she'd be mad if I mourned her when she died. (pause) Like she doesn't want a gravestone. She doesn't want kind of anything. And like (pause) So one of my dad's wishes is he wants to be buried near his mother and sisters. And my mom wants to be cremated and ashes scattered in the ocean. But the only point that I have asked her, do you want a double gravestone with my dad even if you're not there, do you want—and her main comment was that it was a waste of money (pause) and stupid, but also expensive.</p>

<p>[0:36:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. I mean obviously we can just go out and do whatever we want. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's still (pause) really sucky to deal with before. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Also sucky to think about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:37:18]</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffling) </p>

<p>[0:38:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're being hurtful or disrespectful if you have feelings about things?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom has really vocally said that it upsets her. (pause) The idea of (pause) her parenting being criticized by my brother's psychiatrist or therapist or mine is extremely upsetting to her. Like that's one of the few times that she's really sort of expressed emotions that's even close to what she's having. (pause) </p>

<p>[0:38:54]</p>

<p>Which makes it hard because she's like—she was really clear more than once a bunch [ph? [00:39:06] about she thinks it's unfair, and it really hurts her feelings. And (pause) (sigh) (pause) So I mean it does make it hard to talk about her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other thing, which (pause) my brother and I both encounter is—although he more so than I—(pause) kind of pathologizing [ph? [00:39:40] my parents interracial relationship...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...for being the reason why my brother and I have [inaudible [00:39:45] problems. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Yeah I think you may have mentioned that to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) What is it, two psychiatrists sort of insist that's why you've got [inaudible [00:40:04]. (pause) Yeah. I mean one of them was at Dartmouth, and one of them was elsewhere. So, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not aware I've ever done anything like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I would have [ph? [00:40:21] stuck to you if you had. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Sure. As well you should. (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So and in both cases that we're talking about, my brother wasn't getting good care because the person was really focused on that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Time's up for now. Talk to you on Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Wait, actually no. I have a [inaudible [00:40:54] appointment on Monday</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning maybe?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll check. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't remember if we talked about it or not. </p>

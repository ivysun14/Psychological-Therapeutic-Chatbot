<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how yesterday you were talking about how no one ever says anything in the family and ... Perfect example was my dad, my brother and I had gotten into a big fight last night, uh-hmm, not my brother and I, but my dad was very upset with my brother and I since his birthday which was May 12th, and hasn't said anything to us until last night. And he's upset because we didn't see him on his actual birthday, uh-hmm, I don't know he just, he acts like in these passive-aggressive ways and he, this was really bent out of shape because we weren't there on his birthday but I don't understand why he's so upset because it was on a Thursday night and I had to work late and I thought that he would have understood. And I had called him ahead of time, like he didn't think we were coming and didn't show up, but we told him that we weren't going to be able to make it on Thursday, could do something Friday or Saturday. And he was like no that's okay I can just see you the next weekend so we saw him the following weekend. And I thought it was fine.</p>

<p>And then he had hosted Thanksgiving, which was surprisingly good, we thought. And he has been like festering for like probably six weeks now because we didn't see him on his birthday. So I was trying to explain like why are you so upset when I said I couldn't make it, why wouldn't you just say like I was hoping to see you. And he just kept saying like it was the point you didn't cook me dinner, you didn't get me a cake, but he has all these food allergies and whenever we try to do anything he doesn't want it anyways.</p>

<p>So it was really frustrating that he been so adamant but just mean like he was like I know I can't count on my kids to take care of me when I die someday might as well just start saving my money now because you're going to stick me in a State nursing home. And then he throws his, probably his favorite phrase, if I can take care of 20 kids but 20 kids can't take care of one father, then he would say how would you like it if you don't get Christmas gifts this year. I said personally I really don't care you don't need to give me a Christmas gift. And this went on for like 40 minutes of him ... 00:02:35</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was ranting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ranting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you, you were with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, on the phone. And so I was just like I don't know what you want me to tell you I'm really sorry if you're upset. If you were that upset I really wish you would have just said like I'm lonely I want to see you or something. Like I would have tried to made accommodations but I went dad like I was working late by the time I would have got to your house it would have been like 9, 9:30 and you go to sleep like (inaudible at 00:03:02) anyways and you work late too. Like it was on a week night like and furthermore like you don't make huge efforts to see me, it's just like he wants everyone to do for him. Like, see like, I don't know, it's just like he was being really (inaudible at 00:03:18), irrational and unreasonable and.</p>

<p>I was really annoyed and I was thinking how I was going to bring it up in today's session and then I'm like I'm really sick of just wasting my energy like getting upset on him and I'm like sick of talking about it to the point I'm like I want to be just like don't talk to me then because we're better off when we don't talk to each other. And then he started like just complaining about Christmas and there's just three of us and so I was like you know isn't the three of us like the most important three that was there like me, you and Brian. And he's like well there's no one else like well, I wanted to just say like no one else because you're driving (inaudible at 00:04:03) away but at that moment I felt I couldn't deal with the wrath (inaudible at 00:04:07). It's just that this ... but I think like this like why nobody wants to be around you. And he just kept saying like I cared for my father when he was sick and dying, I cared for ... and first you're not sick and dying, it was your birthday and secondly like you really didn't care for them like you took them to hospital appointments but like my mom took care of them, like physically like took care. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was great it didn't sound like you said that damn but that was pretty funny you're not sick and dying it was your birthday. (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I, it partly feels bad because I know that like in his head he probably feels really alone and then so I guess a part of me felt bad because I know that I can't be accommodating to all of his loneliness all the time. So there's like a little pain of guilt there but at the same time I'm like, I feel like it's not reasonable. And then he complained about the gift that he got that it was too late and I'm just like, I don't know it just made you sound selfish. (inaudible at 00:05:20). My brother and I were talking after and I'm like I'm just sick of this and I guess it all started with, he asked my brother to do a favor, he said that ... the things he asks are just nuts. My brother lives in, I don't know if you're familiar with like the New England area. My brother lives in Plymouth, he rents like a mechanic space so he can work on his truck in (inaudible at 00:05:46). So and my dad was (inaudible at 00:05:49) and my dad is in Taunton and he forgot his bag of like money to cash out for the day. So he like randomly calls my brother up in Franklin, asks is he could drive to Taunton to get the stuff, bring it to my dad in Walpole and then my brother would go home. My brother was like I'm sorry I'm busy look I can't and then this is what started the you never do anything for anyone and you know it's like I'm really sorry I can't, you know. And I'm just like why is this his problem. It's not like he lives down the road he wants him to go, you know 15 miles north to go 25 miles south and then go back up. And then that started with like you never help your family, I can't count on you for anything, you and your sister, you disappointed me. And then my brother called me so I called him to be like dad like you're upset like how come you didn't tell me and then it just started.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I feel like you started it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but I feel like should I have not, like I feel like I tried to address an issue because if not he'll go on like pretending like everything is fine so would the right thing to have done been like ignore it and just not I mean maybe with him like this is how I should deal with it but should I not have said anything and then Christmas happens and I pretend that everything is hunky dories? But look I don't know how to deal with him. 00:07:23</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean pretend, pretend like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he like, you can tell him he's off, like I've known that he is off for pretty much since Thanksgiving, after. Because he usually calls me and he doesn't or he hasn't and then I called him to say goodbye before I went on my trip and he was just like I'm asleep and I can't talk now I'll talk to you later. But, and he does that sometimes but he usually calls the next day and I didn't hear from him. So Christmas will come and we'll be at the house and he'll be quite and he'll be acting funny and then I feel like its, well I could do kind of what I did last night and you seem upset or Neil told me that you're upset which creates what happened last night or I just ignore his weird signals and pretends that we're carrying on as just fine. Because there's just no (inaudible at 00:08:20) talking with him. I was talking to with a Lawn Doctor and now I know why you don't like to talk about things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't understand that before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like he, no not to the full extent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think about last night made it different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think just getting like ... I'm starting to not care more and not care about my relationship with him more and not care about it like personally and like feeling guilty less. I feel like, I still feel bad but I'm kind of like, I don't know like I'm not going to be miserable because you're miserable like, like what I feel like the now like I'm just like I'm really sorry that you're unhappy but I don't say this to him it's just going on in my head like I don't know what to tell you like if you don't want to do anything to be miserable, I mean to be happy, you want to be miserable well like, well don't drag me down with you. 00:09:31</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you feel like you were more open with him now and that's why he like what do you think shifted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I am more open, we just (inaudible at 00:09:40) about like family stuff on vacation. I think he was more like receptive to what I was saying because I feel like I've kind of been saying the same thing but maybe when I was talking I was like more calm versus like in the moment like venting to him. And that was more like this is kind of the situation and it really sucks and really talking about it. But yeah like, like I don't even know what to do with my dad, like when he makes you feel bad because I'm like you probably will end up in a nursing home someday, can't guilt, I don't know.</p>

<p>Kids and then probably ... this is when I start to feel bad about other things like should I be like the good daughter who like invites him into my home to live with me because he has a fear of like going into a nursing home. I'm like the man is such a grumpy, nasty man who I have like a bad relationship with anyways, like that's mean but like I don't want to ruin my life because he, I don't know doesn't want to go into a nursing home. And the man is 52, he's not sick and dying right now, why he is like laying this guilt on us? And then I feel like I almost start to get irrational because when he says like random, not obscure things, but like it makes me like get like all this defensive mode and start like popping on things like he like hasn't done for me that like maybe I don't really care about but I just feel like he's like naming all these random things and then just it just hurts to (inaudible at 00:11:17).</p>

<p>Like, I was just like do you make an extra effort to see me on my birthday? Do you say like I'll come over and get you and you can do something? I don't know. Like when he talks about like us taking care of him and like you, I don't know, like don't go out of your way to do anything for us and he just kept saying like my parents were a priority, my parents were a priority and then I'm like well you don't really make your kids a priority so. He's just like, he's stuck in these like, I don't know. Like he grew up as an only child, half sibling, half brother, but I don't know if he's just like in his own little world, he can't get along with anyone as we discussed. You stop trying to figure him out because the man is not changing and I'm like I just keep thinking of like all these things that are wrong with him and I've been trying to build this logic in my head so I can make some sort of sense of it or.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if that's true what would you be trying to make sense of? 00:12:29</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm trying to come to, I'm trying to like build this, like, I feel like nobody is not changing but I'm trying to build like this like final conclusion so I can like wash my hands of everything and like move on. But that's not good sometimes either because I feel like when I make decisions like sometimes like they're not always permanent but in my head it's like the final. Because (inaudible at 00:12:58) you know maybe you're, (inaudible at 00:13:01) relationship for like the next five, ten years and then maybe it will be okay in the future. But for me like that hanging over it like I don't know, it's, maybe it's not simply but I want to know like are we ever going to get along or are we not? Can I like build peace with myself and move on and accept it like you're nasty and I can't have a relationship with you or do I keep trying? That's like this, I'm always like wheels are turning, I'm like trying to think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're wanting some sense of certainty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't think that I am but like I know but like it's well certain to like we're going to have, I mean I don't think he's going to change one day and start being more like open, feed back. I don't know I think the way that we (inaudible at 00:14:00) or care. So, and then I feel bad because I, at first I almost should be sad but I feel like I just don't care and then the fact that I don't care makes me feel sad because I feel like I should care. And then he keeps blaming, when why we're all like upset with him, on the divorce and I'm like well maybe like mom was there and kept like, since everyone was like in the same like household in the family it felt a little better, but like the problems that I have with you like are not do to the divorce it's do to like the relationship we have and like the type of people we are and how he interacts with people. And he would never understand that. And then he is still harping on the divorce and last night I was just like enough like it has been, I don't even know, more then five years, 2006, I think, like I don't know. And then, I don't know, I just feel bad because I'm like does he need some sort of a help to get him through this, like he needs to talk to someone. But and then like I feel like but because I want to help him but I can't (inaudible at 00:15:36) because is he just a jackass or is he like so sad and lonely that he can't, like he can't deal with it. And I feel like it's a combination of both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be better if it were one or the other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me, yes because (inaudible at 00:15:56) I have some certainty. Like you're sad and lonely then I'll probably still be like persistent to help you but then I'll still, I don't know, be annoyed. And then I feel like if you just don't want to help yourself and you're just being difficult then I really need to stop wasting my time and effort and energy on trying to help you when you don't need help but in my eyes being (inaudible at 00:16:27) anyways. And like it just needs, I don't want to be around you like Christmas is next weekend so now my boyfriend is like oh God we have to go over there and he's going to be all nasty and I don't know. We're spending Christmas Day with him not Christmas Eve. And then he was kind of upset about that and then he brought up New Years and I don't even see you on New Years normally why are you upset about it. And when I state like right now I'm annoyed that I'm, I don't want to say wasting my time, but annoyed that he's like the top of the conversation constantly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You started by saying that today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I don't know I feel like he takes up to much negative space like last night was a good portion of my conversation with Anon was like talking to him about that and then like my brother and I were talking about it and then I'm thinking about it and I'm like, not that I just want it to go away but like, you know, it took up like two and a half hours of my evening like I wasn't relaxing or doing something for myself and at the end of the day he, I feel like he doesn't have any of those like, maybe he has the thoughts, but he's not trying to make anything better. It's like he gets angry and he gets off the phone and he sits in his own little cranky world. But like clearly it annoys me so I don't have to like, well I don't want to ignore the matter but I don't know I feel like maybe it's time, like it just takes time and actually like over time it has been getting better but like I still feel, I still do both things and I'm not working there and slowly I'm starting to not be as upset about our relationship as I use to but (inaudible at 00:18:31) annoyed. And like my father I really want to tell him that no one is around him because nobody likes him and I'm like he needs to care about. And I'm like it's not our job to tell him that like because he just sees it as like a mean personal attack versus trying to get him to maybe do some soul searching and realize how, like why people don't want to be with him. 00:19:13</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were saying yesterday that you felt that he was under the illusion that people did like being with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And my brother once told him that no one does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then hoping that that will make him think about how he treats people but I don't think that he has that level of thought and will just get really angry that we said that and then it's just the same phrases like, you're ungrateful. Why are we ungrateful? I'm like, I mean obviously in his mind we're ungrateful but I just think like you haven't really done anything for us but, not that I want anything, but he just. Like he says these mean things and he has a way of like, like I feel like an outsider, I feel like well if he hasn't really done anything for you why are you getting gray or upset that he says that you're ungrateful. But like he just has this way of making it stick and then like really deeply making you feel guilty and like crap and like everything is your fault. And like my brother and I have talked about it, like my mom has like mentioned before and like if you try to tell him this is like where it comes like I don't like sharing any of my feelings like if you try to tell him you're upset like you're just weak, you're a baby, you're being stupid and then like if you ... You know I've had conversations, years ago when I would like have been telling him that and then as he is saying this like I've become visibly upset because I'm upset about it and he tells you like you're crazy. So you end up feeling like nothing, you're nuts it felt like, you know you're making a big deal out of nothing. Am I being too sensitive? What's wrong with me that I'm so upset and he would like, you know was thinking like way up here that everything is fine. So I feel like if I am upset like I usually just deal with it myself because if I tell him I'm upset I end up being more upset because I feel like, you know, something is wrong with me or he doesn't care or (inaudible at 00:21:23). Deal with it myself. But then I'm going to have to realize that not everyone is like that but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like with both your parents you guys aren't living in the same reality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you try to share more of what you experience they shut you out rather then welcome you in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so I feel like that really carries over to like a lot of ... that's like I mean I'll see something usually if I'm like angry but it has to do with me being like, I'm like really hurt about this or I was really disappointed like I feel like that is just really hard for me to have a conversation like that with someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I can see why. 00:22:15</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. (inaudible at 00:22:21), I've actually talked about that. I think we've made some progress about (inaudible at 00:22:29) talking about other things at least (inaudible at 00:22:31) of the conversation about what upsets us about each other and just felt like must safer environment then speaking with my family so I feel like that helped a lot. I just really need to like separate any conversation that I have with them because like I would end up feeling like (inaudible at 00:22:56) or sad or I don't know frustrated. And my dad is much worse then my mom. But, yeah. I just need yeah like you can't, I feel like everyone, his kids are like drifting away from him and he thinks you know in his head like he thinks it's because no one cares about him or because he's divorced or like he doesn't realize that he just drives people away and really upsets them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think there is anything you can do about that. 00:23:47</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm just going to see him on like when I have to. But then actually that's silly look because if I want to see him and then I go there. So like we're like, I'm like this just doesn't make sense. It's like he wants us there and no one wants to be there and it's kind of like we were talking yesterday like my worse case scenario is people are around me when they don't want to be and I think everything is fine and maybe that is where my guilt comes because I just like keep playing into that to make him happy. But for myself I really like oh my God I hope this never ever happens to me, that would be horrible. Before we go over there like it's, I feel like it's really like getting ready for like this mentally exhausting ... my brother and I will joke like are you ready, are we going to arrive there at the same time because we don't want to be there alone with him too long because it's so miserable and it's almost funny looking from the outside but it's not very fun. 00:25:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably funny from the outside not very funny from the inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I don't know, so now yeah Christmas is next week, it's probably going to be an awkward holiday and he just ... he holds grudges and I don't know, obviously I don't care what type of gift I get I don't need anything but I don't know he just holds like anything that you have ever said has like these consequences with him. And they're like, they're not like, I feel like everyone's actions have consequences but him like he like, if you don't do this then I'm going to like take this from you. It's not like if I'm mean to someone you accept the consequences (inaudible at 00:25:48) close with me. It's like if you don't want to do this and get my bag of money then you're a horrible kid and I don't want to keep you in the will. If you don't want to do this then I don't want to give you a Christmas gift. And there's like a lot of people, like in fact I have always been one extra feisty with him, he has actually said before like, why don't you just shut up and do and you're always the one who has to give me a hard time. But I don't and I feel like that in some aspects I do because I've been working for him forever but he's like I'm always like the one who like vocalizes it a little bit and he does not like when someone challenges him or does not listen to him and then he does mean things to like gain control and it's almost like con people into doing what he wants. Like who the heck wants to be around that? 00:26:49</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel for the most part very manipulated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And actually it gets worse as I get older because like in my earlier life maybe you don't realize like it's happening or like I see it happening to other people and then like I see it kind of happening to me and I'm just kind of like, I don't know I guess if you're a manipulative person you just are one but really expect him to do it on his kids but he's just that type of person. He's just, it seems selfish that he only cares about himself and he thinks that. I don't know he has this horrible, horrible life and everyone is just nasty to him and he was dealt this bad hand of cards and. He just says like these phrases like ...</p>

<p>I remember like when my parents were getting divorced I don't remember like exactly what was going on with like the splitting of the assets and the funds and it was like he kept the house and pretty much she walked away from nothing which I feel like she just really wanted to get out and was probably willing to not take anything but he, and I don't mean like I always end up getting what I want in the end and that's something that like is true. Like he'll be so nasty he'll say anything, he'll manipulate anything to get what he wants and that's all he cares about. What he wants are like things that have like monetary value or some sense of like power which usually is doesn't really go with the things that I think are very important to life. Yeah, I just, I don't know I think the more I get to know him the more I just really, really don't like him like he's like my father and I'll always have like a, I don't know a love for him but like if I didn't know even a man off the street I hate you which. 00:29:10</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me kind of sad. And then I always think like, we talked about this before, like I'm just so embarrassed by his actions all the time, like I find it really upsetting and I don't know why I get so upset about it. I don't know if it is because like, I feel like I really like distance myself from him and don't ... I like to think that I don't have many of his values but I don't like he's, like I've used (inaudible at 00:29:50). Like nasty, manipulative person like I don't like being associated by it because that just makes me feel bad. And then I don't know if it because like he's always like how come everyone else likes me so then part of me feels like, I don't know guilty that I'm so embarrassed by his action, I don't know. 00:30:30</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Embarrassed is a good word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but to the point look I even want to, yeah like if I had ... I think like if I, so I always think frequently if you know (inaudible at 00:30:48) or anyone in that matter like I think of having to introduce him to, not so much my significant other but like their family and I have like such anxiety about it that I'm like (inaudible at 00:31:04) what this would be like some day. I don't know I'm really into feeling bad things (inaudible at 00:31:04).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you imagine would, it would be like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Him just having like a really, like arrogance about it I mean I don't know, I feel like do people think like if I come ... If his representation of my, so you go ahead (inaudible at 00:31:34), I feel like it's pretty like ... I have this just like picture in my head of here's my dad, whatever, you know all about him. And then there's like my mom with her boyfriend and their whole family, it's not like you meet one it's like you meet the whole six of them or however many. And then I feel like it's people like (inaudible at 00:31:56), where the heck did this girl come from she, you know is she going to have ... is this like a presentation of what she's going to be like when she gets older or. And, yeah I think about that. Because I know like, I don't know (inaudible at 00:32:25) people kind of do judge you a little bit on your family but I know like when my parents were getting married, my grandmother, my dad's mom was like extremely judgmental of my mom because she came from a divorced family. And then my dad still to this day is like that's why we got divorced and I should have listened to my mom. From day one they said she was no good because she came from a divorced family. But the divorcing isn't what bothers me as much as the type of people that they are. But I feel like at least if they were together, I don't know, it creates this allusion of some sort of togetherness but I have my father up here who is like arrogant and borderline rude and can't socialize with anyone. Then my mom over here with this like messed up thing she's living with her boyfriend's parents and they're really loud and obnoxious and they're kind of arrogant too, less in a mean way but. I don't know I feel like I just. I don't know if someone wants to meet me and my family are they going to think that I'm like that too?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Guilty by association? 00:33:40</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I actually talked to Jamie about that and I'm like, like I think like, you know have your parents ever had to meet mom like I don't even know what that would be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you met his?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I have met his sisters. And just like a lot of times like, well his parents live in New York so he doesn't go home a lot of it, some of it is due to like the our vacation time and geographically but I felt like ... another part of it is almost like I'm not, not that I'm unwilling but I'm well meeting his family would be fine but I feel like it's almost like I'm scared to move forward because I feel like if it starts to go down that road then that will happen, I don't know. I'll just have to meet his parents at some point to be interested. I'm really anxiety driven situation. 00:34:44</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen? You said you didn't like your parents, then what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure they would have like opinions about (inaudible at 00:34:58) wanting to like continue something with me seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they would be like your father's parents? 00:35:07</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly. So like he and I have had conversations before but like I have expressed concern and he was like you know I don't, I really don't think it matters and like you're stressing out about it, I don't care so if I don't care but, you know, your family is like this you really shouldn't care about it. But other then like he has made comments of more talking about like his sisters' spouses have his mom is really displeased because they came from divorced families and so. I don't know I guess (inaudible at 00:35:43) some of the things it's not a huge deal but for me I keep using the word because they're divorced but I feel like that's just, that's for me it doesn't seem to be an issue but I feel like if you have a problem with divorced people, you know you see them as divorced that's one like negative event and you see how they act and that's another negative. But I don't know like we, he and I talked about it a lot and he swears up and down well it doesn't matter which is fine but then.</p>

<p>I don't know like my dad is also like I mentioned before like when you get married someday your mother is not invited to the wedding. I'm kind of like it will be my wedding and obviously she'll be there and he just like, like he talks so much about it and he like I swear if I see her with that fat bastard, her boyfriend, he like ... he wants to like beat him up and he keeps talking until he has like these visions of like the day he gets to like pretty much beat the crap out of him and I'm like just stop having like ... I don't know I'm the type of person who is like don't get, you know, that upset (inaudible at 00:37:02) maybe I should take my own words seriously when I'm saying don't get that upset, don't get upset but so he just like talks about all these things from the point where look I can't even imagine what my wedding would be like someday like I want to elope. Because the thought of like him and her in the same room, my parents, her significant others and their family it's just like eventually ruin the day.</p>

<p>And now when I say this actually it's all really selfish that I'm like you're ruining my life, you're ruining the perception other people may have of me. And so I just feel like do I just have a hard time accepting like the situation, make the best of it or. But it's like he's so vocal about like she will not be at your wedding, like 90 out percent of like divorced people like, okay yeah like both the parents are going to be there but he like (inaudible at 00:38:15) an ultimatum for the most part. It's like he can't even see that like that could be like obviously a very important day in someone's life and he's still harping on the divorce because he doesn't want to see his ex-wife's boyfriend. So I feel leery now with him all the time and don't like to be around him. And like I was going back (inaudible at 00:38:51) like I'm a bad person because I feel these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you should want to be around him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like in an ideal situation yes like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in an ideal situation he would be a different father. 00:39:08</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. True. It's like if I just like, like when I talk to like other people but obviously I don't get into like nitty-gritty details but I feel like oh like it's your, you know your dad, like everyone hates their family, ha, ha, ha, but I feel like I really don't like him and I don't know I feel like more family help each other out and he is just really like all for himself so. I don't say this to other people because I don't know it's not this not really any of their business but like hearing from other friends like oh yeah like you should be there or you should go see him more like it starts to make me feel more guilty because I feel like I'm even more of that person. But I mean to your point a different situation he would act very differently too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think that may be part of the problem that you're struggling with is that this is so far from my deal it's hard to know what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, most people can have a wedding where their parents come if they're divorced. If one parent can't control themselves literally, physically they can't control themselves they may not be able to come. 00:40:41</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's far from ideal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But one doesn't want to have physical altercations during their wedding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And like I just think about (inaudible at 00:40:52), I don't know like he just doesn't think. What if, God forbid, like what if my brother and I got like sick or something and both parents needed to be in an area or, I don't know like you're going to have to face your ex-wife at some point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not necessarily. Sometimes not seeing your ex is more important then dealing with an ill child. Again, far from ideal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I guess I just have a hard time because it's so far from the ideal situation I don't know how to handle it. But I feel like, obviously if he makes such bold statements that are like selfish for himself then I should care more about myself because I don't think he is caring too much about the situations. (It sounded like she might have been crying.) I don't know he just ... When we talk about like, I'm sick of him like throwing things (inaudible at 00:42:12) he's like I'm going to have to pay for a wedding for you someday. Like, make your mother pay for it, I've paid for everything. Or then he like complains about like something like loan that he had for like when I went to school and he was just why don't you call your mother and see if she could paid for it. I'm just sick of dealing with him and it's like he like just throws things in your face all the time. So, I don't know. And then I just feel like you preached like you won't like family, family, family is the most important thing in this world but like you don't really seem to care about it or just (inaudible at 00:43:04). And then I just end up wondering like why am I sitting here getting so upset about this and him when he is off at work making money and not thinking about anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's your dad. He's the only one you have and the only one you'll ever have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you have very intense feelings in a lot of different ways about him. This is part of what we all experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So, yeah I just like I just don't, it's like I'm looking for this plan on how to deal with him and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it because I like what seems to make sense for me is to just not speak to him but I feel like in most situations that is not the answer to things but I feel like with him like you can't talk, you can't do anything so it's just like (inaudible at 00:44:34). Not really have a relationship with him or at least I feel better usually at the time but then I start (inaudible at 00:44:46) because they don't have to deal with him. Like if it's problem like if I don't deal with it it's just going to go away but there's not really any speaking to repair damage when you're dealing with him. So I feel like just like to like stop the contact for the most part is what tends to be the most effective. Because I realize I went about my day like yesterday and had a good day and everything is all well and fine and then like you get the phone call and you start talking about him and then all of a sudden like anxiety and I'm upset. A lot of people get upset when dealing with issues but him it's like, like my brother could say just like a couple of sentences and like I really feel just like just like this nervousness come on. And I feel like I'm not really like a nervous, anxiety driven person. 00:45:58</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be interesting for us to think about, we're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Do you have a pen really quick so I can write you a check?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Were you able to open the statement?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what happened the first time.</p>

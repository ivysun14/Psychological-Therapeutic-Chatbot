<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, how are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seems like forever I haven't seen you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were going through some stress the last time you were here, with your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going through more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is she doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's making it but my husband and I just had colonoscopies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Both of you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my husband has a tumor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.  Were they able to remove it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We don't know yet.  He goes for those couple appointments this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll remember to ask that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were they able to do a biopsy during the colonoscopy or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, let me see, all he told us was that, and we knew it was cancer just by the way the doctor told us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so then they make appointments for next week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That he needs to do and [INAUDIBLE] that it hasn't spread all over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's right on the rectum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it's low.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if that's good or bad.  In fact, this doctor said he wouldn't do it, touch it, because it was too close to the rectum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he's sending him to a rectum specialist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Colorectal surgeon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, did the person that did the colonoscopy, was he a gastroenterologist or a surgeon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was a gastroenterologist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think they'll often times remove tumors or remove polyps if they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If they're benign.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they're in the actual colon and, you know, during the procedure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But often times, if it's in the colon higher up, they'll refer to a general surgeon or if it's in the rectum then it's a colorectal surgeon, more specific.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he said he wouldn't touch it so, hopefully, he said it's very timy</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a scary [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When he went to have his colonoscopy, had he been having any symptoms or was it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just that he went to have his routine colonoscopy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sent us—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To have them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's already had three, this was my first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the night before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have to tell you that I actually had one, since I saw you last as well, my first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, not fun or did you take pills?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I took the pills, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't know why they had us drink, no pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know when you took the pills, you had to drink a lot of water and you had to take the pills like every 15 minutes for like 2 hours in the evening the night before and then you had to deal with the result all night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, well I set up my bed right by the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had mine scheduled early in the morning the next day so at least it's done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We went fairly early—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was done by ten o'clock.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so the next day was nothing compared to the night before.  I don't know if I could do it again, it tastes like poison.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the pills actually weren't so bad but you had to drink a lot of water and then what I found is that I tried to have broth the night before—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I kept tasting the broth the whole night, so I'm never going to have that broth again, no more of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't want any mixture of anything either because I can't stand the taste, I have a big [INAUDIBLE] issue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the pills are probably—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Next time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They worked well for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what, oh believe me, compared to what I had, I'm surely asking for it next time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you and your husband have it the same day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you did the preparation the same time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and he was so good.  He'd drink his and then he'd get mine ready so it was pretty much, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But then you both weren't fighting for the same bathroom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, nobody was fighting because it was so horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we made it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, I guess, I guess what I'm hearing for your husband is that he's had a bunch and they didn't have a finding before, then it's good that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sent him and that they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was tested and they found it, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my daughter [INAUDIBLE] that's why they sent him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly, and that, you know, getting the other evaluations is just, you know, if he didn't go get it then you'd never know about this and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] to kingdom come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, right, so I guess the silver lining to it, even though it's not, you don't have all the answers yet—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is just that, you know, you went for a reason —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They found polyps for you, they were [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But for your husband they found something that, hopefully, they'll get all the tests done and see that they can do something, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They could completely get rid of it, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's rare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it's, well no, actually with the colon, if it's caught early enough and it's a tumor that they can't remove during the colonoscopy, sometimes they'll just do like a partial colectomy or, you know, they'll remove part of the colon and they'll be able to get it but they've got to stage it first, they have to probably do CT scans.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All that he has to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and then they'll have to do, I'm sure, a CT scan of the chest and sometimes an MRI of the chest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's having an MRI.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll usually do it of the head too, the brain, and make sure that there's no spread any place, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's what that's for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then they'll look at the liver too but, yeah, I think for the most part if it's an isolated single tumor that's small, my guess is that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a touchy spot, you know, if they mess him up this could ruin [INAUDIBLE] for life with his bowels, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, but if you don't treat it then it's going to mess them up in a different way, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you know, and I think a lot of people end up having, you know, colon cancers, because of the colonoscopies being done, a lot of people will have surgeries.  Sometimes people, you know, will be able to remove it and will have a colostomy for a brief time but even if they have a colostomy they're able to reattach later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So sometimes they just do a temporary colostomy in certain surgeries too but you know what, just remember the good thing, that they were able to find it and they'll be able to do something about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And not thinking about all the worst things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I haven't been delirious crying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep focused that [INAUDIBLE].  How is he doing with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good, I saw one tear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so he's reacting but he's going and getting these things done.  He's not avoiding it.  I mean I've seen some people, they'll find some news like that and then they'll go do something else and not get their tests done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're in denial.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They could be, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's not denying it, he's going and getting things done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the best he can do right now too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what the doctor told him, schedule it right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were lucky to get, I think it's, I'm not sure if it's [INAUDIBLE], anyway—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which hospital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if it's [DEIDENTIFIED], I can't be sure.  I didn't read all of his [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We saw [INAUDIBLE] it was gross enough, I [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they give you pictures at the end?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the 8 by 10 glossies for you to put on your mantel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No [INAUDIBLE], they were just as bad [INAUDIBLE] pictures and I said no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They actually printed up pictures in my discharge instructions and sent them home with me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, yeah, I have them too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, not ones I carry around in my wallet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it was good to know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That you've done it, you know, that you had the courage to go.  Now my next one is for breast, to go get that checked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had a polyp too and they said I'll see you ten years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, is that right, you won't have to go for ten?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ten years for another colonoscopy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow, that's probably—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they found a polyp, they should check up again in another five to ten years but for me, I guess with my age, it's ten years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, did they find a polyp?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, one, I had one.  They didn't say when to come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, usually with that it's, I think, I forget what the recommendations are now but, obviously, not being a gastroenterologist but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't call you again in either five to ten years—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To come back for another because, you know, it isn't one of those procedures that they can do that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's to catch—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty uncomplicated although it's still a procedure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we didn't like it but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's something you want to catch also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, my daughter is just, she turned in the papers, well the detective, her private detective turned the papers into her husband.  He pulled up right in her drive behind him one day when he was following him, so he handed him the papers and then he tried to make, he said I don't have 200 for a lawyer, you know, so then he tried to make [INAUDIBLE] can we do this, just split it half and half, she said no way and then, what else, she's anyway holding up really in a good way.  I think it now, the attorney or lawyer will read it over how he answered the questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they might be able to come to a settlement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, now he's trying to get the kids, too late.  He takes them once or twice a week to the mall.  I'm sure his mother is telling him, if you want those kids you'd better play with them or do something.  He's never come home till four thirty, five thirty in the morning, so [NAME OTHER] deserves to get the children because that's all on record with her attorney, every day, she [INAUDIBLE] what happened—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so she should make out well but one never knows, especially if a judge gets involved, you don't know whose side he'll be on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it only goes as far as, in a week to ten days I guess the two of them and their two lawyers meet—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well hopefully they'll be able to come up with a compromise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right then, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come up with something so they can just move on too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, everybody move on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because the more they, if you go take it further, the longer it prolongs things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just hope it's not, [INAUDIBLE] with her, that's a real sad thing, just to hear him coming in at four thirty, five thirty in the morning, slamming the door when he leaves and I don't know that you can stop that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, unless they come up with a settlement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One year is over, yeah, so [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well as long as she's holding up okay and the kids are okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's pretty strong most days and we tried to get her to go to a therapist but she said I've lived through hell, I don't need to start one more thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, she's handling it, you know, you did what you can do, you can make suggestions—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she can then take it from there if she needs to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so I read a whole book on it, which was really good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he would try to get her to leave it, she said not yet, she said I'm not ready.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What was the book?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't remember, it has a boxing glove on the front and it, I forget what it says but it's cute—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About being tough with the boxing, you know, knock them out and so on, it's a cute title but at the end there are some things that help when she's going to be alone, so we said if anything, read the last two chapters but that's not easy now.  We didn't tell her about her father, not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it might be better to let her know once you know what you're going to be doing, like once all the other tests are done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, because she may think it's very unfair if we don't tell her and she finds out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think she needs to know that things are happening with other parts of the family too, both good and bad.  I mean if something good were happening, you'd want to share that with her—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That would be part of the family.  The important thing is that you don't just ostracize her from the family—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're worried about her, you know, because if she were, if everything was going okay, she'd know, she'd be involved, she'd with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know, I think you're trying to protect her from being upset about it so if you just plan on telling her but after all the tests are done and you know what the plan is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And let her know, you know, I think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she was home over Easter and the kids had a ball so it was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I didn't have to cook, we went to the [DEIDENTIFIED] and the kids, they take their little plates and go by themselves, of course, with the grown ups—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's cute, real cute.  That's our favorite place and I didn't need to cook.  It wouldn't have been hard, a ham and potatoes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For Easter, so many people go out for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Easter brunch anyway but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can be a tradition actually, that's probably one of the few holidays—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what we've been, I think this is five or six years now, so it's been easy for me, although a ham dinner is easy anyway but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a little easier than turkey.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, way easier and most of the times I just buy that when it's already sliced—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That precooked, it's delicious, it's got syrup on it.  You have to stand in line to get that too but that's the way I do it, so other than that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you're handling the stresses pretty well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, no, no, I mean the last time I saw you I think you were still in shock from hearing about your daughter and everything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like things are sinking in with that and just like you had been reading about issues with your daughter and learning about things for yourself, I imagine that with your husband, once you get some of the test results, you'll want to know what it's about and I'm sure that's the way you'll be dealing with it but right now there's unknowns as long as he's getting the tests done and you'll hit a point where you can decide what you need to do to be there for him and to learn about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that'll be the hard part if it's all through him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Although again, not to anticipate the worst, they said it's small and he's had colonoscopies before that were clean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then I think you have to kind of keep those things in mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that he had no symptoms beforehand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of times people that come in will present with metastatic colon cancer, they usually come in with physical symptoms, like they're losing weight—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They maybe have a blockage from something or maybe bleeding, you know, there'll be some other symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He did have hemorrhoids but I mean he's had those for many years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he did take those out or whatever they do, tie them or I don't really know what they do but he took care of them, so we'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You'll know more when all the tests are done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I'll call you if I have a really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, that's why I brought this to be refilled.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see, what do you have here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was the one you gave me for when I fell apart with [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely, yeah, we'll do that again.  Are you okay with your other prescriptions or do you need anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I probably need, I think they're like three months so I better take them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let me start writing them here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I'll keep quiet while you write.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.  Has anything else been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, nothing new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The kids were good on Easter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, they were very good, just happy to do something different I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And who was altogether on Easter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were all there except my son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, where was he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] but he's coming home for good in about a month.  He loves [DEIDENTIFIED] so he'll be back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he doing work down there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, he's in real estate so he was there for two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's such a difficult time now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is awful, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	An article or a story on CBS, NBC the other day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is terrible, terrible, that's another reason, you know, [NAME OTHER] helps [NAME OTHER], he helps him, he keeps him perked up, you know, like asking him how was business.  He said he had a good month and things like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I got the letter on the Lunesta as well and you're covered, they approved you for prescriptions through December.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wonderful.  Insurance is getting to be such a pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, just certain medications they cover and certain ones they need preauthorization for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just got the word on, I guess they [INAUDIBLE] help do the paperwork for that, so she gave me that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.  Do you want me to open it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you taking the Lunesta every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last Depakote level was September so we should probably get one sometime during the summertime so maybe after the next visit we'll take your level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] at our next visit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we've done three months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we've been doing, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Everything is wide open.  What time would you like, it's a Friday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a Friday, what time is good for you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any time after one, one thirty, two, two thirty, three, three thirty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One o'clock, okay.  So one p.m.  June [DATE].  So the Wellbutrin, the Klonopin, the Depakote, the Lunesta and the Desyrel.  Each of them have three refills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you should have, there should be four months really on each prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.  Now if they do this in a generic way, I don't know what I'm taking, that's what we said, the whole alphabet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it seems backward.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, everything else seems pretty much the same, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When the stress is less then you just get yourself off the Klonopin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only if you need it and as your sleep gets better, still take the Desyrel but only use the Lunesta if you need—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, some.  Those are two of the five that you can try to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cool—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cut back, eventually things are well, so just keep your Depakote, the Wellbutrin, and the Desyrel the same, those are your, those are your standard ones.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other two are just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I need them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For difficult times, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks, good to see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks for doing this, I'll turn this off.</p>

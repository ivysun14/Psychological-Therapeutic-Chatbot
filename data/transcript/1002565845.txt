<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Waiting for school to get over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A couple more weeks or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, finals start, I think we get out 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah 2 weeks.  Ah, finals start next, next week so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you graduating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm a junior so I'll be a senior next year, but, ah, I don't know.  I'm just holding on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you doing academically?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty well.  I'm not a, I was struggling, well I've been struggling in math because I'm in Honors, ah, Algebra 3, 4 and probably shouldn't be in Honors cause I'm, I mean I'm already, at math I'm pretty good but definitely not, I can't, it's hard to work with the pace that they work at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're really struggling?  Are you going to do okay in [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope.  I hope I get it.  I think it's a D right now which is better than an E obviously but I just took a test 2 or on Friday and finished it on Monday, and I think I got at least a B on that so I studied a whole lot for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What grade do you need to credit for the course?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A D.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean I, I wish it would be better than that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm not in Honors next year, though, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll be doing , ah, precalc and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't they boost your grade if it's an Honors like give you like a little extra?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  The GPA for, the GPA scale's different.  For an A you get, normally you'd get a 4.0 for an A, but with Honors you get a 5.0.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And B is a 4.0.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if you get a C or lower it goes back down with the regular scale so yeah.  But other, otherwise I'm doing pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My photo grade's not so good cause I, I was kind of slacking and, ah, teacher kind of expects too much out of us who are working at a college level for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I'm in advanced photography so but other than that everything else is going fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  How's your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No sad periods anymore or</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope and I've actually been feeling pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.  On a 0 to 10 scale, 0 being no change, 10 100% improvement—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Since I first say you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since I first came in?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, close to a 10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can't ask for more than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean I was really down when, ah, when we first started and, ah, I've, I've just been feeling good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good and no side effects at all from the medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we're not going to change anything then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well we, I actually didn't really keep up with the Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We kind of just, ah, it just slipped but, ah, still been taking the Vyvanse before school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's working fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So just the Vyvanse Zoloft combination is good, is adequate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the doses, it's 100 of Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hundred for Zoloft which is sertraline the generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, 70 for Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and no side effects at all?  No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your appetite is maintained and you're sleeping all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  All right so we'll just keep you on it.  We won't change it.  Now the next step is what we do over the summer.  Do you want to just stay on it for the summer?  Are you going to have a job or summer school or what you going to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stay on the Zoloft or the Vyvanse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Zoloft definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah definitely.  I don't, I don't think I need the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Vyvanse cause, ah, I'll be, I'm not going to get a job in the summer because maybe if I could find a part time one for June because in July I think early July or something I'm going to, ah, going on a foreign exchange program to [DEIDENTIFIED] for 3 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?  When it is this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	July some, I forgot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a study program or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm going to living with a, a German family in, ah, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For 3 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Someone you know or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Just a, another I think [AGE] German kid named [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Named what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	His name's [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you don't know him at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  And, ah</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you nervous about it or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm pretty excited for it, but, ah, it's in the Rotary Club and pretty much I, just to get an experience of the culture and what, what they have, and after the 3 weeks down there is up, he's going to, the kid I'm staying with, he's going to come to America with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And stay with my family for 3 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's an interesting program yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you, do you want to be taking the Vyvanse when you're there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, I don't think it'd be necessary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well why don't we, why, when is this, July you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	July yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right and you finish school in a couple of weeks so the beginning of June.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	May 3rd is the last day of school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	May 30th yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	May, May 3rd.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Third, June 3rd?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	June 3rd yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So that'll give us a month.  Why don't we do this?  Why don't we, do you ever miss days on the weekend like Saturdays and Sundays?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the Vyvanse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't usually take it on the weekends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you notice any mood changes on the weekends if you don't take it?  You feel any more sad or depressed or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, no.  Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well why don't we do this?  Why don't you take it through school?  I'll give you another prescription, you know, fill it, and then try stopping it in June.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then if you struggle in any way, let me know and I'll see you before you go to, ah, to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you're doing fine, you know just stay on the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'll definitely stay on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Through, through the summer and then I could see you maybe before school started.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah probably.  I think school starts the 29th this year or 27th.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of August?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then I could see you maybe the 20th or so, you know, before school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, ah, not the 21st, though, that's my birthday so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Happy birthday.  You got plans already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No not really just, you know, I'm not going to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See the only thing is, you know, it does help your focus but there is some, sometimes some mood benefit too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I don't want to lose that mood, like I say if, if you stop it, you know, for a couple of weeks in June and you feel not quite as good as you feel now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's worth staying on it especially if you're going to be in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause your experience will be better.  You'll feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'll leave that up to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I don't think I'd need it but, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You may not.  I mean, you know, it might be just the focus that it's helping you with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, ah, yeah I'm comfortable so we'll do that and then, then I'll plan to see you the end of August.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Unless you decide that you want to stay on the, on the Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I, I'll probably need it for next year too, the Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.  Yeah you, you'll definitely need that so that's why I'll see you in August.  If I give you a prescription now, that'll get you through the school year plus you'll have some extras just in case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the other thing the best natural antidepressant is exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're doing some aerobics or you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've, ah, well over the winter and stuff I wasn't getting much, I mean snowboarding sometimes, but now that it's warm out there, I'm starting skating again.  We, ah, we have a place in [DEIDENTIFIED].  We're going up this weekend actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, ice skating or racing skating or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, ah, skateboarding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Skateboarding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, ah, pretty much use every part of your body with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah I've seen it.  Yeah cause that's on wheels.  That's not on ice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah it's on wheels.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, ah, and I've been taking my dog for walks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, just trying to get back in shape cause I'm pretty out, I gained a whole lot of weight over—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah over, ah, over winter break and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How much, how much extra weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just kind of slothing around.  Ah, I weigh 188 now.  I went to the doctor yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six foot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but, ah, I've never weighed over, I've never even weighed 170 before.  I think I was at 165 last time.  So I gained significant amount of weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I wonder if that could be from the Zoloft in part.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Vyvanse will reduce the weight, keep your weight off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But Zoloft in certain cases can increase weight.  We've got to be a little careful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was eating, I've been eating kind of crappy and, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well crappy food is bread, potato, and pasta.  That makes people gain weight.  Eat a lot of bread and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fast food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With bread and like [INAUDIBLE] sandwiches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stay away from that and eat more protein and you'll control the weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fish, chicken.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I'm, I'm not real worried about my weight.  It's not a concern to me.  I'd, I'd be fine if I stayed at this weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I just don't think that it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep gaining.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it's definitely not the weight that I would normally be because I, because of the food I was eating and really no exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right but you don't want to keep gaining is what I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah but, ah, yeah I'm definitely going to cut down on the fast food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Yeah just stay away from the bread.  You'll be amazed.  If you reduce bread even by, if you take 2 sandwiches, take 1 or half a piece of bread, you'll lose weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know or at least you won't gain it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And school food doesn't help much either.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't cook healthy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, well it's kind of crappy food most of the time, ah, you know, it's not really filling so you got to eat more of it and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So all—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you don't bring a meal [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where do you, what about the summer?  Who'll cook for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom works doesn't she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah she works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So no one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the summer if I'm at home I'll usually eat something, but, ah, I think we just need, ah, I just need to cut down, ah, frozen foods in the microwave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And all that but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you exercise, you'll lose weight too, biking, walking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, skateboarding.  Skateboarding is great exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I skate a lot.  I've, ah, just started getting back into it now that it's warmed up so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they have these parks that you go that have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I go, I go to a bunch of different skate parks and 1 down in, ah, downtown [DEIDENTIFIED] and then 1 off [DEIDENTIFIED] there's one, a skate park.  I mean I skate at skate parks and, ah, just like spots around, you know, a city or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and skate, take the train down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go where in [DEIDENTIFIED], by the lake?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, yeah just around the whole city, just different like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could skate just on the sidewalks in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stairs.  Yeah like stair sets just like doing handrails.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I'm glad you're in a good place so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the Zoloft, I'll write a prescription for both the Zoloft and Vyvanse just to make sure you have it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, yeah probably.  I think I'll definitely need more Vyvanse for the rest of the school year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If I give you 30 that'll get you through the?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then what I'll do on the Zoloft, I'll give you 30 and 3 refills so that'll get you through the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then do you want to just call me in August or do you want to schedule something now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably call you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah cause—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you're back from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] lose track.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  It's already happened before so.</p>

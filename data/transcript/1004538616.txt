<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to DC for a day yesterday. I probably shouldn't have gone in some sense, because I have lots of stuff I should be doing. But there's this really great bookstore there, was having an event totally based on one of my favorite books. And they had one lecture and a stand-up comic, an actor was acting out a scene from the book, and a song based on the book. Then they broke us up into discussion groups where we each had to answer an assigned question and pick a representative to go talk about it, and the representative would win a prize. It was quite an extravaganza.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>[00:56.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so even though I had all this stuff that I should have been doing, I instead took a day to go to DC (laughter) and went to this event. I think I was sort of hoping it would be invigorating in some way and get me interested in doing things again. (laughter) It's sort of lacking. And I thought I could bring my laptop on the bus and do freelance work, so I'll totally be responsible, but then I forgot my charger which meant I had like two five-hour bus rides and only three hours worth of possible work. (laughter) So I had, you know, I'm very familiar with the book from past readings, but then I was like well, I might as well re-read it on the bus. And it was really exciting to re-read it. I think his writing is such a high concentration of novel language formation, novel images, interesting ideas, insights about human relations in all senses.</p>

<p>[02:10.1]</p>

<p>Like self and self, self and others, self and world. There are just so many levels on which she is novel that you just get a totally different sense each time you read one of her books. And so it was sort of a relief to come back to it and to be just as enchanted as I was the last time I read it a few years ago. And the event was really fun because it was so low-key and silly, and I liked my discussion group. It was kind of funny. There were four women and one guy, and when we sat down, the first thing that happened was this one girl said "Oh, I nominate you" to the guy. And then we sort of looked at her and she was like "Oh, because you know so many women like Virginia Woolf and it's so awesome to have a man, so we should totally (laughter) get you up there." And he proceeded to not really say very much during the discussion, so they nominated me at the end. (laughter) I was sort of glad that the guy said nothing and didn't keep his nomination. (laughter)</p>

<p>[03:24.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Because he was a guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like really nervous talking in front of 40 people and my voice was shaking. Something that frustrates me about public speaking, like my voice gets so tight and I feel like it just sounds awful, and I feel sorry for the people who have to listen to me. (laughter) But I got into it after a few sentences. I felt a little more comfortable. The audience laughed at a couple of things I said and seemed to look really receptive, and I ended up winning the prize which was —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Which was this graphic novel that — I'm 30 pages in or so, and it references "To the Lighthouse" as a recurring motif. And also the work of Winnicott.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>[04:18.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like object relations theory, and it sort of has this fantasy scene in which Winnicott and Virginia Woolf pass on the street, which is totally feasible since they lived near enough to each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess the press she founded published some of his work after he died. They published translations of Freud while she was very involved with the process. So anyway, the event was really fun. Afterward I was feeling good, really motivated and hopeful and, you know, it was really pretty great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it was kind of inspiring.</p>

<p>[05:04.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was because I think it's easy to think that I'm pretty useless (laughter) just living the way I do and seeing people so rarely except like Sue and Jeff, who I see all the time. And then when I do see people, it's generally, you know, to talk about life and such. So getting into a situation where I was talking about literature, and people seemed interested in what I was saying and seemed to like it, and learning from other people and feeling like I was actually contributing something useful (laughter) was really nice. And I started writing about it in my diary, hoping to capture that. But then I got really tired because earlier in the week I had been sort of trying to sleep as little as possible and push through work with, not more than the recommended dose of Dexedrine, but probably using that just to sustain a state of being awake without having thoughts that I couldn't have sustained otherwise.</p>

<p>[06:18.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even just like within the dose that's prescribed to me — not, you know. So last night this sort of sleep hangover hit me. (laughter) It would have been nice to just continue writing that way. I sort of just slept in today and just sort of feel sort of groggy and miserable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. Feeling miserable is not so good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I thought it was sort of a lost cause to take any earlier in the day because I felt so miserable that after this, I'm going to take the half and do some work. (laughter)</p>

<p>[07:04.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you haven't had any bad side effects from it. Is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not other than the withdrawal. When I take it for a few days in a row and then don't take it, I definitely feel like I have a headache and just feel tired and in a bad mood. But I'm hoping to find — like, I feel I can find a way that that doesn't happen. Maybe if I do three days on, one off or something, my body will get more used to that. Or three days on, two off, even. I don't know. Maybe there's some pattern where my body won't be so surprised (laughter) when I stop taking it. But while I'm on it and the effects are going this good, I worry a little because a lot of people report that it loses effectiveness after a certain amount of time. So finding something that works but, you know, probably isn't going to work in a few years — although some people seem to like —</p>

<p>[08:14.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in patients it varies a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It varies a lot. So maybe it will keep working for me. But it's still, it's not a magic bullet. I found I still have to do personal writing to be able to focus. Like there was one night when I was like, okay, I'm going to pull an all-nighter and finish this section of the freelance thing, because I'm still behind. I've been doing more work with the Dexedrine, but not as much as I would like. And it always takes me a while to get going. So I need long, uninterrupted chunks of time so I can get the getting-in process — like have as few of those as possible. Because even taking a break for an hour to eat a meal or take a shower and get dressed or something, I lose it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. You've really got to take some time to get into it and stay in it.</p>

<p>[09:18.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, some people benefit from frequent breaks, but I'm really someone who needs to have ideally 12 hours in which I eat crap food and don't do anything but work. (laughter) I wish there was some way in which I could — I mean, with freelancing this is theoretically possible. Do a few days on and a few days off. Because I think that would sort of maximize my brain power. But I haven't really been as successful as I hoped. And I don't know if this staying up until this section is finished thing — I mean, that always sounds great and like I have to do this because it's my goal and I'm going to stick to it. But goals mean nothing to me, which is really unfortunate. I just can't seem to make them meaningful. And they matter to me. But I feel like I've failed my goals so much that they've become totally meaningless, and I just don't know how to reverse that.</p>

<p>[10:28.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you have next to no confidence in your ability to set some kind of plan or goal for yourself and then follow through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And occasionally something happens to make me regain confidence, like oh, I have this drug that helps me focus. Now I'll be able to set goals and stick to them. That was a legitimate reason to have faith. Sometimes I give myself illegitimate reasons to have faith and sort of get on the bandwagon for a while, then I would fail. The night when I was really pushing for this goal, I had some focused time but then I was having so many other ideas for fiction and personal things I felt the need to write about that I had to spend three hours writing personal stuff.</p>

<p>[11:28.8]</p>

<p>And then when I got back to my actual work, it was late at night and just my brain power was diminished. And my verbal energy was diminished too. Because I wrote a few sort of "fictiony" things, a lot of personal stuff, and then before I could get back to work, I had to write this thousand word opinion piece style thing, and I just — it felt like one of the orders I used to get, except it wasn't like an order. It wasn't like "You have to finish this piece before you can do your work." But it sort of was compulsive in the same way that those were. And I just could not get my brain to go anywhere near my work until I finished the piece.</p>

<p>[12:23.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A piece that was entirely for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's like I'm my own personal opinion columnist (laughter) and I have deadlines I have to meet. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those, somehow, you can enforce.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because, I mean, I'm not like a perfectionist and an intense structuralist with the stuff I write for myself. I think the voice for those is very natural and like it's okay for them to be sloppy. I try not to be so much of a perfectionist with my freelance stuff because I don't think anyone else has as high expectations for finding the ideal form and the ideal delivery system in which to package these ideas. No one else is thinking about it in as such minute detail as I am.</p>

<p>[13:33.3]</p>

<p>And there are times when I'll hit a streak where some energy will rise up or when I'll have something that I really want to convey that will sort of carry me through it faster. But then there are a lot of other times when I'm in a completely analytical intellectual state and I'm just like okay, what is the best possible thing I could say about this, which is hard to push through. It's frustrating to have that much trouble shaking this perfectionism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's frustrating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I get frustrated because there's a long period when I didn't know what my problems really were. But now I feel I've sort of identified and taxonomized them and I could have diagrams of their connections to each other. (laughter) But I'm still not very good at solving them. (pause)</p>

<p>[15:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you tend to see these things in a fairly intellectual and analytic sort of way as opposed to in terms of their emotional dimension.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so much harder to find a point of entry with the latter, I think. (pause) I don't know what to do about it. (laughter) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what comes to mind?</p>

<p>[16:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: As far as I've figured out, I mean the ideal way in which I can do work for other people is, I'm in a state in which my personal writing and fiction writing are happening regularly, and it's like there's some door that open in which opinions can form and sort of provide energy to be used through writing. I mean, it's like putting gas in a car, in a sense. And the personal writing I do helps me find that, in a sense, but not reliably. There are some days when I don't feel motivated to do personal writing, and I'm really stressed out about work, and I'll feel so much better when this section is finished.</p>

<p>And it just isn't happening. I don't know how to — it's like there are two wires that need to connect and I don't know how to locate them and connect them some days. When I do, I seem to stumble upon it through something that I sort of have identified as helping. Like it's good to know I need to be writing on a regular basis. That's helpful. But it's still sort of mysterious, exactly what that is doing and what the atom of that molecule is and how to get it another way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I was following you up until the atom of the molecule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess doing personal writing seems to put things into a productive relationship that other times don't want to connect. So I mean, personal writing almost takes various atoms like opinion, energy for that opinion to connect with other things, and mobility in the language I need to express it.</p>

<p>[18:25.2]</p>

<p>Like if you take all of those like discreet atoms, theoretically something is happening that isn't necessarily like writing — or personal writing. That can't be the smallest possible order of what's going on. Like it must be a second order way of getting at something first order. There must be other second order ways.</p>

<p>[19:06.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) So, if I follow, what you're saying is that you're thinking about how to kind of configure your mental machinery to be able to write, and the model you have in mind isn't one involving the most basic elements, but rather some higher order elements which you can talk about sort of sensibly in this way. But that way doesn't fully [relate] to what is actually going on so that you can have a better sense of what your process should be for getting to work. Is that more or less right?</p>

<p>[20:46.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, because the act of doing a certain type of writing, it just has no — there's no obvious reason why that act should sort of change the way my mind functions. So there must be something about that act that is opening a path for certain functions to happen. (pause) Because there are a lot of sort of obvious platitudes about what personal writing does, but I don't know. It seems like maybe if I figured out more exactly what it was doing for me, I could get to that place another way without having to write a long musing on Philip Glass' expressive techniques and cadential patterns. (snickers) I don't want to have to figure out Philip Glass' representational methods every time I try to make some money. (snickers)</p>

<p>[22:08.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could see how that would pose a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also seems ironic to me that you have to figure out something about how he is able to express himself in order to be able to express yourself [in able to do] your work. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. I mean, his work has been meaningful to me for years. At least it's not something sort of like oh, he was in the news today and now I have to write. I've had this sense ever since my sophomore year of undergrad when I got into him that he has really repetitive structures that change gradually. It's sort of an alternate mode to narrative, to the traditional cadential structure where you build in certain ways toward the cadence. Very much like the literary narrative form.</p>

<p>[23:25.2]</p>

<p>Philip Glass offers sort of a non-linear model, and in some ways that works better than some of the language-based attempts to do things like that. I mean, when I think of some experimental writing and some off-shoots of deconstruction theory in the 70s, people say things like "There's no repetition without difference," which is interesting and I believe true and valuable, like I'm glad I've heard that idea. But you go at that with the analytical mind which deals with everything in the same way. Like it has its habits about consuming and disseminating information and so that sentence will be put through the same processes. Whereas listening to a piece of Philip Glass' music is more of an immersive experience in this repetition that expresses difference. I think experiencing that for an extended period of time makes it more real and meaningful than reading some critical piece about that.</p>

<p>[24:56.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. It's like it touches on a different register of your own experience, even if there is something kind of in parallel or isomorphic between that and what an analytical writer might be writing about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's kind of funny that my response to liking that about his music is to try to write an analytical piece about it. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess there's this hope for figuring out how language could have that same effect. And part of what I'm interested in for my novel is finding a type of realism that does convey the repetitiveness of everyday life without it being boring. (laughter) And still keeping the reader engaged and having suspense, because I think every first novel needs to have suspense to get published.</p>

<p>[26:13.7]</p>

<p>But I have this fantasy that really getting to the bottom of my feelings about Philip Glass will help me find this narrative form that I'm looking for and a way to pull together all of these sort of disparate themes from life, from like cooking dinner, standing on the subway platform, you know. These things that are interesting because of the thoughts and connections that they produce. Not because of their place in a larger plot-based narrative. (pause) So I wonder when I had to write about Philip Glass, how much of it was part of this sort of intellectual journey that's important to me, and how much of it was this basic very present-based, process-based need to express myself and like engage intellectually with something.</p>

<p>[27:14.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also try to connect with something more felt about a way of experiencing things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's one of the most interesting things about music. It just has such a profoundly different effect, and I mean really, every art form, mainly like literature, music and painting and drawing. I feel like maybe dance and theater are sort of similar to bringing two aspects together like maybe theater is literature and visual art plus this sort of performative relation. I don't know if I see it as a primary color versus the mixed color. But anyway, I don't know where I was going with that. (chuckles) (pause) And some of the writing I did in school that interested me most was comparing, I guess counting undergrad too, comparative theory about visual art and literature and also music and literature.</p>

<p>[28:49.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a paper you could bring me that you're working on to do with that, like a written response or an essay about a painting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was about — there's this whole chain — I was talking about what is the meaning of the modern mythic quality [and talking about] Francis Bacon paintings[which I could use], which was sort of inspired by a T.S. Eliot poem from the series of poems about a character Sweeney, who was sort of inspired by Milton's Samson Agonistes, and with a touch of Sweeney Todd, although I don't think that was a big inspiration for T. S. Eliot.</p>

<p>[29:38.1]</p>

<p>And then Milton's was based on the biblical Samson but sort of an interesting take on the biblical text, so it really had this resonant structure of iteration [sort of] history and how the painting sort of absorbed all of it, these previous iterations, and presented something sort of absorbed, and deflected them by creating such an intense immediate visual attack upon the viewer with its violence. So that was definitely an interesting question for me.</p>

<p>[30:21.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, say the last part again about the way the painting both, I guess, sort of condensed all these layers of, I don't know what to call it, I don't know what the right metaphor is, but like all of these other works that alluded to each other in sequence, while at the same time you said presented sort of like this immediate visual attack.</p>

<p>[31:15.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess the experience of looking at the painting— it's a triptych and the central panel is a train compartment with an open suitcase and a suit lying on a chair that is covered in blood. And based on the painting technique, the blood is very spattery and sort of coagulated and three-dimensional, not in a cheesy way, but you can definitely see the brushstrokes. The train compartment is sort of head-on, so the experience is almost like looking at a train rushing toward you full of violent death. I mean, you can see that. And it's sort of weird. Your defenses go up. It's very alarming once you sort of recognize what's going on. You're instantly on guard and afraid.</p>

<p>[32:09.6]</p>

<p>And then you sort of have time to look at the other two panels and one is two people in bed. And it's very abstract, so there aren't obvious things going on. In one panel, sort of two figures are lying in a bed, one of them seems to be screaming. It's hard to tell what's going on. And the other two, there are two figures on a bed, but you can't even tell that they're figures. It's this sort of circular mess and jumble of flesh and you sort of discern that there are enough features for it to be two people. But it looks rather terrifying. Reading Sweeney [and] Agonistes and looking at the painting, you sort of figure out oh, this is probably like — looking at the first one long enough —childbirth is happening. (laughter) Although with such abstract figures, it's hard to tell. And the most famous line in the poem is "that's all the facts when you come to brass tacks — birth, marriage and death"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is from the Eliot poem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sorry, it's birth, copulation and death, I think. That's a funny sanitization on my part. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the sanitization? I know you switched — what did you switch for copulation?</p>

<p>[33:33.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Marriage. (laughter) Very different. (laughter) I mean, that line in the poem is an interesting compression of the influences Eliot was drawing on. (pause) I guess I was very interested in the way the painting — I mean, one of Francis Bacon's main goals is to be in the figural not figurative mode, which by that he means he doesn't want to create a narrative in his paintings, even in his triptychs, which is sort of interesting because you would think that by separating three images but connecting them in a series, it's sort of hard not to make a narrative out of that.</p>

<p>[34:44.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, [like a two-] panel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because we're so eager to find connections. But he did a fair amount of triptychs even though this is one of the main tenets of his artistic creed. So I was very interested — and he has had several paintings that reference literary works, and his explanation is that he likes to read and sometimes in the course of reading, some impressions will rise to the surface. He's not trying to retell the story and it's not like an illustration in any way. But he does enjoy being inspired by other great artists. So there's this sense that a work has some essence and some effect on the reader which is singular and can then be translated into another form that is somehow not narrative. It's pretty interesting to think about how successful he is and what goes on in that transition.</p>

<p>[35:52.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean it's something more like a haiku or something where it's about conveying one impression or, in this case, a collection of impressions that happen to be related. But, if I follow, it sounds like part of what he is playing around with is that even with something as sort of narratively linkable as birth, copulation and death, he can just sort of hit you with all three in this way where that's not that dimension of it that you experience most, but rather something more immediate and sort of striking and sort of at a different level. Do I have sort of the gist?</p>

<p>[36:46.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that the visual form is sort of meaningful in itself and in its own way and does not require narrative, and to take something from narrative and respond to it meaningfully in a way that is not narrative is sort of a remarkable effort. I think in the paper, I argued that —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry — I just want to make sure that I'm keeping up — that the way that he's able to — it seems to me like he's able to convey something about an experience or about experiences that are usually linked narratively that affects you on a level that's non-narrative and which was always there, but probably wasn't the conscious focus so much as the sort of narrative unfolding was.</p>

<p>[38:13.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That sounds right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it reminds me of, as it happens, you know somebody like — I don't know if you've read Winnicott but somebody like him was pretty good at this sort of thing too, I think, in sort of hearing in that case something that was more developmentally more primitive in what might sound like a more mature story that somebody is telling. So not necessarily in terms of A to B to C to D to E that's being conveyed, but something about the way B and E and maybe A a little bit point toward some kind of earlier experience that isn't exactly being, isn't sort of the point necessarily of the narrative, but is evoked by various elements of it.</p>

<p>[39:23.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I read one piece by Winnicott many years ago, and I remember being very interested. But yeah, that is one of the things that interests me both about Glass and Bacon. I think I argued in the paper that one of the reasons that particular triptych was so effective was the first impression is just so absolutely overwhelming and shocking and it forces you to take in the visual, to take in the shapes, the colors, the perspective in which the train compartment full of death is headed straight for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like it really kind of takes you over that way, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the violence of it does not allow a narrative. But then after a few moments, however long, you sort of get a little bit used to it and then you look at the title and say oh, how could that connect to this T. S. Eliot poem? Oh birth, copulation and death. How interesting. But you never shake that sort of first impression of it.</p>

<p>[40:37.2]</p>

<p>And I think you sort of get what Eliot was going for in one like — like a few seconds of looking at something and of course he has a lot of different things going on that are interesting that are worthwhile. Like it's not a knock at Eliot or a knock at literature, but it's sort of remarkable how much Bacon conveys what is at the heart of Eliot's play/poem. And as a feat, it's very impressive. And the fact that he takes you out of it for a minute and then allows you to wander back, having explored the other possibilities, like oh, let's think about the figurative. No, actually the figural is those paintings' primary achievement. That's kind of amazing. Makes it even more attractive than if he had just named it something totally random.</p>

<p>[41:33.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's able to collect all of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so it's sort of a brilliant process for him to construct for his viewers. In some ways I wonder if Glass is doing something a little bit like that, in that he takes progressions and cadences that are very satisfying and repeats them with small changes over time. And it's funny, he doesn't describe himself as minimalist. He really deflects that label. He calls himself classically trained, which I think is like really smart because it's like "I know what everyone else did, and I'm still doing what I do, knowing that." (laughter) And so it's fun to think like what are the decisions he's made that are very different from the decisions Mozart and Haydn made and sort of thinking about all these sorts of surface activity which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>[42:32.1]</p>

<p>Not to like knock Mozart and Haydn, but so much is going on and over these basic chord progressions that our — I mean, there are complex things going on harmonically, but it's still 2-4-5-1 at the heart of it. (laughter) And I was wondering to what degree Glass somehow managed to take the reason why we really listen to Mozart and Haydn and what this sort of primal impulse is there and sort of capture that and show us what we want in a sense in this very concentrated form.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And that's how it's kind of Bacon-like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like as Bacon is to Eliot, Glass may be to Mozart and Haydn, yeah?</p>

<p>[43:27.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, I would never want it to sound like I was privileging him over them, but it's like the work he's doing is very interesting and very valuable for listeners and very thought-provoking. It's more philosophical in a sense, because the work of Mozart and Haydn is sort of created to be enjoyed and lived with and appreciated, but not necessarily questioned. You receive it as you would a work of classic literature where you think "oh my God, look at all these amazing things that are happening. This is so wonderful." (chuckles) But Glass really forces you to think "okay, why am I listening to the same passage over and over and over?" (laughter) And it's weird because in one sense it's this totally immersive experiential form, but in the other sense it does make you sort of profoundly question why you're doing it in the first place. And that combination, the two extremes of it, it's so amazing that he can harness both of those qualities. (pause) I think a lot of modern art and music that fails, fails because it's not experiential. It does not immerse the reader or the viewer —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's sort of intellectually academically interesting but doesn't seem like it grabs you in that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And sometimes it's not even intellectually interesting. I mean, there are interesting things about pop art and I think the theme that surrounded it and the following implications for what could be art and what influences art could draw on. They're both very interesting. But the art itself, I mean, it's great as design.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, like Warhol (inaudible at 45:32.6)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mainly. I think Warhol is sort of the prime example. I think that as designs and in things that were very influential, like he's great. But I don't know that you stand in front of one of his paintings and have this immersive —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The kind of experience that you have like standing in front of the Bacon painting. Like you looked at what was going on for people in the first half second that they saw it.</p>

<p>[46:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And of course looking at Warhol conveys all these questions about the nature of art, which I think we're very used to asking and aren't necessarily bad, effective, or don't take people down interesting roads because we're so used to questioning what is art. Whereas with Glass, because we are so drawn in and it imposes itself upon us and makes us feel something whether we want to or not, the questions may be the same questions but I think we're implicated in them in a much more personal and profound way. So it seems much more important to answer them. Whereas with Warhol, it's like okay, there are these questions this raises that I'm very aware of, whatever, and we can go look at the next painting.</p>

<p>[46:48.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It doesn't make you confront your own reactions in the same way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I'll see you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

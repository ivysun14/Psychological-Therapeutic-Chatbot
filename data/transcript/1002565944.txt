<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So, um, he's been having a bit of a time here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it hasn't been as important [INAUDIBLE] until he started this new school to be able to stay focused all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did he start?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE].  All right, so [DATE].  All right, so this is the all day, was the other one a half a day?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he's been a half day in kindergarten, then he went to like a daycare which was no big deal.  But this is an all day school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  So.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I'll tell you the difference between having the right amount of medication and not is he can do an excellent job versus not being able to do it at all.  The same exact task, like adding or, um, you know, pretty much his memory is horrible when he doesn't have it, and his frustration level, and he can't stick with anything.  And he can't absorb anything, whereas when he's on the right amount of medication it's amazing.  He is just amazing.  I mean, in 6 weeks he caught up with, now keep in mind this is a gifted school, so he caught up with the other kids had done in his group, over a half a course of the year which means he's halfway through a first grade math book.  He's halfway through the first grade math book and I taught him, we taught him that within 6 weeks.  As you can imagine, I mean, the kid's smart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Input output is the same thing with out.  If you can get him where he needs to be, you know, so he, um, he needs some stability.  And what, you know, what's happening is [INAUDIBLE].  So, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you did a couple things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We did a couple things.  One was he moved up the timing of the, initially moved up the timing of the 5 mg and it worked, but, um, it wasn't [INAUDIBLE].  And so then we were dosing him with the 10 mg and then it wouldn't last as long as because we were giving it to him like at 11:00.  So it wouldn't last long.  Then you said to go to, and I haven't tried this yet, I wanted to start them this week on this to give him 2 at 11:00 so it would be 10 mg at 11:00, and then another 5 at like 1:30.  That was a suggestion you had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Yeah, that was the later, the February.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It is difficult for them to give 2 doses, um, but they're willing to try, it's just remembering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so you're going to, I guess they can't do that without a prescription.  Anyway.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  I wanted to wait for an order from you today.  But I told them that that was coming.  I've done it at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you want, um, 10 mg at 11:00 a.m. and 5 mg at 2:00?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One to 2 I think is the, I don't know if you can do that on a prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, I think if, 15.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's 2 hours later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's almost like we could, if that works, then it's, sounds like we could do 20 at 11:00, 20 in the morning and 20 at 11:00.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How long would it last?  And that's the other issue.  At home he can't do anything because by then it's gone.  And he does need to do a little extra work at home and the only time I can do it is on the weekends.  So I don't know if we should worry about that right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, is he taking the regular Focalin?  Well, what time are you home, when he gets home, what time's he get home?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I pick him up at 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he could do some work in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He could do a little bit if he had the medication [INAUDIBLE] him, but I also [INAUDIBLE] sleep, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, but if we gave him, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Give him 20, it'd last longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but let's not do that yet.  Let's do 3, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he takes the initial 20 at like 7:30 in the morning, and so that's getting him through 2:00, after, if he takes it after 11:00 he's falling off.  If he takes it around 11:00 the next dose is maintained.  So what is that 5 hours?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  Um, all right, so, um, this would be the XR.  And then, uh, well, it lasts for, what, 4 1/2, the 20, to 11:30, something like that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Probably.  I mean, it probably has, it definitely taper, the impulsivity and the focus are the first to go.  He's not hyper then, but those 2 are the first 2 go.  They notice it with things like speaking out a lot instead of being able to raise his hand, impatience goes up, frustration level comes quicker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's had a couple of outbursts too though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, they made me come get him one day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It scared me 'cause I didn't want him getting kicked out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So his new, and it probably follows, it probably does follow the medication.  It's hard to say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  So, you know, basically, um, but overall I mean mood is much more stable than it was before.  I mean, from way back in the beginning.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I tell you what's better is just the not mood so much, the impulsivity and, yeah, I mean, just ability to do things.  Um, that's what's a lot better.  Ability to be who he is, be, he still has these temper tantrums so to speak, you know, this sort of yelling.  Um, so I think he has a better ability to like go to a teacher and get help than before he might have just acted out and clobbered somebody.  But I'm not sure [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so if we do the Focalin XR at 20 mg, one in the morning, and 5 mg, 2 at 11:00 a.m., and then at 1:00 p.m., set it for 1:00?  One thirty?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's fine, somewhere around there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, if it's one thirty, if we give him 10 at 11:00 maybe we should do 1:30 and hopefully something will still be working when he's home, when he first gets home.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why not give him the 15 all at once 'cause just to spread it out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we can do that.  Do you want to do that, that actually might be, that would be a lot easier.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a lot easier on the teachers and the school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Now do you want me to give you some regular, um, Focalin if you want to experiment with it a little bit?  Yeah, like a short acting stuff to, um, it comes in 2.5, 5, I'll give you the 5's.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, because like there might be things, you know, like if he wants to play baseball or something and that goes a little later in the evening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or he says he wants to take piano, so he'd have to be able to focus during that timeframe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This is all frontal lobe stuff, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, pretty much.  It's, um, uh, it's, um, a lot of, I mean, I'm just, has he ever been, he's never been on Strattera was he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well during the mornings he's not behaviorally, it's like a, it is bad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's really bad in the morning.  You can't get him to get his socks on, you literally have to almost put his clothes on him for him because he just [INAUDIBLE] and all of this is worse since he's been on the medication.  It's like when he's off he will literally [INAUDIBLE] jump up and down like a monkey [INAUDIBLE] like this and swing this while he's talking to you.  Like a lemur.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Worse than no medicine?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's worse than when he didn't take medicine, so now that he's on medication, when he's off the medicine that's part is worse than when he never took medicine before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not that it just looks worse in comparison?  It really is?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, I thought about that.  I don't think so.  I'm not sure I could have tolerated.  I'm not sure, you never know what you can tolerate while you're doing it, right?  Um, it's pretty bad though.  It's bad.  It's completely, 2 completely different kids.  Unbelievably.  You know, before I used to say it's like, okay, I can't leave him, I can't leave him.  When he's like that, you can't leave him, you cannot leave him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Um, all right.  So Focalin XR, um, 20 mg and then 15 mg.  You're in [DEIDENTIFIED] right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What do I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, what school wise?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's in a private school in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] form?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's fine.  It doesn't really matter as long as they have something from you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, this yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If it says the county public school just cross that out and put [DEIDENTIFIED] and initial it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'll make a copy.  So let me get you the, um, now the regular stuff—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I want you to weigh him too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	His brother is half a head taller again, and it wasn't like that, so I mean somebody could have had a growth spurt, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.  Says one, you can try a quarter or a half the first couple times to make sure that's okay.  Here are these guys.  And, um, I'll do this.  And let me, how old is he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[AGE].  Find out in a minute what he weighs.  How tall is he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, we'll figure that out.  All right, so last time I saw you, yeah, it was—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	At what point, what are the things that I would look for to understand talking to you about whether we thought Abilify would be something that he would benefit from?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a good question.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If I see a mood, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's definitely, yeah, he's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Mood stability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And he's not so defiant, he's just, it's just not possible, yeah, but, um, it's different.  I mean, it might be, but then again perhaps we could try Strattera which is a non—stimulant and see if that will work around the clock some so when he gets up he might be able to function a little better.  You hate it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That didn't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	As well as the older one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I hate to put him on that and pull him off this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, not pull him off this.  This works.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, I see what you mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just adding some.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I gotcha, okay, all right, I wouldn't object to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I wouldn't pull him off.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I just, you know, it is tough on him too to go up and down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's very aware of himself in that he knows and he feels, he'll tell you he feels bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  So [INAUDIBLE].  You want to come here for a second, buddy?  All right, hop on, 43.8, ohh.  Um, that's good.  That's basically.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe he's gotten a little taller.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I look at his, used to be where he weighed more than his brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Geez.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And his brother was taller.  And now he weighs less and is shorter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's slow, I don't know if that's a natural slowing or if it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, okay.  Let's do a month again just to see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we have it set up for a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do already?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Let's, um, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

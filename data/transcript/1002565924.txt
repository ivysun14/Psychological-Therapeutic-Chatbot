<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you doing today, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm very jittery.  Um, and I'm very, I'm very dif, like I'm having a panic attack.  On my, on my way here, I, uh, I, I, I don't know how to explain it, but it was, it was like all of a sudden hallucination and, and, and panic attack I suppose, but I, uh, I was, I thought some, someone or some people were following me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I kept turning around and everything and I, seemed I saw peop, someone, a figure behind a telephone pole but there, there really wasn't no one there and then a car, and I, I realize that, you know, this is not real, you know?  But it's, it's too, it's so, represents a problem because it is real at the moment it's happening—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's like today I, I feel so like jumpy and, and I, and I, I, you know, I, I, I haven't, I, and, and, doc, you know, I, I, I think you, I think you saw me, you saw me last time when I had a, uh, manic, you know, episode.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I haven't had one as far as I know since, it's been a while.  I saw myself on the edge of, and this is the weirdest thing.  I may think it's, I'm on the edge of having a panic attack, but once I'm in it, I, I have no idea I'm in the manic, what is happening, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All I know is to me I feel great, you know?  I feel like everything is going in order.  I mean I was doing everything and getting things done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I, I, I will say that I don't, I don't feel that way today that I can get things done, I can tell you that because lately I, I, you know, I took the Ambien, you know, to go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have been sleeping, and this is when I'm actually able to do so.  I [INAUDIBLE] maybe 20 hours out of 24 hours.  I don't know what, what's happening with me.  I feel exhausted all the time and if I don't force myself to get out of the house, cause when I get out of the house sometimes I feel a little bit better except for like what's happening today when I'm hearing like voices and, you know, and, and this voice I was, that I was talking about when I was walking here, this is not a voice that I've heard before cause I have 3 distinct voices as you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this voice is, is very ominous, you know?  It's, um, it's confirming my, my, I guess, hallucination on what, whatever I'm feeling that someone's on top of me, someone's following me and, um, being that, going back to what I was saying about the sleeping thing, um, you know, I, after all this time of having depression and I know what depression is and everything, right?  It, it, I refuse to believe that I'm depressed because, um, my [INAUDIBLE] is better than they are, you know?  My mechanism, my, my, my, uh, what do they call it?  Defense mechanism is laughter, you know?  I try and I, and I, I try to make, force myself to be happy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But as I was, I was talking to, to my friend, you know my partner, and he was saying, he was just saying he's been watching me lately and he says you have the classic examples of depression where you're sleeping a lot, you can't finish anything.  I mean we've been working on the kitchen.  This is going on now at 6 weeks to paint a kitchen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I, and I have a bad leg.  I can't mess with, you know, a ladder, but if the day is good and I'm feeling good, but I can't do but maybe like 20 minutes of work and cause, you know, he'll be at work or whatever.  He doesn't live with me, but, you know, I'll do like 20 minutes of work and then I'm, I'm like exhausted.  I'm like I can't do this.  It's too much overwhelming and then I start looking around.  I've got piles of mail here.  So I, I mean I, I, I finish the mail, but then I have to shred certain things, you know those offers and credit cards.  I have to, I, and I don't understand how this can happen to you where I've got a pile that's this high, it was on his desk that high that has to be shredded.  Then I got another pile that goes back much, for like 3 months ago that I had, I just did not, I did not open his mail up.  I did the bills, but I didn't open up the other.  So it's stuff, it could be something in there.  There could be a check in there for me for all I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like lately I've just been, I can't, I look at everything like okay, I write a list because writing a list will make me do what I have to do and then it, it's too, too overwhelming for me and so I say, okay, I'll lay down and I'll rest and, and the thing with the eating, you know, I've, I've had the problem with the eating.  I, I, I, last week I was eating everything in sight.  I mean I was just eating, I ate like 2, I was eating 3 times in an evening.  At dinnertime, I woke up around midnight, I ate again, and then 3:00 in the morning, 4:00 or 5:00 I ate again and normally [INAUDIBLE] is good cause you know I, I, I usually don't eat, you know?  I, it's, I have to force myself to eat when I'm, you know, when I'm really, really depressed, but not, but lately I, I, I don't feel like my partner and my lover keeps asking me, are you depressed?  I said I don't think I am, but cause I'm eating and usually when I'm depressed, I stop eating, but I just don't have interest in anything.  I don't, I really don't care.  I mean I, I packed away all the dishes and everything because, you know, to do the kitchen, paint the kitchen.  So I just had 2 plates out, 2 glasses, you know, just in the meantime and here it's going on 6 weeks and I, I, and I said, [NAME OTHER], I don't get it.  I said it's half finished.  Okay.  It's got to be done, right?  I keep saying it's got to be done by Halloween.  It's got to be done by, you know, [INAUDIBLE] and, and the one thing about the eating thing when it's been like that is I am eating, but what I'll do is I'll lay down in bed and say, okay, I'll eat in an hour or I'll get up in an hour.  Okay, I'll get up in an hour.  I'm watching the TV and there's nothing, I'm not even watching the TV.  I'm just looking [INAUDIBLE] whatever's on TV and then they say now, oh, my God, it's 2:00 in the morning, I've got to eat.  And I, and I, and, but I sleep.  I, I mean I, I, I fell asleep at the stove, uh, 2 nights ago.  I was making something and I just fell asleep at the stove and I, I woke up in time that I didn't burn anything, but all I want to do is just sleep and, and I don't understand why, why it's that way cause I don't, once again I don't feel depressed, you know?  I, I, and, you know, I, these medications that you've been giving me and don't take this the wrong way, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you've been the most, most helpful doctor I've had and the medications work.  I, I mean I don't, I don't know what, I don't know how to measure it if it's working or not.  I'm not any worse off than I was and we've changed it so many different times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At this point, I figured well, what more changes could be made, you know, because this is [INAUDIBLE].  I, and then I, I just, I, I don't understand if I'm trying to avoid responsibility.  I don't know what it is.  I just don't feel like caring.  I don't, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I threw myself together today and, and here's something.  I'm wearing torn jeans and a nice jacket.  You see I'm, I do half—ass shit.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, well, some people that's, that's the style though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, well, okay.  But, but I usually, you know, if I'm going to wear something nice, you know, do the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I [INAUDIBLE].  But I don't know.  I, uh, these 3 voices that I usually hear—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have been quiet.  They, they have been quiet.  Maybe because I'm sleeping so much, I don't know, but they have been quiet.  But, oh, my aunt came, my aunt is [AGE] today because she was born late, late in life from my grandmother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and she knows I'm gay and everything and she's cool with it and everything.  She came and spent the night at my apartment and she said in the middle of the night she said I feel sorry for your neighbors.  I was like, why?  And she said you're, you're fighting with somebody in your dreams, [PATIENT NAME], and she says you're very vocal in your dreams and I was like, well, what do I say?  And she says, you said, you kept saying things like get away from me, get away from me, and then you said, I'll kill you, I'll kill you.  And then the next day she said I said, one other thing I said, uh, I said, [INAUDIBLE] dream about it, I said you're like a tear, here today, gone tomorrow, and nobody will find your body when I finish with you.  And when she says it, it's so distinct what I say and then I go into [INAUDIBLE] and she only meant the door was closed.  So she could only imagine what if I'm fighting, if I'm toying around in the bed, but that, there are many times when I'm rolling in bed, you know, and I'll wake up in the morning and the pillows are all over the floor and I don't know what that's about because I don't remember any kind of dream, you know?  I'm just grateful that I sleep, but I don't know why I'm sleeping so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I [INAUDIBLE], but anyhow, my, my partner doesn't know everything about my circumstances, you know?  I told you that once before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he ever complain about your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he says I, I, I, I almost gave him a black eye one time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He says you do fight in your sleep.  So what he does is because he's a big guy and he's bipolar.  He says what he does is, cause I'm not one of these people, people that, you know, I like to be cuddling when I go to sleep.  I don't want you to touch me.  Let me sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So what he does though is he says he puts me on his arms when I'm asleep he goes because otherwise you thrash about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he, he has, he has sometimes that I talk in my sleep, but he, he can't understand what, what, what I'm, what, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about, but my aunt was the only, but he has complained about that.  I asked, and you know what [INAUDIBLE] I asked my mother about that.  She said that, um, around the age of [AGE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I used to do, I started doing that and I was wondering because, you know, where I had the problem with the incest and everything that my brother did to me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was [AGE] when that happened and I, I don't know if that has a connection to it, but I, uh, my relationship is going very, very well and, uh, it's, um, I, I haven't, he probably knows that I'm bipolar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause he's a cop, you know?  He's, you know, he's got training on [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, he won't say anything.  He wants, it's in, it's in, it's in his best interest not to say it to me because I, I won't, I won't tolerate knowing, knowing what my diagnosis is or trying to diagnose me, you know?  I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but he, he, he has, he has a problem with sometimes when I just become quiet because I mean as you know I can talk, but when I become just quiet, he thinks that I'm mad and I'm not.  There are, there are days actually [INAUDIBLE], but one of the reasons that we don't live together is, I mean I love him dearly and I make a joke out of it when I say if we live together it'd be in the east wing and the west wing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's the only way it actually would work with me because I'm not the easiest person to live with and I, I don't like to feel that I'm smothered, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it would, it would be, financially it would be to my advantage to [INAUDIBLE] move in together, but I, I just can't do it and I have this fear that, you know, when you move in with somebody, you know, of course you've got to make sure, I, make sure my name's on the lease, but, you know, since he's bigger than me [INAUDIBLE] throw me out the damn door and everything and then I'll be homeless again or something, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean he, he doesn't seem like the type that would do that, but you never know.  People, I'll put it this way.  We've, we've, you know, gone on vacations together and, you know, he spends, he's almost at my house 5 times a week and it's almost like living together, but I mean there are times when he goes out the door and I'm like thank God, I'm alone again, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think that I, I would be, it would ruin our relationship if we had to live together because there are certain things that, that I don't want him to see that I do, you know, and nothing perverted or anything.  It's just I talk to myself a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he made a joke one time, his mother said, um, she said to me that people who talk to themselves either have a lot of money in the bank or they're crazy.  [LAUGHING].  But I, I've had full blown conversations when he's not around and I actually enjoy them.  It's as if I'm, I'm talking to someone and they're not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're not hearing the voices when, when you do that?  You're just talking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, any way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] on your thoughts or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll put it this way.  Uh, the voices are like the third party.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never, when I'm talking to myself, I'm, I'm talking as if someone's standing right there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we're go, go, and, and in my mind we're going back and forth.  Like I'll, I'll answer his questions that he, but this is an imagine, this is like, you know, like people have imaginary friends and everything.  This is like my imaginary friend—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then what will happen is the voices will be the third party saying what?  What are you talking about?  How, where did you get that from?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, I, and I'll say I, I, it's just like they hit my brain that way that way all 3 of us have a conversation because one out of the 3 voices will always chime in during my little conversations with myself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, sometimes [INAUDIBLE] depression is sometimes after these conversations, I do get seriously depressed.  It's like night and day.  I used to go sink all the way down and then the next thing you know, it's gone on for 2 weeks and it, and I, I, I don't know if it's because of the conversation that I've had to, to nobody that starts it because the, uh, the depression can happen like that with me and I, I know why you, it's Cymbalta why you were giving me that too because [INAUDIBLE] about it.  The pain that, I do have physical pain in my hips—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And everything, but I guess it does [INAUDIBLE] it helps with other pain that, you know, that I guess comes out every ache and pain, you know, you have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It becomes exaggerated by the depression.  Um, there's a commercial that's out that I'm going to tell you something that really sums up how I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The woman, it's talking about bipolar and she's on the ocean, on the, uh, on the, uh, shore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Walks in the sand and the waves come in.  I think whoever did that commercial really caught the essence of how I feel sometimes.  The, the wave comes in, it's overwhelming—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, the stress and everything and sadness and then the wave goes back and then everything's fine, but if you notice in the commercial, the waves keep going back and forth—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's what causes really, I like to break up in my mind because I, I, I, I get, you know, I might be, I get social security and disability, not SSI—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was based on my physical condition and then I, you know, I have the, the, the psychiatric diagnosis, but, uh, the, um, even, even if my hips were fixed, I can never go back to work because my mind, I can't keep my mind together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know?  It's very fragmented and stuff, but anyway, but and then I don't know what's going to happen when you're, when you're gone.  I mean who will I get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll, uh, I guess with, I don't know who they'll assign you to, but, uh, whichever doctor's available at least initially until they sit down and start reassigning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And also hiring new, new doctors.  They're going to do that too.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are you the only one leaving?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, no.  Uh, at, you know, as far as, uh, next week, but, um, a couple other doctors are leaving by the end of this year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know where you're going now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I already started there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What, do you mind telling me the name of the place or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's called [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is it, is it in the [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that's in the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I live in the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I, I already started working there in, uh, early August.  So I've been working there and, you know, still doing private practice too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, if you e—mail me, maybe I'll use it for a change.  You wouldn't mind, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And have you seen, um, [NAME OTHER]?  You know who I'm talking about?  [NAME OTHER], I can't ever seem to remember.  He, he was [INAUDIBLE], you know, muscular guy, Puerto Rican.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's gone downhill [INAUDIBLE] problems on the street and everything and he was telling me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's gone back to drugs and, and he, you were his doctor he told me and, and he used to claim he didn't need medication, but he's really messed up and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told him I, I told him I would mention his name to you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, cause, and there's nothing you can do anyway because [INAUDIBLE] anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean he'd have to come back in here [INAUDIBLE] pretty much, he needs to come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway.  Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

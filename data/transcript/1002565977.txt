<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phew, you'd think I'd know that by now after all these times, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have to fill out both sides here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  They're different things.  One is the HIPAA and one is, you know, just permission.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so, um, perfect.  All right, so what's doing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and they're going fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  They have?  That's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I mean what happened, what did we—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last time you were kind of angry a little bit.  I'm not sure why, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he was having problems with some kids at school.  I think that was that.  That's been taken care of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You solved it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They were giving him a really hard time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did you, um, how did you manage to take care of that?  Did you get them to stop?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, well actually my mom just sent them an e—mail, just sent the school an e—mail.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all, and they took care of it?  Amazing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They were just giving him a hard time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, I know.  I know, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Calling him names and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, I know that, but it's, it's amazing that the school would just, that's good.  It's very nice to hear that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The vice principal called him in and [PATIENT NAME] told him what was happening, and he talked to the boys he hasn't any problem since.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a lot easier than kicking things and getting angry, getting somebody to think about how to fix it and get somebody to fix it.  That's responsible and da da.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, that doesn't happen.  Sometimes that doesn't, you know, the schools aren't, um, as cooperative   So, that's fabulous that they just right away called you in and took care of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Life's better, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it really doesn't feel good to have people teasing you, picking on you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's hard to relax and pay attention and all that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, that's really, um, um, all right.  So how's your, your mood's been pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's been stable.  What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, he said his medication doesn't need to be increased.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to increase it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't want me to increase it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Leave it alone?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We increased it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Last time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] we increased the Strattera a little bit last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, did you ever share this with your mother, the Strattera, no.  No, that's a good idea not to since it's your medicine, but, um, the Strattera, what did we do?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You gave me some samples of 10's to see how it works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.  Oh yeah, okay.  Did we use those, or we didn't use those?  We did.  Are we still using them?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, what's he take, the 10 and then 80?  So, what's the next dosage?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Six hundred fifty million.  It's a big jump.  I got a smile.  I knew you were paying attention, that's good.  Um, I figured if I didn't make it outrageous enough you wouldn't necessarily care what I was saying.  Um, 90, oh my God.  Well, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ninety is what he's taking right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Let me see what we can, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is it a big jump from 80?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no from 90 it goes to a 100.  I mean from 80 it goes to 100.  So, it's like 10 mg more.  It's one thing as opposed to if we stayed on 90, which would give him 518's, but that is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the insurance company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, they don't like that.  That's like majorally annoying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We could try 100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see.  Let's see if you, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's the 80 look like?  I forgot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's blue like the other capsule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.  The 60 was blue and orange.  I just don't know, oh, it's 80 is orange and white.  You like that orange color?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't really matter what color it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but I'm asking if you like the orange color because the 100 is all orange.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think we should try 100.  You're taking 90 now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like the 80 a little bigger than the 60, and the 100 looks a little bigger than the 80, but it's a lot smaller than 518s.  Sound good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you're actually going to take less pills.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, which is good.  You only got one little one that you can take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come on, get back in here.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's sleeping okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about eating?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He hasn't been sleeping during the day even if you're tired at school, right?  Have you been tired at school or you're good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean have you noticed a change in focus, attention and it's hard to say?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How about you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's at least as good as before if not better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if it's better, it's like subtle.  It's a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And maybe it's better 'cause you're not being bothered by all those kids, and maybe it's a combination so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think we should try it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um, so the Abilify, what is it, it's 10?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The 10 mg?  Yeah, okay.  All right, and when do you take that, at night?  At night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Wellbutrin is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One and one.  One in the morning, one at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and the Zoloft is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No more Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Off.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  So he just takes three right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wait, when did we get off the Zoloft?  Oh, two weeks ago.  All right.  Two weeks before the last appointment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So a month and a half.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, and he seems to be fine with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Good, good, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're not nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Anxious?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In fact less, but again that might be a combination of, Strattera can sometimes help with anxiety, you know, as you go up, it helps a little more.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But removing the cause of the anxiety or a lot of it is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, all right.  So you're only on three medications.  Remarkable.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's good.  Plus your allergy [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, that means they're here.  It doesn't mean it's their, it's not quite their appointment time.  So, Strattera's in the morning?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Night.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Everything's at night except one Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, tell me how much you weigh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One forty two point eight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One forty two point eight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once again, 142.8.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Shoes off.  That's um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, you're still, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Growing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're still growing taller, but you're also quite on the thin side.  So, it's good that you gain a couple of pounds here and there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What that's gained weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your upper—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not in my lower body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, maybe it's your big toe.  Maybe because I can't see that 'cause your sock's still on.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, he's gained since last time, right?  I just don't want to lose—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 4.6.  That's good.  That's actually—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He seems a lot taller.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yes, absolutely.  All right, so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Remember what a little guy he was?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I do.  You used to be cute back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hey.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you're handsome.  You're too big to be cute, don't you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  So, it's nice to see you in a good mood.  Things are peaceful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're running around asking, begging your mother to give you more things to do so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can be helpful, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean no?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phew, my goodness.  All right, Abilify 10, one at night, Wellbutrin 150 XR one twice a day, Strattera 100 one at night.  Here are these.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And here's this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, you know what, I just filled the Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I'll get [NAME OTHER] to get you, how long ago?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, last weekend.  So maybe three bottles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you 8 of 18's.  I'll give you 18's, so it's 98.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's close.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's closer, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then I can use up what I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause this is $50 now.  I mean it would be a lot more without insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Geez, oh my God.  It would be a lot more, but that's still—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I couldn't afford all these drugs without insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I mean it used, you know, five years ago, the copay would have been $10.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, this is a lot.  Two of his drugs are 50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a lot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Abilify and the Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's crazy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you want to do like six weeks or something?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, this is fabulous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that it?</p>

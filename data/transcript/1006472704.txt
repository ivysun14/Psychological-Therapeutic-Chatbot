<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>Interview with Wes Crenshaw</b></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> In addition to specializing my doctoral electives in family psychology, I was trained in Strategic Therapy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As I noted in my book <b>Treating Families and Children in the Child Protective System</b>, the Strategic approach emphasizes four curative factors in psychotherapy, all of which are present in this case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Personal Influence.</b> Therapists have something valuable to offer clients beyond a kind presentation, empathic ear and willingness to give them what they state that they want. Thus, Strategic Therapy is directive and the effectiveness of the intervention is based in equal measure on the expertise and benevolence of the therapist. While some approaches deny or minimize the role of personal influence XE "Personal Influence", this position actually obscures the therapist's real juxtaposition to the client, the family, and the larger system. The Strategic approach contends that holding the therapist out as powerless or neutral is fallacious, disingenuous, and at times even dangerous to treatment and client best interests. Therapy is never truly value free, so the therapist must be clear and honest about the values he or she brings to the case. As a generic example, I am a strong opponent of substance abuse, yet I work with many clients who partake. All my clients know this about me and are able to make an informed consent. However, I am careful when giving a directive about substances, to base it on literature and reason, not my personal convictions. </p>

<p>Techniques of personal influence that appear in this case include: Speaking the language of the client; Finding common interest or experience with a powerful family member; Showing empathy for the family, a member of the family or some subset thereof; Reframing a set of behaviors in a more positive light; Providing a humorous alternative to an inappropriately grave situation; Normalizing frightening or upsetting situations as manageable problems faced by many people now and/or throughout history; Problematizing situations that cause trouble for the family or a member of the family, when they have become accepted as normal or unchangeable; Teaching from a position of experience and expertise about the nature of a problem from both the child and parent perspective.</p>

<p><b>Belief in Free Will:</b> Strategic Therapy has traditionally held that free will reigns supreme over determinism from psychobiology, diagnosis, environment, and various systems of control. We acknowledge and teach about determinism, proposing for example, that a diagnosis (in this case ADHD) is not an excuse for some limitation, but an explanation that offers a roadmap for a better tomorrow. This goes well beyond an optimistic reframe. It is a core belief about how clients learn to change what they can about their lives by accepting and cultivating their own self-efficacy. </p>

<p><b>Utilization.</b> A Strategic therapist becomes expert at learning what works with a given client and how to help the client execute it. By it's definition, the right strategy will vary from case to case as the therapist works to involve the client's environment, experience, patterns of response, and even resistance to treatment rather than make the client fit the therapist's conceptualization. In fact, therapy failure often derives from treating clients as less than unique, expecting them to respond to the therapist's limited understanding of what they should do. Utilization does not require positive regard for or acceptance of the client's worldview, as has been advanced in the post-modern interpretation. It does mean being ever responsive to that worldview and incorporating it into the intervention package.</p>

<p><b>Contextual Change</b>. Strategic Therapists see the most meaningful and lasting change as coming from shifts in the client's larger life context, particularly when that client is a child or teenager. This necessitates an interactional perspective, seeking first to understand how people involve themselves with one another and the world around them XE "family injustice" . Client behavior can be seen as an encoded message to the natural environment requiring a determined effort on the part of the therapist to decode it and utilize it to render change. In this case, both the child and the family are asked to change their approach to one another to better manage the child and mother's mood, his behavior and his academic achievement. Interestingly, this young man did an unusually good job of decoding his own messages, leaving us to jump past a complex interpretation and move directly to changing the dynamic. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>In terms of personal style and process in therapy, readers may be surprised at how much the sessions "sound" like conversation overheard in a coffee shop and how much humor plays a role in that process. We joke about my office cat. We discuss calendaring programs or the local business climate. We learn about fishing and hunting. This is all quite intentional, not superfluous to the aim of therapy and more than a social stage of therapy as Haley proposes in <b>Problem Solving Therapy. </b>The West Coast School of Strategic Therapy (Mental Research Institute, Fisch, Waztlawick, Weakland, etc.) held that the therapist needed to "speak in the language of the client" in order to achieve proper engagement and utilization. I concur. While I am teaching core principles for successful living with ADHD to both Client and his family, I am doing so in stories and illustrations so that they will be retained, understood and followed. This is true for any client I see, but it is especially so for people with problems of attention and focus. For them, therapy can't simply be useful. It has to be entertaining, or else they get bored and stop listening or coming back. I'm also using that conversation to learn more about how the family lives, interacts, and experiences their world, which in turn allows me to do good utilization.</p>

<p>This is also why I don't do any play therapy, even when I see kids in middle school (I don't see anyone younger than sixth grade). I find that these props are more a distraction, and that I can get even young teens involved in discussion by simply knowing what they like to talk about—usually relationships. Most people who come to therapy are really interested in learning how to love and be loved, and if the therapist is able to speak that language and apply it to the client's presenting issues, the therapist will make more progress in a quicker time frame than by following a manualized system of treatment<note id="en1"><b>[1] One of the few manuals I do recommend is the DBT Workbook, which at its core, is a guidebook on how to get along with others by intentional choice and self-regulation. However, even this is an adjunct to therapy. At some point down the road, I might actually assign some of it this client.</b></note>. </p>

<p>An example of how stories can create change in the therapy is Mom's realization that she too has ADHD based solely on my descriptions of what life is like inside Client's head. At no point do I mention my hypothesis that she has ADHD, until she and Dad brought it up. This may not be clear in the transcript, because the first moment of awareness comes non-verbally when we are discussing "the bra situation" as a matter of tactile sensitivity in girls with ADHD. This immediately resonated with Mom and Dad actually pointed at her and nodded while I was talking. Readers might note that Client is a teen boy and would have no awareness of how bras endlessly annoy many women with ADHD. But Mom recognizes this at once and it becomes a humorous way for her to identify with Client's discomforts and to begin to explain some of her own. </p>

<p>I often tell stories about other clients, as the transcript illustrates. This might be jarring to some readers, but in fact it is a technique that comes straight from the work of Milton Erickson, on whose work many modern therapies are based (Strategic, Solution Focused, Narrative, etc.). Readers can rest assured that these stories are (just like the transcript) made anonymous beyond recognition. Therapeutic stories can be general (e.g., "many of my clients find that X is helpful because of Y"). But they can also be specific (e.g., I had this client once who was having the same problem and she found Z helped"). Even if the story really represents a synthesis from several cases, I tell it as if it were about a single person or family. Several of the more popular stories appear in <b>I Always Want to Be Where I'm Not</b>. I even tell stories about my own children, both of whom have ADHD and are very successfully treated. This too may seem jarring, as if I'm sharing too much or working out my own issues. It is instead, a key tool in "selling" change to clients. I not only have the training to talk about ADHD (and a host of other problems), but also the personal experience to empathize. So, when the parents get frustrated with Client, I can say, "I know how you feel. When my kid did that, I was so pissed and I had to do [intervention]." Or when Client is frustrated with parents, I can say, "Yeah, my kid is always telling me that, and I say [something wise]." </p>

<p>I've often had clients tell me that storytelling is a core reason they kept coming back, that it makes them feel understood, and gives them hope. For quiet clients, nothing is worse than a therapist who won't carry the conversation—except for one that asks them how they feel. I am in fact known for being able to work with shy teens and young adults, and knowing how they feel, even though it is at times rather painful and difficult. A core element in that process is finding the right story, usually based on the most minimal cues, and telling it well, so the client doesn't have to. If there is any question as to the accuracy of the story, I usually end with "So, would you like to argue that point?" or at times more gently, "Does that sound about right?" Like the proverbial shoe, if the story doesn't fit, the client won't wear it, and even quiet clients will take issue when that happens, which in turn, gets them engaged. In fact, I sometimes intentionally get it wrong just to pull them into the dialogue.</p>

<p>Granted, this is a complex and intricate methodology and it takes time and energy to learn; but once mastered, it works. The critical factor is that one must NOT be working out his or her own issues, but instead speaking as an expert not just about psychology or in this case, ADHD, but about successful living in general. Clients respect this wisdom and intellectual intuition more than they do a PhD or Board Certification, as long as the stories represent solid psychological principals and fit the specific treatment goals.</p>

<p>I would argue that researchers and insurance companies have become quite enthralled with evidenced based techniques, but not interested enough in communicating with people. In fact, very few clients come in wanting to talk to a therapist. They come in wanting to talk to a person who knows something about therapy. That difference may seem subtle, but it is not, particularly where teens and young adults are concerned. For example, a great deal of what is done in the transcript is covertly cognitive behavioral, not only because the research supports it, but because it works in a clinical setting. However, except for those rare clients who are unusually interested in psychology, most don't like to be spoken to in CBT language that sounds bland and mechanical, even if it works pretty well. Clients want to talk in normal ways with normal words, and it is up to the therapist to figure out how to giftwrap a technique so the client will want to receive and understand it, without having to learn our strange jargon. Too many therapists buy in to the manual and surrender the humanness of a one-to-one relationship. The two can co-exist, and they must.</p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Will you provide a brief description of your training and background? </p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> I have a bachelor's degree in political science, sociology, and history from Southwestern College, and a MEd in Counseling and School Psychology from Wichita State University, with emphasis in Marriage and Family Therapy. I received my PhD in Counseling Psychology in 1994 from the University of Kansas. I was Board Certified (ABPP) in Family Psychology in 2000. During and after my doctoral training, I studied with the founders of East Coast Strategic Therapy, Jay Haley and Cloe Madanes, at the Family Therapy Institute of Washington DC. I have additional training in forensic psychology in child custody evaluation, and twenty-two years of experience and 23,000 hours of client contact. In response to the increased centrality of sexuality and gender issues in the lives of teens, young adults, and the rest of the population, I am spending 2014-15 attaining AASECT certification as a sex therapist and sex educator at the University of Michigan. </p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b>  Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers? </p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> At time of intake and throughout the period of the transcripts, Client was 13-years-old and in the eighth grade. His birthday is in July, making him nearly as young as one can be for his grade level. He was adopted shortly after birth and his parents know little about his biological mother or his birth. He has a younger sister, also adopted at birth but from a different biological family. The family lives in a rural college community in the Midwest and attends a 6 to 8 grade junior high school with 110 classmates per grade. The town is about fifteen miles from a state land-grant college where Dad owns an iconic sporting goods store, and about thirty miles from a metropolitan area of 2.2 million people. Client has not been hospitalized or outplaced, nor has he any history of legal involvement.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the Strategic approach focuses more on the presenting problem than the client's history. History is considered only insofar as it informs the present. An exception is found in cases of family injustice (e.g., child abuse, family violence) or trauma, though none of these pertain to this case. If a client comes in very interested in his or her history, the therapist looks for ways to utilize this in the service of change. If the client has little interest in history, or is unhelpfully preoccupied with it, the therapist will stay focused on the presenting concern. This is why the first question I ask every client is "what brings you in to see me?" While it is possible (and even likely) that as Client moves through adolescence, he will grow interested in his origins, adoption, and biological family, that isn't the concern at this time and attempting to focus on it, is not likely to be productive and perhaps even distracting. If and when that history becomes important to him, Client will have established this relationship and can use it to explore it.</p>

<p>At intake, client was said to have problems with focus, concentration and anger. Asked why he is here, Client admitted that his family was frustrated with him and his behavior toward them. Mom added that they were struggling with school issues, most notably inconsistent academic performance, but also stated that problems with mood and behavior were far less significant at school than at home. Mom noted that Client's behavior "brings out some other behaviors with Dad," but when asked, these were limited to anger and frustration. It was my impression, later confirmed, that in fact the Client's issues appear to frustrate Mom far more than Dad, and lead to conflicts with her. Some of this is due to the greater time spent between Mom and Client, but other factors emerged that indicate a difficult match in personality styles in that dyad. </p>

<p>There was no indication of violence or corporal punishment. Both parents were appropriately concerned that Client spends a great deal of time on social media, phone, and in his room on the computer. They were concerned that he might be consuming pornography online and given that they had no filters on his devices, I suggested (without needing to confirm it with Client) that this was a near certainty. </p>

<p>Mom also hinted that she was afraid of client. It became clearer that this was true within a week of the intake (included as session #1 in this set of transcripts), when Client wrote a note on his iPhone note app entitled "My mom." I have provided it below sic erat scriptum, with identifying information redacted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes I do things I shouldn't, like yell, punch holes in the wall when I am angry, cuss out loud, say things that I shouldn't say, sneak a sip of margarita out of the bottle about once every month, lie, not do my homework, break things, be violent, throw things, kick things, steal things, and much more. But what my mom doesn't realize is that she is the cause of all this and she needs to change. Here are some reasons:</p>

<p>My mom does not understand me. She says that I'm different. She is scared of me. She thinks I am going to shoot her. She does not know how to treat me. She does not help in my life but she thinks she does, but she only makes it worse. She does not trust me. She thinks she knows how to raise a child with ADHD but she does not. If she did, we would not go see a doctor every 1-2 weeks<note id="en"><b>[2] This is actually a reference to seeing me in therapy. This was not obvious to me when I first read it, since, at the time of this writing, the family had only seen me once. But Client is speaking here prospectively about going "every 1-2 weeks."</b></note> on how to control it. She thinks less of me. She points out many flaws that I have then rubs it in. She cares about my grades, but only the bad ones. She is very sarcastic and treats me like I'm stupid. She puts pressure on me if I do something wrong. She makes my life hell. She only points out the bad things that I do and makes me</p>

<p>feel like crap. She takes my phone whenever I do something bad and she only takes away my phone. She thinks it will help, but it makes me so angry then sad, then depressed, then it makes me not want to do my homework, but write things like this instead of doing what I'm pretending to be doing. She makes me want to kill myself without leaving a suicide letter addressed to her because she knows how I feel about her. I honestly hate her. She makes me want to run away. She makes me want to kill myself.</p>

<p>I don't think this will change her mind or change how she treats me but it's a damn good place to start...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Beyond it's eloquence and candor, this note offers a bit of a Rorschach test for a therapist's approach to a child and family. Some would find the language quite frightening, as did Mom, with commentary on self-harm, violent behavior and thinking. Some might even see it as grounds for hospitalization, and in past decades, it might well have been. Others, more in line with Dad's perspective, might see it as a manifesto in which Client is really trying to get out his feelings and frustrations with Mom, so they can be dealt with in therapy; that he is simply responding to my opening question, "What brings you in to see me?"</p>

<p>I fall into this latter category, particularly given that Client wrote the document a week after intake, references therapy, and ends the manifesto by noting that he does not know if such sharing will change how he is treated, "but it's damn good place to start." What better aspiration could a therapy intake have?</p>

<p>Having worked with teens for twenty-two years now, I've come to understand that many harbor disturbing feelings, almost by design. Not all can describe them as articulately and honestly as Client. When a teen does, one may have to listen with a calm ear, lest the therapist initiate or add to the emotional reactivity of family members. At the same time, the therapist does not want to miss one of the tiny fraction of teens prone to harm self or others, so I spent time trying to discern whether this note represented a frustrated young man whose mother is out of sync with who he is, a youth with a budding mood disorder, or the early stages of a disorder conduct. As we discuss early in the sessions, these sorts of issues are prevalent among American adoptees because adoption is not held in high regard for unplanned pregnancy in the US, and thus the very low number of available babies. Likewise without any genetic history on Client, we are left to consider him without any biological context. It was ultimately my conclusion that for now, Client was not a risk to self or others, though he did seem to pose an ongoing risk to drywall, as several holes appeared during the course of treatment.</p>

<p>Client was diagnosed in 4th grade with ADHD-Inattentive Type. There was some concern prior to and early in our sessions that Client might have an underlying mood disorder, but his mood fluctuation seems to stem more from family dynamics, poor frustration tolerance, irritable-ADHD symptoms, and medication washout late in the day. With regards to medication, Client has only been treated for ADHD. Several different medications are said to help, but may also produce side effects. I say, "may" because over the course of the transcribed sessions, it became increasingly clear that Client is no stranger to secondary gain, and capable of feigning or over-focusing on side-effects rather than the benefits of medication. This is an unfortunate situation in a young person for whom medication has been quite helpful, and in our clinic, it is far less common than readers might expect because we emphasize a team approach that affords the client great influence in how medication is managed. That is evident in the transcript, though it does not turn out as I might have hoped, as Client tends to instead manipulate the medication and exaggerate side effects. While the area of ADHD treatment is surprisingly controversial, the literature is clear that the best treatment across large populations is a combination of medication and therapy for both the child and family. Except in a minority of easy cases, that is easier said than done. </p>

<p>The family consistently found methylphenidate medications to be superior to amphetamine types for balancing efficacy and side effects. They particularly liked Concerta, but at the time of intake, Client was on Focalin. Asked, they claimed that Concerta caused Client to lose weight in 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> grade, dropping from 90 lbs and dropped to 80 lbs, which is substantial at this age. However, Focalin is the same medication as Concerta in a different delivery system, and the change may reflect a prescriber with limited experience in stimulant management rather than a logical treatment strategy. I consulted with the provider and we tried Daytrana, which had many properties that made it more tolerable</p>

<p>Asked at intake how Focalin is working for him, Client notes that he doesn't feel good—meaning his stomach growls and he needs to eat but he can't. This formed the first clue that Client might not have sufficient buy-in for medication management, a problem that continued through the ninth session and will probably continue thereafter.</p>

<p>Client had also been tried on Vyvanse, but Mom claims this "made him scary violent." Asked what this means, the family said that he was more than irritable, but when pressed to describe, they admitted that his violence had been limited to kicking holes in the walls and verbal barrages toward his parents, particularly Mom. Yet these same issues emerged during the therapy period, and he was never on Vyvanse at that time, so we again find a questionable feedback loop about how medication is really impacting Client, pro or con. The family also tried, non-stimulant Intuniv and predictably found Client became lethargic. </p>

<p>The reader can see throughout the process how much of an investigation and experiment medication management really is. Too often, in my experience, many clients and providers give up too easily. As I discuss in my book <b>I Always Want to Be Where I'm Not: Successful Living with ADD and ADHD,</b> the interaction of medication, family, attitude toward and oversight of medication, and client/family cognition is critical in improving compliance, minimizing side effects and improving outcomes. As noted, we talk a lot about clients being "on the team," meaning we take very seriously clients' input about medication or any other aspect of their case, and in return, they will agree to be compliant with the protocol we decide upon. In fact, I will not see any non-voluntary teen, nor is that actually legal after the age of fourteen in Kansas. Likewise I will not write a prescriber in support of medication if the client is not giving informed consent. The medication protocol can change based on our team effort and client input, but the client is expected to respect the process as much as I respect the client's input. </p>

<p>This seemed to be working quite well through most of our sessions, but in session 9, Client admitted non-compliance and the family became a bit confused as to what that meant and how to handle it. He also feigned (I believe) a side effect I've never encountered before with the Daytrana patch—extreme tactile pain just from wearing it. Moreover, at this time Client had been on the patch for several months and expressed no such symptom. Pressed about this, Client finally claimed that he does not "feel like himself" on it. This is fairly common among teen boys who were not started on medication earlier in life. Thus, the sessions included (and in the future will continue to include) a focus on trying to pin down the best compromise between medication usage and non-usage. As that unfolded, it became clear that the dynamic between all family members was severely strained and that medication management was both an impetus for conflict in and of itself and a metaphorical representation of other conflicts in the family.</p>

<p>ADHD played an additional and unforeseen role in the case. About three sessions in I came to understand that a great deal of Mom and Client's conflict is the result of the Mom also having ADHD. This emerged as it often does, from Mom getting a better understanding about her son and recognizing the same characteristics in herself. In fact, in the 9<sup>th</sup> session she actually admitted to doing an unauthorized self-test using Client's leftover Focalin. As I note in <b>I Always Want to Be Where I'm Not,</b> ADD-ADD dyads are symmetrical and unstable in that neither party has tolerance for the other's chaos (what I refer to humorously as "the thing we hate about people with ADD." Both Client and Mom, upon hearing this, laughed nervously and agreed it fit pretty well.</p>

<p>Dad is a bit of an anxious-leaner<note id="en"><b>[3] I use the term "anxious-leaners" for people who are not diagnosable with anxiety disorders, but have many of the symptoms, and often to their betterment. They are conscientious, fastidious and intentional in their behavior. Their irritation comes from not being able to control things sufficiently to lower their anxiety. I tend to believe that all people either lean toward the ADD side, the anxious side, or in some cases both. Whether this is diagnosable or just an interesting aspect of one's personality depends on the level of impairment in the larger social context.</b></note>. He is a stabilizing influence in the family and has a great deal more tolerance for both Client and Mom. He is able to walk away from pointless conflicts—which at intake, Mom simply could not—but he can set down boundaries as necessary. Dad also understands Client's introversion, as he shares it, and sees client's behavior as less deviant than Mom. This proved helpful repeatedly in the case as Mom overdramatized the seriousness of the Client's conduct, without empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Readers may wonder why I didn't see Client alone at any point in therapy. This too was utilization. In an early session, I offered to speak with him privately after his parents had insisted on speaking with me alone. Client graciously declined my offer, and said that there was nothing he had to say that his parents could not hear. I believe this underscores Client's conceptualization of the case as a family problem that he cannot solve by himself, and this is both accurate and quite sophisticated thinking for a boy of thirteen. This being Strategic Therapy however, if I saw value in seeing Client by himself I would do so, even over his objections, and I am currently planning to do that in the tenth session to have a bit deeper discussion of his medication objections. </p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> What is (was) your goal or hope for the sessions? </p>

<p><b>Crenshaw</b>: My goals were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clarify diagnosis of ADHD versus concurrent or differential mood disorder.</p>

<p>Educate family and child on the nature of ADHD in a language useful to everyday communication. </p>

<p>Set up more functional systems of contingency for client.</p>

<p>Run a series of trials in cooperation with prescribing physician to determine which medications create the highest gain and lowest side-effect profile, and to assess whether Client is using side effects as a way to avoid medication that causes him to do mundane things like study and complete homework.</p>

<p>Assess and reduce the dyadic tensions between Mom and Client and/or reframe it as a natural part of the normal parent-child interaction.</p>

<p>Create a more realistic and helpful perspective of the child's behavior (e.g., he is introverted not socially isolated; he has ADHD, he's not bad; he is in a period of medication washout late in the day, not defiant, etc.). </p>

<p>Create a more realistic and helpful perspective of the parent's behavior (e.g., parents are attempting to increase Client's probability for life success rather than just complaining and nitpicking).</p>

<p>Set some limits on the child's sense that he can act out without consequence, and at the same time…</p>

<p>Improve choice of battles parents fight with child, increasing useful winnable ones and decreasing pointless unwinnable ones; and to time those battles when medication is at its flourish not at it's ebb. A good example is in the session where we discuss Client's desire to paint the wheels on an old worthless mower he's allowed to ride around, and Mom's nonsensical (and somewhat retaliatory) response, which leads to him using her special paint to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?</p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> I actually don't terminate with clients, though we may take breaks. I recently had a former foster care client return after five years, and I believe he waited a bit longer than he should have. Those breaks are usually taken when clients feel they are functioning better and have learned all they can for the time being. I try to leave that door open. I am a believer that effort is not enough to judge success, so I look for tangible outcomes. However, because this is Strategic Therapy, what is desired in a case is always unique to the case and there is no way to know how many sessions it will take to get there. For example, I see a cadre of clients who had parents die tragically (e.g., suicide, murder, etc.) and I expect to see them for many years to come because their problem is a lack of a parent and that's not changeable. It affects all their new relationships, their belief in their own futures, and their anxiety about existence. Those are not weekly sessions. Sometimes they are only a few times a year. </p>

<p>In terms of ADHD, some clients only need four or five sessions to get a diagnosis and get a brief skim of my principles for dealing with it. Others gain a lot from ongoing therapy for ADHD (which is a bit like a higher order coaching), particularly those attending college or who are in early careers. The generic goal is to learn to make more intentional decisions and take more intentional action.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the therapy was not over at the conclusion of the transcripts but it was clearly successful in reaching several of the above goals. Parents were far more understanding of Client's problems and had learned ways to sidestep or even embrace them. Client had greater empathy for parents' situation and came to see them as trying imperfectly to be helpful, particularly as Mom's tolerance for Client improved.</p>

<p>Client's ambivalence about medication could not have been fully revealed and studied had we not gone down the paths we already did, and eliminated some of the pointless conflict over things like painting mowers. Many clients, even some much older than this one, flirt with life off medication. If they are correctly diagnosed and treated however, that is usually a very revealing experiment—though it often comes at high cost. Natural and logical consequences are a pain, and sometimes irreversibly so. Here, Client is at the tipping point of that kind of learning, and at this time I believe he could go either way. My goal is to see that he requires as few trials in life and makes as few errors as possible, while giving him the breadth of opportunity to learn from the mistakes he makes. As a child becomes an adult, this can be a bit like trying to land a crashing plane. So a goal of this therapy is to succeed enough for now, and invite Client to return later for the next round. </p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?</p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> I don't look for breakthroughs as much as I do moments of clarity. Parents, particularly Mom came to see (or at least state) that Client is not a bad or dangerous person, but that ADHD accounts for much of his struggle. Mom also came to see this same condition in herself. I expected that to be a bump in the road, but it turned out to be a moment of clarity and empathy and I actually plan to take further advantage of it. Though, in session 9, it created a bit too much (confused) empathy as Mom borrowed some of Client's medication and found it helped her a lot, but also found it gave her a sort of manic (my term) buzz. She noted, "I understood how it made him feel," leading her to over-identify with Client's concerns, even as she'd only taken it for a day and the effect would be incomparable. While it was kind of nice for them to have this in common, it actually created a hierarchy failure that I'll address in the next session.</p>

<p>Another bump was Mom's earlier insistence that Client was dangerous. This wasn't overtly stated as in "I think he's dangerous," but was implied several times and said he had gotten "scary violent" which was not empirically true. Dad proved very helpful in reframing this, without making Mom seem hysterical. Likewise, Mom has at least tentatively come to an understanding that some of her reactions to Client (e.g., the mower painting situation) were fueling his frustration with her, and that she doesn't need to be as interested in some things as she is. However, I'm a little concerned that she has yet to find a real discipline<note id="en"><b>[4] I use this as a noun to describe a philosophy of successful parenting rather than as a verb to describe something parents do to their children.

<p><b>Carlson:</b>  What do you want to make sure that the readers notice when they are reading the transcript?</p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> There are three main points:</p>

<p>1) The client likes being there. Few clients are as inauspicious in therapy than a thirteen-year-old oppositional, ADHD boy. This one however, conducted himself very well. Of course this is in large part due to his excellent verbal and social skills, a bit of a surprise in an introverted teen boy. But, since chance favors only the prepared mind, I had to actually harvest that opportunity by being engaging, joining with Client in the context of the family, and helping him feel understood by me (easy), his dad (not difficult), and his mom (very difficult). Readers should recognize some good examples of this in the transcript.</p>

<p>2) Joining with the client and family is a lot more complex than being nice to everyone and pretending to agree with them. Empathy plays a role, but it is no substitute for authenticity. I once had a parent frustrated with me because I "validated" her daughter's views of things she did not agree with (like the mother's responsibility for many of their arguments). The daughter started laughing at the mom and said, "Wow. I don't think you know Dr. Wes very well. He's not exactly into ‘validating.'" And she was right. But what is interesting about this—or at least has been interesting to me as I've come to understand it over the years—is that most clients only feel validated when they think you're being honest with them and those who just want to be validated for the sake of maintaining a fragile "self-esteem," tend not to be very successful in therapy. Clients will not respect a therapist who is disingenuous, and they will not like working with him or her as much as they will someone who is honest and a little blunt. One can easily mess that up by becoming too high-handed, but with experience those errors become fewer and farther in between.</p>

<p>3) One needs an ally in the family. Very often that's the child, because without his or her support, things will not go so well. That is true in this case, particularly as I did not freak out about Client's manifesto but used it implicitly to inform my thinking. But I also found an ally in Dad, who proved exceptionally skilled at joining me in being honest and directive with both Client and Mom without getting himself in hot water. An example of this was after Client was "violent" at school, midway through therapy and got suspended for three days. Dad was very pleased when I finally noted that under the circumstances, the boy Client punched in the face probably deserved it for being a bully. This is a tricky situation because utilization does not mean agreeing with someone who does something objectionable. But the situation of injustice in this example, combined with the normalcy of playground fighting among boys did not justify Mom's pronouncement that this was a sign of Client's underlying violent tendencies. As therapists, we sometimes normalize problems. Sometimes we problematize them. I opted for the former here, and I believe I was correct.</p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care? </p>

<p><b>Crenshaw:</b> The clients were self-referred, I believe based upon our reputation in the community for working with these sorts of clients. I tend to see more girls than boys, particularly in middle school and one of my associates sees the boys, but the family wanted to see me and after the first session, I found them to be a good fit. As Client is more talkative than the average teen boy and his parents very dedicated to the process, we got on well. They are also good with humor and I find this an essential part of such cases, particularly with all the tension built up in this one. </p>

<p>All sessions were in my office. We did not need to do school meetings in this case or home visits. I used to do a lot more school meetings but increasingly found schools in the area—particularly the one Client attends—to be closed systems and increasingly resentful to work with, since drastic budget cuts have limited their services. At best they pay lip service to our goals. At worst they undermine them. Fortunately, other than his playground punch, Client's school behavioral issues were minimal.</p>

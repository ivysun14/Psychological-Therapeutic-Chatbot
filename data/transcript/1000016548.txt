<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Boy, it's a little different parking here during the day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty bad isn't it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I wedged in those construction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope you don't get a ticket or anything probably not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are no, no parking signs. Did you find anything out about fees.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I found out who the Fee Committee is. How much do you think you can pay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what the, the minimum whatever they would ah see the way that this uhm who was the guy that sits it up the head Theo.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: First time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah the way he did it he had a sliding chart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And uhm well at that time I was on the top of the chart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so you're paying 13 then is that what you tell me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not at the top.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it way up there, I thought it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The top fee is 28, $29.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well anyhow he said he said something about he went he was going down the line I thought he was right at the top of the thing. Uhm, I've got I've got another friend that is here but she is paying 7, but she is paying back ah uhm a loan.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to try to get a job part-time but right now I have zero income so I, I don't know what they are going to do with that if they will do anything with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I will tell you the way I think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (0:02:00.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, I'm not sympathetic with your plight. Like, you know, that was one of the things that you should have thought of when you quit. So that is</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's my personal feeling that you ought to continue to pay the 13.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah not the I mean I, I would I would think that if they base it, you know, if they base it on your salary thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if, you know, if it's a set rate then that's what I would pay my understanding was when I started was that at least, you know, he went down the chart and he says what is your income so I told him my income.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he says okay according to this, this will be your fee.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, you know, if that is set forever then I won't argue then, then I will come up with the money but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not set forever I mean we, you know, we can partition the Fee Committee and see what will come of it. But </p>

<p>PATIENT: Otherwise</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you ask me whether I think you would have a strong argument I'm going to say no, if they ask me I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm, I'm not working so what</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm going to get part-time work, you know, it's just that I couldn't hack that job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So in other words it would stay at 52.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stay at 52.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is what I that's the way it goes a month. I get a statement and each statement it's always for a month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, oh, oh. I well, you know, we'll ask the Fee Committee.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but if they are going to take your recommendation you're going to it goes according to Committee if it changes is that the deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. Yeah, the individual therapist does not have the authority to lower a fee it has to go to Committee.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but the individual therapist doesn't establish the fee.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well but the fee has been agreed upon by the whole staff, that scale that is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he really doesn't establish it only he does is find out your income and looks on the chart. (0:04:03.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Then to me if I didn't have the same income.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if the income was unsteady.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They would adjust it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe they will.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not I read it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe they will, maybe they will. Shape up, you know, my thought is well gee I wonder what it will cost (inaudible 0:04:20.5) rationality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm going to advise the same law but I'm not spending as much money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact when the pinch gets on then I'm really going to be ah. Well the way the way I'm doing it is I'm paying like if I get a check today I'm paying I'm paying my uhm February rent on that my next check is I'm paying, paying March and April so which means at least I won't be thrown out in the street and if that's so then ah I think what I was going to try to do was income tax now. Which, you know, if would be a if you put in a lot of union hours it would be sometime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you didn't ask me about how much they thought you could afford.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, yeah in other words I've got to put a price on it right. Well right now uhm okay I got a $52 bill I, I can't really price it I would because I don't know like what standards are for therapy. I know that psychoanalytical stuff cost between 30 and 45 an hour, that's out in Manhattan uhm and that a friend out there told me he says he says if you don't pay something for therapy, you know, or if it's a nominal fee they (0:06:02.9) then, then uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is therapy worth to you (inaudible 0:06:10.6). Don't tell me about your friends tell me about you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In terms of money I don't know. If, if I don't think it would if, if I wouldn't have had therapy I wouldn't have quit my job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words it would probably be my one connection with uhm with trying to work through what I think I have to work through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, so it's probably the, you know, the most important for me right now. Not only the sessions here but, you know, with, with my own thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and if I have to put a money value on it ah well let me just ah the higher the money value I place on it means the more time I'm going to have to try to find, you know, part-time work or evening work. Uhm, my feeling is, is, you know, that if possible I would want the fees reduced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it's not possible then I would leave them the way they are, you know, but I would I would ask that if they would they would reduce the fees.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, to, to whatever degree they would. I, I don't think that's going to cheapen it that much in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and that's I think that's what of it, you know, I feel. (0:08:00.4). In terms of money I, I can just say as much as they would reduce it. If they choose not to reduce it or maybe they will even increase it I don't know if that's the way their logic goes or whose logic goes. Ah, and well I may have to start hustling some, some (inaudible 0:08:21.3) right away I think. When, when would I be able to find out about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess by next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This Fee Committee or whatever would have met by, okay. But as of now it probably look like ah have you had experience where this is happened, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And from that what usually, you know, what usually transpires.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well depends on, you know, what generates the request. What, you know, it just depends on the circumstances.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why, why don't you think this would be a valid request.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I, you know, my personal I can only give you my personal feeling okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what I want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well like if you have to consider what happens when you quit a job and what, you know, what the consequences are. So you might be a little strapped for money or maybe the thing you should get a part-time job I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, well my idea had been to, you know, get evening work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like three or four times a week enough to pay for rent, food uhm I've only got one more insurance thing coming up some drinking money and therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those were the, you know, considerations which the way they are right now would amount to around 200 and well if it's the 52 it would be around it would be around 225, 230.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I think I could swing, you know. (0:10:00.1) I know I could swing it from the end of April.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not so sure about the ah another time after that. I didn't just, you know, walk off I sat down and thought about it all morning if I did have the.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we only have what is ten more sessions to go anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ten yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right. Yeah, what's today is the 10th. Yeah, so we have ten more to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How does that work after that in other words is it is it finalized then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have to you have to accomplish it you want to accomplish in 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh boy. And is there any follow-up or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, ah our Daniel who gave you some tests before you started will give you some again after, after you finish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only after 20 sessions. Do they then have different, like different programs here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, different research programs like that yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because this other friend of mine has been in it over a year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know what, you know, what she started out with. Why did you ask like the ten, the ten sessions you mean in, in terms of, of the money angle or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no I meant in terms of time because you said you, you have things pretty well worked out until the end of April and that should be around the time that we'll be finishing anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah depending what the cost of therapy are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That, that, that's ah the indefinite factor, you know, that's what they will be. (0:12:01.3) They really think by 20 sessions it'll do it hun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. But that's up to you. You know, if you can make 20 sessions do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I think I can make it through the 20 sessions I don't I don't know that I'll have been in all the things I want to do. And if not well I'll see. Anyway when I walked in here I was, I was reading this book by Freud on ah well it's Called Introduction to Psychoanalysis and there was a, a section on symbols.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like dream symbols.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I was reading along and the chief symbol for like uhm well the chief flaxit symbol was suppose to be the plow share.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and or guns, you know, either one. Well I knew about guns but I never I never tied it together and I have got on my wall the plow share that big, you know, that I got from, from Iowa see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I put up this thing in one in one of Herman Hess's novels is a word called abraxis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is like a God that sees uhm a God that incorporates good and evil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so I was going to be really creative it's completely unconscious thing it must have been on that wall because there on the left side there are two shelves, there is a shelf here and a shelf here and then there's a picture in the middle and the idea I had behind my apartment was that I want to make it like uhm, you know, (0:14:03.9) part of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: An extension of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost like a woman. And uhm so I, I got this I was when I was home there was this little I went to the to the junk yards to get a plow share but consciously this is what I was thinking uhm that a plow share and there is this old passage about you should beat your, your plow shares into spears and reversing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I thought what I'll do instead the spear I'll get a gun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Modern day symbol of armament, you know. And I'll put those two things on the shelf and then I got a court thing and I got some of these numbers that you or letters that you can get for houses and I put the little brackets around in a circle like that a half circle, you know, in kind of a un, you know, like a cluster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I wanted to symbolize like white and black or gray.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I got a circle I got one of these felt circles that you can buy in a store.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they put on like for floor tile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it comes out about that much only it's a gray which perfect circle right in the middle. Well I had that picture is hanging in the middle of the wall and then on each one of the shelves I've got this when I was home there was there's three parts of a plow share.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's called I think in front called the frog which is just a little thing and then the actual plow share itself is the thing that runs in the bottom.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which doesn't look like a plow share and then this huge thing called a mold board which comes back which is made out iron.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, I found this little frog thing and that doesn't look like anything and I wanted to find what I thought was a plow share so I got this huge mammoth thing that weighs 33 pounds.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I bought that and then I got a 22 which I've never shoot well I shot once that's on the other wall (0:15:59.6) and I called them up put them on the wall and put the whole thing up. And then I'm, I'm reading in this book and a plow share is like, you know, it's this huge flaxit symbol and then, you know, then I started I just I, I just thought about this now so I, I haven't it hasn't sunk on to me but it has got to lead somewhere is that uhm like, you know, well ever since that deal with the circumcision thing, you know, all the time in locker rooms and stuff like that I thought I had a shitty little penis, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all this sort of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Along with all the other things. And, and like when people come over I never thought I was always explaining it in religious terminology as being the, you know, these, these two things are equated that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when they ask me I always make a big made a big point of telling them that uhm that the thing weighs 33 pounds and I had to get extra big bolts, you know, to drive them into the wall because otherwise it wouldn't hold it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know I didn't</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't thing maybe that's a (inaudible 0:17:10.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh gees I don't even what to think about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To make up for your small (inaudible 0:17:14.3.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and make up for a lot of things maybe. Not, not only that but the uhm there's a circle there's a circle in the God damn middle of the </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like a the plow share is screwing the surface.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well either that or the gun, you know, I mean it's I don't I don't know, you know, all it says to me is that there is some kind of uhm, you know, thing at work there I liked it in the bathroom in my bathroom I've got stripes black and white stripes in the bedroom I've got black and white stripes uhm the only art work I can't think of anything that thing, you know, I don't know I don't know where it where it would ah haven't thought of it. (0:18:00.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 0:18:00.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I haven't thought enough about it but. I did another thing last night I uhm oh my head is coming it's going in all directions ah I wrote my sister a letter typed her a letter uhm so when I was home at Christmas, you know, I wanted to find out like what she remembers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From uhm especially about punishment and things like that, how we were punished and she remembers specific examples of where I was spanked or, or if I was spanked in anger if ah I was slapped. I, I keep thinking I was slapped in the face viciously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, so I, I just what I'm curious about is how she responds to the letter ah because I remember my sister when she was in 8th grade ah somebody told me that she had blood all over her dress and I didn't even know about menstruation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said she had blood all over her and she had blood all over her dress and I asked her when we got when we were at home and she didn't she just didn't say anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then about two years later my ma happened to mention when my ma was giving me sex instructions all a minute of it that uhm that Janice had ah, you know, had her period and I bet you my ma never told her a damn thing about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I asked in my in my letter I asked my sister about, you know, whether, whether uhm ma had given her any instruction in it whether she thought it was like a natural sort of thing to do uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or what, what happened. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, or what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or what happened whether she told her anything or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I, I and then I put I doubt it, you know, I I'm not sure even why I wrote that letter but I think it was to find out, you know, her experiences to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not all that sure because I (0:20:01.7) the way the way she treats my niece uhm, you know, it just strikes me a lot of the same thing especially when we're home. Uhm, the oldest one catches the catches the hell and it's almost like it's provoked my sister actually provoked her she teased her and when she got mad the kid ran in another room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And was the, the, the one of the mother-in-law slapped the kid, the kid was told you're tired go to bed and they stuck her in the bedroom and, you know, and she's like been missing school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, not even missing school she has been bumming school and telling her parents that she was there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She has been lying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they said the last thing they tried everything at Thanksgiving, you know, to keep her from bumming and then finally they my sister said well Christmas they uhm spanked her and I don't know who spanked her or how they did it but I really wonder about that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whether that was a good thing to do to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or what, you know, or why didn't they, you know, why didn't they get to the bottom of why, why she was ah, you know, why she was maybe it's no big thing but uhm, you know, it might be, you know, I'm not. I don't know my sister uhm well I don't know I just want to see how she responds.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the letter because I never because I have never in my life written her a letter, you know, in any way shape or form like that. It usually, usually we write yuck letters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Without any real meat in it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah just, you know, newsy, entertaining.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Superficial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And this, you know, like if she's it was funny too because I put (0:22:02.8) one section in there this is the only letter I have ever written to my sister that I reread three times but I put in a section that I said uhm oh I won't tell ma or anyone else about it. And then I said no now ma is going to be coming down there for visiting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually she always reads my letters (inaudible 0:22:28.9) so I crossed it out and then I sat and said now why did I do that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you so concerned about what your mother sees.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I didn't I might do this yet I might write my ma a letter because that's, you know, the primary, primary material or else I can call her if I, you know, I don't know why I didn't do this before but I can't ah all she said when I asked her about when I was punished was that she said up to a certain point she ah she spanked me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she wouldn't tell me how, or she didn't tell me how and I didn't ask her but I did happened to think well did you slap me in the face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did you do it or did you do it in anger that's what I got I've got a feeling she did it in anger. I was talking to a friend of mine last night and ah, ah we were talking, you know, like about childhood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's in therapy too. And ah, you know, all those like if I my ma ah lost her husband, you know, in the damn war and is faced with the prospect of raising two kids one of whom is, you know, like when I was little I was I was, you know, like a hellion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't listen to anybody that's what they say I, I don't know I can't believe that but that's what they say ah if that is so, you know, and if she has got that anger (0:24:03.9), you know, built up inside her and she's living in a small dumpy little house and she's living right near her parents and if she has never worked out a whole lot of stuff about like affection </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How to show affection if she distrusts people and then if she feels she has no one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if she's not getting sex which she wasn't, you know, for four God damn years I didn't know what she was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and uhm and she's living with idiotic brothers and sisters all except one, you know, who the hell is she going to take it out on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the only person I can come up with although I, you know, I block out I me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if she did that to me, you know, what hell did she do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, it almost scares me to find out like this, this thing with, you know, I broke up with or Susie broke up with me put it that way uhm but well she broke up with me on Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like an asshole idiot I did not, you know, I just let I, I worked on me all this stuff about deception and all these other things it worked on me and it worked on me so I finally on Saturday I sent her a letter I said ah say hello to grandma for me ah if you if you ah if you're not too rushed sometime she sent me a Peanuts cartoon, a little thing if you're not too rushed sometime ah, you know, ask yourself why, why you have a need to be in such and such.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of just sitting there and crying and ah I sent her the letter then but, you know, I never called her I never talked to her and on, you know, and I was just throwing around like, in uhm I really thought I might flip out. (0:25:59.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it was that bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then and then I kept thinking things like alright it's not really Susie that's going on here it you're, you're redoing something that happened before, you know, you're just you're redoing it in your God damn head so if you call her there is a certain amount of anger and feel but if you let all of it out it's not against her you're letting it out it's against somebody else. So all this stuff was going through my, my idiot head and then finally on, on, on Monday night at about I don't know it must have about 12 o'clock I was just sitting there and I got this it was like a thing I had to call her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, you know, my heart went crazy and I was I was really shook because I didn't know what I was going to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I called her up, you know, and she said hello how are you feeling I said shitty and then and it was like I had planned to get mad so I didn't really well I said every I said everything that I didn't really want to say to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or that you did want to say </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then (inaudible 0:27:01.6) and then I was greatly relieved and then but then she went into she went into things and like she's not my ma ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you mean she started analyzing all of the things that you said to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she just, you know, I said first of all, you know, this deception thing I said, you know, you, you know, grandmother's house that I said why didn't you just tell me right away, you know, that you couldn't go out on Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she said she had not decided until Monday night and that ah on where it was Monday or Tuesday, Tuesday night it was that she, you know, she just said she could not keep on dating three guys at the same because she was going crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So on Wednesday she said she, she, she said she didn't want to do it on the phone and I said well that's one of the things I'm still pissed at her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, I remember you said that to her, you told me that last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah okay. Well she, she said she didn't want to say it on the phone but she had she had this, this other guy there on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:27:58.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so she did it anyway and uhm when I went into the thing on deception she said that she had, you know, that their grandfather had died one year ago this Sunday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that they were going to get together on Saturday so she says, you know, it's not like honest and then I said uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute I don't understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean in other words she really did, you know, there was a possibility that she would be going to her grandmother's on a Saturday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she hadn't been lying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I had conjured up all of these things that number one she knows that, that the best way to hurt me would be to deceive me because I, you know, I have no ability to trust anyhow and, and if she really wanted to nail me that's way she would do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either consciously or unconsciously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, you know, so I well I had to say, you know, you know like I, I what I was mad about is that I didn't call her up sooner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she even said like she said well when she told me anyhow she said she had no idea if I that I would make a big deal out of it. She said she was kind even worried that I would laugh at her for making a big deal out of it because she said she never knew</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She didn't know that you really cared hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I didn't until and then I then I she said the only reason you're mad probably is because you thought you were being made a fool of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said yeah to a large, you know, to a large degree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not exclusively.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did like her also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can't figure it I told her I said I think I could both love and hate you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it, it, it uhm most girls I have to say either one way or the other, you know, but with her uhm, you know, I draw these damn analogies, you know, I don't know if it's just that I'm thinking about that now or if I honest to God do see a lot of my mother in her and uhm (0:30:03.0), you know, hell I don't I'll never be able to work it out no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but ah it was really uhm, you know, the correspondence was so, so ah so close that ah, you know, I just I really couldn't separate her in my mind. What else did I say to her. Well the main thing I think was deception. And there were other well there are other things that, you know, still bug me. In other words that, you know, she chose another guy over me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then the thing that's really, you know, when I stop to think about it I never really told her uhm she had no way of knowing what I felt and ah when we got all done we were we were kind a just talking about, you know, some of the times we had and uhm it was like this and even well even when I hung up, you know, I still couldn't say anything like uhm I couldn't allow myself to recognize that I might just have needed her a little bit or I couldn't allow myself to, to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you couldn't admit that to yourself or to her or both.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I couldn't admit to her nor could I admit it to myself. Now I could possibly admit it to myself, but I could never admit it to her</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I might need her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe, you know, just maybe she might change her mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because to me, you know, a person makes a decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, why mess it up. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're going to mess up her brain or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like when ma makes a decision why, why mess something up, you know, why, why go against her why do anything like that. And uhm and then too I don't know, you know, like ah whatever it is, you know, that (0:32:02.5) little that little it's just a tiny little thing, you know, like kind of kind of I sensed was there like a uhm the most remote ah like little input of needing somebody, you know, and, and not and not feeling that if you need them, you know, you're going just go you're just going to, you know, collapse, you know, and you wouldn't have a, a separate kind of thing with her. What gets now is that I did exactly, you know, the opposite of what ah well it's exactly the opposite of what I say I always don't. In other words, instead of talking to someone, you know, uhm I would choose to keep it here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, because I don't even know what the, you know, how, how to go about it until finally it's so built up in me that I, you know, either it has it has to be released. Uhm, and I don't know why that is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why you hold it in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and why I ah (0:34:01.8) especially man especially the ah well the suspicion the anger the distrust uhm the jealousy even my ways of showing jealousy are, are ah, you know, politeness, coolness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, like game playing which I claim disclaim, you know, that's God that is sacrilege to be playing games, you know, and that's exactly what I do. I know what, you know, when I sit and think I, I conger up, you know, like trying to trying to understand what the hell, you know, like what I'm doing now I walk around with this damn note I'll show you notebook in my pocket. And I write down things, you know, like when I react a certain way to something, you know, like yesterday, yesterday I was I was walking along the sidewalk and it was real icy, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I'm walking by this old man and ah this, this damn landlord I don't are you Jewish or if it doesn't matter I don't give a damn this landlord who I bet you was one of these damn Jewish landlords who I hate because I've had three of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he, he ah was telling this old man these are the exact words he used he said "do you understand", you know, as though the dog should sit up, you know, and gees I was I was going to really tell the guy, you know. (0:36:01.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he understand what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does he understand how to throw the damn salt on the on the one the ice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like you got to instruct the dog on how to throw the salt on the ice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's just that I'm so damn hostile now but then, then I walked into the grocery store, you know, so I'm going through the line and there's a thing I remember from public aid that when somebody is on food stamps they don't want to admit it because when they go through the line and they show a food stamp uhm in these well they don't mind it if the clerk takes it, gives it back to them but the clerk yells out "food stamps here", you know, well this asshole girl who I don't like anyhow uhm bellers across four cash registers</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Food stamps.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How much tax on ah, you know, so much food stamps or is there tax on so much food stamps or at least that's what I thought she said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't really make a </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you thought that she was embarrassing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was thinking, you know, you I mean </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You asshole.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this well I don't know if I even said this see I'm losing track now as to what I say here and what I what I say to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, which I guess don't really mean that but there's a the, the girls in junior college ah called me a woman hater and I really am starting to see in like a lot of ways. Like on Monday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have it you are hostile to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah really I, I never wanted to admit it but like on Monday night, you know, I was I was pissed as hell at Susie and I, you know, like a dumb ass, you know, don't talk to her don't call her you might get something settled that way. So I'm, I'm I go to choir, you know, to this club.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there's a girl there I know named Kelly Meeter and she was she was sitting, you know, we have a break and she sitting there tranced out on something ah and then she said she was tired so God I went after her, you know, I know how to (0:38:02.4), you know, I know how to insult if I choose and so it was all these double (inaudible 0:38:07.6) things about uhm well this other guy was kind of, you know, she has had too much on, on Sunday night or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So we really went after her, you know, and then I had to check myself because I said holy cats, you know, she hasn't done anything to you and then we got something on we're talking about on your mind. She said she would never want to look inside her mind and ah at that point we quit talking but then I said ah no I didn't I, I said, I said I don't think I miss, you know, because I was really ah it was like in a laughing way but it wasn't most of that stuff was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wasn't so funny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Remarks on her weight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was really hostile hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah which she, she has got a thing about a weight uhm and there's a couple of other things too that. Well then I went to a bar then at the bar I meet this, this girl and I was very nice to her probably to make up for all </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Overcomp... you were compensating for what you had done to Carol hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Kelly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kelly, excuse me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I never I never</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you were riding your Ps and Qs in the bar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well then the next night though I didn't watch my Ps and Qs again. But it's uhm what were some of the other things with Susie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess with Susie you didn't really feel like watching your Ps and Qs hun when you spoke to her on the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no not that time I mean I called her every, you know, I was never going to call her a slut but I called her a slut uhm cheap relationship. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun. (0:40:00.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cheap relationship, you know, met in a bar, cheap relationship all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that's you could you could say that about many of the relationships that you have because you meet many of the women you know in bars, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, who is cheap them or you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's what I said</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was trying to think of every tactic I could to get to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every nasty thing you could.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every, every little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every way you could get to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she, you know, and I even I even, you know, given her some comments along here, you knew I was going to give her some counsel I says, you know, the thing you should never want to know with is a guy that and weird advice to give is a guy that has a need to hurt because I think you have a need to be hurt because in this whole range </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean a guy like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she says well then she really cracks me up she says well that's what I thought you exactly what I thought you were like because the very first night I was with her said I looked mean. Uhm, and then and then, you know, then I says you know that might be right. Uhm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were in the sense then telling her to stay away from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No see I said it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what you meant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's not what I meant to say and I never even thought about it that way that I was telling her to stay away. Well, I've had some scary feelings about, you know, like that. Sometimes I, I would have an urge I think, you know, to, to hurt her uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To really fuck around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Then I can't figure I, I don't I can't figure out why we got so (0:42:02.9). Like she didn't get mad except one point when I said that I knew what she was thinking. She said there is no way you can know what I'm thinking and on the rest of the stuff she reacted the way my ma would have reacted. She reacted by justifying herself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mentioned the fact that I had read in a book what did I read I how in the hell was that I had read in a book on of Hess's books something or other and immediately she says I still got one of your Hess books, you know, I'll send it back to you she had to justify herself. I mentioned something about I had I this was after we were I had pretty well gotten over anger at least vented.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said uhm oh I said yeah I, I thought something was coming because I said you weren't as, as affection as you were before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said well I had an infection she said I'll even show you the prescription meaning that we weren't screwing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had meant, you know, what my judgment was is that she didn't grab my arm as soon as we left the building.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way I </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She had been colder to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and ah when I got all done I couldn't still say anything like ah she wanted to get I she had taken a picture of me and she wanted to give me this picture from the land of concert I says well let me give that to you that's about the closest I came, you know, in order to ah to reaching out to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, even when I hung up the phone (0:44:01.2) hun it's like it was there, you know, uhm and I almost I almost knew it was there, you know, I almost could have maybe said something but not quite yet and it just ah well I can intellectualize and says, you know, I ah but like when something happens and, and I, I react to it like over here, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It takes me that long like for incidence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She breaks it off and, you know, it took me that long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A week and a half later you call her up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or she breaks it off and then maybe then I thought oh, you know, how the hell why should she stay with me I mean what the hell I have, you know, what, what I have ever given her and, and, you know, and the discrepancy between the time when, when the event happens and my reaction to it is, you know, a long time and ah, you know, if I ever could come to the point where, you know, where I where I could feel, you know, right away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, but God, you know, it still ah there a little just a little something that there was but it I couldn't get it out. I was really unsure, you know, (0:46:01.8) it's like on a thing if it doesn't, you know, I would have say something if it doesn't work up uhm ah, you know, give me a call or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But to say that it's almost to, to grovel and I, I'm not going to grovel and I feel really weird about that feeling. And like an ass, you know, like admitted this, this stuff on therapy some of the tour like she's aware.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why, you told her you were in therapy any.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no I and then I admitted some of the stuff like, you know, once before I didn't, you know, I really got into one of these dumb ass moods where I didn't trust anything she said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the only thing I could fit, fit it then was this thing like on, on the circumcision thing, you know, every time I think about this stress that goes back to that and I can't remember there is some stuff before that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, but that's something that's the thing that we were </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah all I got to do </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The mistrust of your mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Think about and it gets me ah </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All up tight all over again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want I don't believe I want to talk to my ma any more if ah, you know, she isn't going to know what the hell is going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, you know, you mistrust your ma.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just pissed for everything she did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, nay I went into that before it all started right there. (0:48:00.5). Most of that other stuff was just things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things you never said about yourself you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really weird and people, you know, still people when I meet them they think my head is together yet. Like I was with a girl last night one of the girls from my office and she thought, you know, she thought uhm all the stuff like was I still my head was still together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think my head is together, but apparently I come off like it's still together. What really scares me is maybe I'm not making any progress at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got to be I mean I've never I've never been this fucked up, you know, I have never done unless I'm just trying to prove that I'm getting somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, maybe that's it like, you know, there's, there is some things I got a I got a thing where I always kind a I question whether, you know, whether I am making great strides or anything like that or whether, whether I am really just playing games but I mean there has got to a be a bottom there has got to be some place where, you know, there has got to be some valid things I can say about myself, you know, that for pretty much all practical purposes uhm, you know, will hold up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and are real and true in a correct, you know, and a correct understanding of myself, you know, the way I really am. And yet, you know, the, the few things I can point to are, are ah, you know, like emotionally I'm a cripple I'm convinced I'm an emotional ah cripple I honest to God don't know how that ah </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How to take care of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm emotionally a cripple. I, I, in other words anytime it gets to any point where my emotions are involved either in terms of ah of ah loving, caring, hating (0:50:06.0), needing uhm laughing, crying if it's in the presence of another person and if it's in the presence of another person that ah, you know, I care about I'm an emotional cripple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what that means though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That means that I can't express.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't respond.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it does not come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, you know, yeah I, I, I, I, I cannot, you know, like I cannot get it out it's like with Susie I could not get it out immediately. Uhm, I can I can, you know, intellectualize, I can talk and I can respond in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To almost anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But as far as, as responding to what I'm feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. Can't do it. What do you feel as though that's true here also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not as much like when I was thinking about Susie before I, I did feel whatever it was I felt before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's, you know, it's </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hard to get them out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Uhm, like right now my, my well for like maybe the last month and a half my mind has mostly been occupied with ah and see maybe see I'm so fucked up now I don't even know if it's legitimate to do that, you know, I got to say it is I mean I got to say it is or flip out. I, I can intellectually think about myself and I think can, I can I can sense my feelings and I can ask myself why I feel this way and I can try to trace some of these things down and I still wonder, you know, if there isn't this big unconscious thing within me that tells me that everything I'm doing right now is fake. (0:52:02.4) You know, like there is another side of me which I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like this damn thing with the with the plow share.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like everything you do may be wrong and there may be a reason to doubt the motivation or the goodness or rightness of anything you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or that it's of a proper approach to myself. A proper approach to, to, to finding out uhm really where I'm at because I, I uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're finding out about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I there are things that well I, I, I've got to go that way because that's the only way that, that I function.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean that's the way I've been, you know, been functioning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

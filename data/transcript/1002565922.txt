<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay [PATIENT NAME], so tell me what's going on with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm seeing ghostly figures in my home.  I'm sitting in my chair playing my game, and through my left eye I see this ball of white, clear white, pass by my eye, and nobody else sees it, and I've only seen it out of my right eye once, but it's always in my left, out of my left eye, and this morning when I woke up, I saw this ghostly like figure standing over my bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how long that's been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, no, this just started the last few days with this, with this.  In the past, I've seen things such as people running up and cutting my throat, such as cars turning around in the middle of the road and smashing into my car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, you told me about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Such as my kids being beaten and killed, stuff like that.  And I don't, I don't know why.  I don't know where it comes from.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are your mood swings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes they're okay.  Sometimes they're not so good.  They're, one minute I can be really, really nice and the next minute I can be screaming at you, or cussing you out or I get really bad mood swings with, as in hollering and screaming at people, and for just little simple things to, like to you it would be nothing.  They, they really have done nothing, but to me it's, stop it or I'm going to beat your ass or stop it or I'm going to throw something at you as with my husband and he won't, won't be nothing, but to me it's just, I don't know what it is.  I get really annoyed.  I don't know, and I want to find out why.  I don't know what to say.  I don't like it.  Sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My husband don't even want to live with me because of the way I am.  My kids cry because they see my mood swings.  They see how I am and I'm putting my kids through this.  They say, "Mama, I want you to be better.  Mama, what's wrong with you?  Mama, why do you act like that?"  And I have no answers.  I wish I did.  My, my older kids, they, they can tell the difference when I'm on medicines, certain medicines and when I'm not on medicines like the Klonopin.  They, they say they can see the difference and with me hollering at them, my bigger kids.  My little kids, they pretty much stay in their room so I don't, I don't really holler with them.  My bigger kids, any little thing they do and I'm screaming at them, and I don't know why, don't know why.  And I, I don't know.  And I want to find out why.  Whatever it takes to do, I'll do it.  I feel crazy.  I feel like I'm going crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Frustrating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It must be frustrating that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very frustrating, very frustrating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are taking 2 Depakotes, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Geodon, you're taking how many?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two.  That's what my bottle says.  And I don't want, I don't want to be so drugged up that I, that I don't know what I'm doing.  I want to be helped, but I don't want to be to the point to where I'm like zombified and I don't know what's going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.  Is there anything else you are taking besides what I, I mean you were on Wellbutrin and Risperdal before you came to me, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not on that no more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm taking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We discontinued that, remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's lots of medications I'm taking.  It's just not for this.  There's medications I'm taking for my blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't have a list of my medications?  I thought I had.  I can't remember the names of all of them, but I'm on several different medications.  The only medications that, medication they haven't put me on yet is something for my pain, and that's because I can't find a pain doctor.  I can't find me a pain doctor that will take my Medicaid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What were you taking for the pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I haven't been on pain medication in over a year, but I was taking, um, Norco 10 mg, 10 325s three times a day.  And then they quit, and I found, okay, I had Medicaid and I had Medicare, and for some reason my Medicare cancelled.  They found me a pain clinic, but my Medicare cancelled for some reason, which I got to find out why, and, um, the pain clinic quit seeing me because they didn't take just Medicaid.  They didn't take Medicaid period.  They only took Medicare.  My doctor says she can't find a doctor that takes Medicaid, so what do I do.  I stay in pain all the time.  So I got the pain on top of the craziness and I just don't, I don't know.  And then I never have nobody to talk to about the things when they're happening to me.  My husband don't listen.  He thinks it's just stupid.  I get so frustrated sometimes that I have attacks where I just can't, I can't breathe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what they're called, but I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often that happens?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much every day.  My daughter pretty much helps me when I do that though.  She helps me to calm down to where I can breathe and sometimes it helps.  Sometimes she can help me.  Sometimes she can't help me.  Sometimes I just have, they have to get out of my face and just get away from me, you know, and let me sit there and be by myself to calm down on my own.  And then sometimes it frustrates me when, you know, they're trying, they're just trying to help me, but leave me alone.  Just get away from me and let me, I want to deal with it on my own and just get away from me and leave me alone.  And sometimes they won't do that and that frustrates me bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything unusual happening right now, stressful, anything that makes you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my life?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right now.  Anything unusual that you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, same thing every day.  Sit home and do nothing.  Boring life, I can't work.  The doctors won't let me work because my back has no disk in it and pretty much do the same thing every day.  I just want somebody to help me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Depakote when we started you on it was helping some, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You went all the way to 3 now.  You take 3, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your level is pretty good.  Your level is 84, which is good, you know, and Geodon that I'm giving you 18 mg, you take 2, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is supposed to help with the hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was pretty much, and I don't, I don't think that I'm hallucinating seeing this.  I think there's a ghost in my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can't be serious.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am serious.  I've never been more serious about anything in my life.  I think there's a ghost in my house.  I don't think I'm hallucinating.  I don't see the crazy things anymore.  I haven't seen crazy things like people trying to hurt me or my kids getting killed.  I haven't seen none of that in a while, but there's, there's been a ghost like figure, and I swear I think there's a ghost in my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're the only one who sees that then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it when I see it.  Nobody else sees it.  I'll sit there, my brother will be sitting on the couch and I'll, I'll see it and I'll say "[NAME OTHER] did you see that?"  "See what?"  And I'll tell him and he'll say, "You're crazy."  That's everybody's answer for me, "You're crazy."  No, we didn't see it, but this just started like 3 days ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many hours you get to sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just depends.  Sometimes I, most of the time I usually don't go to sleep until 12:00, 1:00 in the morning, and I wake up at 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you doing until that late?  What do you do?  Why don't you sleep early?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I just can't go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you do when you can't, when you don't sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Play a game on my computer.  That's all I ever do is play a game on my computer.  Sometimes I do that and sometimes I just sit up and watch TV, or even if I go to bed, sometimes, like last time I had to come here, I went to bed, I went to bed early, but I never got to sleep.  I mean I didn't get to sleep the whole night.  I came here and I was still fine, and sometimes I don't get to sleep like that at all.  I won't fall asleep all night.  I'll just lay in my bed and watch TV, and the next day I'm just like on the go, moving.  I feel like I'm wired up.  But most of the time I sleep, I usually never get to bed before 12:00, and I usually wake up at 6:00.  So I get, I usually get 6 hours sleep.  I don't have a life.  I think that's my problem.  I don't have a life.  I don't have no friends outside of my home.  I don't know anybody and that's one of my problems too is I have no, no, no type of social life, but I don't, I don't like being around people.  So how am I supposed to have a social life if I don't like being around people.  People get on my nerves.  How do I, how do I go out and mingle in a group of people when a group of people annoys me?  You know, it's, I don't know what you call it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a vicious cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like I want to get out.  I want to do things, but yet again, I don't want to be around people, so how do I do it?  You can't.  I can't until I can figure out what's right for me.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now when you came to me back in August, I had you, or in July I think I saw you first, you were on Wellbutrin and Risperdal and I took that off, remember?  I said don't take that anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you gotten worse since we've taken you off of that or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No because after that I saw you, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I haven't.  I don't feel like I've gotten worse at all.  I'm, I just, in some cases, I feel better, but in other cases, I'm, I don't feel better at all.  With the hallucinations of, the bad hallucinations, I feel better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With them, but the agitation and I guess the so called what you call panic attacks, I'm not better with those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then you take Klonopin it does calm you down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, it doesn't calm me down 100%, but it helps me.  I can't say that it, that it helps me 100%, but I can say it helps calm me down some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and [INAUDIBLE].  What we will do, we'll continue Depakote.  You continue taking 3.  Geodon I'm going to go 3, from 2 to 3.  You take 2, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to go 3 and see if that helps some with your mood swings, and I'm going to go up on your Klonopin.  Instead of 3, you're going to take 4 and let's see if that helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This, this last month I've only been taking 2.  You gave me only a prescription for 2 of them, 2 a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're going to go 4 now.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And 4th one only it's really bad then bump it up.  At least take 3, and then maybe more, 4.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll try to get you, you don't feel suicidal or anything, do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, no, I can tell you that I honestly sometimes want to die, but I would, could never hurt myself.  A lot of times I lay there and I say God just please get it over with and take me out of this world, for God to do it, but I couldn't do it myself.  I couldn't hurt myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it gets too much, you know you are always more than welcome to come.  I'll work you in, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have to wait for 4 weeks.  You can come on in anytime.  I'll be more than happy to work you in, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel like a crybaby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh don't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'll feel better when I leave here because I got, you know, because I can, I can talk to you and tell you the things that's happening, and, and you understand, but my family they don't understand.  My husband doesn't understand that one he, my husband's from Mexico and he doesn't understand what's going on with me.  So we don't have a very good relationship at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That doesn't help it, does it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, and I don't know how to make him understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long you will have been married?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twelve years.  He just don't understand that, what's going on.  Do, you don't have like any information in Spanish?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can order one.  I can order one on bipolar on Spanish.  I'll be glad to.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe that's not a bad idea.  What kind of work he does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Landscaping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.  Is he doing okay financially?  You guys are doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We struggle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that might be even hard on the whole family too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean everything's, our bills are paid, but, but we struggle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  I know what that's like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like paycheck to paycheck.  We don't have a bank account, no, no money saved, nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many children you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have 6 total, but I, I have 3 in the home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Three kids are grown, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have 3 kids grown, yes.  They don't live in the home.  They're out of the home.  Well my oldest daughter, she's 22.  She's about to have a baby any day.  She's at my house every day, but she doesn't, it's like she lives with me.  When her husband goes to work, he drops her off at my house and picks her up when he gets off of work.  So I told her I'm going to start charging her rent because she's at my house more than she is at hers.  That's a joke.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Well, okay, let's do this and let me see you in 2 weeks, and if you need to come back, I'll seen you even early, okay?  And, uh, we'll bump up your Klonopin.  I'm going to write 4 a day, but you take fourth one for real bad days, an extra one if you need it.  If you need every day 4 a day, just do that.  Don't worry about it.  We'll work on cutting you back later on, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

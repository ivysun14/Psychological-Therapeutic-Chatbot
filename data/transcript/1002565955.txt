<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okie dokie, well now, you said you were having some stress going on, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well first of all, that.  That packet that was sent that I brought into you and also [NAME OTHER] was sending you one, I put my comments on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That would be what, this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, this one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, he was sending you one also but I put comments on mine, I also put comments and brought it to him.  Uh, you know, either I'm a very good actress or this is some doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] that I guess does record reviews—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it makes everybody sound like they're lying, including me, including [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], including you, including everybody I've seen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, yep, you pulled the wool over all of our heads but you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm a very good actress, maybe I should have gone to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you couldn't, but you couldn't pull a fast one on that slick boy, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he never even actually saw it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's a record review.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I should see a forensic psychiatrist, whatever that might be.  What is a forensic psychiatrist?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that would, in nonspecific term, it means a psychiatrist that, uh, has some degree of expertise or focuses on psychiatric issues having to do with court, legal situations—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of which I guess—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I am one.  I passed the [DEIDENTIFIED] HRS DCF—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] forensic examiner's training.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sort of thing, which I've done.  Uh, some people actually do that exclusively for a living, they testify in court and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's all, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Disability and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, like I said, maybe I should have gone to [DEIDENTIFIED], I mean according to what this guy is saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it would pay better than disability wouldn't it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, he does mention a neuroophthalmologist which they did send me to in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, I have not received the report yet, neither has [NAME OTHER], however, what they said in there, what that neuroophthalmologist said is that he feels this is a brain stem injury, which does not show up on an MRI or a CT scan and that really, um, he brought out, oh I can't think of the, it's in [DEIDENTIFIED] I know that, they might, oh the [DEIDENTIFIED] clinic, might be able to send me there where they could really treat it and find it but I'd probably be better off going out of state and I thought, uh, workman's comp is really going to do that.  They then gave, sent me to an independent neurologist, independent neurologist, that was all the way in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't recall that name.  I used to know some people there from years back, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He put me through some tests like the toe heel walk that they usually make you do if you get stopped for, you know, he had to keep catching me because I kept falling over.  Um, as I was leaving, he handed me a slip which I didn't have time to make any comments on, which his remark was I could return to work with, uh, no restrictions.  That was a week after [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said unable to return to work.  So yes, I am very upset, I'm getting very angry.  Um, oh, the neuroophthalmologist did say I still can't drive.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I have to use to the walker, um, no work indefinitely.  So yes, I'm angry, I'm depressed because it makes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why does he keep repeating himself about the vital signs are normal, did you see that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gosh, he must have gone to medical school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean usually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  Um, however, and I think I might have put it there or I told [NAME OTHER] to go ahead and pull my records from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who is the one that my regular doctor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My blood pressure normally is something like 90/60.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, then first off, you have to take that into consideration but there is no reliable—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no for pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Physiologic measure of pain, there is no pain meter, there are no hormones, there are no blood tests—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And simply taking blood pressure is not all that accurate, um, certainly with extreme pain it can often be elevated to sometimes a large degree, sometimes not but that, uh, is by no means a pathognomonic, uh, absolute, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've been living with fibromyalgia how long, so I am used to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well it was a 10 out of 10 if it was extremely worse then I'd say more often than not you would see some, um, modest elevation of blood pressure, more often than not but does that mean that it's impossible, does that mean that other factors such as depression and anxiety and so forth could contribute to have you report the pain at a higher level, well we absolutely know that, we've spent millions and millions of dollars determining that depression and anxiety effect the perception of pain.  Um, anxiety and depression generally don't modify the blood pressure in the short term.  The point you made though is even probably more important; you've been living with fibromyalgia for quite some time so in a reflex increase and autonomic signs would, um, pretty much cease to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like I said, my blood pressure, I scare them all the time at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office, are you dizzy, no I'm not, my blood pressure is usually 90/60, I mean or 80/50, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's an acute thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The blood pressure response, for what it's worth, is primarily an acute situation.  If, uh, I get stung by a bee or, you know, a hell's angel bites my ear off—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then, you know, that kind of an acute traumatic situation, I probably would see some increase in blood pressure or I might go into shock and see a decrease in blood pressure but, anyway, whatever value it has predictive, which isn't all that much, uh, is like you said, probably negated when, because that's going to readapt itself—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over a period of time when you're dealing with chronicity, what an idiot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of course, if you also notice, he keeps bringing out, and he brings out in the end also, about me taking care of, uh, you know, maybe independently somebody should come and check and see if I'm really not driving since I'm taking care of elderly parents, one of which has Alzheimer's.  Well, uh, yes I did take care of them but my father died in 2001 and my mother died in 2005, that's way before the accident occurred.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] get a copy of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did doctor whom?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I do know that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] probably did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is an interesting guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you want to have some fun, make sure he gets a copy of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is a guy that was pulled over in [DEIDENTIFIED] driving his $100,000 Mercedes and started, and he was speeding too, and started mouthing off to the cops that this is nothing but a damn speed trap and then he kept at it, he was telling us, I said you're lucky you're here to talk about it.  Um, he said you know you're just out to harassing people, you're harassing me because you look at me and you say oh there's a rich doctor, I'm going to give him a ticket.  He said you know what really upset you is that my car costs more than your house.  I'm going, you did what?  See that plaque there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I work in a —</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Excuse me please.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One day a week, I did [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	I'm just looking at your stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's recording.  Not that one, the other one.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here [NAME OTHER].  I work there, that [DEIDENTIFIED] is one crooked county and you don't want to cross anybody there.  I mean I would keep receipts from the automatic gas pumps there just because somebody, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean they're crazy and he's telling me, but needless to say, he would definitely take numbers at that, he would probably be calling this guy down and tracking him down, offering a fist fight.  You'd probably want to wait till all your business is settled but if you want to get even, just hand it to [NAME OTHER], he'll take it from there, he would go ballistic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I just don't understand, I mean I've done chart reviews as an RN, I mean I know it's a different, you know, it's much different when a doctor does it but for goodness sakes, how do you do a chart review when you never even talked to the patient and you come out with this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think I see where he's going with it or trying to but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I'm faking?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I'm faking?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, no, you don't come out to that extent but, um, uh, well, possibly secondary gain or exaggeration of symptoms.  I don't know, maybe, I see where he's going with the blood pressure thing, that's pretty transparent and obvious and if that's the best he's got, you know, it's like oh he must have gone to medical school, he graduated but he must have been there, he can do better than that.  He'll get chewed up with that.  Let's see where we go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could we get to your part yet, what he said about you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I can't wait.  Let me see what I've got, I'll tell you.  Autonomic adaptation, I'm wondering if maybe I'll be able to get, go to court with this and I'd love to get this guy on the stand back and forth.  Autonomic adaptation to pain is primarily associated with acute pain not chronic.  Um, anxiety and depression have been proven to effect perception and pain, not perception, to effect pain, pain is nothing but perception.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have any pain other than right here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't care what's happening to your limbs or not happening to your limbs, I don't care if you're being, your hand is being put through a sausage grinder or whether you don't even have a hand and it's cut off and there's a nerve that's impinged there and it's being tweaked at the same area that would have been tweaked had the sausage grinder been happening.  Now is the sausage grinder real pain and this fake pain, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It feels like phantom pain with an amputation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phantom pain is real pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is the exact same pain.  The same [INAUDIBLE], the same impulses and as they go through this complex myriad of neurological soup, the first part, that the nose hair receptors disembark on, the first port they get out on, is the limbic system and hypothalamus, that's where are old friend depression and anxiety reside—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they largely hold in court with serotonin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why certain antidepressants have, um, a significant improvement in perception of pain.  Antidepressants or analgesics, no of course not, if you slam your thumb with a hammer, you certainly don't need a Prozac, you need a Percocet but if you are living with a, uh, chronic pain from arthritic or what have you, as you know, you're not going to get rid of it all, success is measured by how well you are able to function with the presence of pain.  You want to damp it as much as you can with appropriate narcotics and what have you but success isn't measured in how well they work, because they won't work indefinitely and, hopefully, they will work well but whether they do or don't, the person is going to make it or not based on how they can function with some degree of pain, so we have different definitions of pain.  Well, the same area of the brain, the hypothalamus and the limbic—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the same area that sends efferent, serato, serotonergic pathways down to the brain.  Now every part of your body is innervated, we know that, anybody knows that, take for instance, your toes right now, how do your shoes fit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Loose, comfortable, they're okay, do you have socks on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no socks, a little bit of cool air here, you probably feel it on your toes now can't you, yeah, well that's because your body has sensations to all parts of your body.  Now 3 or 4 minutes ago when we were talking about play this cool, were you thinking about the cool air on your toes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, of course not, why you'd be a blithering idiot if you're walking around thinking about your feet and your toes, and your butt, your underarms and whatever, you couldn't function that way could you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Almost like someone with chronic pain couldn't function with that constantly going, so the body in its infinite wisdom has a way of dampening some extraneous repetitive—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And learning to cope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That it doesn't need, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And learning to cope with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right, well we have a chemical way of dampening those.  We're aware of our feet because, God forbid, we step on a tack, we want—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To definitely know it and in order for that to happen, we still have to have some kind of conscious awareness of it but we're able to block it out most of the time when it's not necessary and that is by serotonin pathways that descend down the spinal column right next to the main fiber receptors that they send and they're run by serotonin from the same area and that's why people with depression will invariably report more headaches, backaches, butt aches, the usual stuff that we all have, like statistically the probability is about 0.00001 that is by random chance they will, because it messes up that serotonin and they're more acutely aware of all discomfort, uh, probably all sensation, but particularly any discomfort, not dramatic ones but just, my butt itches, whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and you know, little headaches that all get ordinarily so that's the body's way of dampening that.  Antidepressants enhance those mechanisms, they don't, that's not mainly why we use them, as a bonus we found out, mainly we're talking about the ascending stuff to the cortex as to how you think and feel about the future, and blah, blah, blah but at the same time, it's also enhancing the descending so that's when suddenly 2 and 2 came together and said, well you know, we're still going to have to give people their opiates and muscle relaxers and all that but by God, when we give them antidepressants for some damn reason they're getting, you know, that's how you feel, if you stop and say I've still  got a 6  out of 10 or whatever, if you stop and say by the way, thanks for stopping, I was in the middle of this book and I had forgotten all about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that and, as the pain docs will tell you, that is how you measure it, not actual numbers but are you able to read that book for an hour, are you able to sit through a church service—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A play or something and, and, enjoy every bit of it and if somebody stops you, you would say yes, I have some pain but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm able to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully people don't do that and then, you know, that is actually pain management, coping with chronic pain, hoping it all goes away isn't realistic.  So we know a lot more about pain than most of us do, some of us don't apparently.  Um, but, uh, any increased blood pressure is something you see with acute pain, it's part of the adrenaline—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mediation response to trauma, to tissue injury and to fear because pain generally promotes fear, it's a sign that your body is being damaged.  Well, you're not really afraid of your pain anymore, you know you've got what you've got, it's not news so it probably won't elicit fear much, in other words, your body does adapt for the most part to that, um, so the ballyhoo about that was just almost laughable.  Um, it'd be just as likely anxiety and depression would cause increase in blood pressure and the other no brainer is well what's your baseline blood pressure first off, before you even make a comment at all, find out what that is.  So, um, now then we go on to, he keeps reiterating about the MRIs and so forth, there's only very rare or extremely grave situations that would present with structural or anatomical lesions on imaging, um, that would fit a clinical picture like this.  Um, pain, it might be difficult for him to realize this but pain is not radiopaque.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You cannot take an x—ray of a brain and watch pain go through it, it doesn't work that way.  Um basically, you know, we're talking functional and neurochemical aspects of brain function, which are never evident on, on imaging studies unless you get a radiolabel neurotransmitter uptake, that sort of thing, but uh, or Polaroid snapshots.  All right, well let's move around, we don't want to spend all day on this; it's interesting so far.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm waiting for you to get to your part.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd love to chew him up, it'd be easy too.  Okay, so in his humble opinion, is he, uh, from [DEIDENTIFIED], so he's going to tell [DEIDENTIFIED] that his neuro exam fell below standards, huh.  I think your knowledge of psychopharmacology falls way below standards myself.  Ah, okay, keep repeating the blood pressure.  Still having headaches and normal vital signs.  By God, it happens.  C spine curvature.  [INAUDIBLE] beyond my—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's why I put down there also where is all the tests from, [DEIDENTIFIED], the balance tests that are all computerized and, um, that's where he gets the gait abnormality but that's okay, yeah, and supposedly [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is, uh, world renowned so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think I've heard of him, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I'm just saying it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's repetitive, yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll move right along and leave it up to him to hash on that.  Well, there's nothing much I can say about that other than what an idiot, documented was the closest thing we have to anything in its objective, which is the back way, which is uh, very good, very good reliability, it's been used for decades, it's the standard for testing any new drug, um, but yes, it is not a substitute for a psychiatric interview, that's why I can make a call of severe even though it fell in the upper range—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of moderate, otherwise, monkeys and robots or even psychologists could do it.  I think I'm capable of diagnosing depression without getting a Beck from a psychologist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A forensic one at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A forensic psychiatrist at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, furthermore, it's doubtful that workman's comp would have been delighted to pay for a psychological evaluation but I'm sure [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], a good friend of mine that works with me on a lot of cases would be glad to do it, that'll give us even more ammunition.  Objective psychological testing to verify subjective complaints, blood tests.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We had the blood tests for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Blood tests for depression, what are we talking about, objective, he just flew off the gold standard of psychological testing which is effect, because it's somewhat subjective.  Sleep disturbance, [INAUDIBLE], lack of concentration.  I'll check these.</p>

PT:	What didn't you do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, the memory, the most objective thing we can do is object recall.  No, we already did it in the Beck anyway.  Yeah, without, if I wasn't going to do the Beck, if I was doing essentially the same thing on this memory cognitive function—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abstraction and judgement, for some reason I left those blank.  Um, I think cognitive and memory would have been moderately to mildly impaired, abstract judgement is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But one reason I probably blew it off is because they already had it with the Beck.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll bet we can get 7 or 8 other board certified psychiatrists and they'd all give the same diagnosis.  Now they didn't ask for a forensic evaluation, they asked for a 45 minute, uh, evaluation for treatment when I first saw you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  No, they didn't ask for a forensic, I mean she's saying that now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Moderate impairment of concentration, no actually, I dictated it, these were just a copy of the notes.  Uh, [INAUDIBLE] sleep disturbance and decreased appetite, decreased energy, no I didn't hire a private eye to verify it.  Um, marked moderate impair concentration, likewise, short term memory with overall mild impairment of cognitive function.  Abstract judgment, insight intact, I called it from that far back, all right.  But yeah, this was a treatment evaluation not, not to nit pick with people but to try to get you feeling better and, um, pharmacotherapy consistent with,  [INAUDIBLE] to moderate depression.  Oh, that's how he figured that out, he must have read my report, 20 would be severe, go figure.  Okay, I did not elaborate on the rationale for the, uh, reason.  I thinks that's enough for the injury, although I'll bet my 14 year old could say, wait a minute, he said that was a single episode, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that means that's the first time she's ever had it, right, yeah, when did it happen relative to the injury.  Oh, about 4 to 6 months after.  Yeah, I'll bet I know what your fancy psychiatrists are thinking about when you put those things together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like she didn't have it before and then this happened and now she's got it, I'll be there's a connection.  You've got to hand it to him.Yeah, these kids are smart.  Actually, it's more sophisticated than that though, the, um, constant barragement of the limbic, uh, neurotransmitter areas that regulate mood and depression—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	By those receptors, predisposes on a molecular basis, to, for people to develop depression and probably 75% of people do, it's the minority of people that don't, I've seen a few but most people do.  It usually occurs about 6 months out, not one month, you might be hurting in one month, you might think oh my God I'm screwed, you know, I'm injured, blah, blah, blah, all those worries are there and you're not happy, you're certainly not having a great day but there's a big difference between that and where it develops into clinical depression and time after time, after time, after time, after time, I have people tell me, you know, doc, yeah, it was at about, you know, 4, 5, 8, whatever, but usually about 6 months.  It takes a while for it to start knocking the person down until they start getting, I can't even eat, you know, and think, you know, my wife comes home from the swimsuit thing they're doing, I don't even have any interest in her—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's not me, you know, so, and this is all in the journals.  What the hell pathology are you going to get on an MRI that would, that would account for dizziness or, uh, balance problems other than things that aren't going to matter because you have a tumor or something and you're going to be dead in another 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A tumor and acute bleed, which like you said is, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A tumor, uh, amebic infection is eating away the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Area but there's only a few things like that but the vast majority of people that have tinnitus and dizziness show no abnormalities specific to that, that's the norm for that.  Well, one thing, I agree that I think, you know, getting those tests would, for the legal part, I don't think it would add anything to treatment decisions.  I think I would, you know, I'd have probably done the same courses that I did anyway but in terms of your legal situation, it would further document validity and consistency I think of the presentations you've shown, it would not be a bad thing.  Psychological testing may assist in further delineating underlying motivations for the ongoing subjective complaints.  That's possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they certainly could show, [INAUDIBLE] could show exaggerations and, um, somatization scales, chart neurological patterns of utilizing sick behavior to, um, uh, resolve feelings of guilt or obtain special privileges, breaks from work and so forth, but people that go in, the medical profession as a group are generally about 180 degrees on the other side of the pole with that, you know, think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A person that likes to lean on the sick role, to be comforted and things like that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh, we're the caregivers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, they don't go into nursing, that would be really stupid, very unhappy nurses, so actually I think on the other side of the coin would be that these psychological testing, in my opinion, more than likely, would serve the opposite purpose, it would shows that you do not utilize, you have other defense mechanisms but those aren't the ones that you would utilize so it works both ways.  [NAME OTHER], like I said, is a local guy, he does a real good job with, if you have an option or actually, since they brought it up, why don't we, uh, have your attorney stick that one out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'll give you, if I'm going to court here, it'll give me something to work with too, something I can really ream him with but we could, we could pick who want rather than some of those guys—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] office space for him, in [DEIDENTIFIED] next door.  One of the more interesting ones that I've ever read.  That could be fine, that guys not really very smart, I don't think.  That's tricky work to do, that kind of stuff, and he ain't very good at it.  He's going to get his butt chewed up there sooner or later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, just like I said, you know, when I went to their neurologist and we came out and, of course, their nurse practitioner, which I know works for the company, I said to her, you tell me what kind of job a nurse can do on a walker.  Well, you have to use your brain instead of, you know, running around the hallway.  She said I have a sedentary job and I looked at her, I said, uh, yeah but you have to drive to all these appointments and I'm not allowed to drive.  Oh, you have a point there and I thought well that tells me a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's your attorney?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER], oh that'll be good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, he adores you, I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, well, we hit it off well, we're good friends but I adore watching him get hold of somebody like that in court too, I mean he is, that's when he can shine, he's good at that.  Well, well, well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And of course to a certain extent, what they're doing now, I mean I'm still getting my checks but they're playing games with the checks so the checks are coming later and later, which of course, puts my bills later and later, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have a son in boot camp, which I told you, he did go in and I'm wanting to go to this graduation in April and so that has me more upset too, I realize that, I know that's part of it, that he decided to go in the Army, stupidly in my opinion but that's besides the point.  Let me ask you something [PHYSICIAN NAME] and of course this has nothing to do with the workman's comp case—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you think Lyrica would help the fibromyalgia?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  I've, uh, seen very good response thus far.  I have had a great deal of experience—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because you realize [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] believes in only natural stuff for fibromyalgia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] believes in only natural—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ambrotose, which I don't know, it's a health food thing and it doesn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ambrotose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ambrotose, take more Ambrotose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I take that stuff, it's, uh, it's okay I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, you know, but I would take it for an illness.  I'll tell you what it is great for, gargle with it if you have like, um, you know, a little inflammation—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it'll help with that quite a bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But with all the other medicine I'm on, I mean I'm talking about my routine medicine, the Xanax, the Restoril, the, um, Pamelor, the Lyrica wouldn't effect that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a little harder question to answer because you can't say definitively, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What about the small dosage, like the 25 mg?  Doesn't it come in 25's?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of what, the Ambrotose or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lyrica?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh Lyrica, yeah.  No, I'd go with the real medications, um, you're going to get modest benefits out of certain health foods.  I know those guys kind of promote, like take large amounts of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I don't think that would be a good idea to take large amounts of it because it hasn't been proven.  I think, uh, well, any fool will tell you that Aloe vera will help a burn—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure and maybe they've cooked up something a little bit better, uh, but it doesn't do it without having some real physiologic effects and we're not at all sure what those effects are and how they might interact with other drugs.  I wouldn't take large amounts, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, I stopped the Ambrotose long ago, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's as expensive as it is, it's probably not the best bang for your buck in the world.  My wife got interested in that so I got interested in looking at the company, [DEIDENTIFIED] is a crook.  They made about 6 grand off, what is it, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] now, what's the name of the company.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I can't think of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she was going to start ordering this crap, I think it's way over priced to be honest, it's good stuff, the vitamins are pure organic and all but anyway, I was fiddling with it, looked at it and said I should have jumped on it, jumped out of it, that's $3000 that I just made [NAME OTHER], get all this health food stuff, it's on the house, they paid for it.  Okay, let's get a little more beefed up here.  Mini mental status exam, what year is this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What year is this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what year are we in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	2008.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.  What day of the week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, it's Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	State?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	County?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three unrelated objects, pen, banana, church, could you repeat those three words?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pen, banana, church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll ask you later what they are.  I'd like you to count backwards from 100 by 7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	100, 93, uh, lord, forget it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, spell the word world, like as the world turns?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	W O R L D.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, spell that word backwards now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	D L R O W.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What were those 3 items I asked you to repeat earlier?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Banana, pen, and church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've always had a pretty keen memory, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You still had to struggle on a couple things, I suspect it wasn't such a problem before, huh?  This is a questionnaire; over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by that, not at all or nearly everyday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or in between?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Little interest or pleasure, this is nearly every day.  I don't do this, the total.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Check these, what this, kind of keep a log on a regular basis and we'll review them when I see you next time, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pamelor 50, Restoril 30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Xanax 0.5 b.i.d.?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and I'm going to need prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you feel they're working for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, Xanax, the Xanax 0.5 twice a day, I haven't had to go up on that, that seems to be handling the, um, anxiety okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it last long enough, that's the short acting isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, you gave me the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	XR?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the Pamelor 50, I take that at night, that seems to be doing okay.  I mean I'm still a little depressed but, you know, basically that seems to be doing okay.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Doctor, patients are leaving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and the Restoril 30, I'm still having trouble sleeping or staying asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't we switch that to Ambien, do you think that might work better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been on that and that hasn't, Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, Lunesta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh, that worked even lousier than the Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll stay on the Restoril, I mean it takes me a while to go to sleep but I'll stay on the Restoril.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's nudge the Pamelor up a little bit.  We could also check a blood level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Again?  Did they ever send you that report, you didn't get it the last time I was here but, I had it done at, uh, the lab near [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] lab or [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The one next door to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], what is that called?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, by [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED], um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let's track down what you've already had before we—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You asked me to go for a, uh, Pamelor level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, okay, I remember that now, yeah, no I didn't get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, let me try to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it part of [DEIDENTIFIED], one of their draw sites, that would have been like either [DEIDENTIFIED] or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], okay.  We'll need that but meanwhile, I think we could still go up to 75, um, it sounds like you are having a little bit of depression slipping through on you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I know I get angry quicker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tend to get angrier quicker but I basically tell my family, deal with it.  I know that's not very nice but you know what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	5'2"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And about what do you weigh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	123.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any kind of blood pressure problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, none.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At the present.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None present.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No, actually no medical problems other than the fibromyalgia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what about Lyrica?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I know that I can't be on workman's comp, do you think I should try, try the 25 mg?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, why don't you go ahead, you don't have any samples of that do you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've got some coupons I can give you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay and give me like a 7 day, it goes by a 7 day supply doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then if I do all right on it, I'll give you a call.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's got some mood stabilizing components.  I prescribe it, uh, psychiatrically for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really but just give me the 25 mg because I don't want anything that makes me any more goofy than I already am, okay.  I see your wife isn't here with her little dog that she dresses up.  That's all right, I have a little pug that, you know, I'm actually thinking to take it to, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] when I go to my son's, uh, graduation of boot camp because I don't want to leave her with anybody, so I understand exactly.  The last time I was here, when I brought this over, I looked and it was asleep in the basket and it had a little dress on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay and you want me to do these, so I'll start like tomorrow I guess with this, with my moods and my appetite, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you married, widowed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Widowed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you live by yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a roommate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pardon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a roommate that lives with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Roommate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  And my oldest son comes and checks on me quite a bit, then the youngest son, of course, is in the military like I told you.  And you will give me samples?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

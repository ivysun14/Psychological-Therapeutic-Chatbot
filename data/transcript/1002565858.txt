<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
 
<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so when did you find out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, last week they called a whole bunch of people in from the company.  They were picking as large a groups as they could—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They went throughout the entire company, and, um, they told us that, um, they were, we were pulling out of the [DEIDENTIFIED].  They had decided on three areas.  They're taking all the HP people all over the United States and they're either sending them to [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], or [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Did you have a choice picking those spots or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Our group was assigned to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So the good news is I guess [NAME OTHER] still has a job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He still has a job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you got to move to [DEIDENTIFIED] to keep it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Will they pay for moving expenses and things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they haven't given us the packages or everything.  We, we don't know anything at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it'll be at least 18 months because [NAME OTHER] group will be one of the last to pull out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Huh, so, but he's decided he wants to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We kind of have to [PHYSICIAN NAME].  He's 57—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, I mean it took us a long time.  It's a good company and we just can't walk away from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  It's hard to find jobs these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So about 18 months is what they're saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, okay, and he'll have the same job, same salary?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  At least you have some time.  What are you going to do with your house then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have to sell it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this is not a terrific time to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  I was thinking there are a lot of people, I think it was over 1,000 employees, wasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thirteen hundred.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thirteen hundred, that's a lot of extra houses that'll be on the market then too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, part of the problem though is the moving package.  We're not expecting a whole lot not when you're transferring 1,300 people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you have to end up moving yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the good news is [DEIDENTIFIED] is not too far away at least.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's about 6, 7 hours, something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know what the housing market's like down there, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For the cost, or the cost of living I don't know either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a feeling it may be a little lower than here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope so, yeah.  Have you ever spent much time in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went there one time and when we left I said to my husband, well it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh dear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Verbatim.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, shoot.  Little did you know I guess at the time you'd suddenly moving there, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and [NAME OTHER] [AGE], I'm thinking how many more years will it be till he can retire, um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he don't have a whole lot left after all those years of unemployment.  Before 9—11, we had a pretty doggone good retirement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it was in the market, not a foolish market, but the whole thing crashed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, we've probably lost about $300,000 in that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and social security's not enough to live on these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Yeah, I get $700 and some odd dollars. "</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So things are just kind of up in the air.  You just have to see I guess.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, so how are you feeling about the move?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm feeling okay about it.  I wish we were going somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, I'm just kind of still kind of numb about it all.  Um, some of he people just left work and went home and told their, their wives because they've got to decide pretty quickly whether they're staying or going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they're starting to move people quickly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, and what is [NAME OTHER] job with [DEIDENTIFIED] again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's inside government sales.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, works with, um, the government, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, if there's somebody like in the military or in a department somewhere that needs something, they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's the one that goes and figures out what they need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so he'll still be able to do that down there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he travel much now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not now, Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know if he'll have to then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You don't know.  Customers are back up here or in other places.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Time will tell I guess.  Okay.  Well, it's something you're going to have to find new health care providers, a new home, just kind of everything I guess.  Okay, and do you know when you'll put your house on the market even or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we're probably going to put it on next spring and, um, because it's, you know, everything's in bloom.  It looks nice and we're hoping to put in on next spring and if we have to, if it's another six months or something, when we sell it, we'll just go into a, um, an apartment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that makes sense.  Okay, yeah, because I know for some people it's taking a year or so to sell sometimes, but you just don't know.  Some people sell it in a week.  It's just a funny market.  Well, so your spirits are doing okay overall then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I would say so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I, um, I'm having a lot of nightmares.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean really bad violent nightmares.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and when I wake up I can tell you every single little detail of those nightmares.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not exactly sure what is causing that, but, um, it's, you know, it's, it's not really affecting me much except night after night after night I don't understand, and then the only other little problem I'm having is I shake a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What part of you shakes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, all of me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your whole body shakes.  Is it on the inside or can people see it from the outside?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can see it physically outside.  I was trying to write a check the other day and even when I try and go to write, I feel like there's a jerking in my hand and my handwriting's, you know, not my own.  It's very hard to read.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't read it and that's saying something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That makes me wonder if it could be a medication although the ones you're on, I don't know what one would cause it to be honest with you.  Um, okay, hmm.  Are you sleeping through the night with these nightmares or do they wake you up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm sleeping through the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is one thing I'm doing really well right now is sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, and then is your energy level during the day okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  All right, is your appetite stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, are you feeling anxious much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm having a little trouble with anxiety, but given all the circumstances, I don't think it's, it's very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of, uh, taking or, I'm on 1 and a half Xanax, taking it down to 1 and a fourth or you know, 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, are you having any panic attacks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, not right now I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That Lamictal and, um, Effexor seem to be working well for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Um, so, yeah, we could sure look at cutting back slowly.  Are you thinking about trying to just cut back to the lowest possible dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's still a very good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe a quarter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A quarter, but, like a mg or a tablet do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well I'm on, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're taking how many tablets now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I take, uh, uh, 1 and a half mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I didn't know whether I should take 1 and a quarter or just go down to 1 or what you thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let's see .5.  It'd probably be good to cut back by half a tablet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if we go too fast, it could put it into withdrawal, and we don't want that.  You're not on a high dose at all, but it'll probably be safe to go down by half a tablet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I'd just be on 1 now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, well actually you're taking 3 tablets, so it'd be good to go down to 2 and a half tablets.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I still have the blue ones, so I'm taking 1 whole blue one, and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the tablet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the blue one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'm not sure which ones the blue ones because they're generic, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're 1 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're 1 mg, okay, I see what, I was thinking you were taking the .5s.  So you're taking 1 and a half, so yes, if you go down to 1 and a quarter then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'd be the best.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One and a quarter.  All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I'd go down decreased to 1 and one quarter mg per day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I'm going to start using the ones that you gave me.  Um, I thought it might take me a lot longer to get off and I wanted to use the rest of the blue ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, uh, if I was taking this dose on the 1s, the .5, how many would I take?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd be 2 and a half tablets.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It would be 1.25 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  You know, we can sure try that and keep backing down and see if you keep doing as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then let me just run through the other medicines.  You're still using the Trazodone to sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Atenolol, do you use that every day still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and Lamictal, you're still taking 1 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Now is that 100 or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, 200.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two hundred, okay, I'm doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and the Effexor generic, you're taking 75 twice a day still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and the Ata, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you have Effexor generic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, they don't give—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When it goes generic, they don't give it out anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And plus the company that makes it is not even giving out Effexor XR anymore because they've come out with a new medicine that's kind of a modified version of it, and once that happens they stop giving out samples of the old medicine.  Is it an expensive one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.  Lamictal and Effexor are the two most expensive medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now in that donut hole, I'm having to pay for it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Yeah, I'm hoping the Effexor will get cheaper because it's been generic for a while.  The Lamictal, I'm trying to remember if I heard if it was going generic this summer.  It may be going generic this summer.  I'm not positive about that, but that may cut back on the cost too then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm also taking Atarax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Atarax, 1 twice a day still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any side effects or problems with medications that you can tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, okay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Effexor's already gone generic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Hopefully they're giving you venlafaxine, which is the generic for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't think I have that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you can ask them the next time you get it if you can get the generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I needed a new prescription for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It said no refills on the bottle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, okay, I'll write you a new one.  I put down use for use with refills, but they may have put it in the computer wrong, so I'll get you another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, what about, you said no panic attacks.  Any problems with feeling unsafe when you go out recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I've been pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So you're able to kind of come and go as you want?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you're not feeling like people are trying to bother you or mess with your, okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do get kind of paranoia where my neighborhood.  There are a lot of gangs and we drove by the [DEIDENTIFIED] which is walking distance of our house and this guy crossed the street in front of us, and I said [NAME OTHER] that, that's scary and I had someone to try and come in, um, about a year ago, and we got the police called and everything and they arrested him, came in my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He came in your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He came in our house while my employee and I were there, and they came back later in the day and asked us some questions, and they said we can't go into, into any detail, but we can tell you he was at your employ.  So, that scared the heeby gees and they are all drawn guns, you know, before they go into my, uh, garage and, uh, that scared me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then another time, um, a man showed up at my house, he had a badge on, and he said, uh, uh, don't leave your home.  There's a felon in your backyard and we're trying to catch him.  No kidding.  Well, they didn't catch him, so I could see from the back of my house, they were opening up the dumpsters everywhere and, you know, then, the, uh, the gangs spray painted our white vinyl fence.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm ready to get out of there.  I mean if I wasn't leaving, I would be moving one way or another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where do you live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I live, um, just outside of [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I mean I'm not in a terrible—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Neighborhood, but it is really, uh, gone downhill in the last 3 or 4 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, shoot.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"And somebody else busted our, our glass out trying to get inside. "</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your, your window or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, yeah, and we had a rod there and they couldn't push it back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I, I've had enough of that neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, it's probably a thing you're moving then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about have you had any experience of hearing any voices that other people weren't hearing recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's the music thing that's troubling me now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still, still hear music?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you hear it inside your head or outside?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's inside my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean it drives me nuts [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it a song that you can identify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's usually something I've heard and it just goes over and over and over, and I get up to go to the bathroom at 2:00 in the morning, and that song's in my head.  I mean it's like a plaque.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, okay.  Any other sounds or voices or anything else that you hear?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've had the sense that somebody was there a lot and I look and there's nobody there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like right standing next to you or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I turn, but nobody's there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that happens quite, uh, a lot more often that I'd like it to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I sense that someone's there, but I don't see anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, have you seen anything else unusual, or anything that other people didn't seem to see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, and is that sense of somebody being there, is it a comforting thing or a frightening experience?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of frightening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I've actually had times when I felt someone was in my home, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So yeah, that's not comforting at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  When you go out, do you feel like people are kind, or does it feel like people are like watching you or following you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  I kind of guard myself [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I mean I don't go out a whole lot, um, and if I feel sometime like someone's following me in my car, I don't go home.  I, uh, just keep driving until they finally turn and then I go a different way and then I go home because I'm scared for somebody following me home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Hmm, okay, um, what about have you had any thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself at all recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I have had thoughts that, you know, I'd be all right with going home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Okay, if it were to happen, passing, I mean if it was your time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, are you having any health problems right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I'm having a pretty serious, uh, problem with my back.  That's why I'm on ice.  I don't know what I did to it, [PHYSICIAN NAME], but I've tried two different chiropractors.  I even tried, uh, acupuncture to get some relief in this back.  I was due to leave on Saturday to go to, I've told you, for you know, months I was looking forward to going to [DEIDENTIFIED] for the 4th, but we can't go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of your back pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, yeah.  I, I, even standing at the sink this morning trying to do, um, dishes was really painful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've tried ice and stretching and muscle relaxers and acupuncture and two different chiropractors.  I saw my doctor last Saturday, he happened to be open on Saturday and he said [PATIENT NAME] there's nothing more I have to offer you except for muscle relaxers and Percocet, there's nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, but I'm doing the stretching and ice.  I always have ice with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, you know, I just, right now I have to live with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But actually I know I mean all this sounds kind of bad, but actually I'm feeling pretty stable right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well good.  That's the important thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty stable on those medications you put me on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As I cut down the Xanax, sometimes I have a little bit of a problem, but if that happens, I'll call you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just going to take it down a quarter of a mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds fine.  Yeah, I'm thinking let's, let's not make any other changes and if that's okay with you.  Let's cut back on the Xanax that quarter mg—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And leave your meds alone so you don't have too many variables changing at the same time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, anything else going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know exactly what I'm going to do if I move to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know how you'd feel about this, but, um, it's far to drive, but I might want to come up every few months and see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't want to start all over with a, a new [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I've been very comfortable with you, and, you know, I feel that we, we'd done well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can see what works.  I mean the thing I don't know, um, there are a couple of issues we have to look at.  One is would they, if I write a prescription for you here, would they fill it down there.  Some states will, some won't, and I don't know [DEIDENTIFIED] laws.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like I know, I've had patients that left here and went down to vacation in Texas, and forgot their Xanax, and I tried to call it in and they wouldn't accept an out of state prescription for Xanax.  It had to be written by a doctor in the state.  So that's one issue we'd want to look at, and then second would be, you know, would, would I, uh, be available enough for you from here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, if it turns out that works, you know, we can surely look at that.  If it doesn't, I have a very good friend who lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] who knows a very good psychiatrist, so I could try to help find out who that is too, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll try to figure out what works for you, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would be open to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want somebody that will take time with me and work with me on my meds like you've done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  You want to find someone good down there.  The person I've heard her describe is she said is one of these just really good people that, uh, the kind of guy that will spend time with you, talking with you, getting to know you.  He treats policemen and firemen for free, you know, he doesn't, he's just a good hearted person as well as a good psychiatrist and I know I've heard her describe him, so, but we can cross that bridge when we get closer to it, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me get your prescription in for the generic Effexor.  That's the one you needed, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, I'll write for the generic which is venlafaxine.  And you're getting it filled locally, aren't you, as opposed to a mail order?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, uh, no, I do it mail order—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because if I have enough, get enough for ninety days—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, they give me one month free.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I'll write for a ninety day supply with a year's worth of refills then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would miss you [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME] I'd miss you too.  It's always hard when somebody I like moves away, but I know, and it's happening more and more these days because people's jobs are just not as stable as they used to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And a lot of people having to move for work, but, um, we'll see how things work out and I'm sure we can find what works best for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we've got at least 18 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's a pretty good window or time frame to kind of check things out and see what your options are, so.  All right, anything else then before we set up another appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think we're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if you have something Wednesday around 11:00, that's always a good time for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, about a month from now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's see here.  We could do, the 23rd I'm going to be out of the town, the [DATE] I'll be here, and I've got times either at 10:30 or 12:00 if either of those would work for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, what about the next week?  Do you have anything at 11:30?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have 11:30 on [DATE] if that would work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean 11:00, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't have 11:00.  I have 11:30, um, I'd have to clear out to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's, let's go 11:30 on, um, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so 11:30 on [DATE].  Would you like a card too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to write it in my book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Okay and I'll write it in here too, so 11:30 on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Occasionally I have to call you and say when was that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.  You just let me know.  All right, well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.  Now, [PATIENT NAME] I guess congratulations I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's kind of a mixed thing.  I mean like I said, it's kind of exciting, but it's kind of sad at the same time, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well I, I really am feeling better than I have felt, you know, emotionally and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not having near as many panic attacks as I was.  I like the, the mix of the Atarax and the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, and that's the most important thing.  If you're feeling good, wherever you are, you're going to be okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, all right, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've encouraged that you might know someone in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's like a very good friend who really, I really trust a lot that knows someone down there.  So, I'll do some research even ahead of time if I have to that is, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, thank you [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have a good day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, you too, take care.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bye now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.</p>

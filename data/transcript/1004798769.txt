<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would normally think it would be easier to get this whole thing—coming in here and having consistent—talking about stuff would get easier, but for some reason, it doesn't always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not like it is hard as in I'm afraid, it just like—I sort of (pause) tend to not [inaudible [00:00:31] have things that are immediately about myself that I am thinking about. That kind of stuff, you know? [0:00:37]</p>

<p>(Pause) So, I guess (pause) I don't know it is just, like I said, it is one of those things where it is (pause) it is really awkward for me to do this very much, you know? (Chuckles) But (pause) I am going to eventually make it, I think. I just feel, like I said, really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talking about these things so much, along with many other things, sometimes makes me feel very emotionally drained, you know? And (pause) because a lot of my issues that I have are things that I cannot change, it doesn't always—I mean, I know there is progress, but it doesn't always feel like there is anything that is going to change. [0:01:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So (pause) but (pause) (sigh) So last night—as we were going to sleep, my husband mentioned something about going into therapy and talking about like the—the thing that each other does for one another. Like, you know, the fact—he was talking about the fact that one of the greatest things I do for him is get him to step up and be a man and this and that, you know, all this stuff. He is like—he mentioned the fact that his therapist asked what he does for me and he says, "I don't know." (Chuckles) He said, "Maybe you should go home and ask her." And I'm like, "I don't know (chuckles). Especially because you are asking me this as we are going to go to sleep and it is the last thing on my mind." And I've been feeling really guilty about this. I really do think very positive things about him as a human being, it is just that I feel like this is sort of kind of an awkward situation to be in, you know? Being like, okay, so I have no idea what I am going to say and I don't really—it is like feeling creatively stunted for that. [0:03:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Emotionally stunted. I mean, I think he is a great guy and all, but I just—you know. It is—sometimes when I am put on the spot I am not very good at things, I guess, is what I am trying to say. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I'm not saying in any way that anybody meant to do anything like that, it is just that it is, you know, it is kind of awkward sometimes—put on the spot. (Pause) In general, that was sort of a—and then of course, because this—this brought up the timing of going to sleep again, it seemed like an awkward conversation that went on a lot longer than it needed to based on that time of day. And so (pause)—he really is trying and he was a lot better, not just by when he is around other people, but having been around other people again, like his friends, he becomes a better person—less selfish, that kind of thing. But sometimes I just really wonder about him. [0:04:37] </p>

<p>(Pause) And maybe I am in the wrong on this [inaudible [00:04:48]. It is entirely possible. Apparently (pause) it never dawned on him that I was treating him the way I wanted to be treated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I just, you know, I was trying to lead by example. Like steady, normal, regular, two decades of behavior and he never thought about that. (Pause) And he was—we were just—this came up because the way that—he is like, "You're asking the way you want to be treated" and things like that and I was like, "Well, sort of go by the Golden Rule, I treat people the way I want to be treated." Do things—that kind of thing. Although he is going to make a concerted effort in it, I just never realized just how screwed up his background is that he never even thought about it that way, you know? [0:05:55]</p>

<p>(Pause) It is really like, literally it never dawned on him that that is the way people do that. Not everybody, but there are people that do that that way. You know? That is (pause) kind of weird. (Sigh) I am just—I'm kind of sick of thinking about and talking about his background because it is so fucked up. (Pause) I mean, I can't not because that is part of who he is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I am frustrated that (pause) that his family is the point where they are also willing to help except for the things he actually needs. You know what I mean? (0:07:05)</p>

<p>Actually, they are not really willing to help at all, but they say that they are. You know? (Pause) And I am extremely angry that there is a clinician who has implied that Dave asking from family members—telling them directly what kind of things he wants from them is (pause) ridiculous behavior. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am just so pissed about that. You know? I mean, how else is he supposed to have a relationship? Is it only supposed to be on her terms? You know? Of course he is going to say, "I really need you to do this." You know? Otherwise she'll never ask. She doesn't care. She hasn't even called in a couple of months. You know? </p>

<p>And (pause) I just don't get it. I really don't. One of the things that was especially hard about the funeral, actually, is the fact that he realized that (pause) if were something to happen to him, that there is like three pictures of him. His parents really can't tell that many stories. You know what I mean? There isn't that support. There is, like the—okay, this is what happened this Christmas kind of thing. And I think that really made him sad. [0:09:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And, you know, it is true. It really is true. I (pause) I am already at this point right now where I am sick of being held at arm's length and being spoken to so clinically and cold and in a way that makes it seem that I am the one that is not mature and doesn't understand how to deal with everyday life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just—and I thought—it took for years that there was something wrong with me and that I was being, you know, un-whatever. And (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it is not even that you (pause) concerning yesterday—struck me as it seems you would rather tell what you are saying to [interposing] how much is matters to you and you are completely not alone in this, but for the moment how much matters to you to really feel a part of something with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [0:10:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sort of close to people around—sort of a group or communal sense. And I wonder if that is part of why this stuff with Dave's family is so hard and you [inaudible [00:11:01] things to heart that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. I knew that before I even came in here. I was really looking for extra family, especially siblings, but just in general. And the rejection has been really hard. In fact, when they say things to me, I believe it. And for the most part—if there is someone that says something very negative about me, I tend to believe it. There are some categories in which that I default to "no", but these are things that are not categories that are really all that relevant emotionally, you know? [0:11:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If somebody told me that I—something that I felt very, very confident about, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:11:49] imagine that part of the reason you have done that with them is because it sort of (pause) in a way, you felt worth it to be part of the family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That and for a long time, Dave didn't actually think there was anything wrong with his family. He thought they were really close—you know what I mean? It is hard to explain, but, yes, it was—it was very easily told the exact opposite of what was actually true. So yes. (Pause) And it wasn't like I was trying to throw my family away, it is just that I come from a very small one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [0:12:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it can be a very nice thing about getting married.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I agree. I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, to your point that it is not something you are trying to throw your family away or wanting less to do with them, but it can be nice to—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, to have extra family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where, I guess, it really would have meant a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they had gone—if they were a different sort of people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it really would have. (Pause) Especially because of the whole just be yourself thing. I'm like, I am being myself kind of thing, you know. It is really hard to get that kind of awkward feedback that doesn't make sense. It is like, okay, being myself is obnoxious. Great, you know? (Pause) Or being myself is being sulky, apparently, or whatever. You know? (Pause) I (pause) I do worry a lot, especially because my family is aging and my parents are not in the—well definitely my mom is not in the best of health lately. And I don't know (pause) although I have many cousins, almost all of them are younger than me and are sort of not really all that interested in settling down or really getting to—I mean, and we know each other—or don't know each other that well. There is a big age gap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. [0:14:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the—it is like (pause) you know, my maternal grandparents have passed on. My paternal grandparents, unfortunately, especially my grandmother, although she is alive, she is suffering from dementia enough that—along with many other things going on, there isn't that much family support, you know? And one of the things that was really nice to see was all the family around. That kind of thing. And (pause) in a time of crisis I would not have that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. [0:15:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is really upsetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The few times that I have felt comfortable enough to say things, I have been [inaudible [00:15:59] for a fool for saying so and now I have to be exceptionally guarded. You know? (Pause) I (pause) (sigh) We do what we can do. It is hard being the black sheep. I have actually introduced myself to Dave's great-uncle's daughter's wedding—I guess that is his second cousin? I don't know. The point, though is, it is a wedding, I'm like, "Hi, we're the black sheep of the family. Pretty soon we're going to ask if we can stay at your house and ask to borrow some money." And they are like, "What?" I'm like, "I am just kidding." But the black sheep—being the black sheep is kind of hard, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yes. Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (Pause) Especially when I feel like it is undeserved. (Pause) And I am pretty sure, though I don't really know how to explain this, that (pause) I have definitely gotten the feeling that Dave's other family had chalked up the lack of children thing as, at least in some part, a desire to avoid responsibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it is a little bit. That is why I try and talk about wanting to adopt a lot and Dave talks about it a little bit, but they seem to be like, you know, (pause). They seem to treat it like as a pipe dream for us. But yet, they do reward people who have children. [0:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and I am not entirely sure if I want my kids to ever get in the rat race of competing for attention. (Pause) But it really hurts. It really hurts to have to (pause)—it really hurts to be told that I am broken girl from a broken home and my parents are nuts, I am nuts, all this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it is just—(pause)—I am still seething from the way they dismissed me in saying that my dad was trying to act like he hurt himself more and I was acting—going along with him for attention when, you know, he really did hit himself really hard and [inaudible [00:19:05].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened? [0:19:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, at Dave's graduation he ran into a table or something like that and got the point of the table into basically like right in here and did like a little bone chip that we didn't know that at the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was in a lot of pain and I was fussing over it because I am like, he's been working really hard and all this stuff and there was actually—at the graduation there was somebody who was a physician that saw the whole thing happen. He was like, "Yes, I would stay off of that and that is probably going to swell up like crazy tomorrow." You know? But they didn't think it was that hard of a bump and therefore—because you know, from across the room or whatever was, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am just like, you know, I am just so sick of dialing this down that when it is that kind of—saying that these things are not important—fuck that. That is my dad. He is the person that took care of everybody when he needs to and if he can't walk on that leg, which he will still try to do anyways, you know, and knowing him, he will be just as likely to—if I didn't fuss over him—to say that there is nothing wrong and then quietly drag his leg behind him. [0:20:32]</p>

<p>(Pause) I just resent the fact that they treat my parents so badly. My parents who have only clothed and fed their son and taken care of him for almost all the [inaudible [00:20:45], you know? (Pause) And (pause) just so (pause) I don't know. It is just that I just don't want them in my life anymore. I don't want anything to do with them anymore. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't ask him not to, though. You know? (Pause) But then there is always something in the back of my head saying, "Now, Debra, how in the world—you must be overreacting to this because how could things be that catastrophically bad?" This is not something that almost never—this is not something that is in the bell curve of human behavior. This is not in the—it is not in the standard deviation of things. This is really, really obscure. Therefore, this is probably not true. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is saying that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am saying it in the back of my head. Like you obviously just aren't—you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I do want to. I want to (pause) do that. Mostly because of the fact that it is so hard for people to understand. It is so hard for—I mean it is just so improbable. You know? A girl could only have so many improbable things happen to them before it starts—you start to wonder how much is actually real. You know? Or how much is you are just deciding it that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kind of doubt your own credibility? Yes? (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is just silly, I know. But...it happens. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: For example, like I said, someone who is a licensed, you know, whatever—therapist, whatever, and says things like, "Oh, I think that you are overreacting" or "Dave needs to figure out—he just needs to accept that his mother is never going to be the way he wants her to", that kind of thing. Well, (pause) there is a difference between how much of this is actually reality—there is a difference between accepting it and tolerating being treated badly, though. You know? [0:23:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause) I think this may be another manifestation of your wanting to belong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you would rather doubt yourself and feel crazy or wacky or something than be right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is also—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe not overall, but I think that may be what is happening now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also try and—at least in most of my daily things, try to use Occam's Razor, you know? And it just doesn't fit in there, so you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [0:24:52] </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) It is hard. I mean it just isn't just wanting to belong. It is also the basic tools that I have for understanding most situations aren't working for it, too. You know? That is part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like this doesn't really makes sense any which way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it doesn't really, no. There are lots of things that don't make sense, you know? (Pause) I cannot actually get my head wrapped around most of the feelings and motivations of anyone in that family at all. I have feelings for—I have empathy for most people—people that argue with me, people that are directly opposed to me, I can at least do that. But I cannot understand a single thing about why in the world any of this is happening. [0:26:02]</p>

<p>I feel like because I can't understand it, it doesn't—it can't be right. (Pause) I mean, we often make jokes about the concept of Dave's mother—like there was one period of time where she was actually being kind of nice—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We were like, "Maybe she got shock treatment." (Chuckles) Like that was sort of a joke but it was like, yes there was something—that was the most logical thing we could think of, you know? But (pause) there really isn't—there isn't a way of understanding it. They won't talk about it and they can't understand it and therefore I don't (pause)—I have no way of figuring it out. [0:26:55]</p>

<p>It is like the classical thing of being told that—just be yourself, but you are being yourself, so how am I supposed to act? You know? That doesn't make sense to me. It feels like it is—not really an oxymoron, but two things that are diametrically opposed. You know? (Pause)</p>

<p>And though I have spent many years wanting to belong at this point, if I was actually treated nicely, not on your life. I get a phone call saying, "Hey Debra, we would really like to you to have Dave come home for Christmas, you come home for Christmas" and things like that. Like you would be able to—"I'd like to try to keep in contact with you so we can make plans." No freaking way. I may back down cowardly by saying that neither one of us can go, but not on your life because I know what it is like. It is the most subtle, subtle behavior that is so damn, like horrid, you know? (Pause) And that is the other thing, is that you have to read into literally everything that you see around you to get what the real picture of things are. [0:28:26]</p>

<p>Like it is only when you see—like Dave's parents, the way they speak about his other brothers while they are not in the room, that you have to wonder exactly what in the world they are saying about Dave. You can say, "Oh, well that's different, Dave is the golden boy, blah, blah, blah." No it isn't, because there will be times when they don't call him for weeks, you know? And they talk about him being so troubled, so obviously they are talking about him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, these are very, like I said, very subtle things and you have to be—like I would never want to, as much as I would love to have a family holiday, the concept of going and (pause) and doing any of that—just the sheer concept of the vigilance I would need to do to make sure that nothing bad happened by the time we left? Terrifying! No way. I spent a lot of money and a lot of effort flying down there more than a few times to do that kind of stuff and I am never going to do it again. [0:29:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (pause) I (pause) I (pause) I see it and hear a little bit and I think I hear it in the way that you talk about them. I think it is pretty disconcert—like I can [inaudible [00:29:40] when you talk—and a lot of times you kind of—you like to know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) I don't think it is (pause) arrogance and I don't think it is competitive, but I do think to some extent it is about managing a kind of anxiety or vulnerability that you can feel when you are not sure how things work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is only because of the fact that—because I used to be perfectly okay with a lot of these things. The fact is I have been blindsided by going in there naively. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [0:30:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Without thinking about it—the fact that I had to be careful. I used to very blindly—and every once in a while I used to do this again—I have tried to not be anxious about things and just walk into it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there—I would imagine it is in a pretty different sort of register, but, in other words (pause), like, you know, like that it is pretty clear that I am well-intentioned and so forth, but are there ever things here that I say that blindside you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was one or two things but I don't remember what they are anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was very, very little things—but no, I almost never get this connecting it with anybody else. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like literally anybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have that nervous vigilance in any other situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even have it with Dave's more remote family. Like Dave's grandfather's brother lives in Cincinnati. And his family is obviously further removed—there is fifteen years between the brothers. One of them is 90 now, like and his children and the brother—I mean, that far out, perfectly okay. You know? Randomly, like, you know, people that are further out, perfectly okay. It is just that core group of people that I just—it puts me on edge. I don't feel this way in any other situation. (Pause) I don't feel overconfident in certain situations, but I have never felt like, "Oh, my God, what do I have to do?" And it is so—that is the biggest thing is that it doesn't make any sense to me. It really doesn't. The more I am around them or at least the more I have their influence in my life, the more it bleeds over into the rest of my life. You know? But, like (pause) for the first part, no, it is only when I have been—good example of this—up here they have toll tags up here, too. At one point we lent one—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right—they have what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Toll tags—those things you put in your car for tolls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At one point we lent ours to Dave's sister because they ran out of money and theirs didn't have any—they didn't have a credit card to put it on and all this other stuff. We were going somewhere together and I wanted them to have the ability to have tolls. Well, they gave us back their old one and then kept racking up things on our own. Now that doesn't make sense because if they thought the other one was defunct and there was no money on it, they would have never tried to go through toll booths, you know? And, therefore, it is very obvious that that is what they did. [0:33:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Along with—and this happens with many situations. This is the most obvious one because I still have the records from it. I couldn't figure out who was racking up things because we were with the one that didn't work. In Miami they have their own separate one. And so I had, only after having things like that happen, have I thought to myself, "Okay, when I hand something to somebody, I need to make sure I get my own X back." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I hand—even just, you know, like something that is valuable, I need to check and make sure it is really mine. But that is only after a series of being screwed like that. And—but for the most part, I have handed—like this weekend, somebody's wife I have actually never met wanted to go out and get some juice and things like that for mixers. She realized that after charging too many things from out of state—she is from the other coast—her credit card went [snapping sound] and it was in the middle of the night, couldn't make phone calls. So I am like, "Here, just take mine." Okay, really should I bring a receipt? Sure if you want to, but really, honestly, it is going to be less than 50 bucks, yes, just do it. I am never that flippant about money except this was a very special weekend. [0:35:05]</p>

<p>But somebody I have never met in my life—here is my credit card. Would I ever do that with my sister-in-law? Not in your fucking life. You know? And I would probably, if I had to give it to her for something, like I was in an accident and I needed her to go pick up my medication or something like that, I would carefully check the online charges between one and the other and see if something else got in the way, like in the middle of it. That is really—they are the only ones that I feel this way about. (Pause) That itself, to me, makes me think that maybe I am not crazy. Like this is not like me just mistrusting or me misjudging things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It does make me wary, though, occasionally feeling, in certain situations, so comfortable that I want to be myself. It is very—not very much, but it is very specific things. Like the point at which I realize I am trying to decide if inviting myself to do something is okay—that kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [0:36:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually, right now, I usually—I use humor in almost everything that I do to deflect from things I am anxious about. So I will be like, "Yes, I am totally inviting myself to your dinner party. I hope you know that I may be a giant pain in the ass about it, but I bring a good wine." [Chuckles] Like that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:36:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is usu—I only do that when I know that I am sort of invited anyways, but I still feel like I need to say it because, you know. Whatever, but that is—you know, it is hard. It is hard not being part of the family. Dave refers to his dad as "Uncle" sometimes. His dad is trying at least, now, because of the H-bomb—the H-word, things like that. He is actually trying now, sort of. Really we are just in their minds a couple of kids which just can't grow the fuck up and spend all their time in academia, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In this fantasy land of research and stuff. And now they can't even own a car. For years they didn't own a car and now they don't own a car again, you know? They don't own a house and they don't, you know...(pause) Spend too much on vacations, I guess. I don't know, which is really funny because we don't. But it is very easy to have that perception. I feel like, you know...(pause) It is hard. It is really hard. So, and I know you make your family—not necessarily—sometimes you can find other people and we do that as well, but at the same time, people who are not related to you are not the people who usually—and I guess bringing this back to—the people who make your funeral arrangements. I mean, they are not those people, you know? They are not the people who do this or do that. [0:38:28]</p>

<p>And (pause)...It creeps me out how normal they think their behavior is. That basically if someone is not immediately in front of you all the time, it is almost like they don't exist. That is what they have been doing with Dave since he was 18 years old. And (pause) they do it with other people too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing [00:39:16] you are kind of incredulous as well as—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am incredulous that this could be like a whole family phenomenon—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uncomprehending—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like this whole mass hysteria concept of—that a group of people could all together have the same warped—I'm incredulous—I believe it, but I am almost incredulous that more than one person could have these same deeply fucked up beliefs of being very solipsist and very like this and very that. You know what I mean? [0:39:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like how in the world could this—first of all, how does this all work in a family? Don't they all fight over things? You know what I mean? It is all—it doesn't (pause) I always thought that people behaving like this, like literally, this kind of stuff is mentally unwell. I don't understand how these people could all be mentally unwell in the same way. It is—even with the divorce and two people that are far away that haven't seen each other in decades still have the same core beliefs and think that Dave is a big sissy, you know? (Pause) He is not a big sissy. This guy has a lot of weight to bear and they have never seen his measure. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) They (pause) Yes—they just never saw it. They just disbelieve that any of this stuff is important or true. Like for some reason having brain malformations and things like that are, like, okay. Today he was seeing an ENT or an ear infection. He was like, "Yes, you've got this strange bulge in your neck." And Dave is like, "Yes, that is just a Chiari Malformation [ph0:41:34]." This and that and he's like, "Yes, I still want a neck CT because I am not sure if this is still a Chiari 1 at this point if you can actually see that part." And he is like, "Okay, whatever." Like most people would be having a freaking panic attack if they thought their brain stem was descending into their neck. They have taught him to think, "Eh, that's okay."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [0:42:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so if he does panic, he's just being a wuss. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so he is—it is so hard because (pause) I see—and this is the reason why I both want to and don't want to have relationships with my nieces and nephews—I see this pattern going all over again. And the more and more I hear about it—I mean, part of it you have to take with a grain of salt because you are hearing it from other people. But they were bragging about it being funny that an eight-year-old boy looks to his six-year-old sister to ask how he feels about situations. That is fucking creepy. Like, you know, to me that sounds—I can't even imagine—I know I was friends with more eight-year-old boys than I was ever with six-year-old girls at any age. And I can't imagine any one of them saying something like, "Do I want this? Do I like this? Can you tell me what to do?" That is so screwed up. And I know that he had a huge, huge delay in speaking. They actually did all this testing and just found out that he couldn't get a word in edgewise, apparently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That is what you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like once one of the kids went off to school, he was actually talking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [0:43:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they think it is—I mean, they talk about it being painfully adorable that this stuff is happening. That is—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think I want my kids to have anything to do with that? Even if they do have a little bit of shyness in them or maybe they aren't so good at cooking, do you think I want them to be told about how when they were nine—again as full adults—about making fun of them about not being able to make eggs? No! </p>

<p>I am not saying that you should not have a little bit of that. My parents, still to this day, love telling how I thought the song, "Crocodile Rock", these background singers were actual crocodiles. They sounded like crocodiles and I was very little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your parents aren't mean-spirited. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, they don't. But my dad is also the person who runs around telling everybody that his daughter read at 18 months, too, which is a wild misconception of reading.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—if you play by his—he is not lying. If you play by his rules of what he considers to be reading, yes. I call it iconerate [ph [00:44:40]—he has used the word iconerate now—there were certain symbols that meant words, yes. That is not reading. But to him, "My daughter read at 18 months. And she started speaking in full sentences." Yes. Not really. Like accidentally putting a subject and a predicate together doesn't mean you are speaking in full sentences. Yes. But—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know what? Honestly, though, he has got so much pride about it. And occasionally you tell an embarrassing story and that is okay. But that is all they got. They teased him when he was going through puberty, they teased him for everything that they could ever have. Like—and this is my super irrational belief, but I don't (pause) they have no idea why doesn't make enough whatever the precursor is to testosterone. They have no idea. There is no good reason at this point. They don't know anything about it and at this point I am starting to wonder if his body just down-regulated it so he could keep in that family and be happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or survive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, survive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll be back on Tuesday then.</p>

<p><b>Interview with Scott Browning</b></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> <i>Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</i></p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>I work utilizing the Common Factors of Family Therapy. This approach is helpful in that it satisfies the criteria of Evidence Supported Psychotherapy, while being flexible to adjust to changing family needs. I am a family systems therapist. My primary frame is to offer exceptional empathy to a system. Each person is worthy of your complete interest. I don't try to manipulate, but rather I look for every opportunity to teach, offer acceptance, discuss positive intensions, reframe perceptions (when equally accurate) and to assist the people in the system to try new behaviors.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Will you provide a brief description of your training and background?</p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>I have had diverse training. I started as Adlerian, moved toward CBT, then Psychodynamic, and finally into Systems. I was trained in Milan Team therapy, and Strategic, particularly MRI. But, I did my post-doc during the waning days of Philadelphia Child Guidance, so I will alwaysappreciate Structural Therapy. I was trained by Robert-Jay Green andMary Herget at the Redwood Center in Berkeley, California. I was then an intern at the Brief Therapy Unit at Kaiser Pleasanton. We served as the first Manage Care laboratory, in that the practical application of MRI (Strategic therapy) was started at this sight. Every single session was observed by someone within the units clinical team. I then moved on to Philadelphia. Once I became a professor, I learned to enjoy all the theories for what they are worth. Each approach has some modicum of genius (sometimes a lot), but even the model that interests you the least has some aspect that is either a shared intervention or philosophy.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers? </p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>This family is about as interesting as it gets. My original client is on the autism spectrum. He would be diagnosed at Level 1 on the new DSM 5; in other words, he's very high functioning. He is in a loving family that has three other siblings. The other siblings are successful to some degree, but one sibling is now dealing with mental health issues that are difficult. The family went from riches to rags. The economic turmoil hit them hard and they are trying to figure out how to help their son who is not in therapy. They are dealing with physical impairments, substance use, couple's issues and remaining a loving family. It is an honor to work with them.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> What was your goal or hope for the sessions? </p>  <p><b>Browning:</b> <i>My hope is that it becomes clear that, at times, clinical success is about staying afloat, still loving life, having a good family, and reducing the suffering of yourself and your family. This is such a case. I also remain committed to the young man on the spectrum. It is easy for the voices of those with disabilities to be over-shadowed, and I believe the clinician serves as one to keep each perspective heard.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions? </p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>Jon, I think that the question of success is very interesting. It can be a more complex issue when doing family therapy. Sometimes it is obvious, the affair ends and the couple really work it out. The high school kid is less depressed, improving social and academic life. Sometimes the whole family is now able to work together, with a reduced tension and more love. But, systemic therapists have to deal with reality. One subsystem may improve a great deal, while some others do not. Sometimes everyone gets better, but not always. But, is that a failure, if only some people are much happier and healthy. The issue of number of sessions is also variable. Therapy can work in one session. There are cases where a little nudge, such as one really appropriate reframe, simply assist the family in understanding situation and they start perceiving the situation differently. Usually you need enough time to see all those involved and get people talking. This can be 6-10 sessions, often. But, 20% of cases are simply much better off with less frequent therapy, but one that goes for years.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?</p>

<p><b>Browning</b>: <i>Yes, in listening to the session, I know when I am making progress, and when I am stalled. But, with a story this complex, just being there with them and offering a reality check quickly, is very comforting to them. The husband begins to panic at times, and when he sees that his escapist position is not helpful, I know that I am making progress. In regard to "bumps" in treatment, there is a couple to note. There were times when the son was better served remaining in the room with his parents, while at other times; he did not need to be part of the emotional build-up. The wife's drinking is also controversial. On one hand, she benefits from AA meetings when her drinking was out-of-control, but, in general, she does not exhibit true addiction. Therefore, one bump came when the husband did not feel supported enough in his concern about her drinking.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care? </p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>This is a case that I have seen for fifteen years. I was referred the child, he was not yet diagnosed. I recognized that he matched the description of Asperger's Disorder. I saw the whole family from the beginning. I did not see the other three children a lot, but they came in for sessions every one and awhile. I saw them for two years. Then it was very rare to get together, mainly as a checkup. Then the family let the area. I kept in touch by SKYPE, but have not charged from that point forward. ï¿½I started seeing them in person, again, about six months ago. But the therapy you hear from me is the way I do therapy. I am not this informal if I don't know people. But once I have seen a family for any period of time, I am your friendly psychological consultant. I am running short experiments, connecting though empathy and looking for places where miscommunication or misperception is making healthy family functioning difficult. I work primarily in the present, but I will certainly look at how history is influencing the present.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</p>

<p><b>Browning:</b> <i>Well, I would like to offer an update. The other brother who struggles the most with mental health issues continues to reject attending treatment with anyone, but on the positive side, is not as untethered. He is still wrestling with "demons," so to speak, but his relations with his family are less stressful. The couple remains in love. Drinking has become less of a hot-button issue. My original client is productive in a creative activity. And finally, the family would still clearly be described as, "loving and supportive."</i></p>

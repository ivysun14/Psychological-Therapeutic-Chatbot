<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you doin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm doin good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Done with school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's that feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's pretty nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what's going, what's happening next?  Do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, hopefully moving back to [DEIDENTIFIED] pretty soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any ideas when you might be moving or do you not know yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how'd you do in school this semester?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did pretty good.  I only got one F in, which is caused by just some essays.  But I got Bs and Cs in the rest of my classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay great.  So, good you're getting credit for all your work then.  And so you think you might move back this summer before school starts the fall or do you know for sure about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay. [NAME OTHER], do you know any time frames or you just not know at this point?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, we're just waiting on his mom to make a decision.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  D, uh, as to if or not, it's okay for just move back or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If she's in a position to bring him back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And if she is then [PATIENT NAME] moves back and if she not right now, you'll stay for a while longer here?  Is that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any plans for the summer right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just kinda hanging out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, how's your mood been overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Had it been, have you had periods of feeling real up or down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or has it been pretty low, both?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and how long do the mood swings last?  Like the up swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About like, I don't know, like it'd be a whole day or like till the next day when I wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So about a day or less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and what about the downs, how long do those last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's not really bad, right?  Like the last time we were here, we were discussing this.  Has anything changed since?  Cause we were, are we here, because you were trying to decide if you wanted to start back on medications or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know why I'm here right now, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well there was a reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just, I'm gonna schedule another appointment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but when were here last time, you were kinda talking about how you're thinking, getting back on the medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, about what [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	About getting back on medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, cause last time when we met you'd stopped the medicines.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we were gonna see, I think, how you were doin off of em, if things were goin okay or not for ya.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you had agreed to it.  I think you, kind of, forgotten how, how the appointment went last time and why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was gonna come back here—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think basically we're following just to see if you're doin okay off the medicines, or if you felt like things were getting rocky or bumpy or, and you wanted ta reconsider that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's rocky, it's bumpy, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause you were questioning it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I kinda don't like being on meds, but I'm kinda, I don't know, I have mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could, I could really feel ups and downs and down, really down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things that trigger me, I could just tell right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So [PATIENT NAME], are the mood swings, um, something, that if you felt you didn't, if they continued at the level they're at now, would they be tolerable and okay or are they pretty uncomfortable then with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you sleeping well at night, or you having trouble sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, having trouble sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do wake up during the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, naw I just don't get enough sleep anymore.  I don't know what's wrong with my sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're able to get to sleep and stay a sleep, but when you wake up you don't feel rested?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah I just, kinda just, feel like crap sometimes or feel really good.  But it's like I wake up either in a bad mood or a good mood.  And then it kinda like, continues on like that through my day, unless somethin good happens to trigger me to be happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how's your energy level during the day?  You feel like you have enough or you tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I have, I have energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have just the right amount or do you have too much?  Like where you can't sit still.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, just right amount.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, ah, it's kinda, and I haven't been eatin lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You haven't been as hungry lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How bout your ability to stay focussed on something, is it difficult or is it pretty easy to stay focussed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's still easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, do you find yourself feeling anxious or nervous much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About anything particular, er, just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My legs have been really messin me up lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's wrong with your legs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm like, my legs have just been like shaking a lot this past week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like restless leg syndrome or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where you just have to keep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have in our family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like you have to keep movin your legs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have to like, keep like, tryin to crack my toes and extend my calfs and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It usually happens when I'm like, getting like, a bad mood or it has something, I just feel it in my legs and my emotions, and my feelings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about, are you doin anything for fun this summer?  Are you seein any friends er—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, every day pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you enjoy getting together with em or no, just uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have you had any down days, where you had any thoughts of not wanting to live?  Have thoughts of taking your own life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, what about the pot, you still smoking some?  How often on average do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And after you smoke do you feel, does your mood change?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, actually centers me.  Feel much better and I can do what I need to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay so you feel more centered after smoking then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't do it to medicate myself, I do it pretty much to just relax and enjoy myself.  To feel a little better than normally, but I do not do it to make myself feel better to withstand my daily life.  Not withstand it ta, what's the word, to get through my day.  I don't do it, I don't do it to get through my day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't feel like you need it to get through the day like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but if it's around I do it and I just enjoy it and feel good to know what I'm doin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and, and tell me again, what's, what do you like about it the most?  You enjoy it because it does what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just feels good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just feels good, just the high you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel centered, uh, more happy.  Actually, can like hear better and pay attention a little better too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Are you doing anything else besides the weed right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Um, what about over this summer, do you have any plans?  Are you gonna get a job, or anything, or do summer school, or just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really don't know yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not sure, okay.  This, uh, will probably depend on where you live.  If you're gonna be here or in [DEIDENTIFIED], huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, what about, drink any alcohol and, over the summer?  Okay.  What about stress, any major things weighing on your stressing right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very much.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, well do you know [NAME OTHER] she, we'll have a call every night—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	For, his grandpa got a DUI.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that's really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Been a lotta, a lot of stress on the family all of a sudden.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What kind of stress do you mean?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Something else we have to deal with and he, cause he's been like, starting immediately taken off the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Dentist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not even what I'm stressed about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just the family's a piece of shit right now.  So I'm just like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well that's part of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of conflict you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everyone.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's always, I mean if you have a problem with me, I think you'd say you have a problem with me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a problem with everybody in the family.  Somewhere, some way or another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So just conflict that you feel like continuing with other people in the family, you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He doesn't fight with anyone.  It's not that kind of conflict.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just getting angry or upset with people?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He doesn't even get angry or upset with anyone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just leave the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you would go—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do my own thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I can't, I can't be at home when grandpa's, my grandpa's at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just cannot be around—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause what happens if you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's just a cru, grumpy old man, and I just wanna punch him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just get upset with him and when—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We all do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just leave then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The same things with my grandma too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She wants—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They really annoy me and I just wanna leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just try to go stay with your friends a lot and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And then also, other people in the house.  Well not really them, they just came back, but use to be that with [NAME OTHER] but she moved out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you just go over to a friend's house or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Na, I just walk around and go and be outside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And [PATIENT NAME], are you [AGE] now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Do you have your driver's permit yet, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet, okay.  Is that something you're wanting to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if I could do it out here since I might be moving back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So another thing you're putting on hold until you know where you live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any other stresses right now or things weighing on ya?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School, well pretty much, they all know what's gonna happen to me if I move back to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Cause I mean, knowin my mom or my family in [DEIDENTIFIED], it always goes bad [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my mom's a nanny and like, just like something to do, her job we'll go on right.  And the money will come in, like the flow evenly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She can't pay off certain things and she'll run to dad so she'll pay off other things and it'll kind of, just fall apart like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, money problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now are you gonna be a junior next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got two more years of high school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what you wanna do after high school yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not a single thing.  I have not, I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not sure if you wanna get a job, or go to college either, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You think you wanna move outa, move out on your own?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Is there anything else that's goin on you think's important, for us to talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no nothing really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can't think of anything—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just same old stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry what [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just the same old stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that seems kind of stress is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope, I hope I'm talking loud enough for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah you're doin fine.  Don't worry about that at all.  Um, [NAME OTHER], what's your feedback?  How do you think [PATIENT NAME] doin overall?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think he's reacting with what is going on in the family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and reacting—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what way?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In, um, how, how, how do I say that?  Um, he wants out of the house all the time, because of his problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then I think we, we have problems because, like we were discussing on the way here, I just let it go.  I'm letting everything go.  When you have an alcoholic in the family, you just kind of, just like put your head down and not pay attention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then when I do start paying attention, I'll call him on something and he thinks, because I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some days my grandma will be like, normal outa no where, but then she'll be like, like a stern woman, like, "Eh, eh, eh!"  Like, outa no where.  Even my friends are like, "Dude your grandma freaked out."  Like you, sort of like these swings of just like, attacking you about everything.  And you're just like, "Stop!"  And you'll just, you'll like, she'll ride you all day about it.  And then she'll call you and ride you more.  And the next day she'll be normal.  But then the next day she'll do it again about everything.  And she'll do that to everyone in the family.  Ride [NAME OTHER] and, and [NAME OTHER], and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, and too, if I guess, you know parents or grandparents have their days where they're, sometimes wanting [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's not even like, she's just riding you.  She's like, like changes and like starts getting nagging, not nagging, just like different.  And start talking about every little problem about you, "And what are you gonna do with your life?"  And then it goes around the bigger picture and then she'll talk, "I want everything else."  You're just like, "Whoa, I don't have time for this."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that really gets to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What we had discussed and why that needs to change, is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, then your solution's [INAUDIBLE], I'll just start nagging you twenty four, seven, instead of acting normal.  I'm like, "No, you could just come and approach me differently, than acting like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I'm not acting like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	An asshole.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A normal proper, parent though.  But ignoring everything that's going on in the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	House—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not ignoring everything.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But that's what I've been doing and then when I decide that things are outa control—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] cause you're never home.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, I run away from the house as much as you do.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only run away from the house when parents aren't home, when the parents are home.  Otherwise when you and grandpa are home, I'm not home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I guess one of the things we gotta try and figure out [PATIENT NAME], you know, how much the mood swings are related to maybe, to Bipolar disorder.  How much is related to stress.  How much are affected by, you know, the marijuana and there are a lot of variables in your life right now.  The uncertainty of moving back to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean, you got a lot of things happening in your life.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a lot of stress right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and you know, life these days, it's really stressful for a lot of people.  More than, more than usual.  I mean, with the economy bein bad, a lot of people losing their jobs, people losin their houses.  People can't afford groceries you know, I mean, life is a little more stressful than it's been in the past, you know.  Even three or four years ago and it's effecting people differently.  Because the key is you know, how do ya, how do ya deal with it?  I mean, what do ya, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like, I take my medication and that helps me deal with the problems.  If you took a mood stabilizer, an antidepressant, you'd probably still want to be outa the house and still want to be very happy and stuff.  But would you be able to deal with it.  Like [NAME OTHER] takes her medication and so does [NAME OTHER], we've all learned that we can deal with stuff better.  And do you think that would do it for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I just don't really like taking pills.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We didn't, we don't either.  We hate them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's one of those hard things, you'll s, I guess the, [PATIENT NAME] I can understand, I don't like takin pills either, um, and I don't like to wear glasses.  But I, I've learned that if I don't wear glasses, I can't read.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can't see my kids faces very well.  With my glasses, I can see my kids and I can read.  It's a pain to wear em, but, uh, for me they're necessary.  That's just my eyes.  Um, and I with medicine, I don't wanna take it either, but if I get sick sometimes I have to or else I don't do well.  So, and I'm not trying to push the medicine on you, because I'm not even sure it's gonna work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause if you still keep smoking weed and takin the medicine they don't work together.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then you have to worry about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so it's another thing we gotta think about if you were, were goin on medicine.  You probably have to stop the weed for a while to see if the medicine is working.  Otherwise, you really can't, it's hard to tell if it's doing what it's suppose to do.  So, I guess, one of the things to think about is, do you wanna stop the weed for a while and try the medicine to see if it would level things off a little bit for ya.  Like your grandma said, it's not gonna make you stay home if there's tension at home, you're still gonna wanna hang out with your friends.  But it might, buffer you a little bit, so the stress at home doesn't affect you as much.  That's what it might so.  That's what hopefully it could do.  Just so the mood swings wouldn't be as intense.  You'd still feel happy if something good happens, sad if somthin sad happens.  How do you feel about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you remember when you were on medication before January?  If you were handling things better or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wasn't any better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause, I think that you did like being on the medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was so hard for me to take that Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, just something else to think about.  You don't have to go back on Seroquel.  And if, you know if there's something else that might work as well or better, we can discuss other possibilities too.  You know there are probably ten or twelve different mood stabilizers that we could look at, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But [NAME OTHER] takes, um, Topamax cause that's better for her and it didn't work, now [NAME OTHER] it didn't work for her.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I guess, you know, the first question to think about is how do you feel about medicine just in general.  I mean, are you completely against it and don't even want to think about it or is it somthin you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, are, tell you the truth the way I think about it is that, I don't, I, I believe, I think the way you put it, is I smoke weed to, to get rid of [INAUDIBLE] things?  Cause you said instead of smo, using the pill you'd, instead of smoking you'd take pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the reason for that is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause it interferes with the pill, so, um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, and you said you don't like pills, but I'm sorry, but smoking marijuana, even though it's a plant that grows in the ground, it's still, you're still the same concept.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm more familiar with that then some unknown pill that changes my mind.  But when I only smoke, I don't smoke to medicate, I just do it for fun.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you're still—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm still, I'm still sober most of the time.  And I'm still doin fine and, but I'm still havin a problem lettin them do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, but you're against pills, then you would be against marijuana then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because it's still, kinda in the same—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well [NAME OTHER], what I hear a lot of kids saying is they see them differently.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They see marijuana as a natural plant, where as pills are synthetic.  And therefore, kids feel, some kids—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some kids feel like it's [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't look at it like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not the same thing at all really.  It's just two different types of chemicals.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know on what weed does to me, I've been doing it for years.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then you do your research on medication that could probably help you then.  If you did your research on marijuana, which there's tons of books in the house all about it.  Then you should do the same research on the medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and just the one thing I would caution ya about marijuana, is that, um, there are short term affects and long term affects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, the long term affects to be aware of are, over time, and I've seen this happen with people over the years, is that it can, um, decrease motivation for one thing.  It can start to interfere with positive function thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And even speech over time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've seen people that get to the point where they can't form a sentence cause they're smoking daily.  And, and I think you probably got started too, but the active ingredient in marijuana, THC, does fill up your system over time, gets stored in the fat cells.  So even if people stop smoking for several weeks, they can still have it in their system and still may be affecting them in ways they're not aware of because they're not smoking it daily, but it's still in there.  So, just something, I want you to have as much information as possible to make a more efficient—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we've talked about this plenty of times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, I don't really know, what to do.  Like about this situation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're talking about being Bipolar.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know and like medication.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Look [NAME OTHER] the thing I'm aware of is if [PATIENT NAME] is having some mixed feels about this.  This is what I'm hearing, I, I think you know even if I prescribed the medicine for, for him.  Would he take it consistently, which is what he'd have to do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And would he be willing to stop marijuana to give the medicine a chance to work.  What I think I hear, seeing right now [PATIENT NAME], is you're not sure or certain you wanna do that right now.  Is that right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what, and that's where we were last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Was at first he was like, "No."  And then after he'd got to talking, he realized maybe it would help.  And then you were gonna give him a month to see what he thought.  And so we're kinda, back again to where you're not really sure—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess I should take a medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and another possibility, [PATIENT NAME], is you could try something different for like a month and see if it helps.  See if you find it helpful.  If you do you can stick with it.  If you don't you don't have to stick with it.  We should know within a month or so, depending on what we choose.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And are you willing not to smoke marijuana.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the thing, also.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then you should really talk to, I mean if you wanna talk to me, talk to [NAME OTHER], talk to [NAME OTHER].  They're all Bipolar and they all take the medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they know what it's like to be on it and without it, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You guys are so much different than me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In what way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You want you, [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], all of you, all your daughters and you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have like way stronger, like reactions to things than I do.  Like you guys are like, like change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME] you know, the other thing—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing about like Bipolar disorder is it's not the same for everybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a, they call it Bipolar spectrum.  Now some people have real mild symptoms, some people have severe, some people have rapid mood swings, some people have long mood swings.  So you're right everybody is unique.  And the key, I think for you and your life, whether it's here, whether it's [DEIDENTIFIED], whether it's medicine, not medicine.  Is to find what works for you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can, you know be happy and be successful in your life.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But then he hasn't seen me.  He wasn't around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've seen you on your meds.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wait.  When, when?  I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have, when, when I'm, when I first moved here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, when you were little?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, when I like, first moved here.  I know how you were like, you missed out on some of your pills before.  I just know, I've seen you without your medication—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME], once again, what's important, I think, is for you to decide what you want, cause, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wanna mood stabilizer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I know we'll have a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, then you can talk—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Can he take it with, your stabilizer with out antidepressant?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Many people do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, but [INAUDIBLE] today.  [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] and I have been talking and they, um, okay, [NAME OTHER] says she can't take, she has to take, she has to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that's what you have to work out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's due to [INAUDIBLE], yeah some just take a mood stabilizer, some need a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's different for everyone.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what we could do though, we shouldn't start an antidepressant first without a mood stabilizer.  We can start him on a stabilizer without an antidepressant and see if you feel better [PATIENT NAME].  And if you do, great.  And if the mood stabilizer you know, controls the highs, but not the lows, then some people add an antidepressant to prevent the lows as well.  So those are the, get all the options.  So let me talk to you about some different mood stabilizers then.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What does he get on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we can try the Seroquel, um, we try Depakote.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't think nobody likes Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, there's another one that's, I don't think you've ever tried Abilify, have you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abilify is a good stabilizer that works really well among teenagers, um, cause it doesn't cause sedation or drowsiness.  The Seroquel can, some people doesn't tend to cause, some people gain weight on Seroquel.  With Abilify it's very rare.  It doesn't tend to be, um, sedating generally.  It's a real, it's, um, I see the side effects are much milder if there are any.  Some people don't have any.  A lot of teenagers really do well with it, uh, it can help reduce irritability as well as stabilize mood.  It's also used sometimes to boost the effectiveness of antidepressants.  It can make em work even better if you're on antidepressant.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is Abilify in the same family as [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's a distant cousin of Seroquel's in that same general family called [INAUDIBLE] so it's very different from Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and the nice thing about it is you don't have to have blood tests, like you do with Depakote.  There's no risk of, no organ problems or anything like that.  Just take the medicine and try it if it works, great.  If it doesn't, you know, we stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sounds cool [INAUDIBLE] results I'm worried about.  Can I take it in the morning?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, you can.  You can take it any time of day.  Some people get a little energized with it.  If that's the case, you definitely want to take it in the morning.  If it makes you a little tired, which occasionally it can, some people.  But you can switch and take it at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it, so I guess I have to look it up myself, but between Neurontin and, I'm sorry what'd you call it?  Bili, Abil—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abilify.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause the Neurontin, I take it at night, it put's me to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This one must be a totally different chemical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's totally different than Neurontin, yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, like I said some people get increase energy with it.  Some people get a decrease, not usually huge either direction.  Most people don't notice a big bump of energy either way.  But if it goes up you take it in the morning.  If it goes down you take it at night.  Otherwise you can take it whenever you want during the day.  Yeah, it usually takes about a week or so, to kick in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then we give it about four weeks and see if it's working.  If it is, great, if not we can adjust the dose.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And is it like, my daughters and I can, um, blah, they have to eventually, very slowly get it into your system like the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you mean increase the dose?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, right, right [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not necessarily.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes, if you know, we'll probably start ya out at like 5 mgs a day, a small dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For some people that's enough it wouldn't have to go up.  If it isn't working or it's only working a little bit, we can go up higher to 10 or 15 if we need to.  But there's not a big adjustment dose usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that sound like something you do want to try it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see if it helps?  And like I said, if you don't like it or have any side effects you don't like, just stop and call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or call me first, cause I may be able to get rid of the side effects.  But if we can't we'll just stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But usually people who have side effects, it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it's not something, where if you suddenly stop it, you have side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you can stop it any time that you need to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd ask you to let me know if you're going to stop it, just so I know what's goin on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  It's almost like an antidepressant where you can take it as needed?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it has to be taken daily cause it has to build up in your system.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For it to work.  But let's try it and see.  Um, if you read the product insert with the junk that comes from the pharmacy, it'll talk about things like, you might gain weight or it could lead to diabetes or things like that.  I haven't seen it on Abilify.  Other medicines like Seroquel, and higher doses can cause that kind of problem.  But with Abilify, I haven't seen that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So let's try it and see, if that's all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any questions about that at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's see, if you try it and have any questions what so ever, please call me.  Okay?  Or any side effects, I don't think you will.  But if you do, you know we can cut the dose, or adjust the timing.  We can do lots of things to make it so you don't have the side effects or problems with it.  Let's see.  So let's try that and then you set up an appointment and come back in about four weeks.  Does that sound okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] are you okay with that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see where that'll put us.  That'll put us around the end of June.  Is there a time of day that works best?  Morning or afternoon?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Late afternoon [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, some options then would be, we could meet like on [DATE], the 3:30 is one option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay with you [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And I'm thinkin, uh, you need to schedule a twenty minute appointment or longer appointment.  [INAUDIBLE] otherwise, maybe one more time might've been helpful.  Do you have a preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you guys think?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't I schedule more time so we can have it if we need it.  Excuse me one second.  Okay, I'll call the person back.  Why don't, would 3:00 do okay, [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's do 3:00 so we'll have more time if we need it.  Okay.  That's [DATE], 3 PM.  All right gimme a call [PATIENT NAME] or grandma call if you have any problems or questions, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, do you have any questions about this at all?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Let's give it a try.  There's the card.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, take it easy.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.  Take it easy [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  See you in about a month.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Bye, bye.</p>

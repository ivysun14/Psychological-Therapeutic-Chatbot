<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I looked at my calendar and it was 3:30 and I was like oh my gosh I am 30 minutes late, but I'm here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're here and I wish that you were right. I wish that you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. But I'm glad that I'm here because I can speak fast. But essentially what's going on so summer school officially finished and it was actually a really good experience teaching. And I saw that I could type up like 10, 11 pages, of course with some illustration, but I typed those up every week on top of doing tutoring and whatnot. So I really saw that wait if I did that in seven weeks a PhD is only like 150 pages or it doesn't really have any page length but it is double spaced too. And I was like well I just need to start typing and getting busy. In one of my reviews I would just with the equations, and then doing the math, and writing about it. I was just like okay this was really a good sort of warm up to using Law Tech or using the program to write up the PhD. [00:01:21]</p>

<p>And tutoring with students well there's a little bit of I wouldn't say drama it was more like sort of... Well in one aspect there are these two girls that one of the girls she was, I guess, very dramatic and she's like I'm so stressed. I need to be tutored three times a week so I counseled other possible students to be tutor for her and she didn't show up. She didn't show up, and she didn't tell me, and she was like oh well I wasn't ready for the tutoring appointment, or she was like I'm so absorbed in the material. You know it was fine once, maybe twice, but then it would be like an hour before oh I can't make it. And they teamed with another girl and they would never pay me on time. And eventually they were supposed to pay me $20.00 this week for a session that I did on Saturday. They're like oh are you going to be on campus today? I said, "No, you can just mail it." And one of the girls was like I'm going to be graduate student, and I'll just be around the corner so we can just meet up. I was like okay fine. [00:02:33]</p>

<p>I probably won't meet up. It's not worth the $20.00 from here. I'm hoping the other girl mails it, but it's just sort of like... I guess I learned my lesson that you can't let people get away with things. As much as you want to they will take advantage of you and everyone else had to pay up front. If not it was a special circumstance like oh I will definitely pay you. I'll see you in two days, I'll pay you this. So I've just sort of had my anguish and I saw that instead of being passive, aggressive and make statements I should've been just more assertive. What they did that was not fair and it wasn't fair to others. [00:03:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. They took advantage of your time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they did. So I just really... Yeah, that's exactly it because I would cancel my dance classes for them and do like 6:00 to 8:00 and we'd wind up going from 6:00 to 8:30, and I didn't get comped for that. So much of my life was put aside for them but I just started to realize I just don't want to chase them down for money. I'm not a tax collector. And I just learned my lesson and I think that was a good lesson; a $40.00 lesson at that but that's why company's say you have to pay up front. [00:04:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's the money and also I mean you didn't just lose the money if they don't pay you but the things that you give up you're canceling your dance classes; things that you wanted to do or time that you could've spent doing other things that were...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Quilting, seeing my boyfriend. Yeah. I guess that's why... It isn't exactly... Like some students I stay overtime and they're like oh I need to pay you more. I'd be like no, no, no, no we were just talking and discussing because they were really there, they were engaged, they always paid up front. I guess I developed a respectful relationship. One of the guys actually he was my age and he lives around Jeremy's neighborhood, and I had met him three months ago on the bus, and I remember talking to him. But anyway he's a really nice guy. By tutor his scores really improved. I even started to not get a crush on him but I guess it is kind of like it's not like an active crush but I did - he was cute. He was funny. He was really like - it was kind of like an intellectual sort of thing. I mean I don't know how he is. I don't know how he spends his time. I don't know about his values or anything. [00:05:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you liked the attraction the effect you saw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I felt myself like one time we went to get coffee and he bought me an iced coffee because I was running late. I didn't pay him back and I was like oh no I'm a horrible person. Maybe that led him on. I don't... He said I'll buy it as a coffee so don't worry about it. But I remembered like my mom's like a man gives you a gift and he expects something back. But he knew about my boyfriend. He knew that we were moving in. He was just a really nice guy. And I guess it's kind of strange... I don't know why I would have this sort of side like I'm really interested in Jeremy. I adore him. He adores me except when it involved moving which I'll explain in a second. He's a really good guy, and I don't know why I would get feelings. I guess that's a romantic comedy or whatever sort of movie is that you just... [00:06:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's so cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess we all have emotions but we don't always act on our emotions. I felt really guilty because I don't know. I guess I don't want it to happen like I did with my last boyfriend, but in a sense it was a different circumstance. It was because I was not being treated right. And I did want to feel loved and accepted, and I guess I didn't respect him either because he didn't respect me. And I know that if Jeremy cheated on me I'd be very upset and sad. And I guess that's one thing I have to remember sort of Nietzsche's principles of morals. [00:07:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you cheated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was still dating my boyfriend back then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you cheated on Jeremy by having a crush?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel kind of - I mean I thought about kissing him but a thought if I wasn't with a boyfriend you know just like that. You know how guy's get thoughts of girls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a fantasy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did. I felt really guilty. I felt like that was cheating because what happens - I shouldn't have those feelings. I don't know. I just didn't have fantasies very often. I don't know why then. But I guess I can see... I feel like a little bit... It's interesting I still have I think it's the antidepressants that just makes me not able to have an orgasm but I can see that I'm more interested in sex. I just can't fully cum and I think that's one thing as the year rolls around and I feel more comfortable to lower the antidepressant just a little bit. I mean I can make myself cum and I don't know if that's just something but that requires work and concentration, and I know that most people don't have that problem. But I am feeling more open around Jeremy. [00:09:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something that you could have him do differently that would change it because it sounds like physiologically it's possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so and I think I'll probably just have to talk to him about that. That's part of being more assertive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And being able to tell him what works even if that's introducing something that's not currently part of your sex life. And it's a lower risk way of being able to have an orgasm with him than going off your meds since the meds serve a function.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they do. And you're right I can definitely take matters into my own hands very proficiently and have multiple orgasms at once. But I guess maybe that's something that I need to talk to him about. [00:10:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering if partly does it feel like it's something physical that he's not doing what works for you or is it that you feel less comfortable with him than you feel on your own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think it's just - I think it's in part like I do feel a little bit uncomfortable because it kind of like - I feel uncomfortable because physiologically I know there's just sort of one sort of way. It's just something that I have to do it. It's just sort of like I guess I just feel uncomfortable talking to him about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know that he's not bringing you to orgasm, or does he think something's working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes he thinks something's working. [00:11:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think maybe that's another problem is because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because he's being trained to think that oh I do this and it works for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it's hard but I think being honest about the fact that it's not working and it's also not him. Partly it's maybe more difficult because of the meds. But I mean you guys have been together for a long time and my guess is he wants to be able to please you. And if you can show him what works then he can actually learn that because this is probably not an Olympic event. He can only learn it if you give him the opportunity to see what it is that actually works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I haven't been a very good teacher.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's hard. It's a tricky situation because you don't want to hurt his feelings. It comes out of a nice place that you want to protect him, but it gets in the way. [00:12:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess that's the thing. I think maybe that's why I have this sex is really stigmatized in my brain. It doesn't - It just seems like something kind of secretive, dirty, and but something to also enjoy. It's really weird. I can't think about it straight. I mean I don't know. Maybe it's just because I grew up very prude in a very prude household. You know no sex before marriage. It used to slowly got in tune with it and got in tune with my body and somehow that would wind up hurting my feelings and then me not be able to say no. [00:13:07]</p>

<p>So it wasn't until recently that I started feeling cravings for sex. And I don't think that's a physiological thing. I think that's just sort of a coming into terms of my partner and just not being so scared. I really enjoy Jeremy, and I love him, and I guess I didn't realize how still sex was something still sort of like a big deal for me. It still feels kind of taboo. And it's hard to talk to anyone about it and I definitely don't really talk to my friends about it. I mean I've talked to maybe Lucy but I don't really see Lucy so often. She's still one of my best friends even though I don't see her very often. But yeah I think that's something that... [00:14:09]</p>

<p>Actually I was proud of myself because the moving like I remembered last year when I was moving Jeremy did not help at all, and we had a huge fight because the company was just not very helpful. And so this year I'm a little bit anxious about because we're moving together. It seems like we're working as a team, and I'm ordering boxes, and I'm like what's your address and he never tells me. So I order the boxes and there's like a hundred pounds of big boxes that I have to bring up, and I'm just thinking oh no he did it to me again. I'm calling this moving company names and he's not doing anything. He arranged RCN, did call the superintendent, but that didn't come to my mind when I was lugging up the boxes. [00:15:01]</p>

<p>So I was kind of venting to my roommate, and eventually I just texted Jeremy something passive aggressive, and then I realized yeah maybe he's not going to get it. And I just said that yeah. He's like oh you should've asked and you should've shipped them. I said yeah that I should've. Next time. I just told him that I was nervous that things were going to go like last year, and he's like no, no, no they're going to be different. We're going to do it together. He said that it's going to be a lot of work but we're going there for each other, and we're going to make the place beautiful. That's really I saw ah hah maybe that's a better way of addressing things because if you just say something passive aggressive they don't really no. They're calling to say oh she's such a bitch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The point gets lost. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I sort of see that also with... You know this teaching has been really good for me because I really just saw two different professors. One was more of a hard ass. He was very assertive, very yes, is his explanations, and the students really learned a lot from his as opposed to the second professor that came in after three weeks. She was kind of wishy-washy. Well not wishy-washy but she wasn't very clear cut. She wasn't as assertive and I saw that the kids just didn't learn from that. I kind of feel bad because I got to listen to the kids and looking at the professor's slides I'd be like well these are kind of messy. Why is she going through that? What's the motivation? Of course I feel bad because it's almost like gossiping. But I did feel bad. I mean I was tutoring the kids and they were completely lost. [00:17:10]</p>

<p>It's just interesting how I guess I know... I don't want to be one of those people like the gossip girls like the "Sex in the City" bitches where they're always gossiping about everyone and I don't want to be like that. But in the same sense I do, I guess, I talk about it. It's not a very positive thing. I know the professor's trying. And I know that she definitely knocked me down for some of the things that I did during my reviews because she was the teacher of my teaching class. And she had to judge my teaching and I'm thinking my teaching was a lot better than hers. Of course, you know it's a lot different when you're doing a whole class and she was trying the method of doing the tutorials and having kids become scientists. And kids in summer schools are not interested in being scientists. So I don't know. I feel kind of like I was bashing her and I guess I sort of... [00:18:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a way that you feel like you could've helped your students with her lectures in a way that you would've felt better about and would have been equally productive for them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what I did is I would go through all of her lectures in the format tutoring sections. I would say look at these are the main equations that you need to look at. So basically I'd go through the slides, and I would filter out and just sort of say the reason why she was really talking about this was because she was leading up to the particle wave duality. That's the real point of her motivation. As I'd go through I would sort of put meaning to the slides. I felt better because then it was more constructive instead of saying look at how crappy these notes are. It's like okay what is she trying to say, what are these notes, and still complain I guess because maybe I felt like it was making it harder for me and I guess I was venting too. I guess I have to realize I'm human after all. [00:19:31]</p>

<p>And the last thing that I think that's been really troubling me is I haven't told my parents that I'm moving in with Jeremy. And my parents are very traditional. And like my mom when we went to my boyfriend's friend wedding we were all supposed to meet up on Sunday. We told our mom let's do this, this Sunday, July 30th and she's like oh yeah. And I told my mom in a Facebook message. Then I told my dad when he was over here in a layover. And then they didn't remember like my dad sent me a text and he was like oh are you around here? What's the deal? I have to go to work later tonight. What's up? And I just said oh we're at a wedding, and we're going out tonight, and tomorrow's the actual reception. After that I didn't hear anything and I was almost upset because I thought oh well maybe he's planned a trip, but I didn't call anyone. [00:20:52]</p>

<p>And I felt guilty because I didn't call my parents because we were supposed to meet up. They forgot and we didn't meet up. And I felt really guilty when I talked to my mom and she's like what happened? I just said that I thought that you guys just forgot, or just not forgot or I just thought you guys knew. I just didn't know why you guys - I thought you just didn't feel like it. But I think I didn't want to meet with them because it was approaching sooner and sooner I'm going to have to tell my parents that I'm moving in with Jeremy and I guess I'm afraid. I just don't want to be excommunicated again. And I told Jeremy and he's well last time you were excommunicated because it was their way of saying they didn't like who you were with. (inaudible at 00:21:52) fair enough. And my dad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know that they're going to be displeased with this choice, or you're making an assumption. You've got pretty good evidence. That's a possibility. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean because I do remember my mom telling me about what she was telling a dance student is that she should never move in. She's like well don't move in unless you've got a ring on your finger and a scheduled date. That's what Doctor Laura says. And this is what she told the student.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're not following that advice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not following Doctor Laura. Well I wasn't following Doctor Laura but I haven't been known for making decisions that were in accord to Doctor Laura. I was being nice to my significant other. That's one thing I do do. But yeah, and for me I kind of have a hard time sorting out what I am like what this really means. I guess this is a baby step. I know because Jeremy explained to his mom that it was a serious commitment and that sentence in Jeremy's world this is a serious commitment because he was with a girl four years and didn't move in with her. [00:23:10]</p>

<p>So I mean the fact that we've known each other for two years, we're both really excited to move in with each other, and he even told me that he started (inaudible at 00:23:26) you know once you're living for one or two years there's no point in prolonging marriage. If it works, it works. And so I see it as a stepping stone rather than a stomping plateau because there is a lot of - I have a lot of angst. I will say in having to carry my stuff and go in there, and carrying groceries. I mean I've taken two trips there today. Well this will be my second trip. And it is nice to crochet but spending two hours on the T is a lot especially... So I mean that's going to be over. There's going to be no Jeremy being immature about going in the Square to pickup my stuff. Well I don't know what immaturity is, but I just think that even if it is not the ideal situation you shouldn't be grumpy or stressed. I mean it is what it is. [00:24:33]</p>

<p>And he actually sounded distracted. The guy was really tired and hungry coming home from work and he asked if I was coming over for dinner because he had just gotten home. He sounded kind of distracted because I was just oh no I'm not coming over. I'm sorry for not telling you. He got kind of... You know he was just sounding distracted, and tired, and disinterested. I mean I didn't get mad with him on the phone. Well I was just like well fine mister I don't want to talk to anyone. I've been working my ass off all day. I was working for five hours straight without having a chance to go to the bathroom, and before that I was tutoring. I was working while I was eating. And I was like I just want to talk to you. I was just like why are you being so grumpy? Yeah, you're hungry. I'm hungry too. Anyway so I guess that's... I don't know. [00:25:32]</p>

<p>I guess maybe that's the thing is I found that summer school in one way covered up. Like I could get upset about students, or put my all into school, but I still had all this angst underneath. And I see that now that summer school's gone now I'm sort of like I need to learn how to deal with my anxiety and speak up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About what really is the issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel like there's only little things. Like Jeremy is a really nice guy, but like everything I say about him is just oh yeah well he won't marry me probably unless I get a job. And no he doesn't ever come over to my place. I sort of see that I feel guilty for asserting myself, but in a sense I sort of feel like I'm getting to the point where I see that's sort of important. [00:26:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think having more frequent sessions one of the benefits will be that we can sort through what's the stuff that comes up over and over again and what are the real issues that you do want to be clear about and be able to be assertive about and what are the things that maybe are just the day's frustration. And I think one of the problems with having (inaudible at 00:27:08) is you don't have enough time to sort through it all and figure out this is an important piece that I do want to address and this is tired, hungry, cranky, and maybe isn't a big deal. But being able to have a place where you can talk about it all and can sort through it so that we can make headway on what are the real issues that are important for you to make some clear decisions about and be able to speak assertively about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think I've just been touching base with the once a month and I think this has been really excited that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We make good headway when we are able to meet more frequently so I'm glad we're going to be able to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do have to stop for today unfortunately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week 3:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, 3:30. Let's make sure it's in my calendar for 3:30. [00:27:59]</p>

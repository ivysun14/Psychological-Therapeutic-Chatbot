<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what I said?  [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You said [DATE], today is the [DATE], though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DATE].  I know.  I screwed up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I come here.  Because you make mistakes, too, once in a while, and I don't feel so bad.  Every once in a while, you know, I make them —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I, believe me.  That, that's my, that's, that's my charm, is I, people go, "Oh, my, I'm not, definitely not with any perfectionist."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  And I forgot to bring pictures of the babies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My two new grandchildren.  I'll have to bring it next time.  Next time they'll be how old?  Oh, close to a year.  God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's going too fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, when was I here last?  Do you have a date?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> April, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE] All right.  Do you know what happened on [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know the expression, uh, now the [DATE] was my birthday, but I, I waited a day.  Um, walking, you can't walk and chew gum at the same time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wasn't even chewing gum.  I was at my daughter's that weekend —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And walking just in the parking lot, and, you know, part of my disease, why I'm coming here is that I don't concentrate on the action that I'm taking immediately, on the walking, where I'm walking.  So I'm walking in the parking lot, and I'm looking for a store that, I, I'm by myself, that would sell something for one of my daughters, that she wanted.  So I'm looking, I'm looking.  I tripped on a concrete bumper.  Fell on my hand.  Broke my wrist here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The hand came here.  Contus, contusions over here on the chest.  Had my phone in, in my thigh.  I'm pointing, I'm pointing to my thigh by the way.  [LAUGHING]  Phone in my thigh, on my thigh, and I crushed into my thing.  What a mess.  In fact, I wore the, I had a hard cast for about six, for about four weeks.  Soft cast for about three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you broke it here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can see it.  The ulna bone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just, just one of the two bones.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One of, you broke one of them.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, there's two ulna bones?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a radius and ulna, so you broke one of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.  Radius is on the other side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  This, this is the one that broke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> First time.  Never broke and everything.  But again, it's part of the thing that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pay attention?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I don't pay attention.  It, it's, it's with everything.  It's with driving, I find, um, you know, why look in front of you if there's something on the, you, driving, like, 50 miles an hour, you know, but there's nothing in front of you, there's a lousy car in front.  But on the sides there's grass, there's trees, there's everything that's there.  And you can, kind of like, look around, "I don't want to miss out on a trick."  It's part of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even with the medication, you feel you're distractible like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  I'm more distractible, uh, without the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, significantly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  No.  I, the, there, there, there is a difference, but it's certainly not, it's certainly not curing it and making it, uh, to, totally —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, you're still —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, absolutely it's, it's done it.  And even when I was taking the three, uh, Concertas, where I was forgetting things.  I was taking three 18s.  Now I'm only taking two 18s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was forget, I was, I was forgetting things.  I didn't really, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it was a bind either way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, I, I don't, I mean, I tr, I have to physically, but it, to be honest, to be honest, these are short—term pills.  There are many times, because I don't work —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There are many times because I don't work, I don't take the second pill.  In other words, I take one in the morning, and then I take one at 3:00.  I got on my timers.  Like, when I do take one at 3:00, I, I, it certainly is different, it's a different feeling than the one, oh, there's no question about it.  I notice the difference in feelings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then, maybe, you should irregardless, you should take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I probably should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, uh, they have all this data now, because, you know, when they market, uh, these medicines, that people have fewer car accidents and things like that.  So maybe from the safety standpoint, you know, we tried to go higher.  There was a problem with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lower obviously is not good.  So maybe we should just keep you on this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Keep, keep, and I should take it at 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, that's where my problem has been.  That I, the afternoon pill, I tend to, kind of like, now if the bell rings, I put it out.  I was only, I was really taking primarily, you know, when I had a, an assignment.  Like, I came here today.  I took my pill.  [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wanted to be able to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, but, but it does help me focus.  There's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's no, in fact, one of the things I was going to ask you, all right, well, I, I, I don't want to get onto another topic, but I wanted to ask you about medication.  But, um, okay, I'm going to do exactly what, I want to see if there's going to be a significant difference, because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I would take it consistently, then, based on what you're saying.  I mean, my son is, uh, you know, at 16 he was learning to drive, and, um, it's interesting, he told me several rules that were recommended to him that I don't remember learning, that I thought were good.  Like, um, he said that when you come to a stop, you should always be able to see the tires of the car in front of you.  In other words, so you're not right on top of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, right on top of it.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that way, if that guy starts pulling out, and then stops suddenly, you don't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, we always learned you're supposed to leave a car length for every mile per hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they learned slightly different.  They learned if the car in front goes past a certain marker, it should be three seconds, which turns out to be about the same kind of thing.  You know, like, you drive on the highway, and you go past [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You go one for every 10 miles an hour?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We learned for every 10 miles an hour.  Leave a car length.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.  I thought you said —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you're going —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought you said every mile an hour.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you're going 50, you know, you leave, like —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, 5 car lengths —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five car lengths.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always leave extra anyway.  I'm, in that area, I'm very cautious.  In fact —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I was thinking for you, if you're looking at the grass —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's important that you do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well the other thing is, I also drive a little bit too slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See, I'm on the other, I'm on the other end.  Like, on a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not typical of ADHD people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  It's not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  That's very funny, because I've always driven slow.  But now, I like, my wife gets mad, and I like to, I, I'm in the right lane, I just, or, well sometimes, I'm in the center lane.  She says go to the right lane.  And I put it on four to five miles above the speed limit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And everybody is passing me.  All over, kind of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's because you're on the highway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I won't, I won't go faster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  No, but that's fine.  That's fine.  Whatever you're comfortable at.  But, yeah, I mean, people go 10-15 miles faster.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no, no, no.  I, I, I don't enjoy that.  I, I get —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you won't get a ticket that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, true, I never get tickets.  That' true.  [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  But, uh, yeah, the, the stereotype of people with ADHD would be that they drive too fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too, really?  Too fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  All right.  Well that's not me.  Um, only because there, there's, I don't have a, uh, it's, there's, there's no ex, I find that, really, I mean, there, there's, I'm concerned about, you know, you know, my reaction time and every, and everything else.  Especially with all these things going, so I have to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, I, I truly do try and concentrate.  But —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The pill does help on —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] you consider driving an activity.  In other words, you said you don't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't take that second pill.  Well, if you're going to be out —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Driving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you should —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  When I, when I drive I actually do take the pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  If I know I'm driving that day, because it's, it is, it, it does play a significant part.  I, I wanted to ask you something.  We're talking about the same pill and everything else.  I know I tried this once.  It didn't work.  But I, I'm just curious regarding the chemical makeup or the breakdown of some of these pills, because I tried once, uh, time release Ritalin, I think.  They had a time—released Ritalin, and there was another time release type of pill.  Uh, they, do they have different chemicals in it than Conc, I like Concerta better.  But I'm curious if they would, because I'm in that doughnut hole on the Medicare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And considering each pill is $4 —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.  No.  Uh, Concerta, remember we had tried you on the Adderall, and it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Adderall, that was the one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It interfered with peeing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So then we went back to C, Concerta.  And Concerta, is the, is Ritalin.  It is a slow—release Ritalin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They also, they have other slow release Ritalin pills.  Um, so the question is, is there one that's similar that's less expensive?  Because Concerta is not available as a generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See the Ritalin, the one that was called Ritalin LA —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  It —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Never had a great reputation.  You could try it if you're interested.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if they're going to, I don't know if that's going to be any different.  That's just it.  If it's on the, uh, if it's on my plan.  I was just concerned about the makeup of it.  If, if there's a significant difference, I want, because I, I like the Concerta.  I've had no bad reactions —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it does work, I, the system is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now it, it's just, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's felt to be a better, it, it's a very sophisticated pill.  And it's felt to be released nice and consistently and evenly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Concerta is.  The other slow release Ritalins, uh, I, I don't have as much experience with.  Uh, but, uh, we could convert you to a twice a day on, you know, there's a, there is a Metadate version, that's, uh, that's probably available generically.  Let, let's look.  We could consider it.  Yes.  [LAUGHING]  Metadate CD.  Hum.  Because I have a guy who takes one big Concerta, he's a doctor, he takes one big Concerta in the morning, and then if he has a longer day, he takes a little bit of other stuff, and so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Like, to take the two of them?  Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  To extend the day.  Right?  So it's one of the Metadates.  So, and he always says, make sure he specify brands, so that makes me think, that that's available as a generic.  So let me just see.  Metadate ER, that's what he takes.  Extended release.  Is that supposed to be a twice a day medicine?  There's Metadate CD, which is also an extended release.  I think the Metadate CD is, is longer acting than the Metadate ER.  But it looks like the Metadate CD is only, it's the same thing, it's only available as a brand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the Metadate ER, it might be kind of like a three time a day pill thing you, because it's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have enough trouble with two times, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's given two to three times per day.  That's what it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, I have no problem with sleeping.  I have no problem with anything else with this.  It was strictly a, I was just curious if, you know, every, I figure that, you know, with time, every year or so, I'll always ask if any about it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because new things come up where you hear about something that's different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's Focalin, too.  But that also is probably, it's a long—acting, um Ritalin, but, again, it, the long—acting one might be brand name only.  Focalin XR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If Concerta is the best, why doesn't everybody recommend the Concerta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well because people are different, and some people might, I do have one person on Focalin, and I can't remember, I think he preferred it to, uh, Concerta.  I think we tried the Concerta.  I'm seeing him later.  I can ask him.  Let's see dosage, administration, Focalin XR.  Focalin XR is once a day.  But again, it's probably it's a branded one, as it is with Concerta.  Focalin, it's twice a day.  [INAUDIBLE]  Yeah.  Twice a day [INAUDIBLE] So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We, we, we'll stick with —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I was saying is, I don't know of a Ritalin, slow released Ritalin, that has a sensational reputation, that's available generically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was your question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so you're in the doughnut hole, so you're paying full price for this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Just about, you know.  It, it, it's, you know, these, there are —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's, that's another reason that you skip them in the afternoon.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Actually, uh, yes and no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I actually do skip it because I feel I, I don't need it.  I never skip it when I know I have something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not that critical to me.  Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's $4 a pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's probably a little bit over $4 a pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's aye, aye, aye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you shop around in terms of like Costco and Walmart and all that stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I can't, you can't, well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They will be different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I got to go through the doughnut hole anyway.  I got to, got, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got to use that money up.  So whether I use it up here, the, the, they don't charge me any more than the cheapest I can get it at the drugstore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In other words, I, I got to use up the money anyway, so whatever they, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I got, I got, uh, I don't want to let the money part of it, I, I really am not letting the money part be the true focus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just thought that, you know, if there was something comparable, every, I figure every year or so I, I, I'd ask and see if maybe there's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You, you learned of something that, hey, boy this works just like the Concerta, and now they found out something that was generic, that I, that I, that I could use, so it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, no matter what I order right now, it has nothing to do with the Concerta or anything.  Any medication, I would be in that doughnut hole.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh,  Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it has nothing to do with you.  I mean, I take other medications, too.  I take the cholesterol and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [INAUDIBLE] research and all that.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  But that's very important, that you understand that what I'm telling you is the truth, that it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not truly a, uh, I like the idea of having a couple of extra pills, just in case the, for what you it?  For, uh, a time, but, you know, for a safety situation.  But if I'm doing any, I never forget it in the morning, and the afternoons, if, like, I know I'm doing nothing around the house.  I'm just sitting, because right now I haven't worked since January, so right now I'm in a, in a tremendous clean up mode.  Everything from the attic is coming down, and I'm doing a lot of physical work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I figured for that sometimes I, I, I don't take the pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Well, I'll keep researching it, because there may be a cheaper way to go that works similarly well.  It's probably going to be at least twice a day though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well twice a day is okay.  I just don't want to sacrifice the quality of the prod, I'm also concerned about, um, at trying to cut down on pills that I take.  It's, you know, these kinds of things.  I take, I don't take that many.  I only, I, I still only take the two that you give me, and the two that, uh, what you call it, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] gives me.  The —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The cholesterol.  The, uh, Zetia —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the TriCor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's all I'm taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I figure, you know, that's still a lot of pills.  It's a four drugs —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.  A lot of people take a lot more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, well my uncle takes about, like, I think, 12, uh, prescription medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prescription medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twelve or maybe even 14 now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's about 14 now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I, you know, I am sorry that it's so expensive, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  There's nothing you can do.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would say that you should continue to take it until we come up with some other —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I w, I make that commitment to take it at the three, because you never know if I'm driving or I'm not driving, right.  And I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well when you had that accident and you broke your wrist —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hadn't taken it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, because I'm walking, I, just like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Picture this standing up —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but that, that</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could happen to anybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm walking.  Now I'm looking at the store, and I'm look, and I'm just not look, you know, you're not focusing down.  What I should do, and my mother tended to do things like that, also walk very fast —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do other things like that.  And, uh, it just, you know.  Anyway, uh, that's okay.  Everything else is, you know, it would be great if I get back into the work situation.  I am trying, uh, I had a little b, between the, uh, arm and the other thing, I had a little bit of, uh, delay in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But is that because of there's a slow down, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's terrible.  Everybody is, they're, nobody is developing.  They're not doing this, they're not doing that.  But, you know, well, I think [NAME OTHER] said she might start taking social security, so, we'll have a few more bucks coming in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.  Now you want me to do it the way I did it last time?  I did it three months at a time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly the same way, because I want to, I want to put everything through the, uh, and they take those, and everything is fine, and saves you paperwork.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  There really are no other issues, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did things work out with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What was the latest with [NAME OTHER]?  That was in [INAUDIBLE] so I already told you about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a little [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  I told, uh, [NAME OTHER] exactly what, I probably told you the same thing.  It's not, I just, I just didn't address it.  I didn't go there, because I, we had, she had, uh</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I have a patient —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My expectations are just too great.  I'm sorry.  You have a patient?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have a patient who, uh, has a prospective daughter in law, and, uh, the prospective daughter in law lost her husband.  So the prospective mother—in—law lost, uh, I mean, lost her father.  So the prospective mother—in—law lost her husband.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the daughter, so the daughter—in—law, let's call her daughter in law, was over, and she was saying how her mother was having a rough time and everything.  And so, uh, my patient, who is a patient here, also is a therapist, says, "Maybe she should go, you know, for some therapy or counselling" —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well what —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.  That's, what a great idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well the girl blew her top, won't talk to you, you know, because she suggested that her mother could go for therapy.  So some people are very prickly about stuff, you know.  And, you know, they just come from a, you know.  I call hose people tightly wrapped.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.  That, that's the expression, tightly wrapped.  That's ex —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, and so, she wasn't saying her mother is a crack pot, she's saying she lost her husband.  It's rough.  Maybe she needs some help, you know, but the girl took it like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's the most logical, logical thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course, of course.  But from people, people who, who find that very upsetting, like you're labelling the person, or you're, you know, whatever.  So that's been a tremendous issue, you know, because now there's all this tension, and blah, blah, blah.  So it's a similar kind of problem, you know, I mean, you could say the most pleasant, jovial, innocent constructive thing to some people, and it, and it may not be to their liking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can't, you can't win either way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a tough problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it is, but what I've said is that I'm just going to, when I'm on the phone with her and she's, she's very nice, and very pleasant, and I, I, you know, I try and, you know, make it more formal when I talk to her.  Rather than just trying to be my normal self.  I just have to watch those words.  Because I'm going to fall into a situation, I know I'm going to say something, and, my son doesn't stand up for me.  I mean, he's, he's married to her and whatever she, if they'll be married for 50 years, I think it's the greatest thing that the two of them stick up for each other, as long as their going to continue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My concern is that sometimes one becomes so over powerful, I wonder how —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he gets you, he ought to kind of, you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, he doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of plow the field a little bit there, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sh, yeah, I, I wish, they don't really visit, they're doing their own thing, but you know, I don't know.  We, we'll see what happens when they have children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We'll see.  But the thing that I don't want to do, I really, I'm very concerned.  I really don't want alienate, I don't want to be the guy, I don't want to, I don't want to win the battle, but lose the war.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to say, hey, I'm right, and everything else, and then when they have kids I don't see my other grandchildren.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's exactly what happened to a friend of mine, and I, I'm really concerned about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I've got to just, kind of like, mellow it, and this is really, basically why I even started with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I recognize that I have the potential of being like a bull in a china, china shop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm a nice bull.  I mean, I'm not doing anything bad.  [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In your defense, you know, come on, I mean, you're, you're, you're trying to do all the right stuff, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But it's, it's doesn't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, whether they, they kind of get you or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, my kids know me, and I, you know, I, I'm sure they know me better than I think that they know me.  And I'm just hoping that, you know, I'm, that they accept me as one way or the other.  I just don't want to alienate them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I've just got to, I've just got to be careful.  It, it, it's work.  I, I can't say anything, you know, really, I'm having a problem with [NAME OTHER] now, but she has her own issues.  And the good news about [NAME OTHER] is, she is, no matter what her issues are with me, she is going to therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So at least she's in a, you know, I'd like to always, I'm always concerned about what she says to the therapist, because she always says things that, I'm always afraid she's going to say something that's really not true.  And I always wondered about that.  You know, what happens if a therapist, because you're only hearing one side of the story.  I'd like to, you know, there's nothing you, there's nothing you can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As long as she's seeing, as long as she's into that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My wife, uh, went through therapy, because when we met, she had recently broke off an engagement.  And then we started dating —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she was, you know, whatever.  So I was a pain in the ass.  So the therapist essentially said she should get rid of me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which may have been the correct —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]  [LAUGHING]  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They always do that.  They always say, you know, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I mean, therapists, some are very sophisticated and, and understand they're only hearing one side and, you know, there are others who have, you know, an a, maybe not a conscious agenda, but you know, have a, a kind of a bias or whatever.  So listen, maybe she should have gotten rid of me, but you know, now we're married 22 years, you know, whatever.  I don't know, I mean.  [LAUGHING]  So, uh, she could have done better, she could have done worse, I suppose.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I, see I recognize —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do want the therapist hopefully to, to understand, you know, if she really gets to see [NAME OTHER], she'll see [NAME OTHER] as part of what's going on with [NAME OTHER].  It's not exclusively [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Hopefully she'll see her enough to understand —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Her whole —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Structure.  Whether she's l, b, uh, and, and that's more important about seeing [NAME OTHER] as, rather than individually with, I don't care about me, about her relationship with others, but she, I find that she's, she's just like me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Actually I like when other include other people, you know, the partners or family members, because I think that helps them.  The traditional, the very rigid traditional psychoanalytic was, you know, you never include the other person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I just always —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but I think that's wrong.  I think it is good to, to, to include those other people, because you get them on board with the process, hopefully.  And also, you get to see, you know, you get to validate what people are talking about or not, you know.  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  What do they say people, some people see things half full, some people see things half empty.  So, you know, like, [NAME OTHER] may be seeing things one way, and maybe somebody else sees it, it a different, you know, I, and that's also for myself, too, I find.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As long as she's meeting with somebody reasonable.  Hopefully the process is helpful to her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, don't know who, and I don't want to even, I'm not going there.  I have enough issues with her.  But, but every, every, everything is going great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  All right.  So let's figure out when to meet.</p>

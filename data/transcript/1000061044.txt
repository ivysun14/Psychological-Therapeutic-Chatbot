<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115. Interview number 15, March 23rd, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was I here last Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Had I gotten reclassified one eight (ph) at that point?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope it stands. I got a draft notice: I am supposed to be in Boise...well, not a draft notice, a physical notice. I am supposed to be in Wichita tomorrow morning  for a physical but then, today, I got the cancellation of the physical notice. By the end of the week, I am supposed to get the reinstatement of my One Y (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That can turn (inaudible 1:52).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did. Blue work Monday. Probably about $40 in long distance calls getting it straightened out. Somehow straighten these up will be a hell of a lot cheaper going back to Boise. It just seems to be another stage of the waiting game here - just pulling out paychecks until some of them start ending up as mine. (Inaudible 2:31) doesn't seem to be bothered. I am getting awfully fed up with Jessica.  I haven't gotten a letter from her again for I don't know how long. I get this rap of she really doesn't have anything to say or she just doesn't feel like writing or some kind of shit like that. Be that as it may, I feel the same way myself sometimes but I would at least appreciate an explanation or an effort - anything. So, it's kind of a low ebb of our relationship. I intend to just write her or call her tonight - I don't know which. I doubt if she can get it in gear or drop it but I am fed up with this shit. 0:03:22.4</p>

<p>I went to bed at 7 o'clock last night. I almost got 12 hours sleep. I was so tired all day. Carmen will be here Friday. Notes to remind me who gets what sandwich when I go out to buy them all lunch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A true (inaudible 4:04). I can't really tell what you are feeling about Jessica: you said you were fed up and that is about all I got.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I sometimes get the feeling maybe I am being very selfish about it but then I kind come to the conclusion that if that's the way it is, it is because that's the way I am. I should feel very bad if that were true but that still wouldn't make it any different that I end up in situations that get me awfully upset. I don't think it may be the way it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing about it that upsets you is that somehow when you don't get a chance to see her, the communication drops off and you don't see her as making an effort - even if she would write you and say, "I don't know what to say," or "I feel blocked - it's hard for me to write it down."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I could identify with. I could say, "Well, yeah,  I'd feel the same way." But, even to the point that when I do get letters from her, I have noticed a greater and greater percentage of the time, in the last four months - maybe longer...I don't know but it seems to be about that long that I have taken note of it happening. I will get a letter and it just doesn't mean a thing to me. It doesn't interest me at all because all it is is some rap about what she did that night, or who she talked to yesterday, or what somebody's mother said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is all about (inaudible 5:55) 0:05:56.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it has absolutely nothing with she or I - or she and I. I don't know what it is - her interest...or any signs of active interest in the relationship seems to have gone almost nil as of late. I hate to take to her on the phone because usually the mother or someone is around and that's kind of an uptight scene. So I don't know whether to try that or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It almost sounds like she acts like there isn't anything interactive between you and that's the message you get. It is almost like as if there was nothing between you all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it is turning into a one-way affair, it seems like. I don't feel bad for me haven given up something and lost it. That isn't my hassle at all. I mean, I don't feel bad for me having had feelings towards her and I think I have been cheated or something like that - it is not that at all. It is just that I  am completely fed up that there is no gain; there is no loss; there is no point to continuing that. I just as well know where the situation is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, almost, there is some sort of indifference about it that gets to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like there is an undertone to your voice that makes it sound like you are deeply angry about it</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I am just terribly pissed off! I think it is very rude and it is very unnecessary and I have made it clear at least three times this year what it is that is bothering me and that I don't like. As recent as a week ago I talked with her about it and told her then that I didn't like it. I called her just a few nights ago and told her I was really bummed out that night. She said, "Well, what has got you so mad?" Or not mad, "What has gotten you in such a bad mood?" I said, "Well I don't appreciate going for about a month without hearing from you sooner. It doesn't mean that it hasn't phased her. She just chalks it off as a bad mood. If she reads me that wrong...well, I don't get along anyway. 0:08:35.8</p>

<p>I was in a pretty good mood until I got home and saw that I didn't have any mail again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing really changed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other side.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that has happened uncountable times. I don't know how often I have come home and been completely bummed out - no matter what I feel like - when there is no mail. Not just no mail - no mail again. 0:12:00.4</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: It really hurts to be almost ignored like that. I mean, it is not intentional: at least, it is kind of like the end result. It's like you hadn't said a thing about it, almost.  There seems to be no response to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm, yeah. Like, I just get to the point where in my letters - I don't normally do it - I just point blank ask questions and figure for Christ sakes, if nothing else, she can send me back a list of "yes" and no." That would piss me off as much but she has got something that she can...even if she hasn't got something to write about, I am giving her something to write about. She hasn't even answered those. It has been a long time since there has been any replay in her letters. In a way...I don't know whether I really believe this - that is a strange way of putting it. I am getting tripped off on however I ever got into that idea but there is a feeling to the effect that Jessica has a world that she can occupy herself with. She has got friends and places to go and things to do. All I do around here is sit on my ass until I want to scream. I got up Sunday morning at 9.30 and it was a sunny day and I thought I would go out for a walk because I didn't have anything to do. I got two feet out the door and I realized there wasn't anywhere I wanted to go. I went back inside - nobody up. I went down to my room; nothing to do - not even anything to read. I came upstairs - nothing to eat. I started to go outside - nothing to do there. I went through that little journey about 20 times and by one o'clock in the afternoon I was screaming; screaming foul language and kicking walls; slamming doors. I had to do something.  I was so uptight I went down and went to sleep: I don't know how I managed it but it's like that was the only way out. I woke up at 5.30 that evening. There were some other people awake, so we all sat around, bored together but at least there were other people to talk to so I didn't go crazy. That's not a bad case - that is typical - of what I do around here in my spare time. 0:15:27.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems to me that most of your life here is awfully empty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost void! Like I said, I don't know what to call it but there is a feeling to the effect...I don't know whether it is because I am feeling jealous or the fact that Jessica isn't that way...I don't think I would call it that...I don't think that if I call it...well, it is to the effect that she fails to recognize that situation. It is like she has got things to do and she is bored so all she does is go over to Carmen's or something like that. My Christ, if I just had one place to go to, I would be content - have something to do. I don't think she has any comprehension of what is going on. As many times as I have tried to tell her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, it almost now sounds like...I can't read into what that is for her but it sounds almost like a certain kind of...just insensitivity to what your life is like. If she really knew and could comprehend what life was like for you, you feel, of course, she really would try to do something about it because it is pretty awful sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know what she would do. I don't know even if she does not know. Like, I have explained situations to her. Like that one: I think I talked to her about that when I was talking to her...I don't know, maybe I haven't...but situations just  like that have happened many, many times and I have told her about them. Maybe she understands what I am trying to say - maybe she doesn't - but I don't know...maybe that is why I don't understand quite what I feel about the difference in those two situations - the way she is; the way I am. If she does understand it and ignores it - and if I knew that; I was fully aware and confident that that was the situation - I would  just never bother to call her back again. As it is, there is at least the situation where there is some way or some reason that I can't convey to her the ideas of what is happening. 0:18:20.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With a whole lot of luck - history showing how short I have been on that for the last couple of years - I may be getting a car this weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My uncle's neighbor died and left him as executor of the will and has an old car, a '64,  I guess it is, car that only has 11,000 miles on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if I can nail it down, I will be ahead but I don't know. Like as not,  it will have to be a fair execution of the will, which means he will probably put it up for auction and I doubt I would be able to afford it. If nothing else, I could at least get hold of a motorcycle. If I could just be able to go somewhere: I love to just travel: just getting out of the city and just driving around would do me a hell of a lot of good in those kind of situations. It is like getting in that situation and seeing how absolutely at the mercy of it that I am makes me that more frustrated. I have no way of combating the situation. It's kind of strange: I knew at that time that if I walked out to the point, I would probably calm down; I would probably find something to be interested in. But I was just so pissed off because I knew walking out there was absolutely meaningless - it was absolutely of no good. Even though I knew that once I got out there I would calm down, I knew it would be so phony - I just couldn't make myself do it. 0:22:16.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What that reminds me of is...sometimes what it is like to think, "Well,  I could take a tranquilizer but that is just artificial - that is depressing certain nerve actions. It is not really helping what is getting to me." Or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like dulling the pain and not really getting at, or being able to, have an impact on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I had have thought that I could go out there and settle something in my mind - that it would help things - that would have been fine. It wasn't the case: it was just that I would go out there and manage to ignore it for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is what they call, I think, a palliative. Something that just puts a lid on it or calms you down for a little while. Like you were saying, "There wasn't a constructive thing  I could do about it; there was no way I could deal with the situation."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have no idea how I got to sleep because I had just slept for probably 11 hours I think. I had been awake for three hours: I went back to bed and fell asleep within 15 minutes, not because I was tired but because I had to. I didn't even think about it - I just knew.  I would go to sleep - I just had to. Then I woke up at five and it was four o'clock Monday morning before I managed to get back to sleep. That brings up another thing: late at night, laying around, trying to get to sleep. Every now and then - although it is on rare occasions - I still lapse into a little "is everything around me real or isn't it" game. It is kind of getting to a game of nerves to see whether I can manage to scare myself or not. I will still catch myself making sure the windows and the doors are still were I thought they were. The walls really aren't padded. It is kind of an impasse: there is no conclusion to it. I just, you would probably say, tire of the game. It just kind of ends after a while an my mind goes on to something else, or I fall asleep or whatever. 0:24:47.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to make any fancy connections but it just struck me that the last time that came up - although it was more serious then - that's when (inaudible 25:00) meant business -  what you were also talking about emptiness and just waiting. I am wondering if that is something that happens when you feel like your life is particularly empty. I don't know - I don't know and if...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have thought so - I have thought so many times. In fact, I don't know whether I mentioned it or not, but I have had the feeling that if I ever get my shit together - whether I was in a little more contented situation with life; where I wasn't so completely fed up with it -  I don't think I would have that kind of problem. I was thinking the other night that if my life were to continue to the effects of gratification as it has, for say, what the last year and a half mean to me now, I think I would kill myself tomorrow. Another 60 of that just isn't worth shit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I don't mean to make this sound like this is what I think is really going on but I am finding myself having associations to what you are saying and another one I just had was: you are saying at times like this you feel like you just don't have any power over anything. And I am thinking, yeah, you don't have power to the extent that you can't even keep...your perceptions won't stay right. And even that starts going: you don't have the power to control that some of the time. I don't know if that is right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know because when that starts happening to me, it is not so much that I doubt my powers of perception, I doubt what I am perceiving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I didn't mean how it felt: I meant how it looked to me. That is another way of being awfully powerless...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that might be good too. It's like the impotency of what effect I have on everything else is kind of infected even in my sensitivity to reality. 0:27:08.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounded like this time it's kind of...it either comes in flashes or in some way a little bit off at a distance from you; like it doesn't rip you like before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, it still just scares the hell out of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I am familiar with the fear now. It still scares me just as much as before. I don't know what different perspective it is. It seems that if you are familiar with fear it isn't as bad but it's not true - it scares me just as bad. It does not last as long usually but I am learning to probe it. If it is late at night and I am lying in bed and the walls seem to disappear or take on a different form, I won't sit up and look around and reaffirm it. I will just sit and wait and see what happens for a little bit. And usually, after a while, I will get scared enough to where I will sit up and look around but I kind of nose out a little further each time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, like, how long can I stay with that before I have to sit up and listen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, alright,  if you are going to do something...if I am going to freak out and then find out what I am afraid of or whatever it is that seems to be scaring me, I dare you to do it. Dare an existence to bear itself or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is going through your mind now? 0:30:34.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just flashing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just....I don't know, I suppose right at that time, I was going through a bunch of random scenes of history.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your history?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess at the time...I guess there was kind of a scene to it. It was an old girlfriend and one particular fight we had one night. There were several of them but I thought of...it concerned the problem that eventually broke us up. I just almost had the suspicion that I might be as blind to situations that Jessica is in as she seems to be to what I am in. I have a feeling that if I were to do what I consider sometimes in my more angrier or (inaudible 31 45) moments that I would be making an ass both of myself and of her - and of the situation. I don't even have any way of knowing that, it seems. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way that it makes it hard to think about taking any action because you are not sure if maybe you are acting from some sort of other perspective also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's another bag of sit and wait. For Christ sakes, I am numb with the wait. I have gone through a year of this and I thought it was perfectly worthwhile. I don't feel bad about having done it but I sure as hell don't want to go through another year for nothing. 0:33:10.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like there is something about the very situation that makes it hard to find out if there is a wider perspective. I am not sure if that was clear but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems there doesn't seem any way we can get this shit together. I have talked with her the last time I was in Boise: I don't remember when that was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is her response to your saying that - to your trying to tell her that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The last time I talked to her just solely about that. I called her up her up and I told her that we were pretty f***** up and things had better get back together and she said, "Yeah, I think they are too and I have been feeling really uptight about it." So we talked about it and I told her I didn't think things were going to last unless we managed to have a little better understanding in communication. So she thought that was it too. And I said, "Yeah, okay." Without saying it, I did say it but 980 miles is a hell of a problem - a pretty big obstacle - so we can't be together like we'd like to. I can think of any number of ways that the situation could be solved if we can just be together for some amount of time. I can't afford telephone conversations. I am fed up with $150 a month phone bills. I have paid several of them in a row right now. I am wasted; I am bummed out because they haven't really done a damn thing either. So it is obvious that letters are our only choice and she just doesn't take the clue. Clue: I won't  even call it a clue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say that doesn't sound like the right word.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like telling someone to tie their shoelace: every time you see them it is untied and they say, "Yeah, I will tie it." And you don't have time to stay with them to make sure they do it and the next time you see them, they don't have it tied. That, and if I were to write her a letter, I am sure the only way that it would make an impression is if I were to really get to be a bad ass about it because I have written many letters just saying that why I don't like this and throw in a few...you know, just kind of mingle it into a letter, "Why haven't you written for a month?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you have never really gotten really directly...really mad about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I did once and she decided that although she just hadn't felt like writing for a month, she really felt like writing then, so she wrote me three or four letters.  I got a few more and then it was gone for another month. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that doesn't sound like you have to keep doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No,  I don't want to demand letters.  If that is the case, why don't I just forget it too. There is nowhere I can turn but I am still leaving a good chance that what I am doing is wrong, but I feel like I have got to do something because just apathy is equally wrong. I have sat on my ass too God damn long. I have to take the responsibility of having a good odd of being wrong. I have been forced into having to accept that too because evidently she isn't going to do anything. She agrees, "Yeah, there is something wrong - I am not going to do anything." She will say the first part, not the last. 0:37:32.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you sort of conclude the last from having this happen a couple of times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have even asked her why. That is why I don't why...I have tried to tell her about my situations. I ask her why she doesn't write. She says, "I don't feel like writing." That's all I know about it. So I have nothing more to go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is so ambiguous. It sounds like that is part of it. It is like, I don't know, if you really knew there was something bad going on, okay, you could deal with that. But this is another one of those shapeless things that you have to wonder about. There doesn't seem anyway to grab onto it or give it a name.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was talking to Carmen the other night. I asked Carmen: I can't seem to get any real response out of Jessica. I asked Carmen if there was something going on: why wasn't Jessica writing? It seems that she mailed a letter a while back that hasn't gotten here. It is now over a week overdue. Jessica told Carmen that she was going to mail a letter that day. It's possible it got lost in the mail: we've had that happen twice - letters that just never arrived. Jeez, I don't know what it was I asked her. Oh, I said that it was getting to the point where  I was just about fed up, and that, to ask her if she was wanting to forget the whole thing. Carmen said no, she wasn't. She thought I was getting really bummed out on her. If she feels that way,  I can't really understand why she continues with what it is she knows is pissing me off. I just don't understand a bit of it. I don't know. It's getting on my goat to be the one to call her or to write the letter. So I am getting tired of being the one who has to carry the relationship along. I am not electing myself for martyrdom. I am saying that out of damn obstinance. It is a dent in my ego - it pisses me off. 0:40:36.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also to have to ask for a positive response I think would be something that would really hurt me. I want somebody to listen to me and to give something to me and not have to almost bludgeon them for it. That would dent my ego.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Another part of being the one to have to take the (inaudible 42:26) stance is that with all the God damn perspectives and the different situations to consider and all the ways of getting my butt bit when I try to do something. It is work to sit down and try...If I have to write a letter tonight or I decide to do so, I will be up late doing it. It will take three drafts to decide what I am going to put in it.  I will rewrite it umpteen times and it will be 10 pages long before I would even hope to get what I wanted in it. Or I could be just throwing a rock and just put it in four paragraphs and say, "Either write or you're f***** and know that I am leaving every possibility of being wrong open. It is really a task to try and do it right, or do it to what I would hope to be closest to writing. And I am tempted to wait until maybe I will get a letter from her and that will help. It will give me something to go on but that just means I will wait a month, get a letter from her and then if I say something, she will say, "Well, I just wrote - what are you mad about now?" God! 0:44:00.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you keep pouring your energy into this and you don't even get any information back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't get anything back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is draining.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sure is. I don't like living alone at all. I am not used to being a chaste little b******. It is a real pain - it is a hassle. I used to have great faith and belief in the idea of it but I have seen a whole lot of loopholes in it lately. I will continue it because that was the agreement that the relationship was established on and until it is mutually agreed to change it, then I would be a real bastard to do it on my own. It is just that much more of a reason that I am not willing to put up with all this shit to continue. I haven't gotten anything out of this for quite a while. Are you ready for service?!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was going to say it - ironic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I often wonder had I had to face the actual choice, if I would have gone into the Service a year ago.  I was having some pretty serious doubts at the time. I had just met Jessica and the month between when I had decided and started making commitments and the time it came for me to go, I had also turned into quite a heavy doper. My viewpoints had changed quite a bit, right along then with the people that I was running around with changed. I think I would have gone, knowing that my shoulder was so bad. If I ever wanted to, I could easily get thrown out with a pension - honorable discharge - and be cleared up with the whole damned mess. And I'm too tired to write any letters tonight. It seems like all I do any more. Go to work, come home, eat a can of soup and go to bed. I guess that makes it that more frustrating not to have anything to do on the weekends. I have about three hours between when I get home - maybe four hours - and when I go to bed. I am usually in bed between nine and 10 at the latest. So that's (inaudible 48:44). And yet I will feel pissed off because I am putting off doing something about this whole situation too.  0:49:11.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure I get the connection: you mean at least you had something to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I am mad about it. I have been about a week now. I now feel like, hell or high water, I am going to do something about it. I don't know what: I know it can't be entirely right when I do it. And I will go home and go to bed tonight and be pissed with myself because I have put it off. I think the thing about waiting until I should hear from her is that if I should hear from her and actually gain some information, it would give a little understanding to the situation. I am leery enough of the risks I would have to take - in my actions - that I am sure I would put it off. But it is all too easy and it is all too familiar for me to put it off until I hear from her. I will get a letter that is the same as I have gotten before. It is nothing. It is a funny story that she wrote at school, or something like that. I have literally gotten letters like that - out of nowhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let's see...you are saying that it is an admirable motive to wait until you have got a letter in case you should get information. However, there's part of you that is pretty sure you are not going to get that information.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am not pretty sure about that. It is not that that is the majority of the letters but that that's...it is damn near a 50-50 division. And maybe out of the last 10 letters, I would say seven of them have been of that type. But then, I don't know. After this long spell, maybe she would actually have something to say. It is like, not only am I putting it off...it has already happened that I am mad and I wouldn't be able to say anything about it then but also, if I am mad now and I wouldn't be able to say anything about it then - and I would have gained nothing by then also on top of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just that much further in the hole. Then you have got to sit there with your thumbs up your butt, feel the same frustration and hassles and not have any opening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that sounds like right at this minute you are leaning towards taking an opening now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

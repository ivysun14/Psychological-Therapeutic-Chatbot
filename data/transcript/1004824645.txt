<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) So... (PAUSE) I remember as we were wrapping a couple weeks ago, I was, I was thinking about... (PAUSE) [00:01:03]</p>

<p>I was thinking about observation. I was thinking about being observed by your iPad. As... I haven't really been able to, I don't know, to, to completely tune it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not in an, not in an onerous way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now and again... In fact, the opposite, oddly and very unusually in the sense that it's usually come up... (PAUSE) It's usually come to mind when I feel like I've said something well or been able to articulate something well or been able to articulate something that I want to articulate rather than the opposite which is kind of unprecedented in my experience. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>Now, I don't know. I don't know what to make of that. But it's interesting. It's, it's quite a contrast. Normally observation is very problematic. It... I mean the truth is that ever since I started shrinking my head, I've always really just had this abiding desire to make sure that whatever I say isn't lost. This is in some ways, like the absolute fulfillment of a wish. And, you know, I fantasize, well, you know... There's something, there's something very deeply satisfying about it. So, I don't know, the contrast is a little bit curious to me. You know, when I'm at work, sitting at the office, the sense of observations is almost indescribably oppressive. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>I mean, really, really painful. You know, it's animated. I guess it's a different, it's a different kind of observation, I suppose. But, but even, even the kind of fantasy that there's some inanimate observation, you know, that I don't know, some workplaces like track their employee's, you know, web surfing habits or whatever. It happens that I know the IT director well and hired him back in the day. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just did him a big favor so if it did come to that (inaudible at 00:03:44). But... (LAUGHTER) He's Turkish so we have a, we have a natural rapport.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. So, so even... It's not really a contrast between animate and inanimate. Maybe it's a contrast between the benevolence and the malevolence of the immediate environment. I don't know but it's very striking to me. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least that was, that was the thought I left this...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...little room with (inaudible at 00:04:17). (SIGH) (PAUSE) You know, I, I think to myself... I'll say something that feels like I articulated it well, and I'll think to myself... And I'll fantasize about the transcriber, you know, I'll fantasize about what happens to this afterwards. And that's not exactly where I want to be. I mean, I feel like that being otherdirect in that way is probably not constructive in the way that I would hope and yet, it's hard for me to get rid of it. [00:05:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what happens when the transcriptionist comes across something you articulated well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean what do I imagine happens? I don't know, Ethan. I mean, I think, I think I kind of put it comparatively. Like, you know, of all, of all of the head cases... (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:05:51) agonizingly writing down. You know, somebody in Bangalore is sitting there, "This one's the best." (inaudible at 00:06:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what I imagine. But it's very distinct and it's recurring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very... It's recurring. It's recurring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:06:21)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I remember I had a fantasy once long ago that a guy that I was seeing should write a paper about me. I was that far out. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think the thrust of that fantasy was probably similar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:07:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And normally when, you know, I come up with a weird fantasy of this sort, I feel chastened or (inaudible) (LAUGHTER) I guess my reaction is kind of amusement.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is good (inaudible at 00:07:31).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. (inaudible at 00:07:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something there about the sort of intensity of the focus and observation for you know, whether a company by good judgment or bad... [00:08:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good judgment in the? I see. In that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, whether it's positive opinion or (inaudible at 00:08:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: In this other sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) That seems important but I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) Well I mean I guess there's, there are a couple of things going on here. Number one is what we were talking about on Wednesday. You know, this, this kind of, this displacement or projection. I don't know. Maybe I'm describing this too clinically. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>But, you know, this kind of looking for somebody else to mouth the, you know, the, the self critique or evaluation that's in my head. So that's one thing. You know, I am constantly observed. Not because there's some external force that's doing it but because this is, you know... (PAUSE) It's as if this very normal function of self evaluation has, you know, has been somehow turned into (PAUSE) or confused with or, you know, kind of integrated in a way that's confusing or a little bit disturbing with the parallel function of external evaluation. The ego and the super ego are confused a little bit. I guess... Anyway, whatever. Whatever the, the formulation of it... I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I want. I'm a little tangled. By contrast, the transcriber would not have enjoyed that. [00:10:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well... (PAUSE) I, I actually imagine it, it is kind of a relief and like the humor of it fits in with that, to be able to think about it in a lighter way. Where I'm going is to say, maybe this is kind of a bridge between, I guess what we think of as a usual version of yourself and a more Engelbert (ph) version of yourself in that I think the, one of the key differences involves the really, really cranked up way this operates in the Engelbert (ph) version. [00:12:11]</p>

<p>I think when you're, like in the Engelbert version, the, you know, intensity of that projection is profound.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also that you have no insight into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...at that time, though you kind of do now. [00:13:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, at this point, I'm aware of it, at the moment. I'm not really, I can't really (inaudible at 00:13:09] Okay. I mean, it's easier to be humorous about it when the projection is benevolent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though no more realistic. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:13:45)</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know for sure. I mean, this is a big recurring really troublesome issue the realism or accuracy of my self evaluation, regardless of whose mouth I put it into.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, regardless of whether it's appropriate. It clearly isn't appropriate in most cases to, you know, to, to displace it onto other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But for all that it may be accurate. Or let me put it a different way. For all that, it's accuracy, you know, is kind of unaffected by the fact that it's is displacement is inappropriate. You see what I'm saying? In other words, you know, there are two issues going on here. Number one is how good I am at, you know, at critiquing and number two is, you know, how appropriate it is to imagine that this critique is shared or, you know, originates with somebody else. You know, the second one, you know, I feel confident at this point, is clearly a distortion. [00:15:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, a kind of standing distortion. How good I am, I think is kind of, at doing this or maybe more usefully, in what circumstances, you know, I'm more or less, you know, competent at engaging this kind of critique is kind of a different question. It may also be, you know, equally well a distortion but I don't think that that's established. I think at some times, you know, the evaluation is actually probably relatively close to the moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:15:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe, you know, kind of putting it in pragmatic terms, I need help reality checking those evaluations. You know, even more so, like everybody engages in them. I think one of the problems I'm having is that partly because they are displaced, you know, meaning that all kinds of weird sort of interactive issues come to the fore, I'm not very good or I'm very anxious that at the least about I'm not very good at figuring out how to test them, how to evaluate the evaluations. Is this too convoluted or are you following? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Concretely. So here is an evaluation, you know the, the things that I've said in my, you know, therapy with Ethan are eloquent and somebody would like them. [00:17:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really the issue going on is whether I like them or not. Okay? That, that I'm willing to concede from the outside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not really about what the transcriber, you know, how the transcriber evaluates it. It's about how I evaluate it. Whether I'm satisfied with it or not. And in this case, I'm satisfied. I feel good about them. Now, you know, the following question is, is what I said as, you know, as, as, you know, elegant as all of that. You know, is it novel, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in the broader sweep of, you know, mental patients. What, you know, the facility and, you know, conceptual clarity with which I've approached this thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:17:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That the second question. I guess what I'm thinking is that once, you know, there's some degree of, of insight or lack of insight involved in the, in the initial evaluation where I feel troubled is in, you know, the process of, of, of testing that, that initial insight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, of moving on from it, of, you know, trying to figure out how to do with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) finished writing an essay test or something in college and, you know, you can have this sort of first level level of fantasy about with the professor who is going to say or think in response and then you're kind of owning that one. Like if you feel as though you wrote it well or you did a good job and sort of imagine the professor went, "Oh my God. This is amazing." You know, you're sort of owning that as your feeling but then wondering if I'm following you, sort of how well that's going to match up with the actual critique you get, how... [00:19:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How...</p>

<p>CLIENT: How accurate is it? How reality based it is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is my gestalt about x, y, or z you know, and I feel, I feel unskilled at that, at that process. I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least I feel a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about, you know, the real, my real facility at doing those kinds of evaluations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether... And, and I think I feel this anxiety, whether the evaluation is good or bad. Whether the problem, you know theoretically might be grandiosity or, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...whatever the opposite of grandiosity is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Devaluing. [00:19:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Devaluing. Yeah. I just, I don't feel a lot of confidence. And it may be, you know, my, my sense for whatever it's worth...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is that I'm actually pretty reasonable good at evaluating these things. Certainly good at evaluating these things in other people. I feel, I feel some confidence in that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With regard to myself, I don't know, you know? I feel like, I feel like it's pretty good but I don't know. And because I... It's certainly worse in Engelbert.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's certainly distorted both by the projection, you know, the tendency to project onto other people and by, you know, the just sort of stress of (inaudible at 00:20:47).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand in a way that you're talking about it now, you kind of are enjoying the, like the room, in a way...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Enjoying the room?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...between the sort of, the room, as in room to maneuver...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...between what you recognize as your own projection... [00:21:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and (PAUSE) your sort of openness to what the realities are of what other people think or how other people will respond. And (PAUSE) in, in Engelbert (ph) I don't think there's much of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Say it again. It was probably clear but it didn't (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. It seems to me one thing you're kind of enjoying now is the room to maneuver between the projections you identify, you know, the reactions you recognize yourself giving to other people. And, you know, the uncertainties and possibilities about what do the people actually think. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Room to maneuver, that's an interesting way to put it. Possible distance, the possible discrepancy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And the way that you're now sort of considering both, I think. One that clearly feels like you and then an openness to the possibilities of what's really somebody else.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, which you don't have in Engelbert (ph), I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I see that. (PAUSE) Okay. Agreed. (PAUSE) [00:23:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe there is sort of a strength and an ability to sort of take a risk in appreciating this discrepancy. Say right now, that you lose when you're sort of more in Engelbert (ph) mode. And I think you're much more anxious or afraid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do I lose when I'm in Engelbert (ph) mode?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The distinction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Between inside and outside?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah between what you imagine, maybe even strongly imagine other people to be thinking of you and then the knowledge that you don't really know. (PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so I've just been trying to call it to mind a little bit more...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...concretely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, at some level, the way that it feels is that, it feels just almost on a tangible level is that, you know, there are these observers inside me which, of course, is reasonably accurate description of what's going on. I don't know. There's a, I feel kind of hollow as a result. I feel... It's a very, it's a very distinct and curious sensation. (PAUSE) [00:26:09]</p>

<p>I mean, it's hard for me to, to both call that sensation to mind and apply this train of thought it's very... (PAUSE) This kind of, this level of analysis is difficult to deploy simultaneously in a way that we've already observed. You know, they don't mix very well. This frame of mind and that frame of mind don't mix very well. So I think what you say makes sense. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>I think it makes sense to talk about you know, the lack of room or, you know, the value of space or however you want to think about it. I can't say for sure. I mean, even, even calling it to mind seems to annihilate that value of space. Even, you know, an effort to kind of conscientiously put myself back in that place makes it difficult to say for certain whether this framework is plausible. But I think it is. It seems like it ought to be. I don't know. I don't know where to go with that (inaudible at 00:27:49). (PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p>

<p>I mean this is assuming our interaction is therapeutically useful, this is where we ought to be going with it. You know, that the effort to kind of apply the one to the other is, you know, the theory of what I should be practicing but I'm finding it hard to do it, I guess.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:28:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I was thinking about my struggles with your therapeutic model. And thinking, (inaudible) that one, at least for the moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which struggles did you have in mind?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, does it work? How does it work? Is it plausible? Is it waste of time ? (PAUSE) [00:30:00]</p>

<p>Might I be better off with a witch doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) A few doors down...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Nice. Which discipline? Are they Santeria (ph) or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't remember. (LAUGHTER) I just remember it's a slightly different therapeutic model.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) [00:31:00]</p>

<p>You know, at one point not long ago, Jennie turned to me and she said something like (PAUSE) "Why don't you just go to a psychiatrist and get a pill?" Not quite like that. Something I've been extremely averse to. Curiously, I guess. And I, I suppose I worry...(PAUSE) [00:32:00]</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I started trying to do it this way, this other alternative way. And I worry about persisting with something that's not productive or effective. Purely to validate somebody else's, yours in this case a sense of, you know, their own efficacy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's curious because, you know, the jumping off point for this reflection, of course, was the sense that it does make sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I wonder if part of what's going on is that you sort of lost the thread there? [00:33:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How you were feeling. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lost the thread of how I was feeling in our discussion today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah or maybe I did or maybe both of us did that, you know, we got a little abstract maybe? And I wonder if you felt a little less connected?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you asked me what came to mind and that was in fact what came to mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that I lost the thread in one sense but probably for reasons that are interesting. In other words, you know, the, the trail of our discussion...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...was moving in the direction of kind of putting myself in this very difficult and painful state.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:33:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, that's not a place that I'm very happy to be on the one hand but on the other hand, it's genuinely difficult to, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... try and imply this very analytical framework, you know, conceptual frame, to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to that state of being and so, I mean, I guess you could say in one sense that I lost the thread but I, I guess I lost it for reasons that are interesting. I think that that was probably the place...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...a good place to end up in but on the other hand...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking it was very interesting as well though different ones.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yours are better. Let's go with yours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Generically, that's probably a good idea. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Yeah so you're sort of thinking about remembering a kind of state of feeling that's crummy and difficult and then start thinking like, you know, "Is this valid anyway." [00:35:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Is this a crock?" Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so much, "Is this valid anyway? Is this a crock?" It's more like, "Well, alright. Here's where the rubber meets the road." You know, it's all very well to you know, "The chair is very comfortable and, you know, the light is reasonably good although you don't have much decoration on the wall." You know, this is a pretty benevolent place and, you, I like shooting the shit with you as much as anybody else. You know, I enjoy our conversations. But it's this other place that I really need it and how does that work? And in fact as I try to make this sort of hybridization of, of, of, of these two states of being, I'm finding it difficult even in this setting, let alone in the moment. So, you know, how does it work? I mean, I think that's... [00:36:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that's where the reflection went. And, you know, it's troublesome. It's like, you know, our supposition has to be that the... I don't know. Like insight... Insight is a word that I'm not crazy about but, you know, that the, that the habits of thinking, you know, from one place are transferrable or can be, you know, ultimately deployed, you know, in more exigent circumstances but I don't quite see how it works yet. Or at least I don't see it working quite yet. Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that's the basic theory and I... You know, that sounds like a good idea but I don't quite see it and in this particular instance, I find it very difficult. (PAUSE) [00:37:05]</p>

<p>And even as I say this to you I'm really, you know, I've framed our discussion today in terms of this phenomenon but I'm really finding it difficult to get the transcriber out of my head. And at this moment, that's really troubling to me or troublesome to me. I don't want to be reviewing all of my worries as I speak them and evaluating...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...evaluating them, you know, a second afterwards. I don't want that to be there and it's happening now and I'm not liking it very much. I'm more troubled by it than I was outside of this conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE) [00:38:00]</p>

<p>There's something about, about sort of (PAUSE) pretty closely evaluating what we're both doing in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm comfortable evaluating you and I'm less comfortable (inaudible at 00:38:43).</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:39:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's usually a sign that there's something in the interaction that's uncomfortable. I mean, I guess, you know, I'm thinking that (inaudible) and so forth were you get into that mode is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, once again, the kind of evaluative space, if I can call our transcriber that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is was, it was... The evaluation that was troubling to me just a moment ago was actually a positive one. I just didn't want it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't, I didn't want to be wasting my conscious, you know, relatively precious conscious...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...thought on that kind of a thing. You know, if it's in the background... It's always in the background, you know. It's like that's the way we function but I didn't want it in the foreground. Do you understand what I'm saying? In other words, it was positive. It wasn't, it wasn't like it was, you know, I was (inaudible). [00:40:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want it all the time. It's exhausting, you know, to have the transcriber participating in our conversation all of the time. And I don't, and I feel... I guess at some level, maybe, at some level I feel as if it's not if I'm imagining being observed in this way. My, you know, evaluations or thoughts or behaviors really, like the way that I conduct myself is not genuine. That's interesting. That's what's troubling about it. [00:41:01]</p>

<p>It means that what I'm saying is artificial because it's sort of constructed in a, with a view to evaluation by some external party. Whereas, you know, given, you know, the fact that I'm, I freely acknowledge that's just a sort of... It's a convenience to think of things this way. There's no reason that I should really think of it as artificial. It's not really somebody else that's doing the evaluation. I'm not really sort of orienting myself towards somebody else that's a kind of cognitive fiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's no reason why I should feel as if what's been said in response to that is any more artificial than anything else I ever say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:42:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we're coming to the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We probably have just a couple minutes (inaudible at 00:42:11).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hear a cough outside and I see a little reticence on your part too. Which is probably also a projection. I mean, once you get started this route, you go down this route (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) I don't know. I don't know. It feels very uncomfortable suddenly. I feel less, less able to laugh at that particular kind of projection. And at the same time, I guess... And that discomfort feels incredibly familiar. Very, you like, like this ancient... Very kind of primeval sensation, the discomfort with the tendency to feel observed. (PAUSE) [00:43:15]</p>

<p>But thinking the implications, of, you know, the knowledge that it's projected through I guess, there's no reason... It's the artificiality of it that's uncomfortable. Or the artificiality (inaudible) implies about, you know, kind of my behavior that, that feels troublesome and I guess it's the thought that there's no reason to have that sense of artificiality is kind of new and interesting. I'm intrigued by the possibilities of that observation. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we'll finish up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) Okay. (SIGH) Okay. Interesting. Alright. See you later.</p>

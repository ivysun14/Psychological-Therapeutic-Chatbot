<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so how you been?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good, how have you been?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've been all right.  You got through school?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we had a little rough couple periods.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I got in an altercation at school, so he ended a little bit earlier than the rest of the students.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, they have zero tolerance these days.  Do you get like just in a fight with somebody at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Somebody pushed him and then he turned around, he wasn't the aggressor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he finished—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The fight so, but so both kids were—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand, you know, it happens a lot these days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean even just like a shoving thing, they, did they suspend you for three days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Five days, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The kid got a three day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's, they've got, I mean in the old days, maybe when your dad, I don't know how old you are dad but when I was in school if something like that happened on the playground or at lunch, after school you'd go in the gym, they'd put on boxing gloves, you'd settle it and be done with.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These days they suspend you for five days, you know, for getting into a shoving match so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I was telling him, it's just not worth it and I've been in my fair share of fights and it's just not [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These days it's so different, I mean it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, somebody can pull a gun and then you're done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the schools are so worried about any kind of anything.  I mean I don't know if you heard, there was a, in the paper a while back up in [DEIDENTIFIED], there was some boys that touched a girl inappropriately and the principal, you know, made the report and all, the police came after the principal and said you didn't report it quickly, they were going to convict the principal—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So now all the schools are reporting everything, any little tiny incident because they're afraid they're going to get criminally convicted for not reporting something so my point about that [PATIENT NAME] is that you've got to try to stay out of any of that stuff because they have zero tolerance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was taken to the police—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and that happens more and more so, you know, it's sometimes better just to walk away from people if they're starting something with you and just not even, unfortunately, you know, it's just not worth it so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So anyway, so hopefully if you learn from this one it'll save you some hardship later on down the road so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he lost, he missed five days of school and he has five weeks of summer school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three weeks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so does he get credit for the classes?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, they're going to make him do summer school, so yeah, he's going to move on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But because of this altercation and the year that he had, he's going to have to go to summer school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and when does that start?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	June 2nd.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're leaving for a trip tomorrow so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, where you going?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where are you headed in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that'll be nice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we're down there for a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that'll be nice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, right on the beach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hang out and some fun, then come back and do three weeks of school and you'll be done with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then weight training.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you probably start football pretty soon when you get back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He met the, they've already had a couple of, what do they call those—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mini camps.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Mini camps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really, did you meet coach [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you like him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's a good guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He is a good guy.  I know everybody at [DEIDENTIFIED] is really bummed out that he left because he's their favorite coach.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was showing me how to squat on the bar and he went down and his pants ripped.  It was pretty funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he's, I mean the kids just love him because he's a good guy, he's enthusiastic, they're going to have a good football program over there, so good, and what are you going to play, what position?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying for linebacker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I heard that you guys are going to have, like you'll play varsity, freshman and sophomores against other schools that have freshman and sophomores.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just a smaller division.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We play four senior schools.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, wow, well that'll be pretty interesting.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But they're middle schools.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're 3 A—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're smaller schools—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it's not, you're not going against the seniors.  I don't know if you guys are 5 A or 4 A, I don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're 3 A.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	3 to start with.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	3 to start and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll go up probably.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, what is [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He dropped down from a 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To a 4.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because of the school separating?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, so well that'll be cool.  So that should be fun.  You'll have a good time of it playing football.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now the key is going to be to keep your grades up so you'll be eligible, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if you drop your grades, I mean I don't know if you heard what just happened to the baseball team at [DEIDENTIFIED] this year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They went off to play in the baseball state playoffs, they went over to [DEIDENTIFIED] and got beat by a team and that team [INAUDIBLE], they went on and beat [DEIDENTIFIED] and then they found out they had one of their kids ineligible, they had to forfeit, they were out of the state tournament and so [DEIDENTIFIED] and the other team got to keep playing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so, you know, if you're ineligible, not only can you not play but if the school messes up, the whole team has to forfeit games and stuff so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's really important to keep your grades up.  Now I know I got a call from one of the counselors at school, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She said they were trying to put some kind of program together for you to help you be successful in the next year of high school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did she meet with you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we've had some alternative measures that we're going to try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he's under treatment and because he's, he's going to just be watched, monitored more closely I guess—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Than traditional students.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Because I know like at [DEIDENTIFIED], they even have something, I don't know if they'll have it at [DEIDENTIFIED], called Options 38, did you hear about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was a different program for kids, where instead of having like eight classes every day, they'd have like, I don't know if it was just one class at a time or two and they were really focused so you didn't have to change classrooms all the time, there wasn't as much distraction.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's not that, it's the same traditional classroom—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he's going to meet with his counselor every, or one period a day for the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good, just to kind of help see if there's any issues you need help with or addressed, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then they have pod areas, or pod, oh I can't think of it, where instead of having per academic, or academics, it's going to be you have a math teacher, history teacher, science teacher, they're all together—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So they're not in segregated in their own little groups—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that'll help because the teachers will be able to communicate better and one tactic might work better on [PATIENT NAME] versus another—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or any other students.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, every student learns differently so that's good if they work together.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So are you excited bout going to high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, most kids I know like high school a lot more than middle school for a lot of reasons, you know, there's more options, more classes you can take, you're treated more like an adult, you've given more freedom, more responsibility but what a lot of the kids tell me is, you know, they just feel like they're being treated more like an adult.  The thing you've got to watch out for though is, you know, there's a lot of problems with kids having problems with alcohol and drugs n high school up here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you heard about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's like, [DEIDENTIFIED] is like really high up there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very high.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the top like 100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very high, it's a huge problem, you've got to be real careful.  Kids are getting suspended off the sports teams for going to parties.  I know one kid on the baseball team went to a party and he said he wasn't drinking but they had pictures of him on the internet at the party so he got kicked off for a while, so you just want to really be careful and stay away from that stuff because if you're at a party where they have alcohol or drugs, you can get suspended even if you're not drinking and, you know, it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Guilt by association.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and, you know, there's some kids that are getting real sick.  There are some kids, some athletes over here that have ended up in the hospital with really severe life long problems some of them and so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've just got to be real careful because some kids think it's cool, you know, or some of the popular kids are doing it and you want to be popular and hang out with the other kids and they're just getting in a lot of trouble—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So just try to stay away from all that stuff.  What else?  How have your spirits been overall?  You been feeling up or down or somewhere in the middle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Feeling pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about your energy level, do you feel like you have enough energy, are you tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, I've got a lot of energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is it easy or hard to, well you're done school now but was it easy or hard to concentrate at the end of school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was easy to concentrate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about when you're doing your homework at home, could you stay focused and get it done or would you get distracted, tough to do the homework at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's our biggest problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And is it that, is it that you just don't have any interest in it or is it hard or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I can't stand it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just not interested, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He does really well, I don't understand how he does it, he doesn't do, we've had a problem with homework but yet he'll go do the quizzes and exams and he's 90s, 95s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he knows the information, he's good at it—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He just doesn't realize that even though it might seem redundant and it might be, you know, there's no meaning behind the homework, it still has to be done, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's just certain things that you have to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and [PATIENT NAME] are you thinking about playing college football?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I just learned some issues, my son's interested in playing college baseball and so we just went and visited a college about a month or so ago and what they told us is the days of full scholarships are pretty much over, what they do with kids now usually is give them a partial athletic scholarship and the rest is academic and they said the higher your grades are, the better your GPA is, the more of an academic scholarship they can give you.  Like they were talking about this one program, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED], they said 9 out of 10 kids had a 3.6 GPA or higher, they said that's the first time that's ever happened but that means these guys are getting more money for their grades than they are even for their sports and they said it really improved your chances of getting in a college if you have good grades because they can give you all this extra money from academic scholarships.  You don't have to have straight As but if you're a good student and get good grades, they really look at you even closer because they don't have to, they have more, they don't have a lot of money in athletics these days so they can divide it up and use it better so they're really looking for kids that do well academically so it'll really help your chances.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they look all the way to your freshman year, now everything is under a microscope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing is like it depends on where you want to play too, I mean there are some schools, they'll give you, if you have good grades, I mean I know a guy that went to [DEIDENTIFIED] on a football scholarship, they gave him a full ride to there because he had good grades, it was purely academics—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that's a very expensive school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it is, like $20,000 a year, something ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But they say there are actually more scholarships out there now for kids on academics than athletics—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you have good grades, if you want to play sports, it'll really improve your chances, whereas if you don't have such good grades, you know, they'd look at two kids, this kid, you know, they're equal football players, this kids got a 3.5, this kids got a 2.5, they're going to take this kid because they can use some of their academic scholarship money to get him in the program where this kid, they wouldn't have the money to give him so it's just something else to think about, you know, if you can keep your grades up, it'll improve your chances so, I have a buddy that I played with in high school, down here in the [DEIDENTIFIED], that ended up going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  His brother went to [DEIDENTIFIED] on a partial scholarship, he wasn't such a good student.  His younger brother did pretty well in school, he got a full ride to [DEIDENTIFIED] to play football, so I mean that's the difference grades can make sometimes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it makes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So anyway, what about, are you feeling nervous or anxious much these days at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm a little nervous about going to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, why are you nervous about going to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, just like worried kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want the plane to crash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh okay, just the traveling stuff.  Have you been to [DEIDENTIFIED] before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, have you flown before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you've flown.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It still scares me though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it, yeah, but you'll be good once you get on the plane and get going and get excited about it.  You're leaving tomorrow you said [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is that, like a five or six hour flight?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's an hour to [DEIDENTIFIED], then we have a two hour layover and then it's a five and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We won't get there till—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Eight o'clock at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you'll get there, it'll be warm though and you'll smell the ocean, it'll be nice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it'll be interesting, it'll be interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what about, are you enjoying yourself just in general, you know, stuff you do with friends and all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've been hanging out with my girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Does your girlfriend go to the same school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she's going to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is she going to be a freshman too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What else?  Any problems with medication at all?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I still think he gets a little edgy but it's not as bad as it used to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Can you tell—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I think it's when, a day when he's told he has to do something and then he uses the excuse that I'm still trying to control my anger management, you know, I'm trying to do this and he's using it more of a crutch than it is, you know, a time of, you know, transition I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean maturity, the medication is helping to a point but sometimes I just, sometimes I wonder if it is and then I go back and verify did he miss some medication, I know it won't show the levels stay in his system pretty significant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One of the things I was wondering about is should we even try making a change in medication because one of the things we could think about is getting you off the Depakote which sometimes can cause people to feel a little bit tired, maybe gain a little weight sometimes but not muscle necessarily, and try something that wouldn't make you so tired, maybe wouldn't cause that kind of weight gain.  Are you feeling like you want to try maybe making a change to see if you might feel a little better?  How do you feel about that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How do you feel?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't care.  Just when, the more he tells me to do something I don't like, I just, I just get mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get mad, okay.  Well what is something would help you, what I'm thinking about we could try is this medicine called Lexapro, have you ever heard of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What it can do for people and people have told me this from their experience, they say they still get mad about things but they can think before they react, whereas in the past they would just react out of anger, now they can think before they react so they can decide, let's see, do I want to yell at that principal or do I want to say yes sir, you know, and get mad when I'm not around him or something like that, so it gives them a chance to think before they react and also, like I said, it's a little bit less sedating, people don't feel quite as tired as they might with Depakote and I think with you going into football, you probably want to have as much energy as you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so, I mean if we wanted to make a change, this would be a good time to do it, over the summer, before you're back in school in the fall.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think so because what happens is if he crosses that line—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's hard to bring him back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He just stays angry for a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], what do you think, what I'm thinking is if you would try it and you don't like it, we could always go back or stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to try something a little different though, I think, because you're really, the Depakote, I'm not sure it's the best medicine for you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah that's, I mean that's a carry on from—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah and I just don't know if that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it can have some side effects over time, they're rare but they can be serious ones, it can affect the liver, the pancreas, so I'd really—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Remember, diabetes runs in our family so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so for a lot of reasons, I'd like to kind of get you off that one if we could and if we could find something else to work as well or better with less risk, it kind of makes sense to try that maybe, does that sound okay with you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do we keep on with the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For right now I think we would, you know, over time, you know, I'd like to find the least amount of medicine that works.  The Abilify and Lexapro work really well together, they kind of compliment each other and the Abilify kind of, enhance or increase the benefits of the Lexapro, so if it works well, oh I'm just thinking, you're leaving tomorrow morning?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I don't want to do a ninety day supply, it's just too expensive to go—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean so it'll be two weeks, so if we do it, we'll let you know when we start it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, once you get back, that'd be the best thing to do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well because it takes ten days, fourteen days for mail order.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, oh yeah, I was going to say I could give you some samples but you don't want to take samples to [DEIDENTIFIED] with you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can just wait till you get back, we can do the mail order when you get back, you can start it then, how's that sound?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So you'll write the script for today?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I sure will, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll write it today.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then I can send it off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've got to get a new prescription pad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, do we, what benefits or side effects or concerns that we need to work on with this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With Lexapro there are almost none, I mean occasionally people may feel a little queasiness the first day or two as they get used to it or a little mild loose stools but most people don't even get that and if people do get it, it usually goes away within a couple days.  Any other side effects, occasionally people notice a little decrease in appetite but people don't usually lose weight on it and one uncommon side effect, maybe 1 in 20 people notice they sweat a little bit more and if you're playing football, you may sweat a little more or some people sweat like only at night or some people say only from the neck up or something, you know, it's just kind of one body part sometimes or one time of day they can sweat but it's pretty uncommon and it isn't usually a problem for people, they just sometimes notice it.  It doesn't have any bad side effects.  It doesn't affect the liver or the pancreas or any internal organs, anything like that, it's a real safe medicine and most people like it because it doesn't cause side effects usually.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's safer than the Depakote, less risk of side effects, less problems associated with it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What about chemical reaction with Retina A, or not Retina A—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Accutane.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Accutane?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No problems at all, if anything it would maybe potentially counteract some of the side effects of Accutane because they say Accutane sometimes can cause a little bit of depression.  Lexapro is an antidepressant so if anything, it would counteract that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay and that just keeps him a little bit more level or they don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does a couple things, yeah, it helps people not get as irritable or as angry, it kind of, say it raises the floor so people don't sink quite as low when they get upset—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it reduces irritability so people just don't get upset as easily—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are the main benefits of it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But it's an upper or a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's not an upper in the sense it won't make him feel happy and euphoric like taking, you know, speed or Dexedrine or something like that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll just, it'll keep him, hopefully, from dropping down as low—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or being as irritable.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if it works, you won't feel like you're taking medicine at all [PATIENT NAME], you'll just feel better most of the time and if you're feeling better, it may be easier to get through things like if you have homework that you've got to do, it might make it, it won't do your homework for you but if you can, you know, stay focused and stay on task, it might be a little easier to get it done so it won't be as unpleasant maybe, does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And what kind of dosage are we looking at?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	10 mg a day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I'm a little concerned about, 750 mg just seems like so much, because that's what he was on of the Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and that one, what we can do is we probably, I'm just thinking, do we stop it now or wait till you get back from [DEIDENTIFIED].  The advantage of stopping it now is it'll get out of your system over the next two weeks.  The only disadvantage is if it is helping some and you stop it now, you'll lose those benefits while you're gone and you won't be on Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why don't we stop it when we, what's the transition period because he'll be in summer school as well?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that wouldn't be a problem, we can just stop the Depakote whenever, we don't have to taper off of it, so if you want to wait till you get back from [DEIDENTIFIED] and then stop it, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What if we switched now when we're in [DEIDENTIFIED], do you have samples to take us for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I have plenty of samples, I just don't know if they'll let you take them in, like because it's not a prescription then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, that's what I was concerned about too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the only problem, at the border they may have problems, it'd be more coming back actually probably than going.  That's where I don't know if you'd run into trouble or not because if you don't have a prescription bottle traveling overseas, usually they want a prescription bottle that's labeled.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, because I was thinking about that coming back, I'm like we have to take all these pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's where it's good to have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So coming back would be an issue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you don't have a prescription bottle, it could be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But going there you don't think going through customs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think they'll, when we've gone to [DEIDENTIFIED] they haven't even checked our luggage going down there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why don't we do that and then we'll just take, because those are usually a weeks supply anyway, correct?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're going for how long again [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're coming back Friday, so we're leaving tomorrow and coming back—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, what I could do is I could give you a box of samples to take with you, that would work and then give you another box for when you get back—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you could get back on them, that works, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  What's that from?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Dry skin.  You have to use lotion, it's called—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there's two weeks worth, one to take with you and one for when you get back, then I'll write you out a prescription for the ninety day and then the Depakote, you can just stop it, it'll taper itself out of your system over about a week or so, just gradually.  10 mg, if you get down there and you do have any kind of queasy stomach or anything like that from the medicine, you can cut those pills in half, just take a half a pill for a week and then when you get back start on the full one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's not very likely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we don't need him to get it out of his system before we starting taking this other stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you can overlap them—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's no problem with that at all because they don't interact.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Abilify is helping a lot but we're running low again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You wrote a ninety day script—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I think it was take 1 or 1/2 of one or 1—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah 1/2 to 1 a day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They only gave us 30 pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they should have given you 90.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, they only gave us 30, so I don't know if it'd be easier just to, from what Safeway tells us is our insurance only will authorize half a months worth of supply without getting a doctor's approval or a doctor's consult.  I'm like he wrote the script so what approval do you need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, usually if there's a problem, they'll call me and let me know and I'll—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They only gave me, we only had 30 pills so we're low now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want me to write you another prescription for that one too then?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, if you don't mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not at all.  Now are you getting it filled at Safeway again?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, yeah, so we'll probably need a double.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One for 30 and one, well the ninety day I wrote had three refills on it so that one you should be able to just call in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, so I'll call them again, okay, and if you could just write one for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thirty days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But they're going to give me a hard time again, I know they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they do, tell them to call me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's what I said, I go what do you need for, something like prior authorization or preauthorization, I go, I don't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we have pretty good insurance, I don't know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  So I'll write for 30, I'll put a couple refills on here just in case you ever need them—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, that makes a big difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that way at least you'll have a back up, don't have to run out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It helps, I mean he gets wound up at nighttime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's always been a night person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  And are you still using the Ambien for sleep at all?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, that's what I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, the Ambien you're talking about, I thought it was the Abilify.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay, not a problem, they sound an awful lot alike.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, it's the Ambien.  The Ambien is the one that they only do a half—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now I gotcha, yeah, the Ambien, what they'll probably do, all the companies, the insurance companies have these funny rules, what I can do, are you taking 1 or 2 of the Ambien usually?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're cutting them in half, he takes a 10—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We bought a pill cutter which is a pain in the butt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You have to cut them in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I wrote for the 5s but they gave you the 10s instead probably, is that what happened do you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I'll write for the 10s again, I'll write for 30 and we'll see if they'll give them to you, then you can cut them in half if 5 is enough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, Abilify, we have a ton of Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because we cut the Abilify because he's only on 10 mg and we've got, or 5 mg—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The big pills?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The blue ones, the little blue ones, I think you wrote him for 10 and we cut them in half because he was only on 5.  Is that what we were supposed to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abilify we went up to 10 like in early April, we increased it to 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well then we screwed up, we're still only on 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we need, we can't cut those anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know what I would say then, if you're only taking 5 now, why don't you stick with that since we're changing other medicines.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, okay and then we can adjust later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can adjust later, that way we don't have too many changes all at once.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I screwed up, I screwed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay, no harm done.  Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You always get so quiet when you get in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so we've got Ambien, change to 10 mg, so then hopefully they'll give you a months worth, and I put five refills on that so it'll be good for six months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the directions, I put 1/2 to 1 at bedtime as needed for sleep so if 1/2 does it, you can stay at that, if it doesn't, you can take a full one.  Then the Lexapro are 10 mg, you can start with 1 a day and then if there's any problem with that call me but it's one of the best tolerated medicines so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's both of those.  Any questions about either one of those [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, then why don't we check back and, again, with the Depakote, you can just stop it, you don't have to taper it or anything like that, it'll taper itself over a week—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	While you're down in [DEIDENTIFIED], it'll be leaving your system, so my hope is you'll have a little bit more energy while you're down there too, you know, so you can enjoy, you don't have to get up and run around or anything but just feel better while you're on vacation, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then let's check back maybe in a month or so, once you've been on this medicine for a while to see how it's working, okay</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's see now, today's the 23rd, so the 23rd  of next month.  Will you be in summer school then?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, let's, can we move to the first week in June?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To the first week in July?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You said five weeks or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was thinking towards the end of the June but we can go into July if that's better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah, that works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I can either do like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah, you, oh never mind, I'm thinking it's the beginning of May, it's already the end of May, I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know, time is flying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to do either like Tuesday, July 1st or we can go into the next week, July 7th.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That works, a Friday though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A Friday, okay, yeah, because Friday is the 4th so I'll be out of town then.  Why don't we do Friday the 11th?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, we can either do, let's see here, do you want to do an afternoon time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Late is better for you [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm off all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I've got one thirty in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One thirty then we can avoid all this traffic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I couldn't believe how much traffic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I heard it's bad today.  Well I was thinking, it's the Friday before Memorial Day too, I'll bet a lot of people are getting out of town probably.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's, my laptop crashed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I'm going, I need internet service, I'm just going to go to Walmart.  I wanted to go to Best Buy but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We can go to Best Buy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, there's a card.  Again, if you have any questions, any problems, just call me but I think this will be a real smooth transition, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good seeing you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Again, I apologize about our last mishap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it happens.  So have a good vacation, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	All right, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not mine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, see you later.  Bye bye.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry, I'm a little late.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No big deal. All those chairs and (inaudible - 0:00:08.5) of stairs (inaudible - 0:00:10.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you can, if you want, when you walk back down the hall -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible - 0:00:16.2). I would rather walk up the stairs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I usually take the elevator. That's because I must do it about five times, six times a day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you should do it, it's good exercise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really feel improved today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit, it's good it's the end of the week. Things have kind of been in a hassle so but anyway. I'm going to miss my ten bucks too. Because I'm good (inaudible - 0:01:03.2). This summer I'll buckle down, I guess. I talked to Jen, a girl whose father died, and the girl I had had experience with. I said was going to talk to her. It was fun, nice talking to her. She was rather surprised.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was kind of, you know like it was - in a way the conversation got to be a little bit disgusting. She's going back to school too and she's in a Master's Program and she's going into counseling and all this stuff so I told her that I was coming here and she was really interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She was asking me all sorts of questions, what are you doing and all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, she says oh I'm really surprised and she said out of like the four of us, between her, Sara, and Tanya and I, she said I thought you would be the last to go and I said oh yeah and she said yeah. Because I really didn't (inaudible - 0:02:33.5) problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she says what was the problem and like I couldn't bring myself around to saying it and she was oh you having, were you having an identity problem and I immediately I said no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt like I should have said yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I said no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know like that, you know I just kind of I thought well why didn't I say yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:03:03.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were kind of like you really just didn't want to take about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she, it was even getting further as far as the more the conversation went on the more uncomfortable I got. She was saying that, we were talking about what we were going do this summer, she said she was going to go to Mexico and I said oh that's great. I said are you going with your cousin Chris, because her cousin is running this trip down to Mexico.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said no, she wasn't going with him, she was going with a girlfriend, she said his trip is too expensive and he's just staying in all the first class things and all this stuff. And then she said something about, this is her second or third time going down to Mexico and I said so and she said well you know that there is a big gay beach down in Mexico  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I said no I didn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said yes in Acapulco where he happens to be going  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - there's supposed to be a big gay beach and I said oh are you saying that Chris is gay and she says yes I think so. And I said oh that's news to me and I know him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:04:24.8). If it did I really didn't think about it that long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then she was, she was responding on the subject and she said something like well I don't know if he really is and she says I have no fact or anything like that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and she says if he is he's not really going out that much so, he's not really that gay or something, I don't know something to that extent. She says well he does have some friends that live on Detroit Avenue or something  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that no one has met. And she said oh he had this friend who he went to high school with and they were very, very close. They never started seeing one another again it was kind of like a heart break or something. So then I said well, she says well ... no she says well I really don't care she says as long as Chris is happy and I said what do you think is going to make him happy and she says well, she says if he decides, if he's really going to be gay, just to be gay  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Al the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - but she said I don't think that Chris would do that because Chris is afraid of what other people think  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and Chris may just get married or something like this just to save face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought to myself well god, it sounded like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess she was talking about him but  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - it sure ran true for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think it really upset you a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It did, it really did and I thought, oh shit. And like I don't know if she, all I could say was yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's nothing that, I couldn't say anything else about the whole subject. And I thought to myself oh Christ I hope I'm you know like, I hope it's not me. I just hope that I'm doing something just to save face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said no I'm not I can't be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you mean it's kind of like, with this whole thing with Tanya  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - made you think my god maybe I'm just doing this to save face.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of raise some kind of doubt about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it really did. And then (inaudible - 0:06:52.90 after that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how did you, I mean when you think about a thing with Tanya as being a possibility (inaudible - 0:07:03.1) a possibility it might be some kind of face saving  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - does that seem right to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it doesn't seem right. It doesn't, like it seems really rotten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's probably not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope I just seem ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sense you feel anxious that it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I never really thought about it until she had brought up the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Listen just in your own possibility you never even considered it until she raised as a possibility  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - with Chris  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - shoot maybe I'm doing this thing too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, really, really. And she said oh if they end up getting married she says you hear of so many people breaking up because of something like this and all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that kind of scared you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It really  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not the way you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - no it's not, it really isn't. I just, I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't and then I thought ... and I kept on thinking about it and thinking about it, and I was getting more and more depressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I called up Tanya and talked to her for awhile and kind of calmed me down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Made you feel better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Made me feel a little bit better but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of (inaudible - 0:08:14.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't even talk to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it raised a lot of worries.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, uh-huh. It just, really just freaked me out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what felt so good to me  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and now is somehow kind of, it felt like you were being undermined by this doubt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. You know it's like rather a deflation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like, I guess the question there for you is somehow raise the doubt what am I doing this and in my nature gay or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm trying to disguise it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And I came out and said well I said well why would I be going through all this if I really wanted to be and why would I and I said I've tried it and I've always felt miserable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So why would I just go on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just keep on telling myself these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like why would you, if you really want to be gay you wouldn't be making, you know how it feels to (inaudible - 0:09:12.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also you know that like you don't feel like you being with Tanya I mean it's enjoyable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But then I thought to myself I do worry about what people think and I would be concerned about that, and I thought about that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean kind of fits there well I'm the person who worries about what all the people think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really kind of sensitive thing, you know some confidence  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - to believe in yourself. Well, it fits  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the kind of way you are now kind of struggling with (inaudible - 0:09:54.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. That's the truth, that's the truth. It has really been a hell of a day. You know like I just keep on having this hassle within myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Kind of like you're going through the day to hassle (inaudible - 0:10:15.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. And I keep on saying this at all and that and I don't want to be, it's lousy, it stinks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a hell of a way to live.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like every time that possibility raises that big question mark you want to say no but I know it's not so I mean I don't want that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You make this a struggle going on like you feel very unsure and you having to tell yourself no  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - I don't want to be gay  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and not doing it to save face.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. I just keep that, just going and saying it over and over again. And then when she was saying like before this one she was saying that I was the last person that she expected  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and she was, the first one I should think should have gone to seek help was Tanya and I said oh yeah and she says yes she says you know her, her, what term did she use, kind of like (inaudible - 0:11:45.4) or social outlook on life  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - how she feels close to other people and stuff like this. And she feels, she says she has really got a thing about her and I says yeah I know this. I said I know like if you don't really know her the minute you meet her and that she's this bright, the minute as you get to know her and I said well Jen she's not this way around me and she said something like well you're not going to be with her alone all the time  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - or something like this. And Jen said I know Tanya too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said yes I said I know this whole thing I said if we ever think, if we decide to get married I said we'll hash it out before then and she said hash it out nothing and she said you could tell her until she's blue in the face that she gets going and same impression (inaudible - 0:12:42.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said oh. She says yeah she says I'm serious and she goes I, she says I could go too  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - for that matter. And that kind of disturbed me too. All in all it was a very depressing conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Kind of like her she was kind of saying to you that Tanya would  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and made you feel unsure about that to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. It was just like a very unsure conversation. I said Jen for Christ sake you don't even sound like you're happy for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she was (inaudible - 0:13:17.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here you are feeling happy and she was just sticking pins all over you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the thing Tanya kind of she should have known that, the thing about bothering you (inaudible - 0:13:29.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah. It was really something else. And I said for Christ sake am I not facing up to reality or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it kind of, it even kind of made you feel well maybe I'm deceiving myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of like you were feeling really good and it's kind of like it made everything made you question everything about how real you were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or real how things you were doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of makes you feel kind of similar to lost I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does, it really does. (inaudible - 0:14:31.0). I'll be what I want to be, just to be what I want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what you want (inaudible - 0:14:43.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess kind of like (inaudible - 0:14:49.0) I guess kind of inside somewhere you know that is what you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not really (inaudible - 0:15:02.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. There wouldn't be a question but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you wouldn't feel that kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the truth, that's the truth. But then I thought maybe, I thought well maybe it was because I was engaged in homosexual activity that this would strike home that she would say something to me. But if I was really sure of myself then it really wouldn't even bother me, it shouldn't bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, admit well, the thing ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because I was engaged in homosexual activity and they have always said that a homosexual can never truly become a heterosexual, from what I've heard. I don't know if it's true or not. I just, I think my now myself I think that if someone really puts his mind to it he can change  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - there's nothing that really stops him, but this every book and paper you pick up about the subject there's always well, they really don't change and if they do change it's always something like they have asexual  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - or whatever is it bisexual, I mean. And, what was I going to say? Maybe that's why when she said that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that's why I got.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She kind of raised all those things that you read  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - as fact or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she was kind of raised and her saying that kind of raised maybe those things I read are true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right because I never thought about them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:16:54.7). The thing is (inaudible - 0:17:01.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I read but I read it somewhere sometime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know why most people are homosexual aren't homosexually really I mean they engage in homosexual activities and they enjoy it but it's kind of, it's only kind of replacement, that has kept them or things that kept them away from women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they look to men and they start to enjoy it. It's kind of like people enjoy sex  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - like when you had homosexual experiences it was a releasing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it wasn't probably didn't feel like the preferred (inaudible - 0:17:37.5) what was enjoyable was probably the release aspect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the release aspect through the women you found (inaudible - 0:17:47.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Enjoyable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's just, because people have had homosexual experiences doesn't mean they are homosexuals, I mean that's something I'm not sure if you see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. I never heard it before though. I'm glad you said it, but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean at least according to the surveys  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - research, just some so many people have had homosexual experiences who are not homosexuals any more  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - because it's not an economic thing at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They have homosexual experiences because it's almost in a vacuum of having other kinds of experiences where people can, if the problem is most people can't change to kind of getting themselves overcome their hang ups and try something different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they are becoming real homosexuals.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Well, that's reassuring. Really. I can understand what, why that would be true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If someone would try something different or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and you could have seen that happening too except you really wanted it, because you were very frightened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:19:07.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you knew that you didn't feel good afterwards at least until the pleasurably releasing at the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might have been able to overcome your feeling about not feeling bad afterwards and then you might have been gone that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah that's true, that's true. That makes sense. I've always, there must be degrees of everything including homosexuality or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because just you never, you just ... I would be interested to see if there is really like a real homosexual could change. Like when, when it is possible for him not to change  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and when is it possible ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there some kind of critical (inaudible - 0:20:08.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like a critical period you know like if he can change or can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I always even well, I've always even, I've always said that I don't want to be, because I never really, I just always have said I don't want to be. I don't want to be but here I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That guy who was trying to make me smell this stuff  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - he called a couple of weeks ago, I forgot to mention this. He said he was sorry and all this stuff, his apology and I said I accept your apology and he said oh yeah no I'm really sorry and I said I'm Christian, I accept your apology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he says well something about calling me again or something and I said well just forget it and he says well what do you mean. I said well I'm just forgetting that way of life. He said oh you are? And I said yes it's really I should be thanking you  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - for turning it off even more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he says well, he kind of like doubted me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you could really do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I could really do it. In fact he said that he was going to call back and I said you can call back and I said I'll talk to you but if I see you it will be on the street and that's about it. And I said I enjoyed talking to you but that's about it, as far as it goes. And I felt good telling him this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You also say that was kind of like a premonition.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right it was it really was and I said if you want to see me again I'll go out to lunch with you or something and talk  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and see you but that's about it, I said you're a good conversationalist. But it was interesting and he said well I'm going to call back, I said well go ahead that's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Sort of have kind of like, like you recall that time and place and when he calls back I kind of sense will you probably feel the same way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right I'm sure I will. I mean especially towards him as far as the last time I saw him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I said, I said okay I accept your apology but I won't forget it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:23:14.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, I won't forget it either. (inaudible - 0:23:53.4) interesting life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:23:59.2) tunnel pictures from the (inaudible - 0:24:00.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:24:07.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little weak.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. Oh Jen says what type of therapy are you going to? And I said well I don't know, it has been a long time since I took any (inaudible - 0:24:21.8). Well, I'm in it now. I said okay well. And she says well are you going is it Freudian, is it (inaudible - 0:24:29.7) or is it, what's the other one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:24:34.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. The one that begins with, it's an S and it's a man's name a name of a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An S?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's an S. I think he had something to do with a token thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh (inaudible - 0:24:46.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's behavior (inaudible - 0:24:49.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And I said well I'll tell you I just talk and I figure things out for myself. She said well it's (inaudible - 0:24:56.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And she says great. And I said why? And she says oh that's kind of nice she says, if you're going Freudian or (inaudible - 0:25:07.9) you've got kind of screwed up or something. And she said well the university has been known for (inaudible - 0:25:16.6). She also said something, the last time I talked to her and I said that I would call her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I never called her because we were suppose to go I think to a play or something  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was going to her, Tanya and I, we were going to go to this play and I said well I'll give Tanya a buzz and see what she has to say and Tanya didn't want to go, she didn't want to see Jen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that just kind of blew it right then and there so I haven't called her back. And then ... that's why she says, that's why she said she was really surprised for me to call and I said well Jen I said I was going to call and she said well you said last time you were going to call too  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and you never did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said the reason I didn't call she said was because she said I knew that you were in the middle and I didn't want to put you in the middle again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The reason she didn't call?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't call me back because she said ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Put in the middle  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - of a conflict  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - between her and Tanya.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, between her and Tanya. And I says well I'm making up my own mind now Jen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's says fantastic it's great. After that conversation I don't know if I want to even see her again if she is going to be depressing like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: She just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you think about seeing her again boy is she going to say things that are going to make me feel so lousy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she is suppose to be so perceptive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. And she is, she really is freaky. And that's the reason probably said I had, thought I had an identity problem because I thought I had an identity problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when I denied it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's also kind of a perpetual thing to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything could be an identity problem, that's true too. Yeah, I thought about that too. Well, I don't think she meant it I knew what she meant, I really kind of knew what she meant. And she was always she was spreading she was broadening her horizons and she has met a lot of people meaning that she said about this gay beach she said and then oh she said something about her cousins in Baltimore too and she said oh that's gay too. I said Jen what is this, I mean you're finding all these places that is suppose to be filled with gay. She says oh I met a lot of different people. And I says oh Jen are you turning gay and she says no. I said I didn't think you could. There is no way that she would. She said no I just know a lot of different types of people. She said I'm enjoying it. I said good. She would be, she is much more broadminded about the whole thing rather then Tanya is also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She really ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she can, yeah, what she said well it's fine for Chris if he wanted to be gay and really feel fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. And she meant it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She really meant it, but she said no that wouldn't be Chris.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:28:35.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she knows him right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could be gay (inaudible - 0:28:39.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she really means it. And I was talking to Tanya yesterday, she called up and she says oh do you want to go out she was bored and I said it was just air kind of avoiding the question because I really didn't want to go out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just wanted to talk to her (inaudible - 0:29:48.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well yeah. I was just talking to her but she really wanted to go out. And I had my laundry to do and I was tired and everything else but then we got down to it and I said I'm really tired and I said I want to cut you an hour and then I have to do my laundry and all this stuff. I thought to myself, I thought well fine, I really, any other time I probably would have went over there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said fine I really just didn't feel like going out and I said if I went out I would probably be miserable anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, and I said well, I said are you pissed off about it and she says no. I said well you're not pleased are you? And she says no. And I said well I'm sorry, but I just don't want to, it kind of felt good to say no. I've been pissing yes all my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you've been kind of going along being the good boy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, just saying yes all my life and I'm tired of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and kind of not really doing what you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right what I really feel like doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really didn't feel like going out and dragging yourself  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and just felt like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taking a nap.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We get safe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I said no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:31:02.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it really, it really didn't matter to me that much. I asked her if she was pissed, she says no but she was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it really just tired of saying no, tired of saying yes I mean. Even like when I was in high school and there was always like girls who needed dates, always, because they knew I would say yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And some dogs too, I mean really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't say no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just couldn't say no. Well, and like my sister and my mother would say come on the poor girl doesn't have a date  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of going along  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: - yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you hated to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh the poor girl doesn't have a date, how would you feel if it were your sister or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember one of the girls across the street saying well the minute the girls see that you're going out and they see you going out with these girls and I said but they're really dogs and she said well the dogs (inaudible - 0:32:08.5) then the real nice looking girls will start asking you. I had no nice looking girl ever ask me. Well, one did, yeah one. And that, and I said to her what was piss poor advice. I just kept on going out with dogs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of (inaudible - 0:32:29.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of gone along and it makes you feel good at times about yourself to kind of stand up for yourself  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And say no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and say no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of dragged into things, I guess when you keep saying yes all the time it kind of makes you feel like not so good about yourself  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - because it's like I can't observe myself like I want to please more then I want to do what I want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah, uh-huh. Just to say, just say forget it. Even at home I was the same way too. They asked me to do something I would do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the thing is they knew it and they just take advantage. Of course, my mother said to me that, one time she said, well that's right, she said we'll always know that you're there, big old dependable one and I said just wow. And she said there's nobody else in the family that I can really depend on and who know  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - would really do it. And I always have and I can really understand why she would feel that way, because I would always be there. My brother, Christ he shoot you got out of bed you were lucky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just and my sisters were the same way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:33:58.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really they just do what they want to do and they could care less about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Made you kind of feel like you wanted to do what you wanted to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, really, really. Even when ... at Christmas time or birthdays I always made sure that everybody a gift or something. Shit, they didn't give you nothing. And I still do it though. I don't know why as if I'm looking for something from them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like I'll be good and nice  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:34:34.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They'll care for me, yeah right, yeah right. And it's just like the fact that they really couldn't care less. I really I don't really think that they cared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes you kind of  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - feel like you must (inaudible - 0:34:50.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So people will care about you enough  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - to feel bad things about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Of course, I always did more for my sisters then I've done for my brother because it was like a competitive thing and I could say no to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he screwed me up himself. The many times that whatever I said yes to oh god lending me taking my bicycle and cracking up my bicycle. And we always wore the same size  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - until now he's fat. But we always wear the same size, he would run out with something of mine, he would come back and would have something spilled all over it and I would kill him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like he was really you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But now, well now, he called up and send him $200 and I was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you kind of wish you could have said no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, at that point I was happy to say yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just I thought well he's going to school and if he's really doing something worthwhile it really didn't bother me to say yes then. I think I was kind of happy to say yes. And then he said he was going to, he got his income tax back and he was going to pay me back and I said you need the money now you can pay me back when you really got it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was kind of happy to say yes then. But I mean all the times I lent him $5 (inaudible - 0:36:18.7). Another thing that bugged me I was, it was my last on Saturday a week before last or something it was my sister's anniversary, I was at my parents' house because my mother called me up again and said she didn't have a car  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - because my father was working and she had to go to the store because she was throwing this shower the next day and, of course, I (inaudible - 0:36:58.4) over there and I really didn't want to, but the good boy did it again. So I said oh it was Patricia's anniversary so I went and I bought a couple bottles of Champagne and they were suppose to come over, my sister and brother-in-law. Well, my sister just came over to drop some chairs over and that was it so I gave her the Champagne  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I saw my brother-in-law the next day and he didn't even say thank you, hello, good-bye, go to hell  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No appreciation at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing at all. I said you bastard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I didn't but I sure as hell would have liked to. I said I went out of my way, so I bought you a bottle of Champagne it wasn't nothing but I deserved a thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like, like you really see yourself kind of extending yourself  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - but kind not even getting (inaudible - 0:37:50.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least thinking about them. It's more they do for me. They could care less. And I sent my sister a card and I was wondering if she got, I said did you get my card? She said oh yeah thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like what does it mean (inaudible - 0:38:09.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:38:10.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like nothing, like nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And still I'll just go on doing the same shit. Why, I don't know. My youngest sister, she's kind of she's a little more at times a little more considerate. Like she sees something that she knows that you will like she'll pick it up and say I bought you something or something like that. And why it has to be material things I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of bugs me too. She made a rock for me, it was really nice and I really appreciated it for my birthday and it was a rock she put tissue paper all over it and wrote all over it and everything, it was really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I really like it and I really appreciated it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she didn't have any money and she can't go out  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least she cared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, at least she cared enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she didn't have any money  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - but it's a lot, sometimes it's a lot easier to buy something  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - than to make something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the truth. And it was really nice, I really cared about it, a simple rock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It kind of made you feel good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kept that kind of appreciation  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you feel you give to people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get some of it back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My mother is that way though too, my father is the same way. They'll do anything for anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your father?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother and father, they'll do anything for anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I have always noticed that they'll do more for anybody else then their own kids or their own family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like the people who they're not so sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It was always just oh she, like anything for anybody. She knew someone needed something or someone needed money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:40:15.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, yeah. My father is the same way yeah. They really would, they did favors upon favors. And people really appreciated it and stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now I notice that it's changing around  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that they're doing a lot more for us. I guess because we're grown and we're on our own and they know that we need things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are a lot of things that we need because a lot of times my mom or my dad will always pick up stuff for me, help my sisters. That must have been the way that we were brought up though. You always say yes, you always do what you were told.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Especially I remember kind of like (inaudible - 0:41:06.1) you didn't know if he really cared because he didn't understand  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:41:10.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just wanted to do anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To kind of get any kind of reinforcement or caring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe if I do this, you don't think it out this way  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - like he must never care for me (inaudible - 0:41:23.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or I'll get the caring that I want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the truth, really. We were always taught though you do what you're told to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Obey.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just obey.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of like but that affected you were encouraged never to  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - never be on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never be on your own, really it didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:41:44.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someone is always going to tell you what to do and by god you're going to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're going to do it, right. And they're the same way themselves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like what you're saying a couple of weeks ago about like it's so much easier for you to do things when someone, I feel some kind of external pressure to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That kind of it follows.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And I really learned the opposite that if you don't say anything nothing is going to get done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just stand there and no one is going to notice you or and you're not going to get anything done so speak up and say something. But that's it's not the way that they work, my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They don't work like it's, they do their job every single day and they'll come home and they'll complain about it and shit like that. I said well why don't you say something, you don't have to  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't have to. Well, if you see the number of guys waiting out in that line for a job and stuff like this, no one is expendable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:42:46.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. They aren't going to lose their job and all this stuff and just going on dealing with it, they want to be. Sad, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but for yourself you would rather not just  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would rather not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - just  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - a yes ma'am.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To everyone's expectations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Might be of a mouse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of yeah (inaudible - 0:43:12.0), kind of like timid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Run away from anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not literally running away but it's running away but not asserting yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the truth, that's the truth. Well, anyway I'm going to summer school this summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm taking art classes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of art?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're like they're free and the Board of Education is offering it. One is ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are they related to teaching?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Teaching art.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Teaching art.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Art education.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One is fibers and textures, I think and one is paper experimentation and one the art of fine print making or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is sort of, it's really ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you get to learn how to do the (inaudible - 0:43:59.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, yeah. And I always wanted to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoyed it in college, I enjoyed art.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like I was always had so many other things you really  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - couldn't spend that much time doing it. I thought hell this is free and they supply all of your equipment and all your supplies. You get three college  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you get three hours for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's kind of like a fun kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, something that is really relaxing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like reading books  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:44:26.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know one of the men who is teaching it who is the Art Consultant at in this area and he's really good  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - really a dynamic person. I said well if he's going to teach one of the courses it would really be worthwhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it kind of sounds like there's something  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - nice and interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does. It's only from 8 to 12 so after that you can go on and teach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 8 to 12 every morning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: 8 to 12 every morning over at Laurel High. It really sounds interesting and I'm really kind of excited about the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A long stretch of time everyday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. But when you're doing something ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're doing something and not just sitting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, right. When you're doing something it's really, it goes by really fast. I'm signing up for that. I was thinking of going down to the Art Institute and taking a drawing course or something like that but as long as this is free.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why pay for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, that's the truth. Which should be interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you get like, when you take extra, you don't have to take more courses?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you get an increased salary for like more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, after, well you have, you have your Bachelor's Degree which is the first lane  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - then your Master's Degree which is the second lane. And then 36 hours after your Master's Degree, which is a third lane, which is another increase in salary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have your Master's Degree?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will this go ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it will go towards 36 hours if I ever get my Master's Degree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: After you get your Master's Degree you count up all these hours that you have taken.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, for the hell of it and if they add up to 36 it's nice. Because like they're always offering free courses  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and most people they take them because they chalk them up to that 36.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But this I'm really kind of interested in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not just kind of like, it's interesting in itself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Might be some future year bringing more money.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. I didn't even, it's really kind of nice. At least I'll maybe know a little bit more about art and be able to work with kids a little bit more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you teach? What grade?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sixth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sixth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So they are about 11 or 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, we've got to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wednesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

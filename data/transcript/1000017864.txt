<p>[abrupt start]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I had a little breakthrough with my girlfriend last night because sometimes you know even with her I feel like I can't say something, you know. So last night I found myself even saying, "Well I guess I can tell you." She said, "Well I hope so." It was so funny because you know then it hit me like right between the eyes that a lot of times she seems more like - she's my best friend and she's sort of like a confidante. And usually you know like sometimes like I'm afraid to say something. And it used to be, I used to think it was because I was afraid I was going to hurt her feelings. And then I thought [indiscernible] because I was afraid she wouldn't agree with it and then I would sort of falter and say, well, you know there's something - because she brought it up too that - you know I think I told you before that I used to - I used to copy her and I would almost realize I was copying her. You know. Because I didn't know where to go and I was just faltering. And I realize now that - she says you know you still do but you don't realize it, in some areas. Not as bad. But for awhile when we were living together it was almost like one person. It was really weird. Because you know like again I was trying to get rid of my background. And so I was trying to take on all that she was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was a weird feeling. But I realize I do that a lot of times. Like I picked up - well, I don't do it anymore but this specific hand movement, I used to go like this all the time. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I got this from my drama teacher that I had. And she said when she took drama from the same girl, she said, "I was wondering where you got those hand signals from." It seems like with me I sort of like a photocopy of about six different people. And it's a weird feeling but I realize that that's what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know in order to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't be yourself, you always have to take on other people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, taking on - when I'm with somebody who I think is good in one area I try to either match them, compete with them or take on their personality. You know. I realized like with judo I started really throwing myself into it I think because she was like the best girl in the gym and she had like her yellow belt in six months or less. And most people don't get it that quickly. So right away I wanted to take it twice a week and all this because she did and all this because she did. It was a weird thing you know because I was just trying to prove to myself that I was just as good I think. You know? You know in areas that she was just as good in in real good areas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can match her then somehow you're as good as her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right, right. Because you know I always think well look at all this and she was like starting college when she was 15. And then I say well that's my background. But see then I blame my background too. You know then I say that I'm ashamed of it because of where I came from. And I think this has a lot to do with you know like a problem that I have and then inferiority part of it and the part that you know like I get rejected right away when somebody, even a goof like some fellas and that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean everybody goofy when I come right down and I say Jesus I wouldn't want them as a boyfriend or as a friend or anything. So why do I feel this way? Why do I always blame me and say it's something wrong with me? You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what I've been trying to do and my girlfriend's been helping me is that rather than say that you know like I've done something wrong because see we talk about this too. Every time she says something, just [indiscernible], like you did something wrong. It's just because you don't know, you know. And she says there's a difference between being ignorant in certain areas like in sharing. I wasn't really ignorant but see I'd been burnt a lot when I was younger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: By doing things for people and people would take advantage of me. And then I got to the point where - then I you know I'd get this close and then I've got to do you know too much because then I'm afraid that what's going to happen is you know like somebody can then have fuel and then can turn on me (3:00). You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I figured well if I don't do too much for you and then if you turn your back on me then heck with you because I didn't give you everything. You know? With that type of thing. So you know like this was part of the things that we've been trying to work out and so I've been trying to - it's really funny because like in the last couple of days even I've been able to do things and not even expect anything for them. Or not expect - how can I say it? Not even really care whether the person gives back in that same area or not. You know and I'm not afraid. It's getting to the point where I was actually afraid. And I'm not afraid anymore to give. It's really weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something new for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just in the last few days and in fact maybe the last week. Like with this girl at work and that, I'm not so paranoid anymore. She even told me, she says, "You were paranoid as anything." So I was like, "Yeah, I know, I know." So we're getting along real good. But I don't know. It's even funnier because I just sat down the other day and I realized the people are starting to come up to me and they never did before. Fellas especially. And you know like I'm getting to the point where I'm just, get away from me! You know go away, I don't want you around. But it's just you know the idea like almost every fella I meet now. And it never was like that. It used to be the other way around, like I always want you know fellas and all this. Whether they were really good looking or whether they were real nice or anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's funny, it the weirdest thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're in a position to turn people away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm getting a little bit more in that position that I don't feel so insecure I don't think in that area that like everybody has to like me or there's something wrong with me. But I still feel that way in a way with some of the people I would like, you know to like me. But you know like this is something new. Now I just have to get to the point to find out you know like why I get like a clinging vine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like with friends. Not quite so much with Jodie anymore, this is my best friend. And I think it's partly because like we'll talk and she'll say she's going away for a year and that. But that doesn't mean that we're not going to be friends anymore, that we're not going to write and that when we get back - she gets back that doesn't mean we're not going to see each other and things like this. You know. She's already preparing me for next June I think she's leaving. But that was partly because I get very insecure and I get very tight with somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like I want to clutch onto somebody and just you know like hold one person for me. And - and that's funny because now I don't feel so much like that. I don't feel like - like everyplace she goes like with my other best friend - there's like three of us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she doesn't include me, I don't feel so bad anymore. I did. You know I still feel a little hurt but it's not - it's not quite so bad because I understand a little more you know partially why I do things but partially because well partially because I know it's not going to do any good, you know to hang on. It's like, "This is mine." Because it's not going to help me any.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you hang on then - what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think what happens when I sort - when I try to hang onto somebody, especially like her, it was like the more I tried to hang on and say you know, this is just for me, the more distant we'd get. Because you know like she was feeling like she was being smothered. And I think one of the ways I've found out I was doing it is by watching a fella with her. You know, it was a different relationship but it was the same basic thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like he would call her all the time. And I said, " I think that's so nice, I wish I had somebody to care about me like that." But he ended up calling when she was sleeping, and he'd call her all the time and he wouldn't have anything to say. And it was just like, almost like a pastime, you know she was saying. And she got to the point where it was sickening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he wanted to come in, he wanted to go out every night he was in, and he wanted to go here, he wanted to go there (6:08). And by the time he was gone she was completely exhausted and I said to myself, you know after awhile I said, I see what she means. It's like - it's like he's trying to latch onto somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know hold her. And say this is mine. You know nobody else can have her. And like I found that she was doing things like, he'd say, oh, I'm going someplace tonight so that she would say where she was going. And then she'd say, well, I go to two or three different places. You know and she'd tell him where she was going. And I thought that was mean at first and then I thought well, no, you know like he was actually bating her for saying that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? So he wanted to know what he was doing. Then I thought oh my god. So I was almost doing the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're hanging out with Eliza tonight, huh? Oh, I'm not good enough and all of this baloney. And then I said well you know like you can't be that way. Because it's silly. You can't - you don't even have anything to share then in talking if you're always doing things together, it's silly. It's almost like these married people that end up, you know like one person and it's really bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are two things in that. One is that you kind of smother the other person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have a tendency to do that. I still do it I think - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other one is -</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know I find like a fella that I would really like I would tend to try to you know everyplace we went I want to either be alone - see I still, the only problem, the only time I really have real problems with fellas is if there's other girls around. Because then it's a real big competition-type thing. And then I tend to get jealous and I tend to get possessive. But it's really with a person. I didn't realize that until I got a couple of best friends that were girls. I never had best friends before so it was always the problem with fellas. And then I realized that you know it's the same basic thing with a woman too. It's not really the sex thing I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That just happens with both kinds of people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think it happens with both now. See I used to think it was a big thing with boys like I said because I never really had a best friend that hadn't turned and then I sort of got drifted apart from that friend. And well part of it sometimes it would be like I had only one that was fairly close friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we had a big fight over a fella. She would be like - she's like very flirtatious with fellas. And she was you know built like really great and all of this and she's really pretty. So this is one of the reasons I think I had more of an inferiority complex because you know like she was so pretty - we'd go out, she'd catch the fellas and I'd sit there. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was part of it. And I think even then it wasn't really the fellas themselves it was the idea of feeling like I wasn't as good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I wasn't as - I wasn't attractive as she was to people. So you know that was a problem. And then I come up - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that just made it worse that she'd get all the guys.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. And I think that would be mostly it. Or - and it was the same thing like if I liked a fella and he didn't like me it was because - I would feel like there was something wrong with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's why I think I would think at the time that I was madly in love with the person and I'd cry and all this baloney. But really what I was saying was he doesn't like me and why? You know. Because I would - I'd always get like one or two fellas that would be real nice that would like me and you know I got a couple of fellas that wanted to get married and all that baloney. But it wasn't - it just seemed like it wasn't the fellas that I wanted. And always the girls that you know like, like I would be attracted to them either you know and I don't know really whether it be sexual attraction or just plain attraction. But she would always end up with the fella. And it used to bug me. Or I would meet a fella that she had gotten and he was - I would compare you know and I'd say well he's better looking and he's smarter and he's this than the one I've got (9:01). And then I would feel you know like there's something wrong with me because I can't catch one. But the fellas I had might be as nice or nicer - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know than the other fella. It was just the idea that you know it was like comparing myself. Because I have a real bad habit of comparing myself with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I always come up on the short end needless to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know like it'll seem like, like I'll meet somebody and we'll get - the closer friends we get to be, then that's the most when I start comparing myself. Because I say well, I should be just about as good. Like with Eliza, I remember I felt real bad like I think it was two years ago I was in the secretarial college. And we were up for - we were both up for Miss Executive Law Firm Secretary of whatever it was, '60 or '69, I don't know which. And she won and I don't know why, it was like a big tie for awhile, the judges were tied and then they finally came up with her. I won the shorthand, she won the typing. So I mean really we came out just about evenly. But see that little bit, there was something wrong with a letter I had typed or something for it, I'm not sure exactly what it was. Anyway, I lost. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. But to me it was like oh, god, here we go again. Second best, right? I don't mind - I always come in just slightly before first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But not first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was thinking - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really want to be first.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. At least in one area. You know I wouldn't care what the area was but if I could be best in one thing, I think it would give me more of a security in like who I was and what I was and you know. Like I've done - I keep telling myself well, you know, you're not so bad. Like I've done, for yoga, I do yoga exercises. I was on TV once with a swami to demonstrate it. And then you know I thought gee, this is great. And then I found out afterwards from my other girlfriend that Eliza had been asked before me. She was also in yoga. And she couldn't make it or she didn't want it or something. So I said, here we go it's you know like second, like I'm on TV but the only reason I did it is because she didn't want to do it, you know? And then I said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like always putting yourself down even though you get something that's pretty good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that most people would say wow, you were actually on TV. I'd say yeah, but my girlfriend was asked and she just didn't want to do it, that's why she wasn't on. That's the only way I got in. You know. But part of it is because the type of people I hang around with are really, you know, up there and really swinging and all this. I don't know, I'm funny that way. I like to be around people like that because I know I can learn from them. And yet a lot of times I stifle myself because I won't - I won't learn, I always compare and then I say oh, Jesus, you know I'm so far behind and I'm so this and I'm so that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I end up a lot of times not being very fun to be around because of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'll be sitting there and I'll think oh, boy, you know that was a clever line. I wish I would have come up with it first. You know. Boy my line didn't sound very funny next to that one. You know things like this, it's a constant comparing with people. And you know with my friends and that. And it's you know like to me it's really bad and I - not bad but it's stupid to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like there you are with a bunch of people and you could be enjoying them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But instead you're just going over in your head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All the things that you know like they've said that I should have said or that I said something, oh, it didn't come out right. You know. Oh, that was bad. You know? And then, oh, it sounds so stupid. And that's my big thing, you know and I know it. I've got a big hang up on feeling stupid and I know - because I know I'm intelligent you know but I haven't used the brain. And that's what really gets me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know I'm lazy in a way, something - and I'm very, I think actually before that I'm very, very wish control oriented (11:56). I want everything but I want it right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's just the type of thing, you know like it's, it's almost like I'm sort of a carbon copy but I'm not quite good, you know, good enough to be the real thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm, you know, trying to be better than I am. Rather than I think working on what probably would be best for me or what - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - what I have an aptitude in. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they're two different things. One way you're trying to be like somebody else - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - maybe and you're not good enough. And the other way you're just starting from where you're at, working out of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And I think if I could stay more in that area. See I - but I tend to flounder. I try to get you know in - look, you know like you have, like [indiscernible], like I have a good voice and I know it. And I like the entertainment world and I know it. But I also like nursing. You know like, you know and I sort of - I'm still not - maybe part of it is because I'm not sure exactly where I want to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like my girlfriend can say well, I can only plan two years at a time. But I want to plan like a four year degree. And I don't know what I want to go into yet. You know. And so that's part of it. That's part, you know I'm going this and that and should I take the liberal arts and really get educated for the first two years? Or should I go into something like majoring in something like theater arts or you know voice right away so that maybe in the next few years I can start working in an area where I really, I really enjoy myself. Because I hate secretarial work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though you know like I've got - I'd say for my age and that I've got quite a bit of responsibility and I do a lot of work with clients and you know they always compliment my boss and all this baloney on me. But like the typing and that is just - except for concentration. Sometimes they say this is a discipline. No, this is a concentration. You know and then they say, okay, then it's worth something. Otherwise I feel like I'm doing dumb work. You know it's like oh, here we go again. It's a drudge. Filing and things like this. I think it's almost like beneath my position, you know, to do like hours and hours of filing because I can't see where I'm learning through it mostly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me it's just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not very exciting and you're not growing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's it. I feel like this is just like, like a four or five hours that I just take out of my life and just throw it away. Because like I haven't learned any, I haven't done anything. It's just you know. And see this is part of the thing is like I try to explain that to our, our head secretary and she won't even listen. And she says, that's part of a secretary's work. I says well why don't you get somebody who, who doesn't have the ability but can put you know like one number after another and knows how to put things in alphabetical order and number order and can put them in files? Why not? Why can't they have a girl around the office like that? So that they can free the secretaries to do the other jobs that are halfway you know a little more intelligent. It takes a little more intelligence to do. And that's part of it. And you know like I felt like self, feeling a little bit inferior when my girlfriend said oh, one of the girls in my class - she just got out - I make you know like a fairly decent salary but not what this girl makes. She comes out of business college, she's making $650 a month and I went oh, Jesus! You know, take me another year or two to get up to that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - and this is you know like starting out and I said oh, god. And she says oh, she does this much in shorthand, close to 200 words a minute and she does 100 words a minute typing. And I said oh, yeah, well we won't talk about my speed next to that. And see then again, then I realized rather than being just happy for this girl I was just thinking, wow is that great for a young girl. You know like she's just getting out of school and she can go out and she can make this great money. Rather than saying that I always come - I say oh, you know why couldn't I do it? Or why shouldn't I do it? Or you know like what's wrong with me? Again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I found myself doing it. But you know I caught myself. But see again I just wanted to know why I start these things (15:06). You know because even though I can stop them now it's - it's almost like I almost don't want to because I just don't want any of that feeling in the first place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I want to find out why I have to compare myself all the time. I'm always comparing. And I'm always naturally coming out on the short stick. Short end of the stick. And you know like if I would find out why rather than just taking these people or whatever they're doing and if I'm interested in the field, fine, go into it, that doesn't mean I have to be as good as they are in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm not interested well so what? So I'm not good in secretarial work. So what? You know like what does that prove? That I'm rotten, that I'm stupid? You know. It just means that I don't like secretarial work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [indiscernible] feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think, I sit down and I say okay, logically. And then I'm okay. Then I can even say you know that's great for her because this is what she wants and she's going to spend her whole life probably doing this. And so she should be because she's got great skills and she's interested in it and she wants to stay in that line of work, fine. You know. Like I know that I couldn't take it. Like this woman I work with she's like 60-some years old, she tried teaching, she's got a four year degree and she ends up as a secretary. You know. But to her this is fine because this is what she wanted to do. She doesn't have a real outgoing personality, you know enough to be a teacher. She's not strong enough to be a teacher. So you know I said to myself well why am I judging her? You know why am I saying this? And it's because I feel that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I feel like what I'm doing isn't important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is part of the thing you know like I go here I go again and then I do telephone sales at night to make some extra money. That's another joke, you know. And - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you judge other people by your standards? That's - is that what you were saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not really - see I'm judging them but when I'm judging them what I'm really saying is - I say you know I say to myself boy, that must be rotten to be in that line of work. Boy she must really be weak and she must not be too bright. And then I find out little things like, you know like she's got a four year degree. And then I think to myself well why? And then I said you know I sat down logically I said well, she's not very strong. She said she tried teaching and she couldn't do it. But you know as a personality she's not strong enough and you can tell it, to control a class and she said she wasn't. Okay well she - what she was doing is being honest with herself and saying that she - she doesn't have what it takes to be a teacher so she'll go into something else that she knows. And she said you know like later on I talked to her and she ran a business for her father and that, [indiscernible] dye. And the I don't know what happened to the business. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she went into secretarial work. And then I said to myself well this is what she wants. She's happy doing this. Who am I to say like you know like this? And then I said well why do you even think like that in the first place? Then I said it's because I don't want to be in that you know situation. And I - and because it's not good for me I sort of like take it and throw it off - I like project it on someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And then I realize what I'm thinking is not because of her because if she wants it's fine. That's what she wants. But it's me. And I know it. I've got to get out of this work because it's killing me. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And partly it's because I'm in kind of a bad situation with my boss too because I know he likes me. But he may just be using me. He's an older Jewish man and there's two types, you know. One of them will be very nice to a girl and one of them would just try to see whatever you could get out of her for nothing. And I don't like him that way. And you know so there's - there's going to be a problem unless I can straighten it out some way with him (17:58). But you know as far as those problems go that's about you know like that's about it for there. But it's - I just realized you know like I'm always trying to be a carbon copy of somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really don't know that person down, you know, down deep. Who Jane  is and you know like where she's going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The nursing I think the big thing that's even sticking with me is because my mother wanted it so badly. So it was sort of like a thing like I'd picked up, it was like osmosis. Well, you've got to be a nurse because your mother wanted to be a nurse. She couldn't be a nurse. You can be a nurse so you're going to be a nurse. You know, and - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that may not be what you really want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think so because I don't think I could take it now and it's not because you know like the blood or because I don't like the idea. This is one thing about me and I don't know whether this is - this shows there's something wrong with me or not but I can't stand to see somebody else in pain. And yet a lot of times when I'm like sort of half dreaming or dreaming and I think I told you I sometimes think I'm in another time and all this, especially Roman days, I will see something like torture and this and that. Sometimes I'll almost be that person who's causing it. Not doing it but causing it. And then, then I'll say no, no, no, no, I'm not that person. [indiscernible] that comes in and saves. And then I said to myself well maybe it's because you know like I've got like a sadistic tendencies that I'm sort of keeping down. Or maybe it's, well let's see, how can I say it? I usually take care - like in these dreams I'm usually the one that takes care of everything. But then they end up liking me. You know this has got to be in there too. And then I'm fantastic and I'm you know like up on the pedestal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like on the one hand it might be something really horrible and yuck. But on the other hand it's maybe you really feel that you could help somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. But in nursing, nursing, I've come to the you know like a conclusion of partly that I don't know if I could take sick people because a lot of sick people - because I was you know in the hospital with my back for about five days. And a lot of sick people just use sickness as like a, like a refuge. You know they sort of run away because they've got problems then they get sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think this is part of the reason why I wouldn't have the real feeling that I think would have to be there to be a good nurse. Because I'd be saying, you know, it's not that you're faking, I know you're in pain, but why don't you become strong enough to you know like face whatever it is rather than getting sick? Because it's sort of like a cop out, you know. And to me I think I would have that feeling underlying almost everything I would do. And I really couldn't have that feeling like you know real helping and just being open and trying to help the person just for their - because they're a person and they're in need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. So I think that kind of kills nursing. And I've always liked things like theater and - I shouldn't say always. I started in theater games. And that's more or less like a therapy too, really. It's like a communication with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when I was on the stage and everything I liked it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I liked the feeling, I liked the - the freedom. Partly it's because you know like you're entertaining other people. And this is something that I could do - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that would be good. It's not just the idea that I like to be in the limelight. Part of it is. Part of it is because I like to be, you know be really in something and I guess maybe like the, like the spotlight would be like - like now I'm, you know, I'm up in lights and I'm really - almost like I'm alone and somebody could say, here's Jane Bettworth. You know she's - she can do something well and you know what I mean? She can give something to a lot of people (20:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like it's something like I would be alone and I wouldn't be compared with this one and that one and the other one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I'd be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just you. Performing for those people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And that's the way it would be. It would be like you know like a type of thing - it's almost like teaching is in a way to me. It's like you're there and you know like you're the head of the room and people are watching you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they want to learn by you. And you really feel like you can give something to them and you can do something for them. And again you're not compared with somebody else. You're there. And you know like you're the center of attention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's not even that - I mean I like to be center of attention in that area because I can give something and I know I can help someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like not just wanting to be the center of attention [indiscernible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just for the sake of being the center of attention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can give something there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It would be something like, I mean like somebody could dress me up to be gorgeous or something and I could stand there. But like I wouldn't be doing anything, I would just be like an object.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want that. I don't mean that I want to be center of attention just to be this, you know like a focal point to be sitting there. But I'd like to be, like, you know like I wouldn't be compared again like I said with somebody else and I would be alone. And at the same time I could be doing something that I would consider important and that I would consider could help somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I said with entertainment, a lot of people think it's flippant and a lot of people think it's a world of make believe. Well the stage, I don't' know if I'd want to go into it except for maybe comedy or something. You know. But as far as singing goes I would love to do something like this, like a singing act or something on that order. And - or com - even a singing comedy routine which would be what I think I really would love to do. Because I love - I love to have people laugh. That's part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something like you know I like people to be happy. And I don't know whether that's because you know inside I'd like to be happy too or because you know like what it is. But to me that's a big thing. You know because too many people are too uptight about jazz and I get that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I really get concerned over a detail or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really exciting. Like you're there all by yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're really giving something. And you're having an effect on people and it's just you - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - having that effect and that's really exciting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. There would be something that I would really feel. That this would be - you know like I wouldn't be like just one of a crowd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like one of the - well, ticky tacky people, whatever you want to call them. Like you know this is the way I feel also in secretarial work. I try to be different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like some of the fellas I've met say oh, yeah, I rate your dressing out [ph]. I said great. You know. So what? So I'm sitting in this office with a bunch of dreary people in a dreary job that I can't stand. And you know like so what? So you think I'm the best in that area. I don't care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Because like to me that isn't important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like to some girls it would be great. Gee if I was - somebody thought I was the greatest girl in the office, I really think that was great. But I say, you know like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not where you're at. It's like - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - somewhere else where you could - you'd have more respect and - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - for the job and like it there. It's worthwhile.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A different level. Yeah. A different level too. Because see this is another thing because I'm right in the middle. I came from you know like I think I said the southwest side was where I - well that was when I was like a teenager and that's where I guess I did most of my molding. And before that I lived with like old Russian-type foster parents. And then before that I was in Springfield and then before that I was at my mother's, you know. And like we would - we were never anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know we were just sort of like, you know like one of the crowd (23:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And even then, even in the crowd we were in we weren't, you know like up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where we, you know like, like where I guess we might say where I wish I were. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Because like I can remember when I was little and we had one cousin who was, oh, she was so snotty to me. She was almost my age and I barely knew her. I think what happened is her father did something with my father and - what did he do? Oh, I think he forged a check or something in my father's name. So like we sort of cut them off. And they - they more than likely made money or something because I think I remember seeing her at her father's wake. And you know it's things like, oh, hello. You know? And I thought oh, Jesus. You know, this is my cousin? You know. And it was that type of thing and that made me feel bad. You know because my own cousin, I barely knew her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then - then she comes up and rather than saying you know like I said I was sorry and everything. And rather than - than there being any kind of an emotion or any kind of a feeling, there wasn't anything there. You could tell it was just like, you know like hi, stranger. You know. Thank you very much and walks away. You know I said, gee. So that happened - see that was a problem too when I was a little kid that there weren't any girls around my age. I was always playing with little boys. And I think this might be part of the reason I had a problem getting girlfriends. Because you know like fellas were different even when they were kids. They used to roughneck and things like this. But it's very funny with a fella, when they - I can remember at least when I was small that they seemed to be very good friends. I mean like you could have a friend that was a fella for years. And I can't remember ever having a little - a girlfriend when I was little. You know. Or if I had one I - like even when I got a little bit older in school I had one for maybe like a year and then the next year we'd have a different group and then have maybe two or three other girls that I would hang around with. And then the next year the same thing. And it wasn't anything like, you know like there was any real close bond between anybody. I mean you know like I just forgot them. They went out of my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was very funny because when I was little I could get very close to some people. And I don't know whether it was because of the - it probably was partially because like when I was eight I went one place, when I was nine and a half I went someplace else. And at that part I didn't have real close friends. And then I went someplace else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And then maybe I think that was partly it because I was - that was part of the reason I was afraid to get close to anybody. I mean anybody, like whether a fella or a girl or anything. It was just like I was afraid that like you know tomorrow I might not be there, I might be someplace else. And because the people I lived with really didn't care - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know, that I would be doing that. But you know I think what I really need is to get up in lights. Maybe I would feel a little bit better if I could get you know to a point where even if it was just to be a real fantastic teacher.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That well like I know I could never be the teacher that my girlfriend is, at least not now, because she's first of all, she's got like ten years of experience. I mean she started teaching when she was fifteen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in that area. But see now if I could get into something else like teaching yoga or teaching something else that I'm good at that I only need like a few lessons to, you know, to learn the teaching end of it. Then I would feel like I was doing something that was you know like I said, was important. And it was something that I could say, I know something that none of my girlfriends are, none of my two girlfriends are. It's something different and it's something I'm good at. You know and it's something I can help somebody with, but still it's something that I am good at (26:58). You know. And I'm the best at in the group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. This type of thing because it's just the feeling - you know if I could just one thing. Whether you know like my education that's going to come and you know it's going to take time. But I need something like I think right now that I can say that I'm really good at so that I can say look, Jane Bettworth can do this well. She may not be able to do very much but she can do this well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you could really respect yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I need something that's, yeah, that I would say that I could really say was respectful. Like a type of job or whatever. You know. And I just don't feel that way because my one girlfriend makes like eight or ten dollars an hour teaching. And the other one makes, I don't know what she makes in translations. She can - see this is thing, something she can do. And the other one can do too, they can both speak Spanish and English. I can't do this. I'm - you know I'm used - one language is all I have command of. I have two years of Spanish but you know like this isn't high school and I can't remember hardly anything. But see this is one thing that makes me feel you know like I'm missing a lot even if it's not even quite and inferiority thing it's like they can share in this area, you know and I can't share that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like - it's like, almost like I'm an outsider in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I don't know. It's kind of a funny feeling that you know like wanting to be something that's really good in one area. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Funny how? Do you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think partly it's because I have this you know this thing like I'm not very good - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From like where I came from and all of this that, like I don't think there's - I don't think a lot of people have to be that way. I think that they just, you know, like they either get by on their job or if they, if they've got like a couple of interests and they're pretty good at these interests then they're fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like they say I'm in this and I'm in that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying it's funny because it came out of a feeling of not feeling worth it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's something like that because see I have a feeling like, an inferiority feeling. I think that's where it comes from and I feel like I have to be not only as good but better than almost everybody or everybody in a group, you know that's pretty good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you're pushing yourself to be best but that part seems to be funny to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right, right. Yeah it seems like I really shouldn't have to feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I always have. Like I have to do this better than everybody. And I have to do this you know the best of - maybe not everybody in the world but like everybody in like what the group is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And the group has got to be about my level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because otherwise I'd say well they're below me in level anyways so what's the difference?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I'm still not proving anything. And I think that's part of the reason because I'm still in between and that's a terrible feeling, to not know exactly where you fit in. I don't fit in with the intellectuals because I'm not you know quite up to them. And I don't fit in with like the sophisticates either because I haven't traveled, and I haven't done this, and I haven't done that. And so - and yet the people that are my age and have done - I've done like usually a little bit more than they have. And the people I associate with have done so much more than me. And I'm not used to hanging around with a level you know like the way that most like office girls are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've got like one friend in the whole office. And she's a black girl that's about 28 and she's been around. She's done things, she's been here, she's been there. She's got a couple of years of college at night. And she's very sophisticated and that. And she's the only friend I've got in the office because everybody else is just you know like they're a couple of years older than me, they're my age and they act like little kids (29:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they don't have any aspirations it seems except maybe to get married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know it's an idea that like I don't really have many friends or anything either because of that. Because I'm in this stupid little in between stage that I don't know where I'm going, you know, and it's like oh - it's an awful feeling. This is another reason I think if I could get something it would be a like a security. I know I would be good at this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know either like teaching which I should throw myself into a little more. And - or and like in the entertainment field where I would really like to be. You know this is the thing I really would like to do because you know I love to sing, too, it's just and idea that I really like to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you say if you could hang onto that then you'd feel like you weren't so left out of the world you want to be into?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in that area. I think that would be more or less right because see, yeah, because see then I would say - I would feel like I would have something that I could offer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be really good because look, you know, I can do this. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like your ticket or something, like...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sort of a ticket to ride to get into this group that I really want to get into completely. You know. And yet it's very funny because my other girlfriend from South America, Eliza, has no college either, she probably doesn't read as much even as I do, and you know as far as that goes, and we're both of - as far as our look and that goes we both have about the same. And it's just the idea that she doesn't feel this way but I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. She doesn't feel like everything she has to go into she's got to be the best at. She's just you know like, I'm good at this and I'm good at that. And if I'm not the best at it, so what? You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just the way she feels. And it's a great - I wish I could feel more like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then maybe I wouldn't have these, you know like these aspirations. I think I'd still like to go into show business. It's just the ideal that I do like the idea of entertaining. But I don't know, it's very, very funny that you know like I feel - I notice this every time I've tried something, I've always - not only do I want to try to be best but when I lose, then I say well, here we go again. You're not good enough to be good at something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. You're like, you're like somebody who's okay at everything they do but they don't - they don't excel at anything. But see it doesn't bother them but it bothers me. See, I suppose if somebody, if it really did bother somebody they would excel in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They really wanted to be really good at it. But to me it's like an all-important, all-encompassing thing that I have to be good at something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I can show myself. I think partly it's because I do, I admit, I've got a very low opinion of myself and I know it. You know that I feel like - I just feel like you know like if I died tomorrow, like, what mark would I make on the world. Who cares?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you have to be really spectacular somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There's got to be something there that you know like sort of justifies my existence. Because otherwise you know why am I here? So what? What have I done?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like nobody's going to notice you - </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - if you don't really make a big splash.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it's sort of like that. That I really have to get in there and really - I don't' know. Well like you said, excel. It's a part of thing to me. Well maybe that's it too because I feel like I don't get enough attention otherwise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But well that could be because I don't get that much attention. You know I could walk in in a bikini and somebody'd say hi, how are you, turn around and walk away and that's the way I feel. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like this is - being best would be some way to guarantee somehow that everyone would see you, everyone would notice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe notice my existence. Yeah, that could be too(32:59). You know that there'd be, at least something there whether they liked it or they didn't like it. Because you know it's funny because I remember - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just want people to know that you're there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just - just see me! You're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, that I'm here and I'm living. And you know come on folks, don't pass me by again. But yeah I think that's part of it. And that's part of the reason I think when I lose at something that it really crushes me. Oh, man, I can't take you know losing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like one way you're saying look, I'm here! I'm here, see me. And then the other way when people go away it's like, you know, where are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't exist anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that could be partially it too, that I feel like you know like I don't know where I'm going because it's always seems like it's a transient thing, what I'm doing. You know partially because I think the way I was moving from place to place. It was like - and I couldn't' just move, see, and the foster system, they pick you up and you don't even see these other parents and things like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't go back and visit, you don't do anything like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like - it's like I'm like ten different people in one. You know like I have a little bit of an existence from here and a little bit of existence from there. And where do I belong? One set of parents are prejudiced against black people, the other set aren't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and you're going, I guess I have to go along with them because that's the way they say and this must be right. And you know like if I don't go along with them they're going to think there's something wrong with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, whether in my heart or in my mind I really feel that way. You know that's an awful thing to try to do, to try to change your views to somebody else's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you just don't know their - what way to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah. It's like - yeah. It's like you're - you almost know that what they're doing is not right and yet it's partially not even not knowing, it's the idea that I want to be accepted by them. And so in order to be accepted by them I would do almost anything. You know like stand on my head if they said this would be nice, to be accepted by the group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know that I want to get into. I don't care too much about like snobs and things like this and people that you know that really don't interest me at all. I don't care about them. But somebody - some group that I want to get into.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I can remember at the theater, I wanted to get into that theater group so badly. You know like just with the group of people that - oh, I'd do crazy things like with the fellas, one of the girls used to come in and kiss everybody. So I said well, she's very popular. So I came in and I start kissing everybody. Not that I really gave a darn about it. I didn't care. It's just the idea that I thought well like maybe then they'll like me better, you know because I'm here and I'm showing some attention to them. So maybe then you know they'll reciprocate and they'll be doing the same thing to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Find some way to get people to come to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Right. And that - and not completely everybody but like anybody who sort of attracted me that I thought was nice and that. Or that I thought was - whatever way they were attractive I wanted them to come to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But something in that, they just won't come. I mean there's something, you have to stand on your head or - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. I can't just be me and sit back and if somebody wants to talk to or whatever - my girlfriend was mentioning this too that I tend to do this with fellas especially. That like I'll do almost anything to be noticed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To you know like again like to say, I'm here. You know. And you know it's a weird thing because she said a lot of times they'll start to be attracted to you just because you're you and you're relaxed. (35:59). And then when you start this baloney, it's like - it's almost like you're throwing yourself at them and then they say well, like who needs it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I can see the point there. I can see what I do after I've done it. But again it's the idea - like why did I do it? You know why did I have to do something like this in order to be noticed? I'm not a bad looking girl. You know and I can be very, how can I say it? Not funny, funny, but I can be clever. And a lot of times, like we were talking between, my girlfriend and I, the difference between clever and witty. She's more witty and I'm more clever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I can throw something out clever and she can turn it around and be witty about it. And then it's even funnier. But see when I try to do it it sounds sarcastic. And my girlfriend Eliza tries to do it again it sounds sarcastic and people get turned off because we don't know how to be witty. Because we don't have that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know that knack. And so if I stick to my own area - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - there have been times when I've got people in stitches and I haven't even realized that I've said anything funny. It's just the way I said it and the way they've taken it and everything and what I said, you know, that when I think about it afterwards I say hey, that was pretty funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you do have something there that people turn onto.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I let it come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but I either try to overplay it by you know like putting on, trying to think of something really clever to say. You know when you do that and it just falls on its face when you finally come out with a line that you had memorized for two hours. And I've done this too you know now this sounds really intelligent, I'll throw this in. Or I'll throw in this little fact. Not because I - with teaching I can do it without saying now this makes me sound intelligent. Teaching I just use recall, you know and I can - I can use facts. But I'm using the facts not to be smart or anything, just to help them learn whatever I'm trying to bring, you know whatever point I'm trying to bring across to them. But not in social life. In social life I still feel like and then I have to, you know, like the perfect desk, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all this bullshit that I know is bullshit. You know I know that if I just relax, you know so what? So I don't look like a model. Tough. If you don't like me, that's your problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see I don't come out with that. When I think logically, I do. I say this is ridiculous. You know like why put on a big front? This isn't me, this is like a statue and I'm not a statue, I'm a human being and I'm, you know, I'm alive. But I always come on that way, I come on very stiff because I'm afraid I'm going to do something that's stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like as long as you can stay in that really exciting feeling of being you and being alive and, like that's really good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then it's fine. But some - like many times I can't do that. Because I'm afraid. Like if I'm in a situation where I'm not secure, especially. Like when I'm with people like when we were in Atlantic City, and like these are very big money people, you know, big money fellas. So naturally you know I had to be on my guard what I said and what I did because I tend to be a flirt sometimes, sometimes just trying to be nice but it's taken as flirtation. You know. And sometimes I really do, I just want attention. I want somebody to say you know like, I like you. And that's a big thing to me. Just for somebody to come out and say, you know I really like you. You're really nice. And that doesn't happen very often but usually it happens when I am relaxed and this is what bugs me because I can't relax.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I'm you know like this. And then I'm afraid - because sometimes even when I'm relaxed I get to the other point too, I let the other part come up, this insecurity and this feeling of almost like rejection from - I think it could be partially from men (39:02). But I'm not sure. That you know that comes up that I really - I really want this person to say you know like I like you and I really want this person to - to almost have like not a last - maybe a lasting relationship almost too. Like it really bothers me to go out with a fella one night or something and then I never hear from him again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That really bothers me because then I'll go over the whole night and say, well what did I do wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. He didn't even give a chance to start something. You know. And sometimes I find out later on like sometimes it's the fella too. Like in one area this fella was still married. And he was - I guess he was getting divorced now, I'm not sure. But he went out with me twice and I said, well how come when he came back in town he didn't want to go out with me again? And I found out it was because he was afraid, because he knew I was like vulnerable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he knew it. And he knew he could get to like me because this friend of mine said you know this is the reason, because he's very sensitive too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he knew he could probably get to like me. So he met my other girlfriend. He said no, he didn't want to because he didn't want to get in a relationship like that. He was just you know just starting to get out of another one that he, you know, he got himself into. And see sometimes I don't realize this but sometimes a fella, or a person could like me, but they're just afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not just me all the time. Sometimes it's them. But see I always take it as me. And then I'll go over in my mind, what did I say? I don't think I did anything stupid that night. I really don't think I did anything dumb that night. You know. And then I wonder well I must have done something dumb that night because he's not back. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's part of it, that I always think everything is - that happens is always my fault. It's always my fault no matter what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you do that makes people go away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's always - right. It's something that I have done. And I'm wondering if that didn't come back in like I thought I did something to my parents and that's why you know like I was sent away or that they didn't want me when I was a little kid. I might have blamed it on me - it might have been something somebody else said to me. I don't know. You know. In anger or whatever they might have said you know something like, well, no wonder your parents didn't want you or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It could have been something like that and then that could have gotten me thinking on that maybe my parents didn't want me. And maybe I did do something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it feels like to you? Or are you just guessing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just - that just came out. I never thought of it before. So - you know that's funny because sometimes when I'm talking it just you know sort of rolls out. So I don't know whether that's just something that's come into my head now or it's coming out of my head from before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like maybe your parents didn't love you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you did something wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know like why would I always feel like people went away because it was something I did?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it wasn't something like that came back from way when I was a little kid, that maybe my parents didn't want me or I felt like they didn't want me. You know because - I don't know. I know that sometimes like my mother would tell me a story and I hated when she told me. And I couldn't figure out why because it wasn't - I remember she said one time when she told it, I asked her where I was. She said well you weren't there yet, because my brother was only like four and I was, you know I'm almost five years younger than he is. And she was up on a ferry or something in New York. And they went up with like the, let's see, oh, the horse and carriage would take you around like in a mountain, would go around like that and you'd get to the top. But he was late coming down and the ferry was leaving. So she was running down the hill and she was really heavy then too, she wasn't as heavy as she is now but she's really like a heavy woman (41:59). And she was running - you know it was funny, but I never thought it was funny. You know like she said she was running down the hill holding up her stockings and my brother was yelling, wait for my little Mommy, wait for my little Mommy! And he was running down you know like down and they got on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she used to laugh and she thought it was so cute but I can remember - I think maybe the reason why it really bothered me is because I'd say well, where was I Mommy? Where was I? And she said oh, you weren't there. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were left out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was left out of it. She said oh, you weren't there yet. I said, well, was I in your tummy or something? She said no. You weren't there yet. So - and she did I think partly it's because I don't remember her talking about like things like we all went to vacation to my grandfather's and that. And she doesn't talk much about that. Or like Texas when we went when we were seven.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She tells that one story about my brother over and over and over again. I think she you know like when I think logically it's like, she's telling it because it's one of the few funny things that ever happened in her life that was really funny. And to her it was really a riot but to me it was like, she was having fun before I came along. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just weren't in the picture.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Because I wasn't there. But as soon as I got there, you know - and then one time she showed me the, like the scar she had. And she's got like two big scars on her stomach - she had us both Caesarian. And she said she couldn't have any more kids. And I don't know if she added anything more because like - because it was me. You know like the second one that - because of the way that I came out or something. I don't know. You know. But I can remember she said she couldn't ever have any more kids after me. And I don't know, I guess maybe that hurt me a little bit. Because I always wanted a sister and I didn't have one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It hurt you that she put it on you, that it was sort of your fault? Or just hurt you that - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that I took it that way, maybe. Because I can remember her showing me you know the scars and she said well, after you I couldn't have any more. You know I think that's the way it was worded. I don't think it was even like you know I had you both Caesarian. I think it was worded like, you know like after you I couldn't have any more children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that was like your fault.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like it was almost - yeah. It was almost like she might have wanted more but she couldn't have any more because of me, the way I came out or whatever, you know the way I was in her stomach. But you know now I know with Caesarian you can't have more than two or three. You know like especially like years ago you couldn't have more than two or three. But you know I think that's part of it I think. That I just felt like you know like my brother was the big cheese with my mother and I don't know about my father. Again I can't remember my father and that bothers me. But you know - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least they're accounted to your mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was almost like, I think maybe that's why I was such a tomboy. Because like my, I knew my brother rated well with her. And I can remember like times when - this - even when I was little though I wanted to be noticed. Because I can remember - I remember all the people saying you'd better get your little girl off there, because I was like five or six and I was standing up on the big swings and going real high. And I was almost going over the bars. And you know then I would laugh and she'd say oh, you know. And then she'd say oh, don't worry, she can do it, you know and everything. And then I would feel like, you know like I had done something and I was really something great in my - you know I guess maybe because my mother was watching. You know and like I really - I almost counted like that. And she would say oh, don't worry, she's really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And then I'd feel like wow, I can swing higher than the other kids and the boys and everything and I'm only five. And I can do this really well. You know. And then my Mommy likes this, you know (44:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because maybe it was you know it was like to get noticed by my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to do something spectacular to get - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something that's really the best, right, to be noticed by somebody I care about especially.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like again this is like goes in with my group, with the girls here that I have to be - that I don't feel like I have anything that I can really say is really good or great that I can offer. Because everything I can do you can do better, you know it's like one of those things. Everything I can do she can do better and the other one can do better. Or and [indiscernible] the other one can do better. And so you know like the one girl that does real good in judo and that, she can't do the yoga exercises anywhere as well as I can. But the other one can. You know, so it's still like you know with the group I still haven't done anything that's fantastic that's you know like better than anybody. But I remember that, when I was a little kid I could do that. You know and I'd be doing the things like the boys and I would jump out of the trees and everything into the sandbox like the boys would. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it wasn't important just because you really dug swinging. It was like it had an extra thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I can remember when I got a little bit older that I used to get swing-sick when I got on swings. I don't know if I did when I was a little kid but, you know like I figured if I do it when I got a little bit older it would, oh, then maybe I did get almost swing-sick when I was little and just wanted to do it for doing something that was really, you know like big and great. But like the fellas used to say, my nickname was Sissy and they'd say Sissy, she's no sissy. You know because she does right what the fellas do. And I never realized why because like when I got a little bit older, I don't think I'd ever want to be a tomboy anymore. I mean I like doing things like a friend of mine took me to Star of Rock [ph] about a month ago or something. But you know and I like to climb up on the cliffs and this. Part of it is because I can do it and the other girl was afraid. And part of it is because of my judo I can - I've got a lot more balance and that that she wouldn't have. You know like where she would fall I wouldn't. But part of it too was like, I really had fun when we sat by a stream and just you know could sit and think and you know enjoy nature and be out there without like any of the hassle, no people around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know we just sit down and talk. And then he had to bring it up. See I didn't realize this 'til my girlfriend let me in on it. I am so stupid sometimes. I was - I think he fed my insecurity in not having a great deal of confidence in my mental ability. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he would say things like, you'd better get to college, you know that? You know you're not using that brain you've got. You know you're really stupid. You know and then he would say something if I wouldn't agree with it, I was dumb. Even if I could think that you know like my reason actually had some basis. You know like in fact and everything else. I'd say well, yeah, I guess you're right, you know maybe I am stupid. You know. And you know he couldn't do this unless I felt that way already. But like what he did was feed it. And then part of it was because he saw I was progressing, and my girlfriend says don't you realize you've progressed in a lot of areas and he hasn't? He still hangs around with the same friends, he still talks about the same things, you know. And I said you know you're right he does. In the old neighborhood, he doesn't like being up in my neighborhood. He's got to go back where he's secure, you know, in his old neighborhood. And I said, yeah, you know that's probably it because I've grown a lot of ways that he hasn't done. I've done traveling and he tells me it's stupid. Doesn't have any basis. Well I know it does, this is communication with people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is you know like putting yourself in a completely different situation that you've never been in before. And like in Vegas I was lost the first two or three days because I was insecure, it wasn't where you know like I knew what to do (47:59). So like I had to learn all over again like how to relax and how to you know handle myself in a different situation. And I learned right there, you know. But like to him college was the big thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. So if I didn't go to college I was stupid, and I was this and I was that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And at first you were pretty confused by that and then you realized - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But now it doesn't bother me that much anymore. But it did. Jesus did that bother me because I hadn't been to college. It does in a way now because I still find myself saying oh, yeah, he's great, you know he's got six years of college and this. And I said ah, there I go again, you know. But not quite as much. You know it's not quite such a big hang-up that I think that people that go to college are so much better than I am or something like this because see college has always been a way of pulling yourself up, I know. You know from like an average or below average up to something that can really go someplace, you know. And so to me that was a big thing, it was like a status symbol. And I admit it. It was a big status symbol that I'd like to have. And yet like you know the big houses and all that baloney, oh, it would be nice to visit but I don't know if I'd want to live like in a big mansion or anything like that, in that type of area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see like in the intellectual it's a little bit different because that's where you live, that's you. That's your mind. That's the important thing. I mean the outside thing, so what? Take them or leave them. But you know like it's just the idea with me that I felt very inferior there because I'm starting to get a little bit confident like in my look. Because that's you know like what she would start out with, my girlfriend, she uses like a psychology and that that she starts out building up a girl's look. Because I really looked dumpy. I mean like you know I didn't know what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - you know I just, I didn't take care of my hair or anything. I didn't do anything. You know I just really looked crummy. And then she worked on my look. And then I got that okay. And then she started me on a little bit of other areas. And I was doing fine until I started comparing myself again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then - see before I couldn't compare myself with her because she was up on a pedestal. She was my teacher.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now she's on of my best friends. See this is another thing. You know. And see all of a sudden I want what she's got. Just boom. And I can't do it and I know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that bothers me. You know. But that's one thing with my mother I know that there's something there right - way back there because I can remember that. Just like a silly thing like swinging.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Swinging higher than the other kids so that she would see me, I could do something better than everybody else because everybody else was afraid to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wasn't afraid. And she thought it was just fearlessness of kid - you know like a kid. I probably was scared. I probably was scared stiff. But you know like I was laughing and goofing around because you know Mommy finally looked. And she you know she said there's Helen and she can do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She finally looked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah she finally - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sure took a long time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah she finally like, like she saw me you know like I was there. And I think part of it's because like she was bedridden for a long time. You know. And like I was out playing and all this with the kids. So I never really saw my mother that much. You know even then. Even then when I had a mother I didn't have a mother. You know. And I can't remember, you know like even my sister for like all the things that she does like, I don't like the way she's raising the baby and that. But at least like her daughter's only like seven or eight, and if her daughter's got a problem she says Mommy, I'd like to talk to you. And then she goes in the other room and she talks to her. And I notice this and I think the reason why it really hit me so far home is because I don't think my mother ever did that to me. Sat me down and talked to me (50:57). You know. Just talked to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that was all that I wanted was just you know for (crying) [indiscernible].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have so much unhappiness in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying) She never even looked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you really needed to be looked at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't even realize it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I get the feeling that you were just kicked around so much and you never could cry. You never could say to anybody that you were really lonely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you. I never realized that she never - I never even thought of that. I always thought it was my father. Maybe he did too but I never realized that she - I can't even remember what she ever talked to me. She never sat down you know and said like, you know things like - even little things like I can't remember even saying I love you. It was almost like I was there and I just wasn't there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I think I've said before too she was telling me how my brother used to do so many things for me. Every time he got money he'd buy me things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That didn't stick with me at all. I don't know whether it wasn't important - maybe he didn't spend enough time with me either (53:59). It was just like, you know like I could go out and play until it was dark and all this and then I'd come home and I can't remember what I'd do when I was home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. It's just a big, blank space.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's just like - like I guess when I'd come home I'd go to bed or something or I'd play by myself or what I'd do, I don't remember. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was no people there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can remember somebody. We used to call her Grandma Bettie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I used to go over and watch TV with her for awhile. Maybe that's what I did, you know like on bad days, we'd go over and we'd watch TV. But I just can't remember you know like what I'd do with my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just wasn't there so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can remember her laying in bed and yet she says she wasn't bedridden like all the time. I can't remember her even walking around. You know it was like when I'd come in she'd be in bed. And you know I can't remember what we did or said to each other. You know. And then I don't' know what I did. And I can remember one night I woke up and I had a dollhouse like, and I woke up and it looked like there was eyes and nose and that. You know and I just got scared, I guess I'd been watching a scary movie or something. And I got so scared I can remember crying and crying and crying. And I don't remember whether my brother got up and he helped me or whether he did anything. I don't - because we slept in the same room. I can just remember that scared me so much and like, you know like there was nobody to run to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a weird, weird you know like what did I do? And I think that's why you know like lately when I get really scared or upset a lot of times I won't go to somebody when I should and I know. It's just like you know I'll just sit there and I'll cry or I'll feel like - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know like I'm scared. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're all by yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There isn't anybody there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's like - it's almost like even if I went to somebody nobody would listen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Because like I can't remember if I got out of bed or what I did and you know ran to her and she said you know just go back to bed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember when I had my appendicitis too. It was, I think I was six. Oh that was another thing too. There was like two or three things in that. When I got my appendicitis I would - I went to my mother and I can remember I had a stomachache and she said well just take some Pepto Bismal and go to bed or maybe she gave it to me, she might have gotten up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I can remember her one time up. Once or twice I can remember her being up. But not very often. And she - she said go to bed. And I can remember it hurt so bad. And then you know she had to get up to give me my penicillin and I used to run from it because I hated the taste of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then finally I went into the hospital and you know they said if I hadn't gotten in in another day or something I would have died.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can remember her saying that the doctor said - I can't remember the doctor saying, I can remember saying that the doctor said - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that I was a brave little soldier when I went under. Because you know like he told me to blow up that big black bag and I didn't know any better so I did. And so then I can remember having one of the young doctors was real nice to me. He used to say I looked like Marilyn Monroe or somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he was from Scotland. And there was another one from the Caribbean and he was real nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that was a happy time when you had all those people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I had these doctors that came in and saw me. And the one took out - the Caribbean doctor I remember he took out the stitches and he said, aww. He said don't cry. He says, at least turn your head because it will hurt me so much if you cry because I don't want to hurt you. And he was so nice. And the other one - the other one - I wrote the Caribbean fella a letter - </p>

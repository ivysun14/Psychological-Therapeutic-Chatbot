<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is Interview 13, Interview 13</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever that may be you've got plenty of damn time to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really like lots. There's a nice clump of time during the day that I'm just not around and there's nothing from him to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that when I come home the great excitement of having somebody to talk to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—which is perfectly understandable, except that I've been running around all day and have been on a schedule following other, in an indirect way, other peoples dictates. And don't have time just to kind of sit down and let myself relax and kind of straighten myself around and do whatever I feel like for a half an hour or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm kind of subverted to his demands, oh now there's somebody to talk to, you should talk to me I haven't had anybody to talk to all day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he asked you to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He asked me to do that because those are conditions of his life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I put everything down and I can't think of anything to say, because I don't have anything to say otherwise I would have said it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But why are you putting down then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, or I'll say I don't have anything to say at which point he will get very surly, I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I'll put things down and try and make conversation with him. And I don't want to have him unhappy or how to or peeved or feel rejected. Or I'll say well I really feel like reading just right now. He'll kind of shuffle off and he'll be kind of miffed about the whole thing. I'm neglecting him (inaudible—0:01:49.8), I'm not talking to him. He hasn't had anybody to talk to all day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your problem with this is that it seems like you keep on making him unhappy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. At the same time I have all these feelings about what kind of a trip he's trying to lay on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is, I'm kind of the great emotional end of the day, my coming home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's really not my fault he doesn't have anybody to talk to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So you (inaudible—0:02:28.3) have to bear that burden?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I think, you know, there are times when I'll walk in and pick up the paper and he'll say oh this great thing happened. Well, obviously I want to hear what it is and there's no problem. And the problem lies when nothing has really happened to either one of us during the day, we've got kind of unusual schedules nothing exciting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's really not too much that I have on my mind to communicate at the moment and I would just see he just kind of wants attention in what I find a very childish way, then we get a conflict.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it tends to make both of us or either one a little resentful the way the other handles it. And I'm never quite sure how exactly I should handle it, should I give into him all the time? But I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the signs of that? When you said well should give I guess sometimes you think you should?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean (inaudible—0:03:41.6), you know, that I should that who else does he have to talk to in a really intimate way and when you're close to somebody that way you should really be interested in everything that is happening with him. Except the timing just isn't right for me I'm not comfortable with it I don't particularly want to hear it —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—right then and there if it's, ah, I have, you know, a time when unwind my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So time like in sense two things make you want to do, make you think you ought to do that all the time which (inaudible—0:04:20.7) to the condition that you felt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And something about shouldn't you want to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean if one loves somebody shouldn't one react a certain way?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So it's kind of like saying you ought to react that way or else you don't love him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, except I realize is that that's a totally ideological reason. I mean it's impossible to pay attention to somebody 24 hours a day, I mean totally be riveted in them, be interested in nothing but what they have to say. And I don't expect myself to be that way any more, it's just too much. But there must be a median between total attention and no attention at all which makes both parties happy. (0:05:10.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean at every moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The vast majority of moments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you feel that what you would do if you were predisposed to it, what would amount to no attention any more? I mean, if you could always have it your way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no none at all. It would amount to a lot of attention sometimes, no attention sometimes and a medium amount of attention the other times. I mean there were just days when I kind of wished I could go home and felt some kind of indiscriminate suffering in my face and (inaudible—0:05:54.1), be the time putter do a little of this, (inaudible—0:05:57.8) of this, don't do that, get to the dishes when I feel like it, maybe watch some TV and then go to bed, and not have to follow some (inaudible—0:06:04.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But this success in the real life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now wait, what's the middle level of attention if you don't mean that kind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, middle level of attention is kind of doing things, doing two different things at the same time, being involved in something other then each other yet still very much together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you want to be able to find a way of doing all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's really easy to do when we're getting on very well, but when either one of us is insecure for some reason, whatever, or not feeling very well it's totally impossible to work. It seems to me that that allows us the alternative of either, if we both decide we don't want to do it alone, we're doing, want to do something together that's fine. If we want to just talk that's fine; however, if we want to still be something apart two separate things it doesn't necessarily mean that we're not being together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you want to change the definition of what together means?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's what it is, yeah. But I can't force someone. I guess what we're trying to do is to force each other's definition on us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:07:34.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think we both are. He would like me to accept his definition of being together is not doing anything else at the same time. And I would like him to accept my definition of being together is a feeling, a state of mind and not a physical thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sitting side by side reading two separate papers is still being together. And I guess we get stymied there. And then our definitions clash and we go through various little tricks and games trying to put them on one another and I just wouldn't have it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The right time (inaudible—0:08:24.2) earlier then anyone (inaudible—0:08:28.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:08:30.6) is not good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's such a wishy-washy person (inaudible—0:08:37.6). And when the wishy-washy does get, when he gets frustrated with me, the inability to make (inaudible—0:08:52.2). This crisis format that I'm getting involved in is really funny. I'm really digging it a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm very confused, I don't have any guidelines whatsoever. I have a huge amount of time communicating (inaudible—0:09:11.9) who mumbles. But the neat thing is the people that I've met by taking multiple graduate course, like I have had to ask if they (inaudible—0:09:23.7) history. It gives me a huge amount of practical information —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—on what to look up and have I thought about doing it this way and that's really not an efficient way to do it because X, Y and Z, and I try not —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—that's helpful and Mike Neely is helpful (inaudible—0:09:40.6). It's just amazing how much he mumbles. It's really incredible. My problem is I start in a mumble and I'm really stuttering and mushing my words and groping for a word like hot and cold and coming up with light or dark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that from? Are you describing it just to be in contact with him and trying to be articulate? (0:10:06.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's whenever I talk to people, you know, whenever I talk to like the people in the department or any of the graduate students I get suddenly incomprehensible and to me extremely irritating. I think it's because I'm afraid and I'm just really frightened of being stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of what I'm trying to express is not being on the correct level or clear enough or intelligent enough or just what I'm trying to say is just that what I'm trying to say is stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. You're straining so hard to make it smart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And to make the appearance —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's totally incomprehensible and I'm coming up with the completely wrong term and I keep on groping for the right words which I know somewhere in the recesses of my mind, and I come out with the wrong words inevitable. When I like I just realized the whole conversation trying to obtain a thermometer with delicate, calibrated on a delicate scale, meaning I want a thermometer to a half or fourth degree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That the word I went I think of delicate but calibrated, I cannot accurately calibrate which can be anything. So, the whole conversation was for nothing because we had the wrong thermometer and I had to (inaudible—0:11:27.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how come? You just told me perfectly well what you meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that was the reality though, I thought I had to say what do I mean? I know what kind of thermometer I'm looking for but what is the word for …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no you didn't tell me the word, that's what I mean you didn't tell me the word which I also don't know and I don't think of it as delicate, but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's fine to calibrate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I have to stop and think about it but before a second ago I didn't know. But I knew what you meant and why what I mean because you said the times where you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't say that until I was handed the wrong thermometer and I said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now did you not know that you had the wrong word?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could see it but I couldn't come up with the right one (inaudible—0:12:12.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about a synonym? I mean, you know there's a, there's like another … I'm saying how I understood you was because you thought the right word and all the possible wrong words is also the same like a definition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like were you not conscious of that or were you trying to get the word instead of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was trying to get the word, I was trying to sound articulate and knowledgeable, right? I was trying to come up with the right word. I didn't want to have to go into a ten-minute third grade explanation of the thermometer I wanted which is what I had to do in the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanted the one accurate word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead, want instead (inaudible—0:12:48.9) and what you have, I mean not the thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't have a synonym.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:12:52.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of the (inaudible—0:13:00.3) attitude of like the guy I was talking to who I knew, he's the type of guy who you describe something to him and he goes, “Oh yeah” and gives you the word and says why didn't you say so. Or says look here or what's there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's important to him that you have the right word? Or important to you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—in relation to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm trying very hard to establish some sort of degree of competency, I mean the people should think that I'm intelligent and I have some degree of competency, I'm trying very hard. I'm very, very bewildered so I maybe don't know exactly what I'm doing, I don't have my feet together at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, people don't I'm talking about and it just seems like what you're doing then is getting into pretense which in fact is less successful then would be giving your definition. I mean the pretense of having the correct word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do, I just can't find it. But I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, somewhere along the line I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the second conversation I had with this guy I knew that the opposite of the word I wanted was gross.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't want a gross meter because I needed something that was more exact and on a smaller scale and the gross measurement would not be what I needed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which still left me trying to find the word I was looking for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But see the other places I fear (inaudible—0:14:32.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I keep the cap on it unless you wanting the right word or not, none approaches to it, the right word?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Incredible or nothing at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't even be functional I mean (inaudible—0:14:46.6)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm just saying I mean how much is at stake in that it doesn't, I mean in a way I mean not in a way, it sounds like it's pulling all things that you can't really pull off, right then anyway I mean we all know that there's performance and there's acquisition, but —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—right then you don't have the performance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you simply don't. You've got this other thing which doesn't seem very good to you. (0:15:15.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My whole impression of myself right now which is perfectly accurate is I'm completely confused (inaudible—0:15:21.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I find it very upsetting that at this point when I get confused and a little frightened that I lose my powers of articulation which I've never been in the position —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—of losing before. I mean, I've always managed to bullshit beautifully find a way to almost any situation (inaudible—0:15:42.5). But at this point I'm just have completely freaked out and really frightened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's really important, I mean I really want to go into the feeling, I really want to work with these people for the next year or two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really think it would be really, really great if I could get some sort of paper out (inaudible—0:16:05.2) that can be submitted to graduate school and people can depend on research and possibly go into the Honors Program. And it all hinges on my next two or three months and how will I get it together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a project (inaudible—0:16:19.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not going to get anywhere with it. It would be (inaudible—0:16:30.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wonder of this that you do want to work. Are you saying that with other things before (inaudible—0:16:36.2) you could manage so well if you didn't care how much (inaudible—0:16:40.4)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, probably. Also, these other things I always had a certain degree of competence in my bag of knowledge in whatever it was I was speaking. And I'm really very, very uncomfortable at the moment with my biological and/or (inaudible—0:17:01.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The (inaudible—0:17:08.3) issue is a lot of these terms (inaudible—0:17:11.5). But even basic English are coming out grabbled, dark instead of cold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're dark instead of hot. In terms it makes me more confusing and less at ease and even less at ease.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. It sounds like what has happened to you (inaudible—0:17:34.1) is under great strain and I'm wondering about what the strain meant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least there are two things, there's the thing about wanting very much and it seems very important to (inaudible—0:17:54.1) and another thing that in addition to that, since that you don't have that much there to (inaudible—0:18:04.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To show people something that you know things that you don't really know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not even that. I'm much, much better at saying wait a minute what do you mean, what are you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hold it. Don't take for granted I know that or what is that, then I have been previously. Usually I'm just quite I wouldn't say anything if I didn't know what was going on, now I'll ask. But the feeling that I kind of get from the set up now is that the basic responsibility is on me to design the experiment and to decide what I want. I have to decide what I want to do and they'll tell me whether (inaudible—0:19:00.1) and help me. I get the feeling that well it's my responsibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's only a limited amount of help that I can get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, limited amount of help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they'll give me various instructions and so on and so forth but they're not going to design the experiment for me, they're not going to set it up for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not going to design the procedures and they're not going to figure out the problems and they're not going to tell me which is really important about it. I'm just going to have to sit down and figure it out. And I don't know where to go to (inaudible—0:19:45.3) I really don't. Like Peter just recommended the, I think it's the Handbook of Biological (inaudible—0:19:52.8), which I have never heard of but which will tell me things like body temperatures and stuff, which I need.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (0:20:01.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one or two times I've tried to get help on other things, I have gotten really strange reactions. Most of the time the people I'm asking will (inaudible—0:20:18.0) are not quite sure where to send me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The kind of chance as to what kind of help I get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:20:26.7). I'm quite afraid just to make a really serious mistake being told that whatever just come back some other time, we can't, we don't have the time to spend that time nursing you and coaching you, which could very well happen. I mean that's what happened last quarter they don't have the time to help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Sometimes I think (inaudible—0:20:56.3) that you, you're going to keep on asking you're going to turn them off or get rejected?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And yet an outstanding alternative to ask them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there are certain alternatives but it's really strange because so much of the literature I'm using, especially in regards to the program, is rather over my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of the literature has to do with insects, damn it that's what they discovered (inaudible—0:21:33.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the articles that you don't ever take a look at and I took a look at it and it was (inaudible—0:21:40.0) to me and I guess I could have deciphered it if I really wanted to, but I really didn't care. I mean I'm like I started dieting being very hungry all the time and I have a very short patience (inaudible—0:21:54.4) and I just couldn't make myself to go through because it would be so difficult for me to figure out what it was talking about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:22:00.5). And at the same time (inaudible—0:22:07.4) I made myself go through it and I waited for like (inaudible—0:22:10.8). But I guess I'm really fearful of being told that they just don't have the time ri4ght now to go into things with me, (inaudible—0:22:24.6) to kind of lead me by the hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Is that what you think you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a start I mean in some ways yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because sort of like I'm (inaudible—0:22:37.5), I'm kind of (inaudible—0:22:39.6) with the lack of background I have and how there seems to be no (inaudible—0:22:44.5) during my basic education and the literature I'm reading now and the work I'm expected to do and the work of the people around me are doing. There should be some kind of intermediate course somewhere along the line that would like to help me out but there isn't, there's nothing I've tried everything that this damn school has to offer and now (inaudible—0:23:10.0). I really feel like I'm being discriminated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time I'm extremely fearful of screwing myself by not being quick enough to pick up what I should pick up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you shouldn't pick it up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That even if it's not being presented to me in course (inaudible—0:23:31.1) figure out what's going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't get started for another week or so at which time I should be able to try and figure something out. Find a couple more offers. I mean basically like (inaudible—0:24:00.1) said to me don't forget the thermometer and I thought it was a rather accurate and calibrated, delicately calibrated thermometer of sorts. What it turns out to be is an implant which you implant on the (inaudible—0:24:18.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I can see all kinds of problems coming up because of that (inaudible—0:24:26.4), exactly what does it mean for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What it meant for me was he used a term which I felt I had an idea of what it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Thought you knew that one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it was totally a problem, to have Jack explaining. I mean there are certain people who kind of look at me and kind of have a grasp of the things that they should explain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dan Goldfeld saying (inaudible—0:24:48.5), but a lot of the people like (inaudible—0:24:52.4) and Matt just charge ahead and it's very hard to stop them and ask questions it's just very difficult physically to get in-between the barrage of words. (0:25:01.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it boils down is I just have to keep trying really hard to figure out what they're talking about and to ask the right question and not be afraid to say what I don't know because I just haven't had that much background.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that? Well, it makes a lot of sense to me but it's very hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's very (inaudible—0:25:26.6)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to appear stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're too proud?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it does, I don't like to be slow and I don't like being unknowledgeable. Another frustration if there isn't even a dictionary I mean with 90 percent of the terms I need that I've gone through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about the dictionary in psychology? (inaudible—0:26:11.7)? Do you know the one I mean? It's red and black and (inaudible—0:26:16.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: What medical dictionary (inaudible—0:26:22.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I haven't been able to find anywhere in Georgia (inaudible—0:26:28.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's just say on there are things you want to do on your own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like part of the problem would be alleviated if I could just remember some of the terms which are being thrown about that I can't like figure out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I would, you know, go and look up (inaudible—0:26:49.3) but even the references are the same sort of thing. I have Keaton which is too simple and I have a pharmacology reference which is too difficult. And I'm really caught (inaudible—0:27:08.6) and I'm in a real end of the year stage and I'm just not finding the tools to help me out at all. The brightest texts that have been recommended just has not been my (inaudible—0:27:20.4). I don't know it's just something I keep hacking at until I get terms and procedures and (inaudible—0:27:37.2) in my (inaudible—0:27:38.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very hard and tough to feel that frustration.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And this is (inaudible—0:27:45.0) problem to you too? It seems to keep you from doing certain, you know, that might get you out of the situation and into not wanting to be embarrassed, not wanting to appear stupid to these people. Well, when you are ignorant that's different —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—a little different then stupid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But some of the stuff I feel like I should have observed (inaudible—0:28:14.6). Some of it I have, has been briefly touched upon (inaudible—0:28:22.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should have some idea of what it is. What I need right now what I may do after I (inaudible—0:28:29.5) is just go downstairs and talk to one of the associate science people (inaudible—0:28:36.8) and ask him directly (inaudible—0:28:39.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And … I know there are a few, in fact at one point I think I have the names and I've lost it, I need to find that. I think (inaudible—0:29:02.3). I know who —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got to choose your, who you give your request to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that's relative (inaudible—0:29:17.4) it could be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because some of the people are kind of more delicately attuned to the degree that I'm at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think they'll be more helpful finding the text for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, they'll be kind of more sensitive to what kind of thing I need and how simple it should be and how complicated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of the problems people have been saying oh this one would be really good for you, actually it has been over my head. Finding somebody who knows and not to refer, to refer me things without knowing too much and only knowing specialized material.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not a matter that some people … it sounds like you're saying some people will think less of me and some people will not talk to me about it so they aren't people to ask for a favor. There are only certain people down there that are people to ask for a favor. (0:30:14.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are only certain people out there. I appeared at the door and smiled and one guy looked up and said what do you want because I know you want something. And then was perfectly helpful kind of teasing me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. But there's an awkward moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's an awkward moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you prefer (inaudible—0:30:36.2)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I prefer not to have to run into. I don't know I'll figure it out somehow. Maybe I'll check back through my old notebooks and see if I can find some of the references that some of the TAs gave, it might do good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you haven't thought of something like going back to someone after (inaudible—0:31:02.7)? Well, what you recommended is too hard for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly because the stuff I'm talking about I was doing for the last two weeks before (inaudible—0:31:25.1) and I didn't have the time, I just didn't have the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also because when I would get into that feel that I was figuring out the feel the way I was doing and talk about the paper was too much, I didn't really need that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I found that I wasn't, that the references I was consulting with were too complicated and I had a lot of background which I had to kind of make up then I figured fine I'll just let it go and I'll concentrate —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—on the (inaudible—0:31:50.4). And that's why I didn't. Also because I am really embarrassed and I'm just really embarrassed I mean I have this big hangover about it which I have to really fight. Really strange thing happened to me. What was the strange was pretty horrible. Last Friday (inaudible—0:32:25.7) —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—you're suppose (inaudible—0:32:28.4) kind of use bike auction showing and I felt pretty strange about it because we don't know too much about (inaudible—0:32:35.7). And we came back I was still willing to go the next morning at least see what was going on (inaudible—0:32:47.9) flipped out, I didn't want to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was like really awful too much apart (inaudible—0:32:58.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:33:01.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was alternatively (inaudible—0:33:10.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was kind of like seeing someone (inaudible—0:33:23.2) out of control and acting crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It was really awful though (inaudible—0:33:29.5). And wondering what was going on. (inaudible—0:33:36.3) you don't want to go you wouldn't go. And he kept on going into hysterics about how it was something I wanted to do and that I wasn't doing but he would carry on and his not being able to control himself which were any need from doing something that I wanted to do —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—and how he felt guilty about that. And what a ratty person he was and how I shouldn't have to worry about how he behaved and no go, if I want to go he'll go and it was awful. It was just terrible I was just really upset. What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was kind of what, what thing that you were so incredibly upset.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. That he was just so completely out of control and that I should, didn't know how to communicate with him or help him at all. That I kept on trying to get through to him and say, you know, it really isn't that important. —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—And he kept on saying yeah but you want to do it, you're not being open with me how do (inaudible—0:34:42.7) and all you're doing is trying to play kick me and here I am and I'm lousy and I'm just terrible for you, what an awful person I am and how I hate myself but I don't really want to go and throw something. And they would throw something against the wall and I don't know what, just so terrible. (0:35:01.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not to get (inaudible—0:35:02.2) upset too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But not to be able to help him cope and I kept on trying and really what he was doing was exactly what I was trying to prevent by saying that I wouldn't go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole thing was his … in the middle of the situation you feel this pressure, it's really upset, you have to get out of here, we have to go I want to go right now kind of rushes out the door. And that's really embarrassing (inaudible—0:35:34.2). And it's just, just very difficult situation to handle, all is much worse that it happened in front of my people then if we, beforehand decided not to go because a certain party would be uncomfortable. It seems to me it would be a much more rational approach to the problem that he is going to be uncomfortable anyway. We might as well decide intelligently beforehand and prevent a discomfort which was what I was trying to do. If he was going to be uncomfortable with this thing then we shouldn't go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was just all just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you thought you were trying to help him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or help the two of you in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And he was reacting that I placating him and that I was not telling him the truth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was being treated as a child?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which to a certain, to take into the nth degree yeah I guess he was. Just like you don't take, for a certain period of time perhaps you don't take your children to a restaurant because kids just can't behave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or knowing that your child is very, very frightened of large animals you don't take him to the zoo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Simple things like that. Certain situations are going to put Murphy up tight and you don't put him in those situations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was reacting very negatively to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To that kind of (inaudible—0:37:08.2)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, I think he's pretty crazy (inaudible—0:37:18.6) our agreement. Before I would say yes I want you to do this, I want to do it let's go and we'll see how you do and he would in the end get very perturbed and we would have (inaudible—0:37:29.8) we would have to rush off or and I would be very pissed. And so (inaudible—0:37:34.9) agreement that I was just not to put him in these sort of situations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I wasn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I wasn't (inaudible—0:37:43.9) situation. And he just (inaudible—0:37:47.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like before you would get for doing certain kind of thing and now you decide you won't do that thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got hit for it and you got hit for not doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you leaves what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It leaves me frightened too. (inaudible—0:38:03.8). A lot of the times he doesn't I mean like I felt that deep down side he wasn't treating me out so much about the bike auction which was something in which would freak him out to a certain degree. But the bike auction was kind of a line up (inaudible—0:38:17.0) about bikes and I'm not confident about bikes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:38:20.2), I actually don't have a job, we don't have the money for a bike and I'm incompetent about getting a job. I think the whole (inaudible—0:38:27.4) of his attention (inaudible—0:38:30.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As much as the bike thing, which I said really in the beginning at the (inaudible—0:38:36.0), you know, you really are (inaudible—0:38:41.0). And how can we afford it when I don't have a job. It was like really transparent to me but I still couldn't get through. And I'm still left with … like an hour or an hour and a half totally shattered (inaudible—0:39:05.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Completely (inaudible—0:39:07.2). And then even like we were talking —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A certain way, I just want to know, was there, is there an issue, you felt kind of communicating your upset to me or is it also more how you could (inaudible—0:39:27.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just what? I'm kind of passing out how do I handle things like that? (inaudible—0:39:34.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any different that went wrong or just the sense of me just at a loss?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sense of being at a loss. That maybe telling him that if he didn't want to go I wouldn't go was a mistake but I don't see what else I could have done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're thinking what (inaudible—0:39:58.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's the truth. It was perfectly fine with me not to go to the bike auction the next day. We did something entirely different, it was fine I didn't mind. (0:40:07.0)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure I like the bike but no we didn't really have the money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could be talked out of it (inaudible—0:40:12.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just became this huge, huge issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (inaudible—0:40:23.5), an issue where in sense kind of fell over (inaudible—0:40:28.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:40:31.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was really into this whole trip about I was just doing this to placate him and that I would resent him later. Well, I didn't resent nothing about the bike though not nearly as much as resented his temper tantrum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was really upsetting. Yeah, especially on a Friday afternoon, an hour before I have to go work, he goes to pieces that's really difficult because there I am (inaudible—0:41:05.3). It would be much better for him if I stuck around but we're dead broke.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. You have to go to work and that kind of thing make you so much not want to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I feel that (inaudible—0:41:22.6). And I caught in the (inaudible—0:41:33.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:41:36.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I had to go to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:41:44.7). How to talk to him at a time like that or how should you be reacting or what to do with your feelings about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, all of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what are you thinking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, usually I (inaudible—0:42:06.7). Everybody I have ever known that had thrown temper tantrum have always resorted to hitting that person (inaudible—0:42:20.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean temper tantrums (inaudible—0:42:25.0)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eventually, if you're that sort of person to have a temper tantrum you're going to hit someone and if I'm the only person around it's going to be me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is the feeling (inaudible—0:42:34.3)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like a common fear (inaudible—0:42:37.7). Because if I don't say the right things, I don't do the right thing I'm just going to get smacked and possibly hurt that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're just scared, like being in that cage without (inaudible—0:42:54.8) and you have to move around it very carefully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that is my (inaudible—0:43:01.1), complete fear (inaudible—0:43:08.7). And not knowing what to expect. Whether he is just going (inaudible—0:43:14.2) throw something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's incalculable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:43:27.0). Then he went on, awhile back when we were talking kind of the way I expected him to act and I had talked to him about that lower expectation (inaudible—0:43:52.4) and how I worked very hard and expecting him to react as an adult child fashion —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—and how I was getting here. And then he went on for a long period (inaudible—0:44:04.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean he's saying now I've blown it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And now (inaudible—0:44:12.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (inaudible—0:44:15.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: More then before yeah. There is nothing I could say to him that what can I say show me (inaudible—0:44:27.6). Don't feel bad about it. (inaudible—0:44:36.6), I'm trying to be honest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's, I found that is very difficult for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean when he says things like that I guess he went into re-incrimination that I thought of which he agreed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously reinforcing his re-incriminations were not such a good idea (inaudible—0:44:55.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean things you would like to do and said well that is how it works, that would just kind of driven him farther into his thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. On the other hand I couldn't say oh no, (inaudible—0:45:16.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a problem then because you do have a reaction and you might not want to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think it's wise. Do you think it's correct (inaudible—0:45:36.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: To help him get himself back together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a judgment that that's not the (inaudible—0:46:00.0)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, like just like yeah I agree with your incrimination (inaudible—0:46:10.4) it's not that cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible—0:46:17.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I know that there is a kind of reaction, of course, you can't play that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By that time like I was in tears. I had had it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just sitting there, I was just kind of like, I was in my own shell because I had just been battered for about an hour listening to him going on and on and he freaked me out. And running out of the room, running in the room and all I could say is I don't know. I really don't know what I'm going to think of you in five days, I was just aching emotionally aching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then are you saying really tell when you could have taken a decision back (inaudible—0:47:10.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just felt like I very (inaudible—0:47:19.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No way you could change him, no way you could control your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there seemed to be only two alternatives. Either stay in communication with him which would have to be that plus (inaudible—0:47:45.3) or totally close myself off and walk out. And I felt that walking out (inaudible—0:47:51.7). And I was not going to walk out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you weren't going to leave him and you didn't have any alternative but to walk, but to deal with him. You either close yourself off or you don't. You kind of stay cool (inaudible—0:48:18.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried, I mean that's how I tried to stay very rationale and very removed from his emotional and to say when he said well I don't want to go, I'm uncomfortable and I don't want to go for this reason and this reason and this reason and this reason I said that's fine as long as you don't, if you don't want to go that's perfectly fine with me you don't have to go. And he got furious because I had said, the way it all began, well if he had said look I'm uncomfortable about for the following reasons (inaudible—0:49:03.5) and I would rather not go how do you feel about it? And I said well if you don't want to go that's fine we won't go. And he went into this big trip about he didn't want me reacting to the potential emotional situation, he wanted me to go through the reasons but my honest reaction was he's going to get upset in the middle and I don't want to have to go through that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if this is what he needs, write down, this is what I'll do I was no longer concerned with the bike auction at all but with his head and I so reacted and he got very, very pissed and started throwing tantrums.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he didn't like that you genuinely reacted to his reactions to the situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He wanted me to react to the situation and I just wasn't reacting. And that's when he went into all kinds of stuff of incriminations about forcing me to react to him about certain situations. Which, yeah, to a certain degree of knowledge sure I've learned so I want to avoid situations launched by, maybe I should react to him (inaudible—0:50:22.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the way that you reacted to him last Friday is the way that over time would come to be the way that seemed the best.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:50:39.2), that way you should not let him freak out over it he shouldn't (inaudible—0:50:47.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible—0:50:51.5) he did freak out, so maybe there is something involved. Maybe I'm not having (inaudible—0:50:57.6) even though this is the method which has evolved over time (inaudible—0:51:02.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To react to his reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I just have no idea how to react to a situation like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you kind of even don't know whether you were really wrong (inaudible—0:51:15.8) you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was just trying to keep the whole thing on a very even rational level and he totally is screwing with my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The past two weeks have been very emotional, there's just not a job not turning up and the guy has been calling has to do with his last name, maybe next Tuesday, call me next Tuesday and then not being there Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And call back tomorrow, he calls back tomorrow well I don't know yet, it's a cliff hanger (inaudible—0:51:57.5). And he feels that when I diet (inaudible—0:52:17.2). I understand but I still think (inaudible—0:52:21.4). He kind of sees my diet as an imposition on him. He can't eat as well (inaudible—0:52:34.8). Which is true, I mean if he has to use a little more ingenuity to create a cookie for one person (inaudible—0:52:34.8) wanting to cook well for one person, it just takes a certain degree of thinking about it and picking the right kind of recipes. But he's going onto his —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he sees it as imposition but in fact a minor one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It takes a little more time, but we spend a lot of time on cooking and it takes a little more thinking about it. And he has this thing about he doesn't like to eat alone so what I'm doing I'm on a liquid diet, I'm dieting with Sego, (inaudible—0:53:17.2). And I agreed with our friend up there we would go on it together type and kind of see how far we got with it, if it was any good. So I'm drinking four glasses of Sego a day and I'm really hungry and to have to sit and watch him devour three lamb chops, it's really like super annoying on the first couple of days of your diet you're really hungry, but that's what I'm doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel it's an imposition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel that my diet is much more of an imposition on me then it is on him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's making such a fuss about it and such a big thing that I am going to eat with him and in fact I'm even going to cook for him, you know, just to show him that it can be done. Because there are all types of things I can make for just one person, I have to adjust. But I'm kind of pissed that I have to do this, that I not only need the discipline to simply maintain my own diet but I need the discipline to have to sit around and watch somebody else stuff themselves and cook well for someone else, which makes it twice as difficult. I mean if you can just take care of yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (inaudible—0:54:35.1) he's not going to allow you just to take care of yourself on this, he's making you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he's not making me cook for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—cook for him. But take these things into consideration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's making such a fuss about it, yeah. It's making it that much more difficult for me to diet which is hard to begin with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're basically pissed off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm pissed off. I'm pretty damn pissed off. But right at this particular moment I don't want to make a fuss about it but he's really (inaudible—0:55:10.8). And also because we are both very irritable and short tempered and I don't want to precipitate a really big hassle because we're not going to get anywhere. At the end of the hassle we are both going to be pissed out and we are both going to feel put out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't seem like anything can really change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because he said I know it's unfair for me to say so but this is the way I feel I'm being honest with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said sure it irritates me but I can handle it and I'll do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what, you mean this kind of visual level, hostility has been admitted to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's the level that you want to keep it at? Or anything that you could do to try to get it less will only make it more?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't see exactly how we can lessen this particular anxiety. I mean if he has to eat alone he's going to resent it, there's no doubt about it. If he has to eat less well, he's going to resent it. The new resentment is he can't go out for dinner because how can I go out with him and sit there and drink Sego, which is pretty nervy, while he sits there and stuffs himself. How can he do that? Which is pretty much true. But he hates eating alone so he doesn't want to go eating out by himself and leaving me home to drink my Sego. Like he will be uncomfortable at that point and I must have admit that if I have to go to a restaurant with him and drink Sego I'll be pretty uncomfortable too. So, I don't quite know what to do about it except that, you know, withstand it as long as I can and I figure it will be better when I'm less acutely hungry. It will also be much better when I have lost the weight, like I've lost three pounds yesterday and I just started. That it will be much easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—0:57:18.1). You both are really on edge because of his job and you because of what not eating and both seem (inaudible—0:57:35.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It leads me to thinking quite what (inaudible—0:57:52.4). Because often the solution to our feeling bad about one another is to sit down and cook together or to have a meal together and how one of our major and perhaps our only truly shared interest, I mean one that we both had before we met one another is good food and good wine. So we share that I mean we just feel very comfortable around and I'm challenging it I'm saying I'm just not going to eat and I'm sitting a limit on it either. I said I'm not I'm going to diet for as long (inaudible—0:58:30.4) until I get down to as light as I possibly can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe that's not such a minor thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe it's not. Dieting is always so difficult but it has always been … when I finally set my mind to it the way I have now I started a very serious diet, I've managed to pull it off it hasn't been that much of a hassle because I guess I only have to deal with me. I just didn't go out and I just ate or whatever, cottage cheese and that was it I didn't have to deal with him. And when I was dieting at home with my parents they were all for seeing me (inaudible—0:59:09.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in contrast (inaudible—0:59:34.3) you really welcomed it, it's almost like a specialty shop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he would love to have me thinner, that's (inaudible—0:59:41.1) I mean he has been commenting about how heavy I am and I am heavier then I have ever been in my life (inaudible—0:59:48.8). Which comes from our love of food and the way we cook I've never eaten that way before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I finally got myself together and I really put myself on a strict diet which is the only way I can lose weight there's no doubt about it. I'm not one of these people who sets a 1,500 calorie limit per day and figures everything out doesn't eat any more or less. I mean I just diet or I don't, I mean I can like really go on them and spend two months taking off 20 pounds (inaudible—1:00:18.7). If I'm not on a very strict diet (inaudible—1:00:24.5) all the time. (inaudible—1:00:28.9) because I have been trying for the past two months to kind of diet quietly and I put on another ten pounds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So much for that system. And he feels he hasn't been able to make certain things because I've been trying to get on a diet for the last two months that he has been not making what he wants for himself, for awhile and now it's getting worse. I really feel the whole thing is a great lack of ingenuity, an inability to cope with the changes (inaudible—1:01:04.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you really don't have (inaudible—1:01:05.8). I mean you had to wait and see how —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I see how —</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—he plays.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—but I really don't have any (inaudible—1:01:11.4). I mean I, but I'm in a position where I have to have some assistance for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to ask (inaudible—1:01:15.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, why is this? Because there's a guy who might not to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right now it would be (inaudible—1:01:21.8), I just don't want to have another (inaudible—1:01:27.3). And it could be very hard for me he's going through all kinds of identity crisis in terms of (inaudible—1:01:43.0). And the last thing you need is kind of hassling me about (inaudible—1:01:51.6). So until he's a little more together I'm going to put up with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See what I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: However, you are always going to keep going through … are you saying that you aren't going to be able to (inaudible—1:02:08.8) his effort successfully?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think so to a point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there are going to be times when I'm just going to say I really don't want to cook for you tonight, like I'm really hungry and I'm really tired and what I really want to do is stuff myself so please leave me alone right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, I'm going to try very hard to eat with him and to take my share of the cooking, take my share of these issues which is also highly irritating to have to sit and watch somebody else (inaudible—1:02:40.1) delicious lamb chops, it's really madding. He would (inaudible—1:02:46.20) faster he would be perfectly happy to cook all his meals and have me wash all the dishes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I really don't dig at all one bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible—1:02:56.1)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because (inaudible—1:03:02.5) and he hates to eat and wash his own dishes because it makes him feel like (inaudible—1:03:11.2). And boy if I have no sympathy for having to sit and watch him eat I have even less sympathy for the fact that he doesn't like to cook and wash his dishes when that's an imposition on him, I just think that's so much utter crap and self indulgence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not going to make an issue out of it because I really think it's the wrong time to make an issue —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT:—about something as ridiculous and deep rooted as that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so you really I mean why you keep asking me in a way I'm asking well, what's the problem with it and it seems like there are problems with it —</p>

<p>CLIENT: The problem —</p>

<p>THERAPIST:—(inaudible—1:03:59.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT:—is getting myself into lie, you know, of making myself theoretically feeling that I should tolerate these things and make myself tolerant (inaudible—1:04:11.5). Say, oh god damn it why should I have to wash your dishes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why should I have to cook your meals, why should I have to watch you stuffing yourself and all I can eat is this lousy bland of Sego, a can of skim milk or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Your convinced that (inaudible—1:04:32.9)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible—1:04:38.9). All these big fights and he's just getting too unsettled and not sure of himself right now for me to have (inaudible—1:04:47.5). And it still leaves me being pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not to the point of doing it (inaudible—1:05:05.6). I'll see, I'll see how long I last. If I don't last very long and there's really, you know, starts bothering me a lot I'll just have to say I really think this is ridiculous. I'll have to try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we should stop. You don't get appointments with us any more.</p>

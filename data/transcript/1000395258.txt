<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence)  I was just thinking about the fact that uhm, the woman I have been trying to get in, in, uh — you know, had to get MYJ to fill in for — came by today, so that she could meet me and see FSO, know what I'd want her to do and all.  And uhm, I was just thinking about my reaction — she's a very nice woman and I'm pleased that she can come, and I think she'll be responsible and all.  But uh, I mean, it h—, it almost had, it was just because of, I don't know whether it was because of her age, or because she's another woman, or just what.  But uhm, I reacted as if she would be critical of me, I suppose as a mother, maybe anyway.  (Sniff) And I don't know, it was as if, how can I be telling her what to do, I mean i—, almost as if I expect that she'll be telling me what to do.  She has, well I think it's 3 grown girls.  But I don't even know if the fact that she's a mother with grown children would make any difference.  Just the fact that she's a woman might make me feel this way, anyway. </p>

<p>And so it's almost as if I am apologizing her when I tell her what I want her to do.  Or if I'm not sure, because uhm, each week or each 2 weeks or so, I notice that FSO's changed quite a bit.  And what t—, th—, I don't know, I mean not totally in the way I handle her, but In, to some degree, in the timing of things.  And, so what I might want her to do right now, would be different from, I don't know, 2 or 3 weeks from now.  And I felt — I'm sure she understands that — but on the other hand I felt somehow that I should be more definite, or something.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>And I think there's something too, uhm, I was thinking this when I was feeding FSO, right before I came here, uh, that I haven't felt so much with MYJ, maybe because MYJ's younger, or maybe because MYJ's a boy.  I don't know which it would be.  But uhm, but I, but I was thinking of now having this woman replace MYJ babysitting, and th—, almost as if she'll replace — I mean, in a way she is replacing me, but uh, uh, I think I was feeling it in another way, as if somehow emotionally she'll replace me to FSO.  And (Pause) I guess it's just a feeling that I won't feel so necessary.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>The next thing I think of is, uh, the fact that FNI called today.  As she's been doing quite a bit, especially lately, uh, and i—, no, with no particular purpose, except just to say how are things going.  I don't know, I, I think, I mean, sometimes I'm not surprised if I haven't seen them for awhile and haven't spoken to her.  But this time, I think I was feeling kind of surprised, because we just saw them Sunday.  And she always asks first, how are you, how's, or how's it going, how's the baby?  And then proceeds to give me advice on something, whatever it is.  And I always try to, I always feel I don't want to set up a situation where she's going to give me advice. </p>

<p>And today, I don't know, I just felt, well I, I, well I think I did feel more annoyed than sometimes.  Because it's almost as if I'm feeling she's checking up on me.  As if she's saying, well I really know more about it than you.  (Sigh)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well so your feeling about FNI and uhm, your sitter are essentially the same.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   In both cases, you feel somehow like a little girl.  This uh, woman is telling you how to do things with the little baby.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) It makes me wonder about something that uh, maybe I've thought of it before, but it seems like a new thought.  Because when I was thinking about — this sitter's name is MRS BJC — uhm, and I even have a problem, she's referred to herself to me as FCE.  And I haven't known, because sometimes with some people like this, it takes awhile before you can call them by their first name.  And I felt very much I don't know what I should be calling her.  I have been calling her Mrs. BJC, because I'd first started that way, before I'd uhm, met her and we had worked out anything.  And it's almost as if I'm feeling I can't, how can I call her anything but that, but I haven't, I'm not in a position to be anything but very formal.   
But, but in any case, when I was thinking about her and my reaction to her, or to the situation, and I suppose to her because she's what she is, uh, I was thinking that I could somehow see the wa—, that I don't know, her age would make me feel that here was another mother figure, sort of thing.  Because her age is the same as my mother's, or enough so that I was thinking of it that way.  But then when I see that this feeling I have toward FNI is the same kind of thing, uhm, I don't know, it just makes me wonder.  I mean, I don't quite see her as a mother figure, I don't think, except that it seems like all my competition with women comes from being, feeling like a daughter and, and younger, as I was with my mother.  But also feeling very competitive and not wanting to feel in an inferior position, or, or a less powerful position.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think the reason I think this seems like a new thought to me, and, and yet in a way I feel as if it isn't so new, but uhm, I think with FNI I've been thinking this feeling of competitiveness with her came because I was feeling competitive with my sisters.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about my re—, the next thing I think of is my relationship with MSCZ and my reaction to having intercourse.  And I don't know, w_ we had it again last night and the feeling I had then was feeling angry.  But I was more aware of feeling I was fighting something than just feeling angry.  And not letting myself get involved, which I know, I, I can hear myself having said this before, except I can't remember anything else about what I've said before. </p>

<p>And last night I — and I've had this feeling before too, of — I think I use FSO as kind of an excuse.  How can I, sort of totally blot her awhile and concentrate on just my relationship with MSCZ, or the experience we're having and forget about her.  And so I fight doing that too, and, or at least that's one way to fight something else.  To keep sort of being aware of her, and my responsibility to her, even though she's perfectly fine.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Could I have a tissue, please?  (Softly) I seem to have gotten something in my eye again.  Thank you.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean when I got something in my eye?  I don't know, it does seem sort of suspicious, since I rarely do. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You were just talking about blotting out FSO.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence)  Well I suppose, it could be partly that I really want to blot her, I mean, I am saying in another context that I'm fighting blotting her out, because I really want to.  I don't know how m—, I mean I think when I was pregnant I assumed things would be difficult for awhile between MSCZ and me, just simply because we hadn't had intercourse for so long, and our relationship would be changed with the child, and had changed while I was pregnant, to some extent.  But yet in another way, I think I kept thinking well, things will get back the way they were, and they had been getting back.  And, or my feelings had been getting better, and, or more to what I want them to be, and (Sniffles) it hasn't happened that way, in fact it seems like it's worse. </p>

<p>And I don't know, maybe I blame FSO for that, too.  If she weren't there, then I could feel th_ the way toward MSCZ and toward having sex with him that I was getting to feel more frequently before I was pregnant.  (Sniffs, Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose I'd especially feel that way, I don't know if I'd feel that way if we'd had a boy.  But since she wasn't, and she hasn't therefore, fulfilled what I wanted a boy to fulfill, I suppose I'd especially feel this way.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I've really in effect, said this before, but I was just thinking about uhm, the fact that well Monday, she seemed really a lot better.  But then yesterday, she got a lot worse again.  And today she's been worse.  And it's worse in her — I mean, her nose is running again, more than it w—, it had pretty much, not completely dried up, but a lot, a lot had, I mean she'd had a lot fewer sneezes, and so forth.  And (Sniff) now it's running and she's sneezing.  And, but she doesn't sound as stuffed up, but her cough is a lot worse. </p>

<p>And it, I, yesterday I kept wondering whether I should call her doctor again, and then I just, and yet I was feeling well really, it isn't that bad, and I don't know that it's really that unusual for a cold to reverse itself for a while.  And I've heard a lot about with young children, how they have one virus, or whatever it is, that just sort of seems to hang on for a long time.  And yet, m—, on my, on the other hand I kept feeling, I'm not going to see something and then she'll really get sick and die on me.  That she'll suddenly get sick and die. (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know when, I — because I can do this more with MYJ, because he's younger than I am and, and, hasn't, I mean, except for the fact he's one of 7 in his family, so he's had, and he's — I think he's the second oldest — so he's had a lot of association with young children and babies, bu—, or maybe it's because he's male.  But anyway, I feel as if I can tell him how I want things done in a way I have felt more hesitant about MRS BJC.  And I've noticed that I, I keep, one thing that keeps coming into my mind whenever he's around, he'll sort of look at me as if, sort of why are you worrying so when I say, you know, keep and eye on something, or don't do this, or could you do that with her and, uh, you know, it's things like, if she's coughing and is in real distress, notice, and things of that nature.  Although her coughs really, are probably very normal.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And, it always comes to my mind then, well what if she suddenly gets something that hits in a flash, and then she's gone?  Because I keep, in uh, in my experience has been, friends whose children have gotten very sick quite rapidly, still have had plenty of time.  But I will keep thinking of little things I've read about how baby's temperature can suddenly go up, or uhm, an illness can suddenly come on them.  And the way I'm thinking of it, is it would happen in minutes.  Well, the comparison that does come to my mind too, is what happened when FEJ, MSCZ's sister-in-law, had that experience with the baby she was taking care of.  When it apparently was having an epileptic seizure, but that it happened very suddenly. </p>

<p>And, but I don't think that in itself upset me so much as that it was, I mean it was an upsetting thing, but I think I'm thinking of it now, simply because it just is support to what I keep concentrating on.  (Sniff) And th—, and I do think again of the fantasy that I had about taking a plane trip and going down in the water and not being able to hold FSO up above the water, and so she drowned.  And as if again, she's going to go fast, because I let her, or I want her to.  (Sniff) And so then as a result, I hover over her and become over concerned.  And it — (Sigh, Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>And what I've been doing a lot, especially lately, uh, and, and I'm having trouble, I mean, I think I have trouble anyway admitting these feelings about her, because they make me feel guilty.  But I, I keep thinking too, that I mean, just in herself, she is a very nice baby.  She's an easy baby and a very pleasant baby.  And uh, so I, I guess I find it hard to think, how can I be feeling this way toward her when I really do like her?  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking back to seeing MRS BJC this morning.  And uh, I think, I'm still thinking of just different things that happened, but all of which sort of point to my having put her in a position where she had to sort of take charge of the whole thing and make the initiative, movements and, and that type of thing, as if I just didn't know what, well I don't know, whether it was that I didn't know what to do, or just whether I felt she was the one to take the initiative.  I mean, assuming, I would assume that was it, from what I've said about it before.  (Pause)</p>

<p>What that part reminds me of is uh, well I (Sigh), I can remember incidents from last year, too.  But especially when I was first teaching and having conferences, when there'd be ones the school was initiating.  So I was in the position of running it.  And I w—, therefore, the parent would be expecting me to initiate conversation or remarks, or anything.  And yet I, I think for some mothers always, and, and I think when I was first doing it anyway, I used to feel very much s—, I, I don't know, just sort of letting it go, and letting, and finally sort of forcing the mother into initiating things.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Because I have the feeling that, uh, (Sigh) well I don't know exactly why I have this feeling, but I do, that I've run away from well, 2 things.  One would be, I don't know, I, wh_ when I was thinking about FSO and saying what I said today, then I, when I finished I think I was thinking well, I've said everything there is to say.  And then I was thi—, then I thought again, but that was only part of my relationship with MSCZ, and yet I also had the feeling there, well everything's been said.  And yet, I don't know, right now I just had the feeling that I'm thinking back about MRS BJC, and so forth, because it's just easier. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So what else is there to say about MSCZ, then?  MSCZ and you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I somehow, I don't know, I was just thinking it must have something to do with the other side of why I feel in competition with women, and feel especially with older women, that I'm — and apparently I do with FNI — it must be part of why I resent advice from any of my friends, uhm, with many of them.  Why, why I feel like a little girl, although I don't know, or maybe the fact that I, because I do react this way, wondering what it does with my relationship to MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and then that makes me think if I'm seeing myself as a little girl in all these instances, maybe I am with MSCZ, in that well, I've been aware of times when I have tried to make him sort of a father figure for me, or perform like a father to a daughter, rather than like a husband.  And I'm just wondering if that means then, having any sexual relationship with him is like a father having one with a daughter.  And I would think — maybe I want that, because I wanted it with my father — but I, I should think I'd fight it, since it's, my idea would be it would be wrong.  I mean, our society's idea is that it's wrong.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence)  And I was just thinking, well I suppose partly because I was thinking that, after I said society, our society holds that it's wrong, was thinking my father also made it very clear, almost, well I almost think of it as any kind of meaningful relationship or, I mean, anything beyond an occasional affectionate pat, or something, seemed to be wrong in his eyes.  Or at least, he wasn't capable of it.  And, because it wasn't until later I began to reject his overtures.  (Sniff)</p>

<p> Uhm, but, and then I, then I thought of something MSCZ and I were talking about once, and I'm, I don't know, it was all sort of vague, but it had something to do with our talking about a man's feeling, I don't know, a certain kind of sexual response, to his daughter.  And I just, I don't know whether he said more on how he felt about it on, on why this would be, or anything.  Except there it was, maybe from the same thing that I was feeling I'd feel that way toward a son, if we had one.  And I don't know, it just seemed to me that seems to be something else that's functioning, and I suppose my feeling threatened and jealous of her in a sense that she might steal MSCZ from me, because I somehow think our roles could get all mixed up.  (Pause)</p>

<p>A—, th—, then I almost think well, MSCZ might establish some other type of rela—, I mean I, he would establish some other relationship with FSO, that would be sort of a, I don't know what word to use, but in place of — I mean, maybe it's another kind of sexual relationship — but it would be in place of really being aware of her as a female, which I think is what he was meaning.  When we were talking about, or at least certainly that was what was in my mind.  But then I think, if he, if he did that, he would always be feeling I was sort of second to FSO, and that if we had intercourse, it would only be satisfactory to him because he couldn't have it with her, or something like that. </p>

<p>But then, the next thing that comes to my mind, I mean I really was feeling that way, but then I wonder if that's wishful thinking on my part, in that that's what I would wish my father's reaction had been to my mother.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I do—, I, I mean, this is part of it, though I 'm not sure if it's for the same reason, of sort of wishful thinking that my father had reacted this way.  But I keep thinking that they could, FSO and MSCZ could very easily form a relationship that would exclude me, I mean, in a sense they will form one that will, but that it would exclude me really drastically.  And then that seems that's almost what I'm trying to force them into.  Even though she's so young now, that I'm trying to set things up already, so that that's exactly what would happen.  And I almost said something else when I was saying FSO and MSCZ.  I almost said, FSO and my father.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about FSO's name.  And, I, it's kind of a vague thing, I don't know exactly what my feeling is, except somehow, I, I've been wondering if aside from having found it hard to use her name after she was born, just because I didn't want to admit she was there, I think there's something else.  In that, I, I don't know how much this acted into my liking it to start with, but there's some kind of a feeling on my part that it's a foreign kind of name for my family.  And I don't, I was just thinking about all the names.  Like my mother's is FDO, which is not quite the same thing as FYC or FNA, but sort of, I think of with my parents anyway, their liking names that are fairly plain, but nice.  And FSO, I, I think then I get this feeling it's a very florid or a fancy kind of name, and I liked it just because it went against having sort of a serviceable, plain, but nice name.  Which is what I think of my parents standing for. </p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. There's something on my mind...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and, I want to exploit the opportunity of being here and so forth. Today I went, I found two T-shirts, long-sleeved, black T-shirts, one an XL and one an X, so I decided to put the smaller one, the large, in my son's, I keep a chest of drawers in my closet for his things, because since the divorce, he's spent time with me and wants to move back to Chicago. He was with me Friday, Saturday, Sunday night, every other weekend, and once during the week and so forth and so on. So I opened the drawer and I see only two T-shirts in there, when he had a whole, a couple of stacks. And also at that time, I guess some weeks ago and before he went to school, he was saying, "Look...there's a..." And now of course I was with Macy's when he's, "...this stuff of sleeping over every other week..." And so forth and so on, "...and you were going to work, it was really, that was when I was a kid." And so forth and, "It really doesn't make sense now, especially since...if I get up you're at work anyway." And so forth and so on. And I say, "I can understand that, so we'll just play it by ear." And so, last week he, which was the last Wednesday or Thursday or whenever, it was the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, and he came and so he came over and we had dinner and he, and then at about 9:30, after we watched Seinfeld, when I was expecting that he would stay over, this was the Thursday night, and then it was then Friday, he and his mother were going to go to Claremont to visit his grandparents, he's, "Well, I'm going to sleep at Mom's, Dad." [0:03:06.0] And he goes, "You know, all my things are there." And so forth. He had come down from school for two days or something like that. So I was kind of disappointed. I was expecting him to sleep over at my place and then go to his mother Friday morning and then do whatever. So, then the next thing today...and I go in and I open his drawer and I... Oh, when, before college, before, when he was going away to college and I wasn't going to drive up for several reasons, with Jennifer and him and I so told him. So I went over to say goodbye to him and Jennifer said, "Ghee, he's at your house picking out some, picking up stuff to take to school." And so forth. So and I just called him and I said, "Hey...I'll be over there and I'll pick you up and I'll drive you back." And so forth. Okay. Now, back to this afternoon, and I open a drawer and I see that he's taking, except for two T-shirts...he's taken them all, and to me that's like a statement. And it's a statement that, "Hey, I'm...don't look forward to me spending any nights here after, when I come down from school." Or whatever, putting aside summers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were hurt that he hadn't, didn't spend the night there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like you were also feeling hurt now, because you're interpreting his taking the T-shirts as his saying that he's not going to stay the night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And we had a talk about this before he left, just before he left for school. It was during the summer and we were talking about him not coming over. And I said, "You know, I just want you to understand how I feel. The fact is that I feel greatly deprived, ever since...when you were between seven and eight."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Of a chance to what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I thought you were going to interrupt me to ask me something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Your mother wanted a divorce and okay, I was sick another year or two and so forth, but since then I have been deprived of the time that fatherhood would usually mean..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...face time and so forth and so on...whether we're talking or not you'd be at the...breakfast table or dinner table and so forth and so on, and therefore, time with you means...a great deal to me and so forth and so on." [0:06:05.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then he's, "Well, yeah, I understand that. But...I'm growing up, I'm an adult." And so forth and so on. And I said, "I understand that too, and if you want to spend time with your friend Jason or whatever and so forth, I respect that. But I just want you to feel that time with you is... Yeah, I know things have changed...I know you'll be 18 this October." Now this month, just personally, but it's his birthday. And so again, I opened a drawer and then I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When is his birthday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The 14th, he'll be 18. So I opened a drawer and I see that he took out all but two T-shirts, and then this to me is a further statement or a reinforcement of whatever, as if to say to me he had totally stepped (ph) out. You know, 'If I ever, if I'm ever sleeping over here it will be more the exception than the rule or...it will be, and that you'll bear it.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you make of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do I make of that? I make of that, that he's, he wants to, he's certainly making a statement that, 'I'm grown, I'm no longer a kid. And I want to do only what I want to do.' And I'm, when I say that I'm putting together things that Jennifer has said, that he...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But it sounds like there's something about that, his growing up or his giving you the message, which it sounds like he did sort of directly, saying, "Well, I'm an adult now and I want or I need more independence." There's something about that that's difficult for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What's difficult I think is the fact that, let's, for example, I'm just disconcerted. I must tell you, just very frankly, I'm disconcerted. You're not, well, are you looking at your watch? This time you did...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't think I was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're, you've been...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have I?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you've been, you've been looking at something or turning your wrist and I'm always there wondering if, okay, just, okay, put that away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't aware of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...looking at my watch, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you keep looking at something and I was just disconcerted by that. Put that on your data bank and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...we'll figure that out later. Okay. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was, what was your reaction to that though, that 'my being disconcerted'?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I, the first couple of times I, I would check to see what happens. But when you continue to do that, I said, "The whole point of therapy here is being open and aboveboard and so forth." [0:09:08.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I feel that I should say it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because it's very distracting to me. Part of me is not concentrating on what I decided to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what did you start to think about, what might be happening with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I couldn't figure it out because, yeah, I couldn't figure it would be time because you kept...looking at maybe your wrist or whatever. I was...trying not to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...stare exactly. So I don't know what it was and I figured it couldn't be time because you're or could it? Because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if you do that every ten seconds, why is that? And I figured I should ask.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's, yeah. Well, let's go ahead and maybe we'll come back to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sure. And just, to put a finer point on it, it's not something that I had seen you do before...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which is why it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm having, I think I heard it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, maybe you're looking at me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...when I was, maybe I was looking at my finger, which is maybe it. I don't know if I was looking at, I have been looking at my finger because I actually did cut myself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...earlier today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're right, I probably was looking down at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't necessarily aware of that, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was using peripheral vision here, so it could've been, clearly your finger rather than your wrist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But maybe I was feeling a little distracted...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe at least initially. I think partly, again, it was one of those situations where you're beginning to tell me a story...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Too much?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and I was wondering sort of where it was going. Although, now I feel like I know where you've gotten with it, so I'm not feeling that. I think it was on my mind a little bit...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so you're good. But I feel like I have a pretty good sense of where you are with this, so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm, so we're getting back, you were saying...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...we're, I mean you were talking of, there's something that's difficult in hearing that message from him, that he's growing up and becoming an adult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There isn't, I don't have a problem with that. I have a problem with wanting, expecting him to understand I have a problem with (a) having to [audio blip at 0:11:34.6]... but, okay, if I have to. I shouldn't expect that he has...a perception that he may not have yet. I don't know. So I would explain to him that I feel in spending some time with him, having some face-to- face time with him, is in a sense, much more, I put a greater weight on it than, well, he should put a weight, a greater weight on it than he should with his mother, because his mother had the opportunity of knowing that 'you're right there in the next room or you're at the same dinner table or you're at this'. I mean I, there's a lot I've been deprived of and therefore, I have a need, a fatherly need and so forth and so on. And I made it clear to him that were it, again, to repeat myself...if it were something that...he's going out with 'a' or 'b' or 'c' and so on, great, [inaudible at 0:12:34.7]... I'm just saying that..., "If you come home and you're going to spend time in one or another house..." I would essentially, had this conversation taken place after last week, I would have said, "As for last..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, right, go ahead. [0:12:54.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: "As for last week, when you came over for dinner and to spend the evening with me and I thought you were going to sleep over, and then you surprised me by saying, 'I'm going back to mom's.' When just as well you could have opened the bed...if you wanted to go to sleep you could've opened the bed and gone to sleep and gone to mom's the next morning."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know, I think I understand the part about your feeling like you want to see more of him, you want to spend more time with him. And that you feel like you missed out on seeing him more as he was growing up. The part that I'm not sure that I understand is the idea that he should spend more time with you or that...that that was part of the way you said it, that he should spend more time with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He should understand that if there's a choice in the matter, I think, [as I put it to her,] (ph) if given the circumstances, I would appreciate, as last week, that I would have been content, and of course couldn't have this conversation because it's theoretical, I would've been content if he had stayed over. We were watching television until 10:00 or 11:00, I would've said, "Hey, Kiddo, I'm going to bed." And he said, "Good night." And I mean, well, he would've watched television until whenever and then went to sleep, and in the morning left, however reasonable or unreasonable that is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's your wish, that he would be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like there's a little more to it than that. That it's your wish but you also really feel like there's something wrong with the fact that he's not doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think, I, there's, given my nature, I probably automatically use an unfair yardstick, well, fair or unfair, I use a yardstick of comparing his fact time with his mother...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:15:13.1]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...verses his face time with me, which makes it another story entirely again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what does it mean if he, to you, if he spends more time with his mother than with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's not giving me equal time. And now I'm talking...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I, he is... What does that mean to me? That he has less desire to spend time with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or to spend equal time with me or whatever, matching.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you interpret that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As a rejection!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Because I think, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you end up feeling rejected by [overlapping voices at 0:15:59.6]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a rejection...by itself and it, and compared, and I terribly compare it...in my mind as spending more time with Jennifer than he is with me. So it's, there's a contest there also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a contest going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a competition, and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, competition, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in this competition you feel like you're losing right now and you feel rejected?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know, I know I lost...and I'd just like to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? Do you know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in the divorce, I...I lost a great deal of time with him, and I would just like to, salvage or hold onto a little bit of what I had while he was growing up, which is, well, what it used to be was, every other weekend he would spend Friday, Saturday, Sunday night with me and one night during the week. Now, I'm not asking for that and, we're talking about if he's home, like during the summer or something, but I'm asking for some, I just felt that one night when he had the option of staying over...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know but I can see how it would really put you in a bind if, whenever he was with his mother, you felt like you were losing a competition. And whenever he did something else while he was in town or visited somebody else, if you felt rejected, that's in...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or sleeping with, sleeping at his mother's house....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you would end up feeling rejected. That's a real bind for you to be in, I think, because it does get you in that sort of competitive comparison.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the irony is that I do know...based on conversations with Jennifer, that when he's there, I mean, he just goes into his room, closes the door...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...she doesn't get much of him at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which may make you feel a little better because, well, it's not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It mitigates...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it somewhat, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's still this feeling of rejection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ghee...I wish I had that. Even if I were in my room sleeping, I'd like to know that he was out there...which is just about all she might get now. But in any event, it all exacerbates.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, let's, it bothered me and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and what bothers me is that, what bothers me is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it, go ahead, what bothers you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What bothers me often is how I am going to react to something. And by that I mean, I know he's coming for the Thanksgiving Day holiday, which is theoretically Wednesday and Thursday, Friday, Saturday night...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:18:58.2]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...three or four nights. And so now I'm going to be looking over my shoulder kind of and watching that and what's he going to be doing and...the whole thing is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm affected by it, in a very...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're already beginning to think about the next one and sort of anticipating what's going to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, and just maybe what's going to happen and worse, anticipating how I'm going to react to it, because I have a, I can, I can react more harshly than I should.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Hey...if you can't...it seems to me that...you have no interest in spending any time with me, other than making some token gestures. And if so, give me back the Macy's charge card I gave you. Give me back the Visa Card that I had...your name is on with mine and so forth." (chuckling) Very, pejorative, a very...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...mean spirited, very, I know I'm wise and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I have to make a statement also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or get back at him somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or get, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the feeling is that he's, somehow he's done something to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to show him how serious I take this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess part of what I'm wondering is - Let me think here for a second. - It sounds like part of your idea is that, if you spend more time with him now, that that will somehow make up for time that you didn't get to spend with him, and that you really feel a lot of loss about the time that you didn't have together when he was growing up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the liar. I mean, I not only have a problem making the statement, I did make the statement to him, that the latter was true. That I feel, I feel - What was the word I used?  - - deprived!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And which I ought to say, he's very bright...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I would assume that he can understand there, that's, that's pretty basic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, but deprived makes it, I think the word 'deprived' sounds like there's something that somebody could have given to you and they chose not to give it to you. It adds the idea of holding back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, what you say is true, but that that, it's true, in so far as Jennifer did that, not him. I mean I may be neurotic but I'm not crazy. What you say is very true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She did deprive me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of time with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and he knows it. Sure. Well, by saying, "Hey, I want a divorce."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: By saying, "Oh, please, I want a baby...I'm 35 years old." And so forth. When we agreed and got married, that neither of us wanted children. But that's...I don't want to go into that whole thing again. And the fact is, I'm a reasonable, it's reasonable of me, for me to couch it in those terms...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:22:16.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...as long as it's examined very carefully. And it's not that man, I mean, in no way, shape or form do I feel nor do, have I expressed it, in the sense that David has deprived me of himself, but now he may. My fear is that he may be doing that to me now. Not by saying, "I'm an adult." And so forth and so on, and I don't, there's no longer any reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why might he be doing that? If he were doing that to you, why would he be doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, independence, showing his arrival at the state of sotto (ph) full independence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So maybe it doesn't have so much to do with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I understand that. That's true, that's true. And then the ironic thing is that, I and certainly Jennifer, but I, we, all through his growing up that we did things so that he would have a sense of self or the self confidence and the self of independence and whatever. (chuckling) And we've succeeded very well. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As I joked to Jennifer once, I said, "You know, he's such a bright kid that he's sophomoric, acting sophomorically in his freshman year."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, all right, but you know, maybe there is a bit loss here for you. I mean there is the loss of time that you got to, that you wished you had had with him before as he was growing up. And maybe there's still a loss, that you still wish that you had a different sort of relationship with him than you do now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually, more to the point, I would want a continuing, to continue the, what relationship I had with him. Meaning this, we could be together and so forth and I could rate (ph) at, like I'd see something very interesting in the Times, I'm going to clip it out and say, "Look at that." You know, and we'd talk about it and we'd have what I'd call intellectual conversations about 'a' or 'b' or 'c', which...gives me the greatest pleasure, and he ain't up to it and so forth. And I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you [overlapping voices at 0:24:43.9]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I can't tell you how I enjoy that and that's what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I want, I want a continuation of that, I want to revel in that pleasure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you really got a lot of pleasure out of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a tremendous amount of pleasure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow! I mean, and one thing I did something...and one of the few things I did something right in, in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when did that happen? That kind of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It happened from the beginning, as I told a long time, and I never condescended to him, never patronized him, always, always... [0:25:15.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But it sounds like there was a period where you two really, you felt like things between you were really pretty good, where you could enjoy each others company a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see he was tested early on because when we were applying for schools, in particular Ryder, we had to have a particular average and so forth and he was termed a gifted child and it was very clear. So even after the divorce was over with, I'm in Indiana and I come in and pick him up and we'd go on a bus or something or we'd go into a restaurant. He and I would start having conversations, and I knew what would happen and I could predict it, that somebody in the front row, I can see them starting to listen to our conversation, because here's this little kid and we're having this dynamite conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or people at the next table talking amongst themselves and finally turning around and comment on it, it was that good of course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt very proud, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hey, we, wow....wonderful!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. And so when he came I said, "Here, here's the file." I mean the five or six things where I'd e-mail him, "Check out George Wills (ph) column in News Week, it's really interesting and so forth." And when he was here, before he left for home, left for school and that was home, he would have come and I'd say, "Well, what do you think about that, was he right or was he wrong?" Because it was a very meaty column on whatever...you can take this issue and send it. We'd have some wonderful conversations. Which was one of the great promises of becoming a father, of having this kind of dinner conversation to look forward to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. And it sounds like you don't have that as much as you used to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you wish you had more of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what if he's not ready for more of that right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what if, I mean that's a very open-ended question, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See what I'm hearing you say is, if he's not ready to do more of that now it means he's rejecting you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I mean the answer to your voice, well, what do I do now is, I stop and I appraise this as objectively as possible and try to get straight in my head that I shouldn't be taking this personally - excuse me - or to develop more sharply how I should be looking at this more realistically and how I can, (a) live with it and, (b) make the best of it. I was just talking about this with Lisa, we were having a slice of pizza and she said, "Hey...with him right now, the way he is, and knowing him...just go with the flow because...you guys, theoretically...have something so good and you don't want to alienate him and so forth and so on. He's at this..." I mean myself. "...independent and don't fuck it up." [0:28:25.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I know that but the problem is, how do I grab hold of myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think keeps you from being able to hold onto yourself? You say you know that reasonably not to take it too personally. He's getting to be, he's 18, he's looking for more independence. But part of you still takes it as a rejection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...it's better now because I just had...like you would say a 45-minute conversation, so she had helped me clear things up and calm down...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...for...so that I can at least come in here, having chewed over a few things and whatever. So I think probably the thing that I should mull over is the how to, how to react to one or another scenario at Thanksgiving. I mean, no, and it's easy. I mean if he does choose to sleep over one night, then there's no reaction or want of the pleasure or whatever. The problem is if he doesn't. If he comes home from school and if he chooses to stay with Jennifer, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights or whatever...three or four nights, saying, "Ghee, Dad, all my stuff...I mean, I have my stuff at mom's, so I'm going to sleep there." Then I have a problem with that. That's when I'm going to have a problem dealing with, analyzing it, dealing with it. Okay, how right or how wrong I am. What I'm entitled to feel and what I'm entitled to say, objectively I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you're entitled to feel whatever you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well and...I mean that's why I threw in 'objectively' there, to be productive and to be, to avoid self-destruction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So what would the self-destruction be? Is that [overlapping voices at 0:30:49.5]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it would at least start with my voicing my disappointment, if not displeasure, at him...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well...I can, I'm sorry to cut you off...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because I'm not sure what you were going to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, what I was, I can really see how there could be a cycle here. Where if you're already feeling on edge with him and rejected and upset because he didn't, and you're already looking forward to and thinking up things that, ways to sort of punish him..., "Give me back my Macy's card." Or whatever it would be. I can see how it's a real setup for you to then, you're not going to be able to, here everything you say is going to come off one way and he's not going to feel like he's getting stuff right and you two are going to butt heads from the beginning... [0:31:45.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it's just going to, and I can see how it would go down, and maybe that's what you're afraid of, in terms of self-destruction. You know but that doesn't take away the feeling of rejection that's still there. And by the way...why wouldn't you feel rejected when your kid grew up, went away and maybe spent more and more time being independent and wanted more independence? I know that doesn't quite take care of the part between you and Jennifer, I understand that there's still that part. But I think a lot of parents with teenagers and then when kids get older and move away, do feel some rejection. So there is a sort of developmental part of this. That he is moving out and getting older and becoming an adult. I think there comes a lot of mixed feelings for parents at that time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true enough but I must interject and tell you, I really understand that. But when they come home, they come home. In this case, in the divorce situation, he goes to a different home than mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it, that's the difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the rub here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what hurts [overlapping voices at 0:32:57.9]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what makes the difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So part of it is the [inaudible at 0:33:06.0]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. What I really need more than anything else is to know how to, how to, I could say hold myself in check but I don't think it's that bad, but how to avoid saying anything, getting an answer that's not responsive to what I'm saying and therefore, saying something harsher. Because then it becomes, the issue happens to be... [0:33:53.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the next interchange, rather than the basic one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you're not listening to me, you haven't heard me or...that kind of thing. How to hold in check. I have to put it that way, to hold in check my response, because that's making a statement. Saying I know that I can, chances are I'll respond badly. I don't want to get into an argument with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to...raise an argument and so forth. And actually looking for the line, where the line is, where I can feel that I can express that which I need, feel that I want to express.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that you feel like you need from him? I am [inaudible at 0:34:40.5]... so I see this [overlapping voices]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, okay, sure. Sure. Just to understand, just to understand, just for him to understand what underlays my concern, so that he knows that it is not, I am, that he knows I am not saying to him, "I want you to spend as much time with me, I want things as much as possible as before. That's not what I'm asking for. I'm asking for, when the option arises to count me in, give me a sign, give me a sign that I'm not rejected by, if you're going to be home four nights...you're going to lay your head on the pillow at, while you're in Chicago for four nights, do so one night on my pillow in my room, my house."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, but I think it's already a setup. I think there's already a setup here. Because now the way this is set up, it's not about really what he wants. It may be not even, it may not even be so much about what you want anymore. It's about his proving that he's not rejecting you. And I think that's already a setup, so that he's got to come down...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would you define setup? When you say setup, I'm not [inaudible at 0:36:23.4]...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think there's, you have this sort of image in your mind that he's got to prove to you now that he's not rejecting you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, that's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that already you're anticipating this visit at Thanksgiving...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...over a month away...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...as being about his proving or disproving that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're already anticipating that and it's almost become more about that, than about your visiting with him. It's about whether he's rejecting you or not. I think that puts a lot of pressure on his visit from the get-go. That's a tremendous amount of pressure for both of you. [0:37:08.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He comes home and he finds a boxing ring in the house, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, he finds a minefield that he's not necessarily aware of. That if he steps in the wrong place it will boom. And for you it's a minefield too, because you're always looking for him, where he's going to step.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seems like, the reason I say it's a setup is, I think going into it with that expectation seems like it would be mighty hard for you two to enjoy each others company.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I wonder if there's another way, another way for you to go into that visit, another way to sort of think about that? To think about what you want from your relationship with David? What you need from your relationship with David? And then...some of that he may or may not be able to provide, you know? And he may not be able to do everything you want and he may disappoint you, but at least first you can become a little clearer about what you would like, what you want and to explore that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think, unless you find something, I'm really aberrational in what I told you I felt...I think, I feel what I said I feel. And I would hope that your role is, if possible, to say, what would you say? It is, that way lies madness...you continue down that road there's no place to turn or something like that. You know, in the absence of your saying to me, "Your wishes are unreasonable." Then I think my wishes or desires, what I want, are reasonable. And if I have to work with it, then I think those are the facts I work with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I would never, I don't think I can be in any position to say that your wishes or desires are reasonable or unreasonable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think your wishes and desires are your wishes and desires. That...who can say whether somebody's dreams or hopes are reasonable. I mean if that's your wish, if those are your feelings, those are your feelings. I think what we can do is, to explore them a little bit more. [0:40:04.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I accept. See, you were saying you hoped to figure out what your needs are and I thought I did that. But when you say we should explore them, that's the next thing, then that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think, I mean I think I understand what your wishes, sort of what you're saying your wishes and desires are, in terms of sort of practically, that you want him to spend more time with you. I'm pretty clear about that. And you want him to put his head on your pillow when he's in town and spend more time with you when he's in town. That I kind of see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's one more very important thing. That should that not happen, I must know how to deal with that, how to react with that so that I don't make things any worse than...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...from...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...from my point of view, worse, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you want to deal with that? How would you want to handle that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, one way is to...figuratively bite my tongue and not...not say anything when he says..., "I'm staying, I'm going to sleep at mom's each night." You know, "Okay, if that's what you want." That's one possibility. Would I like that? No. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...do I have the self control?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're clear about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're clear about some...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...one thing is that you would not like that. Okay, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. And the question is then, do I have enough self control? Possibly, possibly, yes. The third thing is that, is that the best way of dealing with it or is there another way? Yeah. Well, based on something, a few things that you said before, it probably is. That if it's not the best way, certainly a better way. Because if I say another way is to address the problem with David, then we come into what you say is rather...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a way of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...undesirable, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. But I think there still feels like there's a sensitive part to this. Which is, I understand you're saying...if, I think it is partly a matter of sort of figuring out maybe how you want to handle this and of how you want to handle your relationship with him. But there feels like this very sticky point, where it is...I think there is a certain amount of normal rejection but I think right now it's very heightened for you, for whatever reason, it feels very intense. That with him it's really sensitive right now that you feel very, you feel rejected by him and that's really hard to handle right now. In some way, it's really got you somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was taken by surprise when I opened the door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...I was kind of shook up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's shaken you up. That's a good way of putting it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's shaken you up enough that you're already thinking about Thanksgiving. You're already looking for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure! [0:43:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this has really gotten to something in you, and I guess that's the part that I'm still...I still feel like we haven't quite put our fingers on maybe, but there's a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure where to go with this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, I'm not sure exactly either. I'm sort of raising it, that I think that. I guess one of my associations to it, was to your talking about you're sort of at times feeling worthless and your history, growing up feeling worthless, and that maybe this is somehow bringing up some of those feelings again. If your son rejects you, you feel like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what's new? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...would he be saying something in 'what's new' and it's even worse if your son is saying it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ..doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's your interpretation. I'm not at all clear that that's what's going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Okay, no, that's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's your interpretation...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Sure, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of it and it stirred, it's stirring up something that's very central and sensitive for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I can live with. That's almost a solution. Because if I can fasten on that in saying, "Greg, we know why..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you're vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...you're vulnerable in this area and that's underlying this problem, in a different venue, with somebody else and so forth, the scales wouldn't show that great an earthquake..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...except for the fact that..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That the stakes are...</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...I'm vulnerable, so vulnerable to this..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...that I'm overreacting, based on my..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it just feels particularly, it shakes you up. It shakes you up, because you've seen the earthquakes code, it's like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but that's good, because if I can remember that, then I can more safely say, "Now I see why I'm so shaken up." Yeah, do I like that the drawer is kind of, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, of course not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...no, no of course not. But the fact is that it's probably more of this, it's tickling this, what I used to call the demon within me...that tells me how worthless I am...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and so forth and so on, and that's what's shaking me up. And once I realize that, then I can say 'fuck you' to the demon and it's...it's less sensitive an issue then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if I can maintain that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it may be a matter of getting a little bit of perspective, of taking a step back and saying, "Look...of course I don't like the fact that he's spending more nights at Jennifer's than he is at my apartment, but I also know that it's getting into something else and that it's stirring up other things, too."</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's not his, that's not his, my feelings of worthlessness, he had nothing to do with. [0:46:05.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But unwittingly he can exacerbate them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. Well, we need to stop for today. We got that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're looking much better than you did last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I'm a, for whatever, I'm a fantastic healer. I heal...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's very...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so very fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's really remarkable to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I still got some problems here and so forth...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but, yeah, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've recovered well [in a month?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're feeling better, physically?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the knees, the back, is still...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, respectively...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, problematic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a challenge? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: However! Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh! I'd...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, we're back to [overlapping voices at 0:47:02.6]...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...forgot to explain...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...next week I'm actually going to be, can you have a seat for a second?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry I forgot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just forgot about this stuff. Next week I'm actually going to be out of town on Monday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I was wondering, would it be possible to do it again on Wednesday, same night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So we'll keep this time on next Wednesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks. [inaudible]...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:47:36.3]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm good</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doing good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think I sat too long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feeling all right or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The couch is low out there for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Soon my knees will be better and all will be good in the world.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just a lot of pain still?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just the one that hasn't been replaced yet.  Okay.  So are they getting along better?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Really?  Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're communicating better and they're going to work as a team to try to help you with your surgery, they decided.  They're going to alternate days and try—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When grandma leaves, one of us will have to sleep in your room.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, you think I'm going to need that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  Well, good.  She's got lots of stuff going on.  But how, did [NAME OTHER] talk about her medicine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, we waited for this, now to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  So I'd like to know how she's feeling on the ADHD medicine because I haven't seen her in a week.  Very rarely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the first day I felt good.  It was like the first like four or five hours of the day I was like really calm and I was like focused in school and then right after lunch, I like I ate lunch and like then I was just spastic the rest of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was spastic.  Hyper.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hyper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hyper.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She got in trouble from her teacher.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like you were more hyper than usual?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was just like, my hyperness came back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Came back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like it only lasted four hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and on the second day, it took a while for it to like calm me down and then like once again for the first four or five hours of the day, I was really calm and then afterwards I was hyper and that pretty much happened all week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  It didn't last any longer the longer, the more days you took it, huh?  Like, not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So you've been getting in trouble for the last three periods of the day all week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Well, you could be rapid metabolized.  That means you're just, you know, kind of go through the medication real quick.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?  She does?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She eats and eats and eats—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And doesn't gain weight.  Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And doesn't stop eating all day.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably what's going on.  How we could handle that, I could give it to you twice a day.  To do that though, you'd probably have to go to the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nurse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, how would you feel about that?  That's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At lunchtime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Why don't we try that.  We'll do 30 in the morning and 30 at lunch, but then we're going to have to get special paperwork I guess to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Don't you just have to write a note?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll try writing a note, but sometimes I have to fax—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes they have a paper that they'll fax over that you have to complete—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell them, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, give them the note, take the note.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She, actually, she takes the  pills by herself during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if I [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the problem is at school, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the problem is if you take it at school and they catch you with the pill—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get in trouble—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because that's the only problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But a lot of people just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's safe, safer to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Safer to do it?  Okay.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So let's try twice a day, 30 in the morning, 30 in the afternoon.  Do you feel the dose is enough when it's working for the first four hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And does it help with the depression too or you haven't noticed anything along those lines?  'Cause you're still taking the Prozac too, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you noticed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you friendlier towards your friends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, the past week, I didn't put two and two together, but the past week, I've actually had a really good week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like really happy.  I mean like a lot, like a few things has happened where I just like got upset, but up until yesterday, I was having like a really, really good week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And it seems like the two of you are getting, [NAME OTHER] and you are getting along better too.  So that's a good sign.  Yeah, why don't we keep you on that combination.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?  And, um, and we'll see.  I think, you know, like I said, it's going to be more stressful the next couple of weeks.  You know, [NAME OTHER]'s going to be there all the time and, uh, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he still goes home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he'll be there more often.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just the one week.  He's got the one week off and grandma will be there.  So it'll be an interesting week.  Just an interesting week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, the first two days we're not there at all.  Monday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Monday I'm in the hospital and [NAME OTHER] stays with me and then Tuesday—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Who stays with us?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Grandma.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Grandma.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then Tuesday—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wish I was going in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Tuesday we might actually be home.  It depends on how things go.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your mom is staying all week, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's [NAME OTHER]'s mom, but, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [NAME OTHER]'s [NAME OTHER]'s mom?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sh, it's [NAME OTHER]'s mom.  She'll stay a week, she'll stay two if I need her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does she help out or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, like I laugh when—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I mean does she—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was there like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last time she was there she was like, and like I thought it was going to be weird like having her there all week, but like she was actually cool, okay.  I don't know what to say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, she's different than [NAME OTHER] personality wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's easier to get along with?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I think we have a good direction, you know, for medicine—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	For her?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For [NAME OTHER] and we were talking in the last session with [NAME OTHER] about she would prefer to add the Abilify than to go back to the higher doses of Depakote.  So we can try that, you know, I'll, I'll give her maybe 5 mg Abilify in the morning with the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then she'd stay—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she's actually be on four medications—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	On the Depakote?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Temporarily.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She'll stay on the same, this same dose—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The 750 of Depakote?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  So we'd need some more 250s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  I'll give you more.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then she's going to add the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that's to get her off the Depakote?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we'll see how she does, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She, I mean she's still got a lot of pains and she is just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she told me about that, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She is just beating me up daily on, on what to do for her sleep and everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Her sleep, her, her muscle spasms—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I thought the Seroquel supposed to help with your sleep.  It doesn't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't and it takes me forever to like, I have to take it forever to fall asleep and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I can't get up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We had reduced that because she was having—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Couldn't get up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Trouble getting up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that could be why you're not sleeping as well too.  So but I said take some of it earlier and then it'll work at night and then you won't sleep as late.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  So maybe we—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What should I do?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe she should take a whole one earlier and go back to 300.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean take 200 at dinner—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Take—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then take 100 at bedtime?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or take the 100 instead of 50 after school—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know another thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What we could try too is take, what time do you go to bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now like midnight on school nights and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't you try taking the whole amount at eight o'clock or so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause then I can't get up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  At eight?  Even if you take it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, didn't I used to take it at like eight thirty?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Eight thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.  So we'd have to take it about six.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Six which is what I told her to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take the whole amount and, take the whole amount at six, 300.  We could try that and see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We could up it to 300 instead of 250 where it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but take all 300 at six o'clock and see how you do with sleep and getting up the next morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know you don't like to take pills.  We—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we, I want, I want to get her on the minimum amount, but, uh, so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The 250 she's just not sleeping.  So now she's asking for Seroquel or any, I mean not Seroquel.  She's like maybe I need a sleep medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rozerem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Rozerem or Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My dreams miss me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't want to go with too many medicines.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't want to go with too, she doesn't want medicines either.  She—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let's, let's try that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just wants to know exactly what's wrong with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Look, well, the mood swings are pretty evident, you know?  I'm sure [INAUDIBLE].  So that's there.  That's what we're trying to control [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mood swings.  Mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you don't have any self—destructive thoughts or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And you've never had them, have you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have them now though or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You still have those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, but not a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have they reduced?  Well, you said this last week's been a good week for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [NAME OTHER] cut too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's looked good to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's cut too, but it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lately, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just not been doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you haven't [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just haven't seen her this week.  It's been very busy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Recently?  This week?  Not recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Let's do that.  I'll give you samples and then we'll find another time when you can come or maybe [NAME OTHER] could bring you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Next Friday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Next Friday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You want to do next Friday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Saturday, you're going, you're going to your dad's Friday night, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'd have to do it earlier?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which is fine 'cause that, 'cause [NAME OTHER]'s off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good luck with your surgery.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I'm just thinking how well, I — it's more feeling than thinking right now — that everything that comes into my mind is contradicting something else or that things are very confusing and contradictory in my mind.  And well, it's even more than that too because then things that I sort of decide I'm going to do I can't do or I think I'll be able to do.  I, I don't feel after I think I'm going to uhm, like just today I thought well, school's almost over and there's no pressure on me now to do anything with the children except just enjoy them.  And yet I, my feeling when I'm with them, as much as I might like them and care about them, is that I'd rather not be doing what I'm doing.  I'd rather not be there, being responsible for their, the way they spend their time the last few days.</p>

<p>And when I came in here today, and you smile at me, my first reaction was sort of, well I wonder why you're smiling at me like that.  What have I done?  And then I started thinking, why can't I just enjoy the fact you did smile?  But somehow it's almost as if well, I don't know, if I'm suspicious of it is the right word, but that I had to do something for you to smile at me and I wondered what it was, probably so I can repeat it.  And I suppose that's so much in,in my thinking a lot recently.  I've tried to figure out why it is that FEIZ gets along so well with the children and in thinking about it, I've felt even less able to get along with them.  And I don't know if there's really any connection or I just am anyway having a hard time getting along with the children, but I, I, it's almost as if I've analyzed the situation and then rationally trying to apply what I've concluded, so it — I end up being inactive.  Or I couldn't understand what was happening last night because Friday night I was thinking of things connected with school and I woke up early Saturday morning as usual, thinking of things connected with school.</p>

<p>And then as it's been so typical of my weekends lately by the end of Saturday I'd forgotten about school and sort of felt I had things in hand and I wouldn't have to worry.  And then by Sunday night I, I just began feeling nervous and thinking well, there's something I'm not thinking about I should be thinking about for school tomorrow.  And almost as if I was trying to get myself tensed up so I could be ready for tomorrow today, so I could be ready almost to put on an act, it seemed like.  And the way I would tell myself at least last night, was sort of, there's more to do to get ready than you are remembering.  And so I would keep doing little things and instead of just sort of enjoying the last bit of free time before school started today, I was just sort of worrying over things.  And I was very conscious of thinking I want the last week to be pleasant and there's no reason it shouldn't be.  And then I got to school today and just found I wished I weren't there and I had — I just couldn't enjoy the children or enjoy doing anything with them.  I somehow wasn't really participating.  I only participated as much as I absolutely had to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And something about that that makes me think of thoughts I had this weekend but I had so many this weekend, I don't even know where to start there.  But I suppose one of them that I think of in, in regard to what I just said is uhm, well, my mother was saying all her usual things, my father was saying all his usual things this weekend.  But one thing — well and they both were working all the time — they didn't — it was almost as if this ceasing (sic) of work was the pleasure that they received and also they could say, look what we accomplished, which is very important to them.  But uhm, I don't know, it was just this feeling that somehow that's the only way they,they prove themselves to themselves.  And I had this feeling it's true of me too, that the only way I sort of know I am anybody and doing anything and worthwhile in any way and am not wasting my time is by working so you have some kind of a product to prove yourself with.</p>

<p>And then contradicting this is this feeling of, it would be so nice just to be able to enjoy living leisurely.  And,and if I felt like doing something fine, and,and then — but being responsible to a family raising children and caring about MSCZ in a way that from all that I think of, it seems like a wife would, although I don't really understand it yet.  And I can't, and I keep thinking well,why can't I be happy with that?  And then it always seems that it comes down to well, I say well I'm afraid I won't do anything with myself.  But it seems to come down to more that I'll feel just doing that's not doing anything, that it's a waste of, that I'll be wasting my time because I might just be sitting around enjoying myself.</p>

<p>And somehow at school too, I have to be in a particularly healthy state of mind in order to just relax and enjoy being with the children.  And usually I feel as if often it's for vague things.  I'm not even sure what they are.  But somehow I should be pushing myself and I should be pushing them.  And it, I was thinking of it today, that I've come to feeling I can't push myself in that meaningless way anymore, or them, but I don't have anything to put in its place.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I also found myself this weekend, usually I have accepted what my parents do and maybe felt more and more,well I'm not going to do it that way.  I used to just go along with it.  But this weekend they just drove me crazy and, and I, I had this feeling, probably more to give myself strength on thinking it, but I had this feeling that so much of what they're doing is meaningless and that they should understand this.  The whole way they spend so much time having to have things exactly certain ways, which I know I do, and saving every little scrap of leftover food.  Or nothing's to be thrown away, nothing's to be wasted, equipment's not to get aged and used and worn out and bought again.  It should be sort of kept in this new state forever, used very carefully.  And I suppose I was also thinking of the fact that while I was up there and they were working in this compulsive way, I just thought well I should offer to help, because I use the house too.  But it was only out of duty.  I had no desire to and then when I, I would offer my mother would say, no, nothing right now, because she just can't have anybody else do things.  And then I would go just sit down to read or something, and I would feel very guilty that I wasn't working too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of something she said.  We were talking about FNA at one point — and there are problems there which I was probably saying things about I shouldn't have said — but at one point I said something about how sometimes I felt very sympathetic toward her because I thought I had felt similarly about things.  And my mother sort of well, "You're so very different."  And then she went on to just, just talk about how we did dishes when we were little and how I was the most noticeable one for just going right to my job and getting it done.  And of course my memory of the dishes is having this job eternally hanging over my head and seeming like I could never make myself just get it done.  So it surprised me a great deal when she said that, that I was always very efficient.</p>

<p>And I also realized something in talking with my mother about FNA who's not writing very often and therefore upsetting my mother a great deal and now she's going to not write to FNA and it was bothering me that there was going to be this sort of stupid split in the family over something that well, I don't know — it just seems like it's out of anybody's control.  And my mother should be more grown-up about it and not just kind of get angry and mad and not write back or something, but — (pause) I was going to say something else, but I can't remember it now.  (Pause) But I was surprised that I felt so upset at my mother saying what she was in connection with FNA, because well, sometimes I think I sort of over identify what FNA's going through because in, in some ways we are alike and I assume perhaps she's feeling exactly the way I do and she's probably really quite different.  But whatever it is, she is unable to cope with life and it's clear, it, it seems very clear that she is and,and so that I don't know, you have to hold her responsible in a way.  But in another way she's not going to be able to cope with certain things unless something else happens to her.  And,and I was just probably maybe because I was thinking well, I'd want somebody to understand me.</p>

<p>I was feeling very upset that my mother was just going to say, well, if you're not going to write to me, I'm not going to write to you, and — I don't know, it was more than that too.  I mean, my mother was saying that "What she's doing is hurting me very much and I just can't write when I'm feeling that hurt."  And I suppose FNA really is trying to hurt her in a way.  But I'm sure she also feels very guilty about it and in another way doesn't.  Well, I don't know, it's probably like how I used to feel so often when I would be nasty to her,because I didn't want to hurt her but on the other hand I wouldn't understand why I wanted to hurt her.  And it didn't seem right to me that I should want to hurt her and I'd feel very guilty, and in a sense I wouldn't want to hurt her.</p>

<p>And she also kept saying something about MTT that seemed parallel to what she used to say about MSCZ and me.  In both cases, for both her son-in-laws, she kept talking about the fact that they were patient with, well MSCZ with me and MTT with FNA,when we would get into one of our moods,as she puts it.  And I mean there are similar times too both of us get — or I don't, I'm not so bad now but I used to just get very moody when I was getting dressed because I was so afraid of what I was going to look like and FNA is the same way.  And MTT said something about, "I just get out of her way, I understand I can't be around when she's getting dressed."  And he sort of accepts it.  And my mother thinks that's wonderful, that he is so patient with her.  And when MSCZ and I were married she kept talking about how patient he was with me and sort of he'd put up with me in all my moods.  And it's not true as far as MSCZ is concerned anyway, and it's lucky it's not, and it really bothers me that she keeps saying this.  (Pause) Well, I suppose it bothers me partly because of what it means she would like and what her concept is of what she should be doing as a woman with her husband, I don't know.</p>

<p>And just how my parents sort of exist with each other and, of course, it was kind of frightening.  I could see just this weekend a lot of things they do that I was beginning to do with MSCZ.  I mean, it seems like their whole relationship is, she'll set out little jobs for my father to do and he'll joke and complain about it but do it.  And when he does something that she doesn't like, she'll get really mad.  And he's learned just not to sort of mess into any of her areas of control or the way things should be and she'd better keep out of his.  And also in talking about FNA and so forth, I, I was just realizing how much my mother anyway, doesn't realize.  I mean she tried very hard not to have one set of standards that we were all to meet, because she says she realizes FNA was different right away.  But it was almost as if well, I think it was very definitely, FNA is inferior in her mind and so we can't expect the same thing from her.  And of course FNA felt it.  And I was just thinking in terms of me too, that it was never, it was very clear always that only certain things were acceptable, whatever we wanted.</p>

<p>(Pause) But it's always seemed to me so hard to fight whatever they've made me feel I should be doing because they did want the best for us and sort of to recognize individual differences but they were incapable of doing it.  And I was just thinking of something they've always said, of "We don't care how you do in school as long as you're doing your best."  And they would recognize liking anything, they wouldn't recognize liking anything else.  (Pause) And it's funny too, because uhm in talking about how we did dishes we kind of got into differences.  Uh, my mother said — well, I don't know, we were talking about something else too, but my mother said at one point that I was much more volatile than FYC or anybody in the family.  I mean, I would be very happy to do things sometimes and other times I would become very — or, or I'd just throw a tantrum or something like that.  And I mean, it, it I know it's true that I would either completely rebel or else feel I could submit to what they wanted and please them, and I would, I and I would like doing it.  And then she said FYC was always more phlegmatic, which I'd never thought of before.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose this is part of my problem of always thinking that people must be feeling the same thing I am and what's the matter with me that I can't handle it as well as other people.  (Silence) And it's — another attitude is sort of changed too, that uhm — often in the past, I didn't like being there sort of alone, maybe with MSCZ but in, anyway, few numbers with my parents when we had meals.  Because I liked sort of sitting over the meal and talking and dwelling on subjects.  And well, years ago I suppose I did too, but I always felt an uneasiness about it.  And I didn't know what it was and I always thought I didn't really fit in.  And again, I always sort of blamed myself but this weekend I was just thinking how — well, it was something I said earlier when we had dinner with my father just how bored I was, I mean occasionally I enjoyed talking with my mother, especially when it was a situation where I could, it would na—, the conversation would naturally break up when sort of the interest in it had died.  But at the table you'd — it's hard to leave and, and either my father will take over and lecture or not really be interested in what other people were saying.  Or sometimes you can talk for a while with my mother and it'll be interesting, but then she kind of for security or something, I don't know, keeps going over and over the same ground, as if she doesn't really know what to do with the subject and she can't just leave it.</p>

<p>And for the first time I was just sort of feeling, well, I'm just going to get up and I'm just not going to sit around for another hour or so after dinner trying to belabor a conversation that I just find boring.  Whereas before, I used to feel g—, very guilty sort of being bored and I'd just sit there and I wouldn't really, sometimes I'd try but generally I wouldn't really give much to it, but I'd just be hating it.  And I don't know, it just seemed like well, I keep thinking of the word loyalty and disloyalty and, I mean it was always sort of, I should be loyal to my parents and stay there during the conversation.  Almost,i have to be loyal to my parents and not think them boring.  How can a child think his parents are boring?</p>

<p>And the other image I keep getting I had it ever since I saw the movie of the, the movie "The shameless old lady", is that if my father died now, that's exactly what would happen to my mother.  She would just become a new person.  (Pause) Not that she doesn't share in these ideas my father has, but, but somehow she could be 2 different people and, and he's bringing out one side.  I sh—, I, I just can think now of how she was saying — I don't know what we were talking about — but something connected with doing as your job, as your profession or work or whatever, something that you were interested in.  And the fact that, well, she kept saying anything you do is going to have drudgery to it and parts you don't like.  And I was saying that that may be so but that if your interest in it is great enough you'll, somehow the drudgery won't really seem the same way.  The interest will overcome it or overshadow it or something.  And her great example that this is not so was keeping house was plain drudgery for her.  And, and it was really almost a bitter way she said it.</p>

<p>I don't know that she realized how she was saying it, but, or just full of anger anyway, it's just all drudgery and then sort of, but your mind is free while you're doing all this drudgery as if, well that's the saving grace.  And I, I just said well if it were that drudg—, much drudgery to me and,and that I don't get any enjoyment then I would want to get another job and hire somebody to do it for me.  And this type of thing is inconceivable to her.  Just sort of, it's almost as if she just wants to have the drudgery, she likes it, because then she can say, look what I've done, all this dirty work and I've done it and now praise me.  And that's, when I say that, it just seems like that's exactly the way I am about things too, because if it's not housework, if I am hiring somebody to do it for me then just the way I got about reports and things like that, I make it harder so then I can say, look what a hard, horrible job it was, but pat me on the back now because I've done it.</p>

<p>(Pause) That made me think again of this question I've had since at least Friday, or earlier, I mean, actively a question of why it is that, so far anyway, I've wanted to teach other people's children.  And something has kept me from wanting to have my own children and doing something with them.  I mean, I have to an extent, but not,not enough.  And one thing that it seemed to me was true this weekend when I was thinking of it, was sort of a fear of the responsibility I would then have.  Because now I can I have them for just 1 year and I can get very concerned about them and think well it's so frustrating because I only had them for a year and look what the parents are doing and look what's going to happen next year, whatever.  Or if I make a mistake, well, it was only 1 year.  It won't matter too much.  But then if they're my children I can't escape it.  And I suppose I feel this way partly because I still do feel that I blame parents a great deal for mistakes.  As if somehow they should know everything.  And I felt that way about teaching too.  But still, and anyway, I can stand the burden, as sort of, well, it's the year is over now there's nothing more I can do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was also thinking just last night about my attitude toward teaching and this feeling I've had so long of well, another year and I can sort of prove to myself I really know now how to teach and I won't make the same mistakes.  And I think part of that is just, sort of this thing I've set up of proving myself to myself.  But also, I, I don't know exactly what the goal is when I'll know I'm not making mistakes anymore, except that I somehow want universal approval or, people sort of saying, now look at this great teacher.  And then I guess I'll think, well I've made it.  I know now how to teach and I can do it.  And somehow right now I, I mean, I, I — even thinking it this year well, another year and then I'll really know how to do it.  And yet all along when I don't accept this, but I know it's true, that when I'm just relaxed and thinking about the children and not myself at all, I do know how to do it but yet most of the time I, I don't know how to do it.  I suppose it's because I can't consciously make myself not be self-conscious.  So it doesn't do any good to know that there are times when I love teaching and,and feel I'm very successful.</p>

<p>And I just started thinking again about how today at school here I decided I was going to have a nice last week and enjoy the children.  And it was really tough going because I just didn't want to think about the children.  And I don't know quite what it is I wanted to think about today except I just felt very restless and tense,as I did last night.  And so all these children were just an annoyance.  It also makes me think of, I think it was yesterday and when, and at one point when we were sitting at the table and I was hearing my parents go on in the way they were, I started thinking, well, I can now understand this.  At least sort of separate myself from what they're saying and what they feel, so that although I might have been affected by it and I don't like to hear it now, at least I can be something different now.  And I really felt strong and thought I could be but then,when I think of it today, that seems just ridiculous.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And just somehow I can't really get free from it, sort of an illusion that I can be.  Or I,i think again of this thought that I keep having of why can't I be happy just being a wife and a mother?  And then maybe finding there are other things I want to do but waiting and letting myself find what else I want to do.  And I just get this feeling, well, I won't be able to keep myself relaxed, that I won't have that much self-control.  I'll feel I have to push and be tense and accomplish something and I won't be able to control myself enough not to be that way.  So I'll end up feeling very dissatisfied and frustrated and unworthy and everything, before I even give it a chance to get started.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I suppose this is all part of my inability to understand what it is to be productive, sort of in a broad sense, in a feminine way.  Because I keep thinking, well, why do I find it so wrong to just do what millions of women have done, and are doing, and en—, and, and can enjoy doing and feel fulfilled by doing.  Yet I somehow have a, I think a contemptible attitude toward them, that, well they're less than what I could be if I just keep myself going.  And then I'll contradict that and think,but I don't think anything of myself at all.  Right now it almost seems as if I think less of myself so I have to do more to make up for it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know, you did have the feeling — you haven't mentioned it particularly today — but you have many times before, that you felt your mother couldn't enjoy what you just said you want to enjoy, that she had to have a life outside of the family and the children, and that that was, according to the way you felt, what was more important to her.  So it seems to me you're saying in effect that you feel ah, quite certain that that's the way you would have to feel and that's the way you often do feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But well, I know that it's many years of I guess copying her and everything that you can't just say now, well, I know she's not what I want, so why do I still feel that way?  But that is sort of, is what I start thinking.  How can I keep on feeling this way when I can see what she's doing and has done, and I don't feel this, I don't well, sort of I don't agree?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah, I can see you Thursday at 2:00 if you wish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, there, there's a, I think I would like to at 2:00 but there's another added complication and could I tell you definitely tomorrow?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because uhm as it turns out now, I might have to leave as soon as possible after school.  Uhm, we're having other people this weekend and the house up in PTN has been painted, is being painted, is supposed to have been finished.  And if it will be finished in time I have to go right up and start cleaning up so that it can be ready for our guests.  But I don't know, you know, definitely about that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Our time's up.</p>

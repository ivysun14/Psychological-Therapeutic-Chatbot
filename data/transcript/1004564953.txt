<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Yawning) I'm sorry. I'm very tired. I went to a show last night. It ended around midnight, and I couldn't fall asleep because I was all — it was kind of a queer comedy, burlesque, going-away show for somebody who got into a school out West.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Which is amazing, but she needs to get there and have some start-up money, so it was a big fundraiser. So I was like, all these great acts, it's amazing and cry. The person who was leaving has been here for so long, and I've seen her in like 40 bazillion performances, and all these other performers that I really like all know her.</p>

<p>[01:06.4]</p>

<p>So it was like — I don't know her personally, I just have seen her a lot. So it was kind of weird. And also I was upfront, right next to the wings and I could see all the performers bawling. I was just kind of revved up. And Saturday was this big volunteering event for a plus-size clothing swap that was incredibly exhausting, in part because my back and my body just hurt. I had initially put myself down as someone who has muscles. Normally I can lift things, no problem. It's not an issue.</p>

<p>[02:08.1]</p>

<p>But like I couldn't bend over and get things off the floor. At one point, I was unpacking clothes and the act of picking up this thing and turning hurt. So that was super frustrating. I also felt bad because there's now this hole in the volunteers without that kind of — because someone else has to kind of over-muscle for me. And then Saturday I felt like I was just on-public-facing on, on, on from like 11 until probably 6 or 7. I took one break to eat lunch at like 5.</p>

<p>[03:06.6]</p>

<p>It was just so exhausting. And one of the things that — I know this always happens mid-way through something really tiring like this. I feel like, not disassociated, but like only half-present. I'm just on autopilot. One of the things I was doing was greeting people at the door and making sure they paid their admission. And then people would come up and ask me questions, can they re-admit, where they can find an ATM. One couple came in and her partner had the shakes because he was so hungry. I was like, okay, first (inaudible at 3:53.2) right over there, and then this is the closest food, blah blah blah. And they came back and were very thankful.</p>

<p>[04:01.0]</p>

<p>Someone came in who was completely blind and needed assistance. We gave her a volunteer to help her shop. So she comes in and I'm just talking to her and frantically looking for someone who I can trust to not be an asshole and not abandon this person and be helpful. Also what inevitably happens is, as I see all these people I know and they want to chat and I'm like — and most people are like "Hi, I see you're busy, bye." But some people just won't leave and it's [awkward]. I'm like "Well, I don't feel like I can kick you. I don't want to say 'get the fuck out' like I would in my own house, but I can't talk to you."</p>

<p>[05:08.7]</p>

<p>And this was also very frustrating. My friend Pat (ph) was basically organizing the event. So the way that she works best in things like this, she's good at it, is that she wants everything the way that she wants it, and she's very clear about it. She's like "Do this thing in this exact way" and I'm like "Okay." And it's funny because she was talking about how she delegates. I'm like "Pat (ph), you don't delegate. You tell people what to do in precise detail." We were at the party and she has this envelope of signs. Each sign had a Post-it note detailing where it was supposed to go. I'm like "That's not delegation" and she's going "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>[06:06.7]</p>

<p>So I talked to Pat (ph) once about Josie, and she was very odd in her forward action which was — it was just so odd, like "You don't know what she was thinking. You can't be sure that she knew that you [fucked out], that she knew you were upset or distressed." Because we talked about how it's really important for tops to not inadvertently harm or damage who they're playing with. And they know if this person says "I'm fine, I'm totally great" but (inaudible at 07:02.2), you should stop anyway.</p>

<p>[07:05.8]</p>

<p>And so I was really surprised she went into this "Well, this was just a friend and why are you saying this to me?" Like I was super upset, and I was telling her that I [told almost no one this]. I think she was the first person in Stay that I told.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I remember you telling me about telling her, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, we were having a barbeque. It was a Stay [of the year] barbeque, and there was some reason Pat (ph) didn't want it in her backyard. I can't totally remember. Oh, I think it was because she didn't want people to be in her house, so it was going to be outdoors but it was a possible rain day. There's a particular Stayster she didn't want in her house, and she's like "Can we have it at your place?" and I said "Sure, it's fine. Here's the thing. I don't want Josie at my house at all."</p>

<p>[08:10.2]</p>

<p>She's like "Oh, she won't come. She hasn't RSVP'd." But when Josie came, Pat (ph) was just like, didn't do anything. I was completely shell-shocked. I think I found out 15 minutes before that Josie was coming. I can't remember exactly. Basically my roommate [Ashby] gave me an Ativan and made me sit down, and I just spent as little time as possible in the same room as Josie and [Kate]. And several people who are my friends in the Stay are like "Are you okay?" and I'm like "No, but I just want this to be over, so let's push forward."</p>

<p>[09:04.2]</p>

<p>Pat (ph) was like "I can't tell a Stayster that they can't come into a Stay event." I was like "I agree. It's just really sucky that the reason you don't want her in your apartment is someone, and I don't want her in my apartment because of someone. I would really like a way to be able to say 'no, you can't come in.'" And when I co-hosted the Stay play parties, we've had basically the same discussion of "I would never allow her in a party that I hosted," but it's always a little blurry, like is it my party or is it Stay's party that I happen to be coordinating. So Josie has come every time.</p>

<p>[09:59.2]</p>

<p>But at this big thrift event, this person came in. I know she's (inaudible at 10:03.3) she doesn't like him and she doesn't want to be anywhere near this person, this guy named Kermit. And so we were all working, and he came in a little early and was starting to help volunteer. She up and grabbed me, grabbed another person, a friend of ours, pulled us in the back room and was like "He can't be here. I can't stand it. You need to get him out of here immediately." I was like "Okay."</p>

<p>So I was just like "Oh hey, Kermit. I'm really sorry, I'm really filled up on volunteers. Can you come back at noon when the event really starts?" And eventually he came in and was shopping, and he kind of at one point sat on the steps [while Lila] was chatting with me. I was a little frustrated and was kind of like "move along" and I was hinting at it. I was kind of like "You know, it's a little distracting when you're here" but he just kept on chatting.</p>

<p>[11:04.3]</p>

<p>And at one point, Pat (ph) looked over at me and was just kind of mouthed "Get him the fuck out immediately," and looked really freaked out. I was like, okay and was just like "Kermit, you know, I really just need you to move along so I can continue volunteering." Like a very discreet "get the fuck out." And he came back like 10 minutes later. He wanted to show me something he'd bought for his mother. I was like "Kermit, that's really nice but I just gave you the bum rush. What's going on?" I was talking to her about it later and she's like "Next year, I would turn him away at the door." And I'm just like "You know, I think you're totally within your rights to do that. It really sucks that you're not supporting me in that."</p>

<p>[12:07.5]</p>

<p>And she's like "He just makes me sick to my stomach. I feel really triggered. I feel really upset." I'm like "What he did to you was he was physically and verbally aggressive more than once over a really stupid issue, and after you told him to back off and stop talking to you, he continued to kind of get up in your face more than once." He's really bad at social cues, even direct statements. What he was fixating on was he used to live here, he left and went to school and came back and wanted to rejoin Stay. There had been a minor rule change which is everyone coming into Stay, regardless of whether they had been in Stay before, must attend a safety orientation. It is a 45-minute little talk that happened an hour before one of the meetings. So it's not —</p>

<p>[13:11.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's just like, show up an hour early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Done. And he was just really agitated about it and really fixated on it, in that way where people sometimes get just totally into that's where they have their weird big conflict. He's also like "Are you doing this to persecute me a little bit?" and she's like "No." And he was like "Why can't you make an exception?" So it was just really —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was when he was aggressive with her?</p>

<p>[13:56.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The reason she doesn't want to be in the room with him is because it was like on two or three occasions. The first one was he was super aggressive over the safety orientation, and was talking to her and getting too close and kind of backing her against the wall a little bit. She told him to back off and go away, and he did the same thing. They left where the meeting was, and he chased up to her and was talking, talking, talking and she was like "Stop. Don't." She was very clear. Then there was another occasion where he basically did the same thing. I think there were a few other — the thing that was sort of the big incident was him talking and being — I guess just verbally. It's one of those things where, you know, I get that it was upsetting in the way that I'd get really upset if a guy got in my face as well.</p>

<p>[15:11.9]</p>

<p>But, I don't know. (pause) I guess I feel like it's disappointing that she's not backing me up in the same way that she wants me to. She was very "Get him the fuck out." And I haven't been able to do that with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Unquestionably, your experience was considerably more dramatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think one big thing is that Pat (ph) is like well, hers happened in public so it makes sense. There's no question that happened because people were there. And her thing with me is that it was private. No one can really know what happened. No one witnessed it.</p>

<p>[16:29.4]</p>

<p>And she's like "I understand how you feel because this is what happened, but no one else was there," except for Kate (ph) who — I wouldn't call her an unbiased witnessed. But since Kate (ph) had never [experienced] anything, Pat (ph) was basically like "Well, you don't know what Josie was thinking. You don't even know what happened for a while, so maybe nothing happened. If you weren't communicating with Josie, it's not entirely her fault." This whole thing.</p>

<p>[17:13.7]</p>

<p>(Pause) I really think it's ridiculous. I can vaguely conceptually understand saying it to someone you don't know. Not really, but sure. But not to a friend. I mean, most horrible things happen behind closed doors. I think it's very rare that someone who is assaulted or traumatized or abused that it happens out in public. That's part of the whole thing.</p>

<p>[18:12.2]</p>

<p>I mean, that's the part that shocks me when I first told her and that still reverberates. Sometimes I think about talking about it to her again. (pause) Mostly after I had run a couple of Stay parties. (pause) I don't know. In a large part, what it comes down to is I'm not willing to challenge Josie's membership in the group, which I theoretically could do. So can I challenge her presence at a party, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>[19:16.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also what it comes down to is that people often ask me "Why don't you play at the Stay parties when you're hosting them?" And I usually answer by saying that I'm really tired or whatever. But the right answer is, I don't want to play where Josie is. It's also part of the reason why I volunteered to run them because I'm like if I attend as a guest, she's going to be there and I'm not going to want to play. So in a certain way, I might as well just do something useful while not playing at the Stay party. (pause)</p>

<p>[20:32.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think — (pause) I think it's hard for you to speak up for yourself about this. I'm going to be very clear. I don't — I'm certainly not meaning to say I think you should talk to Pat (ph) more or try to get Josie kicked out of Stay. That's not at all what I mean nor what I have in mind. I mean even in terms of how you're — well, certainly talking to me and I think in evaluating for yourself, the injustice and real lack of consideration, for example on Pat's (ph) part toward you —</p>

<p>[22:07.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you — again, I guess I'm sort of waving my arms around about what I was the other day — like you present her as acting very selfishly and inconsiderately or — I want a stronger word than that, but you know what I mean — towards you. But I don't have a clear sense from how you describe it of your own reaction, which I suspect was a strong one to how she was to you.</p>

<p>[23:06.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a mix. Like during the actual thrifting event, I was really surprised that she was so upset. Like she was shaking and crying. [She cries pretty easily] but it was still a surprise. And I went into this very much like okay, situation to be dealt with, just talk to Kermit and get him out, whatever. So I wasn't really feeling anything about it at the moment except that this person needs to leave, I need to make it happen, bam. And it wasn't until at the end when she's talking about "Oh, I just feel so triggered by him, my stomach hurts," all these other things that I started thinking about how I don't feel like I've gotten the same back from her. And it feels incredibly unfair.</p>

<p>[24:24.5]</p>

<p>And she's someone who is generally very fixated on giving, on the idea of fairness and being like even if you really don't like someone, if you have a rule, you can't bend it either way. For someone you like or someone you don't like. Which I generally agree with for organizational reasons. So it was really frustrating. Someone who I'm like yes, I do agree with your ethical point, even though it screws me over, to then throw that ethical point out the window. Because if she feels like no, I can just not have him come, then that means there's no reason for me to allow Josie at the parties at all.</p>

<p>[25:25.8]</p>

<p>Like I totally agree with the ethical point. In this situation I'm like "No, I don't want her there. I just don't. And just in terms of empathy, I also feel like you know, you're not the only person who's had serious interpersonal problems with someone else in our [big] community." And she's someone who's like "You shouldn't let personal drama affect the group, an organization, or an event," blah blah blah. Yet this is a case where it's completely how he's treated her, not that he's been rude to multiple people or whatever.</p>

<p>[26:23.1]</p>

<p>It's also feels very out of character and out of place for all the times when she's like "No." But it's also in line with another really hard event that we had that never got resolved which was this</p>

<p>(inaudible at 26:40.7) at this gay men's club during the afternoons. And there's this bartender on duty who [was always was screwing up] letting us in. So he's this older white guy, and he very clearly did not like me. I mean, the guys in the bar were always like "you girls," but I could tell he didn't like me because I was black. That was just very clear to me.</p>

<p>[27:10.5]</p>

<p>And at one point, I asked him some questions and he gave a bold-faced lie to me, and I came back and was like "Well, this is what he said. I'm pretty sure it's a bold-faced lie." And someone else who is white came up and asked him a question, and he's like "Oh, well, that one I told — I told the black girl" in this way that was very like — and he said that I was the one who was lying. That he actually — I said "I'm not going to talk to him anymore. First of all, I don't need to be insulted. And second of all, we will never get anything happening because he's racist." And she got really defensive —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who? Pat (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pat (ph). Very defensive and [frustrated] over me saying that to other committee members and also to me saying it to a friend.</p>

<p>[28:08.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she white?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's white, yes. And she's like "Well, I think he sees — I just see him as my grumpy grandpa." I'm like "Pat (ph), there's a reason why you can see him as your grumpy grandpa. He will never see me as his — I will never be in the position of grumpy grandpa/granddaughter with him because he's white and I'm not, and he doesn't want that situation to exist." And she's just like "No, no, no, no." She was just very insistent there were no racial overtones to it, and that I shouldn't say that there were. The reasoning was that it could give the club a bad rep for being racist (inaudible at 28:59.1) for this person and blah blah blah. I'm kind of like "Hmmmm."</p>

<p>[29:05.9]</p>

<p>I'm actually really confident that me saying this one bartender was racist to me isn't going to give a shit to that business. Also, this city is full of racist bartenders and servers and it doesn't bother anyone. That's just what happens. It doesn't really ruin your business unless — it just doesn't really. Honestly. And gay guy bars here— not just in the city — gay male bars are notorious for being kind of racist. Like having bouncers who are like "no urban wear". Very racially coded. Actually, a lot of bars and nightclubs have this like racially coded — like "no urban wear or hoodies" and they just go with it.</p>

<p>[30:07.1]</p>

<p>I also think, why are you prioritizing hypothetical business over your actually existing friend? We had talked about it, and it really — like, she was clearly upset and was trying to listen to me but really she unwilling to accept my perception might be reality. She's like "I understand that's how you experienced it this way." I'm like "Yes, yes, I go to a therapist too. But in the end, if you see that we have two different experiences, then we should both be able to talk about them. You shouldn't yell at me for talking about — or snapping for talking about something I feel happened."</p>

<p>[31:11.8]</p>

<p>Especially since I'm like, "You know, this bar is grudgingly letting us pay them to use the space. Very grudgingly. And I don't think we're responsible for their image." Like I would feel differently somewhat if — we used to meet at this bookstore in their back room, and then I would be like yeah, okay, and I would deal with it in different ways. A gay nightclub, I don't really care. (pause)</p>

<p>[32:12.3]</p>

<p>But yeah, after we had that discussion, I just kind of like just decided that okay, I don't want to let her super close because I don't trust her. (inaudible at 32:34.5) I just don't trust that she'll, after I —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you're describing, from what I can tell, is her having behaved really hurtfully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, I don't mean to keep on saying the same thing, and maybe I'm just being naïve (voices overlapping).</p>

<p>[33:04.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The reason why [I kind of lie about it] is yes, this has happened a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So that's different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's kind of like, I don't know, things I'm not surprised by anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I was wondering if that was part of what was going on, rather than that other thing with talking to her about Josie, in comparison with what happened with her and Kermit. They're kind of different. But I take your point that with this incident in the bar, it's like the 157<sup>th</sup> time you've had a friend who has reacted that way to something racist that happens to you that you're talking about.</p>

<p>[34:04.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel a certain level of sadness, like yeah, that happened again. But I'm pretty — I don't know. Well this about Josie, there's a lot of reasons why I was really shocked by her reaction. I was like "Wow, that's really like blaming the victim here and asking for some weird proof of evidence like we're in court, when I'm actually just talking to you." And also there's a part of our safety orientation talks about BDSM abuse and how they're different, and all this other stuff. I don't know. The biggest thing for me was "I thought you knew better." I think "I thought you knew better" was what I kept thinking about because I feel she's someone who should know about, just like all these things.</p>

<p>[35:33.9]</p>

<p>I don't expect necessarily, especially with the BDSM aspect, I don't necessarily expect vanilla friends to fully — I said that vanilla friends get tripped up over a lot of things that were happening. "But Josie is married" said this other person, and one of my friends said "You knew she was cheating, like she's a cheater because she was cheating on her husband with you. So what's the big deal?" I'm like "Okay." She said (inaudible at 36:10.1) I was really confident she was going to say something positive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like if you were making a list of the people who you feel comfortable talking to about, and imagine understanding and being supportive, she'd be pretty high. Which is probably why you're talking to her in the first place.</p>

<p>[36:34.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's why I decided to. It was just so shocking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you felt terribly betrayed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. It also really reinforced my fear that with Josie being a better-known personality, that people would believe her because she's more of a known [concern]. Not famous, but the more popular person that was a huge friend of mine. And I really felt like that reinforced what Pat (ph) was saying.</p>

<p>[37:30.2]</p>

<p>Because I've been saying to myself you shouldn't let this — this is a ridiculous fear. If someone is your friend or not going to just automatically believe whatever Josie says and also all the things that she said. She said "You don't really know" or "You can't really be sure that happened" or basically all of the things that I've said to myself . It was like hearing that justification script that I hear in my head, except for a friend was saying that. (pause) I just don't get it. Like she's not good friends with Josie, so it's not — I mean, there are other people who I thought would be defensive of Josie because they're good friends with her and have known her for a long time.</p>

<p>[38:32.1]</p>

<p>But again, Pat (ph) was someone I didn't think, you know — (pause) I don't know. It's just like the things I trusted her to be aware of and be supportive on, she pretty much failed all of them in that conversation. And what makes it hard to talk about is I feel like someone who is kinky and polyamorous and in the scene and who is (inaudible at 39:15.3) Josie, like if this person who (inaudible at 39:25.3) doesn't believe me, doesn't support me, I'm kind of like, who will?</p>

<p>[39:40.1]</p>

<p>In a way, Pat (ph) should be the person that is supportive and helpful. (pause) And it's almost [an "F U very much"]. I mean, one of the things she talks about is the safety orientation is important to her because of all the right reasons, including you don't want to see people get abused by the more experienced people. She's our new member coordinator for Stay, so organizationally we put a lot of trust in her to shepherd in new people.</p>

<p>[40:36.7]</p>

<p>It's just that that conversation really just — I mean yeah, betrayal. For me it was more like a loss of faith. Like I don't have a lot of faith that anyone will listen to me. (pause) And it's funny because there's some things in Stay, [like too much drama], that are very poorly-kept secrets. Like we don't talk about them in the meeting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Secondhand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like X's messy break-up or Y's messy break-up. As far as I know, well, I don't think anyone really knows.</p>

<p>[41:28.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So to what extent do you listen to the kind of — I mean, your (inaudible at 41:34.5) that she went through with you. I mean, like how much are you still affected by or under the sway of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. I mean, I used to really just be under that, like just thinking about that a lot. Like what did I do wrong? What could I have done better? And also very much like I don't know what happened. I have no proof. Like all these things.</p>

<p>[42:23.2]</p>

<p>And now mostly, I don't know. I still justify in my head, but I'm more aware that's what I'm doing [and I can somewhat stop]. But sometimes there's been some discussions in the area about how people are more abusive and predatory, and a bunch of the guys who were like "Well, if someone makes a report that someone was really abusive towards me or predatory or whatever, you should ask for a police report. If there's no police report, we won't consider it abuse." And that brings up "You're right, I should have gotten a police report. I should have done X, Y and Z." When, no, nothing, just no. And those sort of discussions like "Why didn't you X, Y and Z," whenever they're in the context of BDSM or polyamory, that's when they really hit me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>END TRANSCRIPT</p>

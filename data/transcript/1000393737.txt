<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence)  I think (clears throat) I'm thinking about what I was talking about yesterday and, what I first started with was remembering—, well something that kept coming into my mind today whenever I'd just let myself wander.  And, uhm, it was—, when MSCZ came home last, last night, which was not until, I don't know, I was home I guess about 2 hours before he came home.  And all I'd been thinking about was having dinner ready.  And I hadn't really been thinking about being in a bad mood or a good mood or, I don't know, in a way I think I was feeling I didn't want to think about anything connected with what I'd thought about here.  But in any case, when he came in he said, "Hello," and I said, "Hello."  And I could tell then I was feeling discontented like I had been before, which I described, but I still didn't think much of it.  And he immediately started saying, "Are you in a bad mood again?"  And then I felt in a bad mood, and I—.  All through the rest of the evening I never could tell just what the mood was and how much it came—, it was stronger because he kept talking about, or how much it was there anyway.</p>

<p>But today I could also feel at school that—, I think of it I guess more as a frustration over something than (clears throat), again I don't know what, but—.  It was not like sometimes when I just get mad at the boys for anything, but what had happened was I just had not patience over things that they really had no choice over.  Sometimes I'll be patient with them, if it's things like getting in line quietly or something like that.  But today, when I asked them to get in line quietly, and they really had no choice and it was going to be a matter of I'd have to wait until they did, I wanted them to do it immediately.  And I was much more strict than I sometimes am, but I felt as if it were a way for me to vent this feeling of frustration.  

And then I was, then just b_, started thinking about that dream I had and the question you raised or something you'd mentioned of wondering if I understood—, I think it was—, or maybe it was before the dream over the weekend, the attitude I had toward MSCZ.  And I think in a way the dream was on my mind because—, first I couldn't remember when I'd talked about the dream, and then I just started remembering going around in circles yesterday.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think what I sort of come to is a feeling that I don't know exactly what these feelings are that I have at home and at school.  Because last night I was thinking, when MSCZ kept talking about this mood that I was hardly aware I was in, because I didn't want to think about it.  Uhm, that maybe it's part of this thing of being angry at him because he's a man, has a penis and I don't and so forth.  But somehow that doesn't seem right.  And I—, it just seems that, I don't know I, how it works here, too, but the way I felt as if I were just kind of going around and around yesterday, I end up feeling, now when I think about it, discontented or frustrated or something that something's escaping me, or I'm letting it get by, or I'm not getting at it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about FYLR and (clears throat), I don't know, I think she was in a different mood today, so things weren't as good that she was doing, anyway.  But I feel as if I'm more in a mood to be critical, too.  And I was just thinking of one specific thing.  I had a conference, and uhm, she wasn't in it.  I mean there was no point in having her in it, and FHYZ had to be, so it would have been sort of overwhelming if she'd been there, too.  And I'd asked her to do something about getting some library books that's connected with something she's really doing anyway.  And I thought I'd been rather specific about what type of book would be meaningful for the boys to have in the room.  And she brought up an entirely different type that, I don't know, maybe she thought they were good, but (clears throat) didn't look very good to me when I was looking them over quickly.  And I was just thinking of that now, and it annoyed me then when it happened.  Because when I saw them was right when the conference was over and she was just leaving then.  So I didn't have a chance to talk with her about it and find out if she tried to get others and there wasn't anything or just what.  (sniff)  But the way I think I'm interpreting it—, well, I know I feel like being critical.  But also I'm interpreting it that it means she just kind of picked out something so that she would be doing what I asked, but had no interest in it so made no—.  I m_, I don't know that she wasn't, somehow wasn't involved in—. (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's a pretty good description of the way you seem here today.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  When you said that it made me think of something that (hesitates), I don't know, I guess struck me odd this morning and, uhm, because I've been constipated, I know for the last 2 mornings, I think maybe the last 3 really.  And it's very unusual, especially during the weekdays for me to be.  Used to be I'd never, ever be.  If I have a little routine about the way I get dressed and eat breakfast and go to the bathroom and everything, and I'd never have had any trouble except for rarely.  And I know once before it happened since I was coming here, and then this time, uhm, this morning it just struck me that somehow, just like I felt last night, I'm very tense about something, holding things in (hesitates) to the point where I'm literally constipated and—.  I just don't understand it after the things I've been saying, it would seem it would be the opposite.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, it seems today I keep wanting to think about school, which is something I haven't done that much of lately. And also of, I don't know exactly when this happened, but it almost seems like I want to become less aware of home and MSCZ and just kind of do things for school.  I don't really want to concentrate on those either, but I get through the day and then just read and go to bed and kind of not be too aware of anything much after I'm away from school.  I don't—, it's not explaining it very well, but it just somehow seems that I'm not making school seem as important to me as it used to be, but it's become more important to me again than—, or in relation to other things than it has been for a while.  (pause)</p>

<p>I think the feeling I keep having is I've gotten to a point, something recently that I started to look at and I didn't want to look at anymore.  And so I've stopped.  And I don't know what it is.  But then the next thing that comes to my mind is this whole thing with (clears throat) my attitude about having a penis or making up for it, that once I'd thought I understood and, I don't know, somehow come to handle, yet it doesn't seem I have.  And it—, the thought just struck me now that what I m_,  I might be doing is, I don't know, almost refusing to.  Sort of saying, "Well that's the way I am," and stopping right there.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because somehow last night, when (deep breath) MSCZ kept saying, "But why are in you in this mood?" or "What's the matter?" and all, the only thing that would come to my mind is that I was vaguely annoyed at him and it all had something to do with this feeling about his being a man and my being jealous and wanting to hurt him in someway as a result.  And anyway, just if I could appear more powerful I could make up for not having a penis.  And, I don't know, just the way I could think of it to myself and say some of it MSCZ it was very rote, almost as if it didn't mean anything to me that I be saying or thinking those things.  And then if did begin to mean something to me, if I were going to feel differently toward MSCZ I'd have to come to terms with that—, those things and (sniff) it's almost as if I don't want to.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about not wanting to and it— (exhales).  I know the question has come to my mind several times of wondering well how can I? how do I start to?  And the fact that there's no easy answer then I'd, I just think well I don't know how to, I guess.  But then I think I'm afraid to, too, in a way, because I know this feeling, and even if I don't like it I know it.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>(clears throat)  I find my mind back on, well this time the conference and, I don't know, I was thinking of 2 different things.  One was that this was a conference of all involving a fairly serious problem, and it was obvious the mother wasn't going to—, she s_, she appeared concerned, but she kept refusing to try to solve certain problems that could be solved I think if she really wanted them to be.  And it could make a big difference for the child.  And yet I didn't, I don't know, sometimes I would get very involved at something like, thinking about what could become of the child as result, and I didn't today.  I don't know, almost as if well, she's going to be the way she's going to be, and there's nothing I can do.</p>

<p>And then I was just thinking about—, FHYZ was there.  And, I don't know, how—, well one particular thing happened that I had—, I was sitting in a, in a spot where I couldn't really look at the clock without being very obvious.  And then it was set up so that if FHYZ sat where there was another chair, which I'd had sort of in mind, she would have had her back to it, so she couldn't.  And without making it at all obvious she went to another place and pulled up a chair that was fairly nearby, so that she could, I don't know, sort of know ti—, what time it was and all.  And also just the way she said some things and, uhm, remembered things that we had talked about earlier we wanted said that—, I had to keep sort of brief notes or else I sometimes am afraid I'll forget.  And, uh, I guess it's this feeling just as you've said I don't sound involved here, of not feeling involved in that conference either, not being really alert to it.  I just—, I went through the motions I guess more than anything else.  That's the way I f_, I think I was feeling last night, too.  I just wanted to go through the motions, and I didn't want MSCZ asking any questions.  And he kept insisting on asking questions, which annoyed me, made me feel angry.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think it made me feel angry, because there were questions I didn't want to think about that specifically I was trying to avoid, like why I felt sort of vaguely annoyed at him, or just, I don't know, a general feeling of discontent or something.  (pause)</p>

<p>And what I'm not sure of now, too, is that I remember you commented on this same feeling.  And I understood what you were saying, and yet it seems like I must be rejecting it somehow and I don't know whether I'm, in the end, trying to say something to you as a result of that or just what I'm doing.  (pause)</p>

<p>I, I don't understand why I do this, but it seems almost as if it's like saying to you, "I can understand what you said, and it's very sensible, but you can't make me accept it."  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about, it seems like I'm—, by not saying I won't accept it I'm rejecting something I can understand that seems like, just in rejecting it or not accepting it, in any case, I'm acting out which you were saying.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I was also thinking just then when I was feeling really stuck, is if I'm just in a_ again going around in circles and I can't get out.  I was just thinking that sometimes you do start saying something when I'm quiet, and I was hoping you would.  And yet, on the other hand, what I'm talking about is rejecting your help.  Because it means somehow you have power over me, or I'm not all powerful in any case if I need to accept help.  (silence)</p>

<p>It just struck me that maybe— (sniff). I just thought of that conference again and the fact that FHYZ said—.  It was arranged that some of the things FHYZ would say, because, in a way it seemed more appropriate that she be the one to say them than me, because it involves next year, and, I don't know, the school's attitude in a more general way than I could really speak for.  But also she said some things that I could just as well have said, but I didn't and she was obviously helping me in this conference.  And, I don't know, I think vaguely I was feeling sort of, "Why did I need it?" or "Why wasn't I able to think of those things and say them, too, at the time?"  Or "Why don't I know as much as she does?"  She doesn't even know this boy very well, but she can evaluate things much more rapidly or incisively than I can.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know why I think this either, but I start thinking about what something she was saying about the second grade today.  Eh, and some of them are boys I had two years ago, and the fact that they're a very difficult class now and they're not as well along in what the boys usually are along in at LKC and, I don't know, there's just lots of problems, more so than usual with this class.  And I know they had a very bad year last year in first grade, but somehow I keep wondering how much am I at fault.  I like to think it's their bad year in first grade, but then I keep wondering, "How much is it really my fault?" (pause)</p>

<p>And it doesn't matter to me that I know (sniff), well, I mean I recognize that I do things better now than I did then, but that essentially when they left my class, at the end of the year, they were just about performing as last year's class was that is doing very well now, and as this year's.  I mean there wasn't—, there were personality to each class and all, but there wasn't some huge difference.  In fact that class was quite good in many ways.  And so in a way I keep thinking that—, and I know what happened to them last year that—, I mean they were treated at a lower level last year than I had when I had them.  And just, I don't know, a lot of things had happened which would make it very difficult for the next year.  And they didn't learning anything much last year, because they became such discipline problems.  But yet still I'll keep wondering what I might have done wrong, too.  And this all, I—, well it makes me think again of how when school becomes important then, well I guess it's my way to comp—, if—, to do things the best possible way as a teacher is my way to compete with men.  (pause)</p>

<p>But I really don't feel that I'm back in feeling that.  (pause)

But I still think there's some kind of a power struggle that I'm setting up and I don't understand exactly how I'm doing it.  And I also just thought that last night, I also had a feeling of testing MSCZ, too, see how nasty I could get again as so often I do, and how much will he take?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Before he runs off with another woman?

PATIENT:  Yeah.  I hadn't thought of it last night, but I know today it's—, it just sort of passed quickly through my mind, I'm going to be nice to MSCZ tonight.  Almost like I can't risk being nasty again.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I think it's more than that.  I think you're really very tempted to really drive him off.  It's as though you really can't stand being happy with him.  That's the central point you made, is how this dream you had occurred at a time when you were, in fact, happier with him and he with you. And here you go back after saying that as though you're really trying to drive him away.  You feel you're also rejecting me and my help, driving me away.  And this happens a week after you were feeling very close to me, like you can't stand that.  You have to undo it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause) Well, I can feel why I might do it in connection with having felt close to you, because I think I felt afraid of that or vulnerable or something.  But I can't understand why I'd not want to feel happy.  I know I do feel that way, because often I've felt happy and almost immediately felt as if I'm not going to let myself feel it anymore.  (pause)</p>

<p>And the thing that comes back to my mind—.  I think it's part of something you said one time about my feeling most inadequate when I feel most close to—, well you were using both examples of close to you here and then to MSCZ during intercourse.  And It just comes to my mind again that I don't want to accept what I am, and, and if I start to, I don't know, recognize it I guess or—.  I mean feeling close to you or feeling happy with MSCZ is involved in accepting what I am or recognizing it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't understand this either, but this thought comes to my mind that, why I don't want to accept it is, I don't know, that it involves then trying to get a penis or making up for one and—.  And I can think of or feel is what do I have then, nothing.  I don't have any feeling of being something else or having something else.  So it's almost instead of not, instead of a question of accepting what I am, it's as if I feel it's a question of rejecting what I've always been trying to be, or been thinking I am.  (silence)</p>

<p>I just thought of what came to my mind, I don't know whether after I left here or right before the time was up yesterday, of—.  I can't quite recall what I was talking about then, but I know it had something to do with the woman in the dream and then, I think so anyway, and my mother, and, I don't know, my father and how he didn't respond to me at all.  And I was thinking something that I often do of, if he had just given me love and, in sort of a companionable kind of way, I wouldn't have felt so inadequate, and I just don't think I would be feeling the way I do now.  And I know it, I've thought it often and I c_ sometimes feel it's, uh, I don't know, just a pointless thing to keep thinking, because it isn't going to get me anywhere.</p>

<p>But just now when it came to my mind again (exhales), I thought something else, and now I can't remember.  Oh, I know.  I was, I was just thinking that sometimes that same kind of idea has come to me in terms of MSCZ, and that when I don't know how to get at rejecting what I've always been trying to be and accepting what I am, I think, "Well, if he keeps on accepting me and loving me and so forth, eventually I'll get this kind of confidence."  And yet it just seemed to me right now, when I thought that, that that's not going to work at all.  Eh, i_, I mean it's almost too late for that kind of thing to work and—.  It's almost like I think less of him for—, if he gives me that kind of accepting me and so forth.  And I know sometimes I want him to be that way like a father and so forth, but right now when I was thinking of it, it's as if I don't want him to be that way.  And I don't know, somehow I just feel it wouldn't do anything except make me mad, and it certainly wouldn't help.  I suppose partly because the assumption of that, and why I think he's refused to do it, too, would be, in a way he wouldn't be able to take me for what I am or, in some senses should be, because he would be taking me for a little girl but not for an adult.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

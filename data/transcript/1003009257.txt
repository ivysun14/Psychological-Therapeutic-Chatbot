<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], you're better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  For the most part.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I got, I got a pretty good attitude about work, um, 2 things the, this is what I remember about Effexor, too, by the way, it, uh, you know, I'm a sweaty Bavarian to begin with and I seem to be sweating more than usual and I think the Effexor did that, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So is that a side effect, sweating?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Prozac, oh, definitely, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And I'm still a little, you know, I can't get off the caffeine, [LAUGHING], which is probably a problem, too.  But, when I take the Prozac, I get kind of wound up a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, are you at 40 now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Was it greater at the 40 than the 20, this wound up feeling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what is the caffeine do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm just, I'm just guessing that it's the caffeine -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the Prozac.  I don't know, I, it, it, I'm still a little like this in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.  Wonder if it's, uh, how much caffeine are you drinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you cut back on the caffeine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I can, but I, you know.  I have to try harder doing that, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That makes me wonder about stimulants, you never had a, like as a kid, anybody suggest ADD problems or attention deficit problems or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I was decent in school and stuff, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And focused and organized and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does caffeine have a calming effect or a stimulating effect for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At first calming, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get up and have a Diet Mountain, 2 Diet Mountain Dews right off the bat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it calms you down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, uh, yeah, a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.  Makes me wonder.  Um, the caffeine -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I tried, I tried taking Prozac at night, but in the morning, it's still that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm still a little jumpy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, you're not anxious at all?  No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're calm and you're not depressed anymore and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, we could, what are you taking, just the Prozac now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No other medicine for physical reasons?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing.  So all you take is the Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still taking the, uh, Campral?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the Campral, too.  Um, and you have no heart difficulties?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing like that and, uh, I'm wondering if we should, uh, try like a low dose of a stimulant to see, uh, why you, why, maybe if you keep craving caffeine, it's for like an organizing affect.  Did you do it as a kid, too, drink a lot of pop and Mountain Dew [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not until, you know, my 20s that I start drinking a lot of caffeine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm inclined because of the severity what you had before, you know, recently, that we just hold off, but I, in the back of my mind now I'm wondering if there is an attentional deficit problem in the background that might be stimulating your caffeine use and I'm wondering if that might have a calming effect on you.  You're not tired during the day, right?  Does this, does this stimulated affect last through the day or how long does it last for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like an hour, 2 hours, just after you take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.  Well, maybe, maybe we should just hold off and, and see over time if this goes away and experiment with the caffeine.  See if you cut back, it gets better -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you take more is it better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If, if my theory that it is an ADD component actually more caffeine, I mean, will that make you more calm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It would be the opposite effect so maybe different days have more, different amounts and see what you feel and then I'll figure out what we do, you know, with any ADD component down the road.  Because people who tend to use drugs and alcohol also many times have an attentional problem.  If you look at the research, people with ADD have like a 3 to 4 times increase in substance abuse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, about attentional problem, um, what exactly, can you give me an example?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, distractibility, impulsivity goes along with that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm impulsive, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really get distracted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once I start something, you know, I see it through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you have an adre, if you, if you start something that you really like, you get an adrenaline rush -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that will help stimulate you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But like it's hard, say if you're in a boring class or you're, you know, your, you, then your mind wonders everywhere.  Is that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you noticed when -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I first get off the alcohol, my mind races.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, I see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm thinking this way, that way, this way, that way -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you see, we have the alcohol affecting your brain, too -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's hard, as I said originally, you know, you're depressed, but the alcohol affects your brain the more time you have away from alcohol the more your brain stabilizes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, why don't we, why don't we not, I mean, this isn't, it's only for a short time when you have this and it's not a negative or terribly overwhelming negative feeling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right you're just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so, and you're so much better if you, if we score it from 0 to 10 with the Prozac, 0 being no change, 10, 100% improvement, how would you rate it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, as far as how I feel overall or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From 1 to 10 improvement?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd say a 7, it's just those 2 little things, you know, it's the sweating and the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The sweating actually I could give you something for sweating if you want, I mean, there's, uh, certain -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I sweat like a pig anyway, this makes it even worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it drips down me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Drips down you.  Now there are a couple of medicines that I've sometimes used, um, that sometimes can reduce sweating.  If you want, I can give you one to try, I mean is it worse during certain times of the day or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I'm working, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you're working, is it worse -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Up and down stairs, up and down ladders, you know [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about in the warmer weather, is it worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that, that's when I have a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that's why I like winter [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the Prozac definitely would make the sweating worse.  So that's the main side effect -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the one I don't like, I mean, um, I'm dealing with this stuff, but, you know the sweating is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me give you something, you know, their pretty benign and you're healthy physically so you might want to try something to see if it just reduces it a little bit at the worse times and, but, I mean, overall 77% increase is good.  I, I think you're going to get better, I think you'll go up to 80, 90% increase, I really believe the more time away from the alcohol, the more time on the Prozac, I mean your mood is much brighter, right -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have any angst about going to work -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Work is smooth and, has it picked up or is it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know how, it's still slow, which -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's still slow -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too much time on my hands then, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you like being busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're not at the job, what do you do, how do you spend the time, is it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, pay bills, work around the house, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exercise at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I've been doing that probably 3 times a week, sometimes 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if you have a lot of free time during the day, maybe go for a walk or something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depends on weather.  You know, I'll take the dog out and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take the dog -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mess around with him, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think I'm, yeah, I'm consciously trying to stay a little busy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, you know, that's, that's something that I've had trouble with in the past.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too much time on my hands and, and then, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you started thinking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then the weather starts up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, but no desire to go back to the liquor store?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, I still have that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still have that.  So every day is a struggle for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I'm not busy, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, are you going to meetings or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't like the meetings or you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm just, it's the same ole, same ole to me.  I hear the same things, you know, I, I've been going for off and on for 5 years, but this last year a lot, you know, at least 2, 3 times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you do the talking, or mostly listening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I talk, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, whatever the subject is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You follow the 12 steps -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have friends in the meeting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's like a social time, too, isn't it, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not real heh, heh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it is but, you know, it's always at night and, um, always puts a damper on it, I guess, you know, I, it's, as long as I'm in the routine, it's fine.  If I get out of that routine, too, then it's like, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A pain to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's the same thing about exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a pain to go there.  Once you break it, it's hard to start on something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The old law of physics.  The law of physics, an object -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've always been a guy who needs a routine, so I don't know if that's any insight either, but I always need a routine, I have to do things a certain way -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how routine is it, would you say it's almost obsessive?  Like you have to do the same thing when you get up every morning and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I wouldn't call it obsessive, but I like to be in that routine, I like to do the same things, uh, in a time frame, you know, I like, I never like to be late, any of that stuff, you know, I like things organized and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Scrutinized?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  When you're on the alcohol, does that lessen that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So when you're off it, it becomes more -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it doesn't bother you, it's not like you feel angst about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No, it would put me in a bad mood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like if you're driving, if you're driving a certain direction and you feel it's not the same direction you drove, you don't have to drive around to go back the same -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, probably just part of your personality structure -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exercise would help that, too, because the more you exercise, the more at peace you feel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The more at peace, the less you worry about things like that.  Have you noticed improvement, in relationships?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like you're happier and the dating situation is better, too, less stress and she noticed this change, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Yeah, I think it's definitely the right combination right now and I, I guess now it's a matter of keeping you out of the depression but also preventing the relapse.  You know, relapse is something we got to look at down the road and, as they say in meetings, it is a one day at a time, I mean, everyday that you abstain is a success basically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, but the reason I came here to begin with is because I, I did put in time, you know, a lot of time, you now 5 months, 9 months, a year and then relapse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the question is what happens that triggers the relapse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well the component that we are adding now is that we are treating the depression -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which wasn't before -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm wondering if, I mean, my personal belief is that alcohol and depression go hand in hand, depression might be the original disorder and then people start drinking almost as a self medication and then they develop a secondary disease and the secondary disease is alcoholism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think, I remember there were some studies, I think they were done out of, um, oh, what's the, Iowa, the University of Iowa where they were looking at women and men who have alcohol problems and the research indicated that there were twice as many men with alcohol problems than women, but if you factored in depressive disorder, it was equal, 50/50.  So, men sometimes tend, because of the social acceptability, you know, to get into a drinking pattern more than, than women, but, hell, lately I see a lot of women, I got to guess at the meetings, there are a lot of women drinkers, but, uh, my hope is that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it's twice, it's twice as many at the, at the meetings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Men than women still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But my hope is that if, if we control the underlying depression with the Prozac, the chance of relapse will reduce, that's my hope.  Do we do anything else to prevent it?  Uh, what else can we do, I mean we could use the Campral, which is a chemical, you know, which can help, so I thought, I'd like to be on the combination, but like you say, in the past, after 5 months, 9 months, you don't know what it is that triggered it or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've talked about it a lot, a lot of it probably is, you know, complacency, you know, I'm I, I get away from what keeps me sober, you know, God and, and uh, and maybe not making the meetings and that type of thing.  I get complacent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the support system you kind of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I kind of, I back away from it after a while.  Like I just did this last time, too.  You know, it's, I'm just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you see it coming or it's like a gradual withdrawal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Actually, no, I don't see it coming until it happens.  And then once I'm done with that binge, then I look back on it and go, well, see you didn't do this, you didn't do that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't see the prodrome of it, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But is the relapse abrupt or is the relapse slow -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's slower, it depends, this last time was really fast.  You know I went from beer one day to vodka the very next, but normally before then, it would be slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Describe the, the pattern.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I would have a beer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One beer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that would be it for that week.  And then, you know, maybe the next week, have a few more and then go day to day beer and then probably a month later, I'm on the hard stuff where this time it was like one day beer, the next day vodka right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, maybe the key for you, then, is to look at any drink as, as a relapse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One drink becomes a relapse.  Could, could you look at it in that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, I do look at it that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so that, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's just, there's just a, a, period of good time that I'm just not looking at myself internally and not being honest with myself and, you know, I, I, I deny what's going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And denial -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I lie to myself basically [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you would have a drink and not even acknowledge that you're doing it in other words.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yes, it's just like, big deal, one drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How could, how could we keep that at the focus or the center so it's always on your mind, I mean is there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's tiresome, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How many meetings a week do you go to now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now, just one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One meeting.  Okay.  Well, I guess we're going to have to see, you know, if the Prozac makes a difference, if the Campral going to make a difference over time, but I still think there needs to be, like you say, the one drink indicator, so, I mean, if you have one drink, you got to call me, you got to, you know, you had the sponsor you got to call, I mean, we, we've got to jump at that first beer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Type of thing.  You know, maybe not think about it every day, but in the back of your mind, realize that that any one drink is the, is the key.  And then we'll kind of try to take a look at, at how to prevent, you know, the second day or the extra beers -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  And like you say being the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Being busy and distractibility -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exercise, the meetings, I mean, you like being routinized so the more you stay in this routine, and it's working, you know, the better you'll be.  And my hope is that jitteriness is going to go away just with the Prozac.  If it doesn't, like I say, we, we could look into, you know, this other attentional component and maybe consider another medicine management combination, but I'd rather wait, because like I say, alcohol changes the brain in, in ways that, it's all neurotransmitter based, we talked about that.  You know, when the neurotransmitters approaching pieces that are unbalanced in the brain, we feel better.  When the probing pieces are out of balance in the brain, we feel worse and alcohol triggers changes on like an hourly basis after you drink, you know, 2 hours, we talked about glutamate going up and then after 2 hours, the glutamate starts coming down and the gabba goes up and the gabba is actually a depressing neurotransmitter, it's an inhibitor neurotransmitter so, so really it's, it's a dangerous, dangerous drug, and, and people don't, don't see it because they get so caught up, you know, in the enjoyment of it or is it enjoyment, I don't know, I mean, what, what do you get when you drink, I mean, what does it do for you?  What did it to for you in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, uh, I'd say like in my 20s, it just put me in a great mood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And like, they talk about bottled courage, that it gave you like more confidence, or did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it didn't, in certain ways it made me more assertive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, in certain ways it did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My personal issues, it probably made me more assertive and in work issues, it probably made me less assertive [LAUGHING].  You know, because, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't care, more complacent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Which in work sometimes better in, you now, when you're a boss and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean if you're managing other people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not your case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it was back in my third, I had people working for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, in your own, in your own business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Now I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it better this way or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, it's much better this way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I like it much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you didn't like managing the people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Little bit of a control freak type guy so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm, so people may mistake you for responsible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would, yeah I'd go over that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now it's all on your shoulder, though, physical, I mean, if there's, if there's a lot of lifting and things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, I have, I have my son help me when I need it.  He's [AGE], so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he going to go into business with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so, maybe, who knows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want him to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really care, you know, whatever he wants to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, just wonder if it will help you out, though, as time goes on, as you get older, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Well the thing is, do I have enough work for him?  [LAUGHING], you know, I just can't have him hanging around me all day not doing anything, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well he's still in school, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like for the summer, he'll work with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do things pick up in the summer or you can't tell.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, um, the way things are going now, I don't know.  I mean, I basically had, I have a couple remodel jobs going, which keep me going, um, but, you know, I like doing service calls and I've only, I've only had like 4 last week, service calls so the phone isn't ringing very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that because things aren't breaking or because people just don't want to spend the money if it breaks or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, people aren't, you know, people aren't spending money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What were the calls, I mean, what do you do on your calls?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like, uh, um, outside faucets, replacing outside faucets, just stuff that has to be done -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like freezing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that froze over the winter and then you, they turn on faucet and it would leak all over inside people's basements.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because they're, they're that long and the shut off in the inside of the house, so when they open it up, it leaks right, right there inside the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I, I get a few, I get a lot of those in the spring.  People first turn on their faucets, they've left the hose on them all winter, so it stays in that pipe, you're supposed to take off your hose on outside faucets -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, so that water isn't trapped in there and drains out through the winter so there's nothing to freeze.  But when it's stuck in there, and frozen, then it expands and busts the pipe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.  Um, so this is the season for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And sump pumps and you know water heaters, that's pretty much what it is, it's you know, people aren't remodeling their basements like they used to and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You did remodeling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I used to do a lot of those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bathroom, remodeling bathrooms, you know, there's not much call for that lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know, the economy is still tight, so, would it help to advertise that business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get some calls for that or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not lately.  I think, I think most of my stuff comes over the internet and the yellow pages.  You know, they'll Google, um, and, uh, in the yellow pages, I'm in the 2 different sets the Dex and the, uh, oh, the Yellow, Yellow Book I think it's called.  Yellow Book takes over a wider area than Dex, Dex is just [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your primary ground, though, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, I mean I see this in the, I tell you I have another fellow I know, a plumber out west of here, he was telling me, you know, it's been so slow, I mean, he's doing it all himself, you know, he used to have people work for him and he had to let everybody go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's not just you, it's just the nature -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, if you go down to the Union Hall, there are like 200 plumbers sitting there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you a union plumber, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I don't really contribute since I'm by myself, but if I hire somebody, it'll be Union, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you couldn't actually get a job through the Union Hall [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did at one time, I went and worked for [DEIDENTIFIED] for about 6 months -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you did [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it was, uh, kind of, uh, um, I had torn something up in my knee, my meniscus, I tore it up and I basically went to work for them just to get the insurance for 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How'd you like working for him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't like it much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, there, uh, you know, their knowledgeable and stuff, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Boy they charge a lot [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't tell me when I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Astronomical.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the [DEIDENTIFIED], I'm sure it's higher now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Astronomical, I mean, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, they put GPS's on your vans and, and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To monitor where you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and, uh, every minute of your day has to be accounted for.  I mean, you're not really allowed to go clean out your truck, you have to charge that to somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so if you get like, if you're lucky, because they charge minimum charge, by, I'd say by the hour.  So if I'm there 15 minutes, you know, then I have time to, to, uh, you now maybe head back to the shop if it's in the vicinity and, and you know, clean out things, but you can't, you can't charge their company any time for loading or unloading and, uh, I, you know, I thought that was a little, little over the line.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean there should be a half hour every day for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's amazing though because he's got -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it ends up, they've got, you know, 15, 20 trucks that are a giant mess inside, you know, they have all this advertising about how clean their trucks are, well that's just the outside, I'll tell you that right now because if you look in one of them  trucks -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Their dirty inside.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did he get so popular, though, I mean, I don't know how he built up such a big business, I don't know how.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he hires decent guys, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To do all the work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he knows who to hire and who to fire.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I knew someone, I can tell, I knew somebody who he bid a job for that this guy had a, I don't think you've heard, but he, what happened was he had a blockage, um, I don't know if it was the sink going out blocked or something so he couldn't use it and [DEIDENTIFIED] quoted him $11,000 for to, to repair and then he got somebody else to do it for $3,000, I mean, that's a huge difference in terms of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The amount of work, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he has, he has all his guys go out and give estimates, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you do that, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean to me that's a managerial job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did it help you in your own business or did it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it did actually, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were able to charge more, probably [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, they do these coupons, you know, they send out these coupons all the time for, you know 10% off, well they're already charging, you know, [LAUGHING], an arm and a leg anyway, so 10% isn't going to, so, you know, so I do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, all right, just hang in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they do, they do, a lot of stuff is, they're really pretty organized as far as like if, you know, they won't tell you on the phone how much anything's going to cost, they want to get their foot in the door to give you an estimate and then, say it's a water heater leaking, you know, you just can't call up [DEIDENTIFIED] and go, I have a water heater leaking how much to, uh, uh, you know, change it out.  They won't tell you on the phone, we'll send a guy out and give you a free estimate and then once they're in the door, you know, they can go, well, you know, it's going to cost this much, but I can do it right now because they'll have a guy come in a truck and bring you a water heater.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  I got upset with him about 20 years ago -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm serious, he did something like that.  I had furnaces and he came in and he looked at my furnaces, I don't remember it was [NAME OTHER], it was when they were starting or something, I think it was [NAME OTHER], he's still there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he, he came in and he, it might not have been him, I don't remember, but anyway, maybe it was a worker, and they looked and they said I had cracks in my furnaces and that I had to replace the furnaces.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I got another opinion and he said, no, that's normal, the, I, just replaced them, last, 20 years later, I just replaced the furnace, so they lasted for 20 years -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he wanted me to replace them right then, you know, because he said the cracks wouldn't, wouldn't make them work or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, in the heat, cracks in the heat exchanger?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I don't even remember what it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that is dangerous because then, you know, you get carbon monoxide coming out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it, really.  Yeah, but it was 20 years, and they lasted all those years, so, I got a little annoyed with him and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, some people swear by them, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, I know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They have a lot of return customers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, they started, it must be what 25, how long have you been in the business?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been 21 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been in business 21 years, but I've been in plumbing since I was [AGE], I'm [AGE] now, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thirty years yeah.  I think they started about 25 years -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  It was like 2 years ago I did that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two years.  Just for 6 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really, I don't, I think it was 4 months actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you left -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three months I was insured -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then you just left, you didn't want to be with them anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they give you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My left, got my knee fixed and then went back into business [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they give you a hard time when you left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, no, um, they were kind of slow at that time anyway, so he had me in the office, you know, getting prints and stuff, which was extremely boring -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I don't like being in an office, I like being out, you know, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't even stand being in school -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, with your nature, I think you do better in your own business, I don't see you working for somebody, you don't like to be controlled -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're like me [LAUGHING].  All right, but I think we're in the right direction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So like I say, we'll just keep what we're doing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the only 2 complaints I got.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  If it doesn't go away, do you feel comfortable going a month from now and, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Touching base in a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, it should be better by then, if not, then we can address this other issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just figured because it's 40, you know, I just figured it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Forty is a big dose, um, do we cut you back, I mean, the reason we went to the higher dose is because you felt that you needed more medicine usually so, do you want to alternate 40/20, 40/20 and see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe I should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want to do that, I don't want to lose the benefit we're getting -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you can try that and see if reducing it, I could give you 30, the problem with 30, there's no 30 mg pill -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you'd have to take, do you have capsules or tablets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Capsules.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you could open, open them up or I can give you another prescription for 20s if you want and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you'd have to take them every day, I couldn't go 40 every other day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, Prozac actually is a long acting drug so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So why don't I just try going every other day then with 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, we could try the 40 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because then I'll see, if the next day, and I don't take it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, if that goes away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we can try that.  But promise me you'll call me if, if there's any relapse or risk of relapse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's something, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not right now, but certainly -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm serious, because like I said, that's a key for you, you know, the first beer you're drinking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can call and then we'll reassess the medicine.  But, yeah, Prozac is the kind of drug that you don't, you won't get withdrawal if you miss a day.  So what you'll do is you'll just lower the level to, yeah, we can, we can try that.  But if you start feeling worse, you know, go back up to the 40.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't need any refills or anything now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, sounds good.</p>

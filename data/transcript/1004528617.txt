<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to make me get an iPhone. It's got so many things that attach to it. It's really a useful thing. That's good. So there's three things that I could want to talk about, all of which are probably a kind of whole session at least worth. One which is an immediate sort of thing I make into a crisis even though it isn't actually but I have been fretting about that's going to get resolved one way or the other in the next few days. And I pretty much know what I need to do. It's just hard. Another which is kind of medium term, and the last which is kind of long term planning what are we doing here Meta sort of questions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here being here or here being...</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of long-term plan and treatment. So, I don't know which to talk about. [Laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. I don't know. Is there any of those you feel like talking about? Or don't feel like talking about? [Laughs] [00:02:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is probably the most important, but which is also the hardest for me to talk about has to do with my patterns of self-injury, which are kind of changing somewhat. And so basically what happened was a couple of weeks ago, I cut myself much, much more deeply than I intended to, as in now I'm like oh, maybe I should've gotten stitches there. Hmm. Oh well, not too late now. And not seriously, still but just I hadn't meant to. And then just the way as - then as the time went on it was like it didn't heal for several weeks and so I didn't cut myself for several weeks and that seemed like a good thing in some ways.</p>

<p>But now I'm in this situation where I want to do that again and that's real scary for me. I'm also like oh so this is how addiction works. Nice. [Laughs] That's good to know. But it also kind of raises just the question of self-injury which is I mean obviously really hard for me to - it's gotten easier for me to tell people that I do it but it's really hard for me to talk about it because I want to want to stop but I don't actually want to stop. [00:04:12]</p>

<p>But I also don't want to deal with the consequences of it. Like it was not very much fun going to the beaches and wearing my bathing suit and having scars on my legs and getting really self-conscious about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what way do you want to do it? In other words...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of - it works almost like - it actually works exactly like sympathetic magic works, which is [inaudible at 00:05:09] sometimes. I mean the idea being in my head at least that if I exact this punishment upon myself, then the larger retribution that I - like a larger kind of doom that I feel hanging over me might go away, which is I fail at everything I undertake and everybody that I love leaves me. And it's like I've already - if I do, if I punish myself for all the things that are wrong with me then maybe other people won't notice them, which is exactly like sympathetic magic in that it doesn't actually - oh, the idea being that you do something to substitute that is emblematic of what you either want to happen or don't want to happen. [00:06:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a voodoo (ph) doll?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, basically. And most I would say kind of intercultures (ph) and I say most magic was of this kind of doing, of enacting something upon a substitute for a thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I guess like a sacrificial lamb is something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly. Yes, yes. So, you know, I mean it's reassuring that humans haven't really changed. [Laughs] (inaudible). But, yes it's just really scary. And that's kind of one of the main things that the cutting does but it does other things too. So if I want to kill myself and I cut myself instead, I don't want to kill myself so much, that kind of thing, which I guess is sort of the same thing. Doing something else instead of what I'm afraid of or what I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind about it? [00:08:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: About?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cutting yourself, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's kind of both I really don't want other people to see it and I do want other people to see it. In practice I make all reasonable efforts to ensure that other people aren't going to see it. Like I don't cut myself where it shows. I lie about it if people ask. I'm terrible at lying but what do you do? I really hate lying but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said something had changed recently about it. I assume you're referring to having cut yourself more deeply than you had before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the way you first said it when you said something's changed, you make it sound different than when you said that you cut yourself more deeply than you meant to. In other words the second way makes it sound like an accident, possibly just a one-time thing, whereas the first way you said it makes it sound more deliberate and likely ongoing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, I think what has changed is not anything that I've done but the control that I feel that I have over it and what I want to be doing. So I haven't cut myself deeply again. But I want to and cutting myself a little bit doesn't fix things in the way that it used to. And that I feel like there's an escalation going on. [00:10:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. This relates to your sort of referring to addiction hike for a while. Six years does it, then it's eight years, like that.</p>

<p>Client: Yes and in case it's relevant I have a lot of alcoholic relatives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So if there's a genetic component to addition it is certainly in me. But I don't know if self-injury it thought of in those terms typically. Yes, I guess I just - it's something that I do to gain control and I feel like I am losing control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel like you're losing control? [00:11:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it's always kind of clear when I think about it carefully but I try not to think about it too carefully most of the time. But it's become more and more clear that the impulse is guiding me rather than the other way around. That the - it's not that I am in an intolerable place emotionally. I cut myself once and then it becomes manageable and I can handle it. It's not something I kind of rely on. Now it's a I cut myself once and the thought is do it again. Do it harder. That's not enough. I think it's probably really bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think you're doing to yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am cutting myself to pieces.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you be more specific?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I can try. It's just things that I do are I will scratch or scrape or cut lightly and I will scrape up my arms with my fingernails so that the skin all comes off, just basically just tearing the skin off. And now it's no, cut into the muscle; no cut farther down; no make something that doesn't close up fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any sense of what would feel satisfying about that? [00:14:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, in the back of my mind is always thinking there is nothing I can do to myself that is actually equivalent to what I deserve, that is actually as violent as what I deserve. But even the violence I do to myself is a stand-in for that and it's just becoming not enough of a stand-in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have images of a certain thing you deserve, even if they're not things you'd ever do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean, you know obliteration and self-immolation buried in a pile of rocks. Yes, just various concrete images that center around just my whole self just being completely dispersed. Not being myself any more. Sorry I find it hard to get concrete. I know I'm talking more abstractly than you're asking for but...[00:16:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes it hard to get concrete?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm ashamed of it. It's easier for me to distance myself from it or to put a level of interpretation on it and then give it to you. I mean that's always going to be the case but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so shameful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's an ontological thing. Like it's not anything I do it's what I am but then it's reflected in everything I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, I'm wondering if it's like this because then you're afraid to feeling ashamed of yourself in some very fundamental, ontological sort of way. I wonder if that sense of shame is especially attached to certain, I may call them more intimate thoughts that you have such as the fantasies of self destruction, which is what makes those especially shameful to the specific event? [00:18:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I don't know. It could be. Yes. It doesn't strike me as immediately true or immediately false. But it's interesting. I mean maybe it is that it is so - to me it is so weak to fantasize about destroying myself. It's not - yes, I don't know. Yes my thoughts aren't going anywhere else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The two things you did, describe self-immolation and being buried by rocks, I have to say one thing is stoned. I don't know if that's what you had in mind. [00:20:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's something that somebody else would do to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just something that would happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you'd be like underneath it. Cliff or an overhang kind of where the rocks fall on top of you and you're just crushed. Yes, and that's what I was going say, which is that it sounded like you were kind of - the self-immolation sounds like people do that like in protests, so it's like a religious overtone as being stoned just because [inaudible at 00:21:08] biblical times, you know what I mean but it didn't sound like that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's more - I mean it's both like sort of acts of nature or things that can't be controlled. I forgot what I was just going to say. I'd rather all of these things happen to me than have the people that I love find out that I'm actually such a failure in all these things, which is going to happen, somehow I'm convinced. I feel like that's the only way to keep from having everybody know who I am, or what I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It actually protects you from something even worse. [00:22:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Then nobody has any control over it so I'm not responsible for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I imagine what makes it upsetting to say is that - what is it that makes it upsetting to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One possibility, and I'm not sure that this is what's going on, is that if I talk about these things to people, with people, then they'll see, they'll [determine that I'm actually dreaded] (ph). If I talk about wanting to do these things to myself, then they'll kind of look past that pointing finger and say oh wow she really is a joke or something. That somehow exposing what I think I deserve will expose why I deserve it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's something about having fantasies like that in the first place and what you use them to protect yourself from that's very closely tied up in why everybody's going to find you a failure and leave you in the first place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know how those things interconnect? [00:26:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, for why people will reject me and leave me, it's as though my brain has already drawn a conclusion and then I just look for evidence to fill it. This kind of knowledge that I'm not worth being with people, I'm not worth taking up the space that I'm taking up it precedes any reasons for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And the subject of your brain to complete the picture.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And it just doesn't budge. So I go back and forth between trying to fight it and reinforcing it and between trying to come up with all of the evidence, which is actually like I am beloved and I am worth time and I am a useful person...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of reason with it. [00:28:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and then taking all of the evidence in the other direction and kind of throwing it at myself in front of [inaudible at 00:28:11].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the evidence you needed how you're horrible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. Ways that I found.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything between not finishing my homework to forgetting about a deadline to saying the wrong thing and hurting somebody's feelings to undervaluing someone to judging someone harshly and then later finding out that it was not appropriate, that I should not have done that. I've get a lot more in-depth and specific about the ways that I fail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And for some of them are performative and some of them are moralistic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And some of them are the things that come easy to me and the things that don't come easy to me, easily. I'm just more or less lazy, like I have a hard time getting work done. I have a hard time sitting down to do it. I don't want to. And it's just a facet of my personality or habits or whatever you call it. And so the cutting is kind of saying yes all of these things are true about myself. Yes, I accept this but see I'm doing this to kind of balance it so you can shut up. [00:30:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, when you say that, yes see what I'm doing about it so you can shut up, it sounds like this part of yourself that knows that you deserve it and knows how awful you are is something you sort of contend with. It doesn't sound like it's such a parental part of yourself like you feel much bigger than you. It sounds like, it almost sounds like a peer that you can argue with, that you can tell to shut up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm pretty contentious with authority figures. [Laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I see. [00:32:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like a law of nature; it doesn't feel like a parental thing. It doesn't feel like a peer thing. It doesn't feel like - it feels like it's just, yes, it's just a fact and you can spend a lot of time having various relationships with facts but they're still facts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's time my brain has more nonsense I know that it does not exact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure. No but I guess there's some way in which you really want to be convinced of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Convinced that it's true?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, because that's how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you mean that because I have such a deep conviction in it, I need external evidence to validate that? Like I need to look for the things that would make it true because that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On some level at which you want to believe it as much as you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, I'm not sure of course, but this is something you need. Apparently you'd like very desperately to believe about yourself. [00:34:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if it weren't true, then nothing in my life would make any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Say again] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I'm not quite sure how to explain it but it's like I've built everything that I am around this fundamental conviction and it'd be like dismantling, I don't know, the laws of geometry or A equals A proposition, like something cannot be both itself and not itself. It would be like saying no that's not actually true. I mean, it one of those things that somehow got to be one of the pillars of not just how I think of myself but how I think, or - yes. [00:36:25]</p>

<p>And it's also I trust my intuition. I trust the things that you just know. Like the way I write papers is I read text and I read some more text and I read some more text and I say oh, this, this, this equals this. But I don't - I haven't taken the steps in between; I just know the answer. And then the writing of the paper is taking the steps to prove the answer that I already know is the case. I went through that 90 percent of the time. And I trust that in myself but so if this is the biggest thing or one of the biggest things and if I can't trust that then I can't trust myself at all. I can't trust anything. This is going to be fun. [Laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. It seems to me, well it seems to me that this is kind of one of the ways that you're most interested in - I can put it this way - kind of using me is to help you to look at things that you know aren't true but are too painful to really lay out and think about a lot of the time on your own. Things that you could be in the grip of but then it's hard to step back from and really look at and kind of try to evaluate. [00:39:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's - when I don't think about things, it's not because I'm - it's - I think it often is because it's too painful, but it's generally I'm unconscious that it's because it's too painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know it's there to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I see. Yes, I mean I can see those sort of a few moments today where you sort of caught it a bit, like okay wait I realize I'm being kind of abstract here. Yes, it's very hard for me to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But I'm good at making myself believe that things aren't hard for me to think that. When I'm skating around things that I don't even know they're there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [00:40:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We must stop in a minute. I had a few scheduling stuff and I don't know if this relates to your question about our long-term standard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just - in this - I'm finally in a position where, okay, I can actually have long-term treatment that's good and that's great but I don't actually know what that looks like. [Laughs]. So, I don't know, yes, I don't know what that involves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I think we can talk about that. Okay, let's see. So one time I have ongoing is - did you say Fridays are often good for you? You have something at this time, which has been a go-to time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fridays I often fly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if that's kind of up in the air now. It's up in the air now as to, like it's up in the air whether I'm going to go home for the - go back to the - stay with James for the summer or not. I feel like I shouldn't. And so, mornings Fridays would probably work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yes, this is more of a mid-day, like at 12:30 kind of. But that's - so not so good. Let's see, I've also got something on Wednesdays at 10:45, which I may have already run by you. Am I remembering right, Wednesdays during the day aren't so good, it's Wednesday afternoons that are better? [00:42:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think Wednesdays during the day are fine. I don't know why I told you that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, maybe I'm just forgetting. Is 10:45 on Wednesday a good time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That works for me ongoing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great. Right now I have scheduling five different people at different plans of the day, different day of the week every week so ongoing is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, no I know we've been going through days with this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean yours is the only ongoing appointment that I have. So two is better than one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you. Okay. So, yes, let me think about it and we can talk more next week about what long-term treatment looks like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, also, you can - I mean you brought this up I think last week or two weeks ago - if you are feeling very scared and worried about [inaudible at 00:44:07] or other things you certainly can call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you. I know, I know. Is it okay if I put you first on that list rather than James? I think that's too much for James.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thank you. [00:44:26]</p>

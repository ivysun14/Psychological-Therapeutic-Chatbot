<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how are you?  How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I would be doing perhaps a little bit better if my partner weren't having real serious pain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Been worse?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Going on for a while and she's had two epidural nerve block steroidal injections.  So far they haven't worked.  And she's on painkillers and she's pretty miserable.  She doesn't have a very high pain tolerance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When's the last time she had a real bad episode with the pain?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no, before this period where it's been bad, like prior?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been building up for about a year or so.  She never had pain in her life before now.  She's [AGE], pain free, never a problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do they know what the cause is?  Spinal stenosis or disc disease or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's some kind of bulge.  She had an MRI and there's some bulge that, um, looks like there's, she has sciatica, well, she has some arthritis in her hip and sciatica and, yknow, sometimes she can walk and she's fine and then all of a sudden she'll get shooting pain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She'll feel it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now I've had this all my life, since I was about eighteen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But, yknow, if I complain about it, yknow, she'd say do something to distract yourself.  So now the tables are turned.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's harder to be empathic?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You might say that, I'm a very good caretaker but there are moments when I feel a little resentful.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because of the responses that you have gotten?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because she hasn't always been the most empathic partner in the world.  So here we are.  And the other big thing that may be weighing on me a little bit is my sister's in pretty bad straits and she lives in San Francisco and she's been living alone for the past fifteen, sixteen years.  And she has this, um, connective tissue disorder called chronic relapsing polychondritis.  And it's very, it's a really bad disease and she's suffered a lot with it.  And we've grown closer over her need for support.  She's also been very supportive of me when I had my bipolar fall apart.  Um, at any rate, she's living in the building from hell and people above her make noise all night and the manager has been trying to push her out in subtle ways because she's in a rent controlled apartment in San Francisco, and could get much more for it.  To make a long story short, which I have trouble doing, uh, I invited her a long time ago to come and live with us. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she has finally agreed to do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she's in the process of trying to tie things up there which won't happen instantly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I think it would be a lot less stressful for her.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now is she older or younger?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's four years older than I am.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And does she, I mean, get along with [NAME OTHER], and [NAME OTHER] on board?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] on board, but sometimes I have to get in there and be a little bit of a negotiator between the two of them or [INAUDIBLE] sometimes [NAME OTHER] doesn't, and the funny thing is my sister's name is [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [NAME OTHER], okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] was called [NAME OTHER] when she was a kid.  So it's hello.  Um, how did this happen.  Um, [NAME OTHER] doesn't always tolerate the differences with [NAME OTHER], and [NAME OTHER] can be very dramatic and full of hyperbole and, um, what can I say.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and she also tends to get herself in debt because when she sees something she likes she feels like she deserves it, she buys it.  And I've bailed her out of her debt a few times.  Um, she's paying off a loan right now to me, um, which will be paid off in August, but I'm thinking she's probably going to be coming in the spring.  It'll take her that long to get some dental work done that she's in the midst of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And she's, um, I mean, the entré€€e is going to be long term, that -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Presumably.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not, um, coming to stay with you and relocating here to independence again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We looked at the possibility of that when she was here about three years ago.  I lined up a whole lot of apartments for her to look at.  And at that point she didn't find anything that, the places she liked were way out of her budget.  And the places she could afford she thought were dumps, yknow.  So she doesn't want to go from one dump to another.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we have a second floor and, uh, I've been clearing stuff, I've been spending time every day clearing stuff out of the second floor part and putting it into the attic section of the second floor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I brought my computer downstairs which crowds my consulting room a little bit, but not too much.  Um, but I've been working very hard to get ready for her and, um, it's, I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at once.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, we sometimes have a lot of fun together, and then there will be times that she'll be very sick and I'll need to take care of her and get her to doctor appointments.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're ready for that responsibility?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I guess the answer I would give you is that she's my only family, I'm her only family 'cause we don't count her father with whom she's had no contact in -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You're taking medicine, yes.  Um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're ready for that because of the bonds of family?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, and I'm a little apprehensive about it because, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever lived, I mean, besides being children, have you lived together as adults?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that, I would imagine that apprehension -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's been living alone for fifteen years and, um, values her privacy and independence.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And have you had that kind of discussion with her?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we've been talking about a lot of stuff.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> At least you have the opportunity for a few months of discussion and negotiation and planning, but it's not like a tragedy has happened and she has to move in next week, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have some time to talk, so I think you know the areas that you're going to need to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we've been talking about which dishes she's going to bring.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I think more importantly just the whole idea of, yknow, finding out, yknow, how she's viewing going from living by herself and independence to being with you.  If you know what I'm saying?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because that is a big change.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, there, yknow, she's expressed to me that it feels a little bit like a failure on her part that she's had to even consider doing this.  Um, and she doesn't want to feel dependent.  And my attitude is as long as she's able to do things for herself, she can come and go.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just have a roof over her head.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It'll be like having an apartment upstairs and.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Will she have responsibilities in the house?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's something we need to, um, talk more about because I said to [NAME OTHER] last night, um, my partner, [NAME OTHER], um, she said something about do you really, do you know what you're getting yourself into?  Because [NAME OTHER] has been very supportive of this move which surprised me naturally, but she thinks she should have done it a long time ago.  She said do you know what you're getting yourself into with all her medical issues?  And, uh, I said I have no plan to be the sole caretaker here.  Everyone's going to have to pull their weight.  You and [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did [NAME OTHER] respond to?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she said, well, I pull my weight, don't I? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe when she said do you know what you're getting yourself into, I mean, obviously she's moving in with the two of you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I have already moved more and more into being [NAME OTHER] caretaker.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Especially with her having more pain now too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And she needs, she's also showing some signs of memory problems.  Yknow, she dropped something, I'm right there to pick it up because it hurts to bend. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like at least [NAME OTHER] at times that she's doing well may be a support too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> An emotional support certainly.  She can be very grounded at times.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, and she's a good cook.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So she'll have certain responsibilities that will benefit you all.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll have to find ways of accepting what she can do and letting her do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Probably the other thing that'll be real important is she has such a, and I haven't heard of this particular disease, that she have a good referral, yknow, to a medical support system here too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She, yeah, I've been looking stuff up on the computer to try to find a rheumatologist who has a specialty.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She also might want to take care of whoever's taking care of her out there and see if there's a letter of introduction or if that person knows of anybody, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's going to get her records.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause that'll help you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And mostly to have, not, I mean, 'cause you indeed are not going to be, I mean, she's an adult, she's not dependent in that sense.  She's not, yknow, you're not her guardian.  She's not without a parent.  Yknow, so it's being able to help her be able to prepare her own support network here too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, she's going to get letters from all of her, she has a whole lot of doctors out there.  And the, and her, bring her records also with her, which are voluminous. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But that'll be real important to do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the other thing is she has been seeing the same psychiatrist since almost the entire time she's been in California which is thirty years.  Um, and she has a tremendously good relationship with him.  Well, I would guess after thirty years.  Um, and that's one of the things she was apprehensive about, moving away from him and from, um, her acupuncturist who has been a great help to her, um, because they didn't expect her, when they first diagnosed her with this, they didn't expect her to live more than a couple of years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she just didn't accept that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And she's had the diagnosis how long now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fifteen years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen.  Does it have like another name or is it a?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's a syndrome and people with it often have comorbid, um, lupus, scleroderma, other, it's an autoimmune disease.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  It's not genetic or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.  There's no genetic tie.  There's, um, yknow, I've been trying to keep up to date on anything that's learned about it.  But people with it develop vasculitis.  The one of the first signs of it is a saddle nose and drooping ears because it's connective tissue.  Um, and then it can affect the trachea, the esophagus.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know a few rheumatologists but I know down at [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED] one of the national scleroderma centers so that they know people from all over the country would come to [DEIDENTIFIED] for treatments.  I was a resident down at [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow, in medicine, I'm pretty sure that the rheumatologists were, but there were people from Indiana and Michigan and, yknow, California that were coming to get various treatments for scleroderma.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I met a scleroderma patient down there when I was there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, so I know it's a national center for that.  I imagine they probably would have that connections to other, yknow, more connective tissue.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The other thing is she will be looking for a good psychopharmacologist and I thought maybe you could find room in your schedule.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a possibility.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It wouldn't be an issue to have?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I see, when I'm doing psychopharmacology and dealing with medications that you have therapeutic issues come up obviously 'cause it's so important, but, no, I mean, I have treated people that [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I treat people in the same family where I started seeing the daughter who was a cutter and then saw her mother who was very depressed and then her father who was alcoholic and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe if I end up like seeing a conflict or have an, I would bring it up, yknow, with either you or her, whatever, try to at least, um, invariably things would come up so I may, when I'm treating someone in the same family is have to understand that I need to be aware.  I don't treat people in the same family that are unaware.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but this is a way we have of putting up a firewall and, yknow, keeping things very simple.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you know when she's in the area, just have her call.  I mean, it's not sort of a unilateral decision just on my part.  Obviously she's a major part of the deciding factor.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I told her some about you and how much I enjoyed working with you.  And she sounds like she'd be interested.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, when you know the details, have her call.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll talk to her and we'll set something up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And let her know too my limited hours here at this particular site.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wednesday mornings and Tuesday afternoons still.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She wouldn't have a problem with Tuesday afternoons [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, speaking of medications, you seem to be doing well.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only complaint I have is, um, particularly in the last few days I, uh, been a little sluggish, uh.  A little less energetic.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just the last couple days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I guess it was about a week ago, um, I found myself, I had gotten up about nine, which is not unusual if I don't have plans early in the morning I often stay in bed 'til eighty thirty, nine.  But then I had breakfast and went back to sleep.  [NAME OTHER] came in from doing something and she said I think her words were this is no good.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You mean you going back to sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Had you slept through the night okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the Ambien, did you take the Ambien the night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, every night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There was one night a few weeks ago where, um, I got the box, I don't know how this happened, but, yknow, I have my med box and it had gotten turned around and I had just reached in, in the dark and taken them from what should have been the corner that would have been the nighttime, but it turned out to be a morning dose.  And I couldn't sleep all night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that means that you took the Paxil and the Depakote instead of the Ambien and the Depakote.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it really would have been the Paxil that was the main thing.  When you woke up the other day and went back to bed, did you take the Paxil first thing, then went back to bed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And then that happened a couple more times.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was it the possibility, doesn't sound like you were over medicated, do you feel more depressed?  I mean, like motivational?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I would say motivational would be about as close as I could, just didn't have any piss and vinegar.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But that's not every day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's not every day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not every day.  I didn't want to get up at seven o'clock this morning but the electrician was coming, so I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And coming here.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, but I didn't have to get up at seven to come here.  Um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yknow, I guess, if there were more signs of depression, obviously the Paxil's something that could either go up or down.  Yknow, it can go up to 40.  I don't want to jump and increase it if it's not a clear pattern.  Um, yknow, if your appetite's not affected or there's not other signs of depression.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the appetite's fine and I'm not seeing other signs of depression.  It's just, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Concentration's okay on, at work and, word finding's okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you got the report from the psychoneurologist, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Back in October, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Psychoneurologist, I'm saying the wrong word.  Neuropsychologist.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ah, this is the -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There I just turned it around, neuropsychologist, from a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There should have been something also from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I got that.  And that had your Depakote level included with it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you didn't get a -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Work my way backwards.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Letter from -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that was July.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was like April.  For your information she was going to send you a report.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing.  This was in the fall?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I had a battery of testing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Neuropsych testing, how'd you do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't get the results, but I imagine you know what the results are.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, shit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, let me send them to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That would be, I mean, obviously -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think she said it's good news.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] neuropsychologist do testing and they're suggesting something like Aricept or, yknow, they're, if there's findings, they usually give me a call if they know I exist.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, now what the neurologist had suggested was in terms of the tremor she said something about, she mentioned a couple of medications including beta blockers, beta blockers, I want to go to beta.  Um, Inderal, stuff like that.  And I said, yknow, I'm taking so many medications right now, I'm just, uh, hold off on that.  If it gets really, really tiresome, I'll consider it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She didn't say anything about Mysoline?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She, I think that was one of the things she said.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a very commonly used one that would have less issues with blood pressure and may not, sometimes beta blockers can make you feel a little bit tired too 'cause they can lower the blood pressure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So if you're already dealing with a little bit of fatigue or, ah, motivation or, yknow, whatever that combination of symptoms is, that maybe Mysoline may be a better choice.  Um, but, yknow, again I'd leave that up to the neurologist.  Just make sure that they know about the, your being tired at times.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah, but I'm surprised that the, this neuropsychologist did not send her report.  It was like two pages.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel comfortable giving her a call and forwarding it on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I have a copy of it, so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Do you wanna?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Wait a minute, did I bring a copy for you?  Let me just see if maybe I have a copy for you because I could do something that silly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's a fax number on the card, on the appointment card, so if you could get a chance maybe just fax it over to me and I'll take a look at it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can do that today.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I will include it in your chart.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One thing I remember about it is, um, that on the test where you have to say as many words as you can starting with a certain letter, that I scored not as well on that test because of words that I went for were not simple words but more sophisticated words.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it took you longer to say the words.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like with S it would be sacrosanct, scintillating, yknow, it was like, yknow, I didn't go for, um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> See.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sin or sat or.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And there were some spoonerisms.  And I've lost about twenty five, thirty points of my IQ since I was in school.  But I was probably tested with what is it, [INAUDIBLE], I mean, they changed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The test today.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The tools are very different.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Now this is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Paxil?  Ambien?  Depakote?  Same as last time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Thirty mg, the 250 mg tablets two and two and the Ambien 10.  I put three refills on each again.  Make sure the pharmacist notices the three on the side.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Now I think that Depakote is coming out in a generic, um, sometime in February.  I'm assuming it's going to be exactly the same as Depakote, not just valproic acid?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, it'll be a coated version.  It'll be, it won't, they already have generics of regular valproic acid.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Which I got one month and I was off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You need the coated version that's a slow released.  I mean, usually I think it's, since your level was seventy seven the last time I would, and you've been doing well, yknow, a level every six months to a year is fine.  But if you switch over to the generic product we might want to check it again or just be vigilant towards after the next.  Well, I would say, doesn't have to be that quick.  If you do switch over to a generic or have that kind of a change that maybe our next visit we'll make sure to get your blood test sooner.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause I'm going to see you again in like three, four months.  Yeah, so that'll be in that timeframe.  That'll be February, that'll be like three months.  So that would be at the beginning of summer.  We try to do that earlier as opposed to October.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  There's one other thing and I don't know what you can possibly make of this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] but for the past maybe couple of months, maybe six weeks, I've been having what I can only describe as olfactory hallucinations.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I thought I had, it sounds very bizarre to me.  Um, it was one day in the office when, um, I was sitting on my couch waiting for a client to arrive, and I looked over toward the window and it looked like it was raining inside the office.  It was like a fine mist coming down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I kept looking at it and I went over and felt to see if it was a mist coming out of the heating vent or something.  Um, I couldn't really feel anything, but then my client arrived and she's a Cambodian woman who burns a lot of incense and while she was there I started smelling, uh, some, a particular scent.  After she left I kept smelling that scent and all the way home and into the evening and I can tell you that off and on ever since then I smell this scent.  I have, um, used Ocean Spray.  I've tried, yknow, washing my sinuses out.  I still smell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, and it's a, the smell is an incense type smell, like a patchouli?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not patchouli.  It's not patchouli, um, but it is, um, and it's not flowery.  Um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you still smell other things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you're cooking you smell?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my sense of smell is, yknow, unimpaired, but I have this extra, yknow, that I can.  That doesn't smell for a minute, but when I'm, yknow, want to breathe in through my nose I smell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Usually olfactory hallucinations are kind of like odd smells, burning smells, rotten smell.  I've usually heard it more in the negative.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not rotten, it's, yknow, it's not wonderful.  But it's, it has a very foreign kind of smell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's odd that you would start when you were seeing a client that was Cambodian that came in that you know burns incense or, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I even asked her about it the next week.  Yknow, I said do you wear a particular scent, um, and she said no.  And, um, she said but I burn incense a lot.  And, uh, and she handed me her scarf and I kind of sniffed it and it vaguely smells like what I noticed last week, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it doesn't, it sounds like it has a distinct.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I don't know.  That almost sounds like an olfactory memory more than a hallucination in a way.  Um, but it doesn't sound like what I would consider a, I mean.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She came yesterday, I hadn't seen her in a month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are certain seizure disorders that can have olfactory hallucinations, but it's, and migraines, certain migraines can have olfactory sensations as well.  Usually will get visual.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like a pre [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Kind of like before you get either a seizure or the migraine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can smell it right now but very faintly.  And I know that it's, yknow, it's not on me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm wearing cologne 'cause I definitely wear a particular kind.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Can you smell that?  Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it's not, definitely not that.  No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's got a, it's got a slightly sweet, slightly pungent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If it continues or gets worse, then I would go see the neurologist or mention it when you see the neurologist visit.  I don't, I don't know what they would make of it.  I don't know if they'd recommend getting an EEG and all that kind of fun stuff, but when you have your next sched, unless it gets worse, call them.  But when your next scheduled visit with the neurologist, just mention it and see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a weird thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would say it sounds like it's not deterring your work or your lifestyle or, yknow, it's a puzzle, a question, it may have an answer just with time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yknow, when I first saw that, what looked like rain in my office, I thought that maybe there was some kind of a chemical in the, in the heating system.  It was coming out and I associated that with it.  But that's, I think it's coincidental that I saw the client right after that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give it time.  If you think it's worse, call the neurologist and definitely when you see the neurologist on your next visit, mention it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I want to see you again in [INAUDIBLE] months.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, so [DATE] is three months and one, two, three, four, [DATE] is four months.  When do you think your sister will be moving in?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm hoping it will be by the end of April.  A lot of it's dependent upon this extensive dental work she's having done.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Would you want to come in [DATE] before the actual move or do you want to come in after? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Might be good to talk before, my thought, but.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that sounds good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So [DATE] at nine thirty.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you my card with the appointment on it.  [INAUDIBLE] fax on the front.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And I'll send you that.  It's funny because I wrote down on a form that she should send a copy to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], the neurologist, and to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115. Interview number 16, March 25th, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I (inaudible 0:31) what to think of it yet. When I went home, I decided - since I had it on my mind - I may as well do something about Jessica that night. I didn't have the energy to stay up for four hours and write a letter so I just called her. It kind of came to an impasse. So, the next day I got a letter which was far more explanatory of the situation than the telephone call was. I made a reply to the letter. I wrote in it that I did appreciate the letter but why in the hell did it have to be spaced - a long interval - and they had to be evoked by a near crisis every time. And I will just wait and see whether it makes any impression or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From what I can pick up about the phone call, it sounded like that was stalemate of some kind - like that didn't get you any place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it didn't get 'em any place. Stalemate makes it sound like a conflict of sorts. It wasn't so much that - it didn't really settle anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that was just what I was (inaudible 2:00).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just kind of a, "I'll cry on your shoulder and you will cry on mine." It didn't decide a damn thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I am not really sure where you are at. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not either. I am kind of just withholding a judgment in every way that I can - let it drift for a little bit. Wait: it doesn't bother me in this situation - waiting. It seems that whether I have my mind made up or not, I am going to be waiting in this relationship anyway - so it is all the same. Carmen will be getting in about four o'clock...in the corner of your eye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always had people tell me that the way you take eyedrops is to just lean back and drop it in. I cannot do it: I cannot look at that thing and drop a drop of it into the middle of my eye when I am looking at it. 0:03:08.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't look at it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have seen people do that. I can't understand how in God's name they do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like putting in contact lenses with a mirror: I get very confused - I just do it by feel. Some days I go by florescent lights and I am looking at these numbers and my eyes just go dead. So I interrupted your...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that is okay. I'm just rambling anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, Carmen is going to be here for how long?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'll be here a little over a week. She'll get here tomorrow; she'll probably leave Saturday or Sunday of next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you planning on coming in here next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that leads me to say I won't be here next Thursday but I will be here Tuesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I was talking with Carmen just before I came down here. I sent Josh downtown today with my checkbook to arrange a ticket. That, among other things, he got that done and botched up everything else I asked him to do. While I was talking with her, I noticed that trying to decide what we would be trying to plan, I was eliminating Josh from about every other thing that we had planned. It kind of raised my eyebrows in a kind of little...I had prophesied to myself that this type of thing would happen and it has. Josh's odysseys have finally gotten to me to the point where I would just as well not have him around as try and put with him. I don't know how that will affect him. 0:06:00.6</p>

<p>I really don't know what to think of this situation with Jessica. Some of the things that have seemed to come up, if not good in their, I don't know, their action, maybe they don't take an active role in the things that happen but they are at least inspirational. Some of it I either don't understand in the least and am suspicious of, or I just don't like outright. She seem to take an attitude that any question concerning the relationship, or what should be done, or what is going to happen, eight times out of 10 it will be met with a response of, "I don't know." She made mention of it in the letter. She said that the only thing that she could do was to try to be happy with those things that she found around her right now that she liked. And try also to be happy knowing that in another year and a half or so things will get together so the problems won't be around. That just sounds great on paper but I don't believe anybody can live it - I know I can't. I just can't hibernate emotions for a year and a half and expect them not to change, and then pull them out of the closet and hang them out to try. 0:12:36.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like she is saying in some way when the two of you are together that is when she'll...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she will just save everything for then and be happy in the meantime because she knows that it will all come together eventually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you are saying is that cuts out any forth and back now in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is giving up on any forth and back now but it is also saying...it is like saying that a person could die for a year and a half and then come back to life emotionally. I can't fathom anybody even considering that. My emotions are as alive and changing as I am. If they need re-enforcement and re-orientation every now and then, it is because they are that way. I can't just stick them in a closet and let them stalemate and stagnate and take them out and expect them to be the same as they were. They don't last.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you are suggesting something that feels psychologically impossible: you don't see how another person could even conceive of such a thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't believe it could work</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't seen it in her in such a long time. Jessica is prone to fantasy - she likes to fantasize about going to desert islands and taking 10 people - the only people that she is really interested in - and those 10 people will stay and this kind or garbage. She loves to rap on that kind of thing but it seems to permeate a lot of her logic. She just doesn't take, to my point, a realistic view in a lot of things like that. I don't know whether it is because we look at things different or whether they actually work differently with us, or whether we have just had different experiences so that she knows something I don't, and vice versa. First off, I can't sit back and be sedate and just say, "Well, I don't know so I just won't try and hassle with it." I feel like there are too many times that I have ended up on the shit end of the stick just because I was happy enough to say, "I don't know," and dig up what I could find. I am scared to death of not knowing. Not knowing is the thing that will usually end me up in trouble but she doesn't seem to have any...she doesn't seem to doubt the relationship, whereas I do. I can't foresee it lasting another year and a half the rate it is going now. 0:15:34.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you are saying she doesn't doubt the relationship but she is looking at it from a very funny point of view - like a hundred paces away. That is so opposite from how you are now. I guess your way is like to come to grips with anything that comes up and do that very directly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she also mentions that...with this little Gestapo game that she has to play with her family, that she's got about three different roles she plays: one at school; one at home; one when she is out with her friends. It doesn't seem to bother her. I just couldn't ever do that. It doesn't bother me that she does but I can't understand how she does or how she could even consider doing it. I suppose I do it to an extent but I could never make it a way of life - I might do it as a game. More than anything, what I am is more open with some people than with others. If I am going to be anything, I am going to be who I am - to one extent or another. But she does: she plays an entirely different role in different situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure: does something in that concern you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. I don't know whether it concerns me or not. It is like another example of her doing things in such a different way that I couldn't understand. It is why I couldn't criticize, condemn or accept maybe what I should try - or anything else - any other ideas because we just seem to come at it from such different angles. I don't know, I just hate to find anything about me that is phony. It upsets me a lot. But that's what I mean: that's not phony to her but she actually those different things in those different situations. (Chuckles.) Original idea, but I think it is more a game of semantics than anything. If that should be case then what would be the real her. Is it another role when I am with her?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, which one of the three, or is it a fourth? Or is there another one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or is she just made up of these three different roles - you never know if there is s real core. Like I said, that is mostly semantics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there is something that I don't see - what is it? Something that...sort of an edge I am picking up...something like, these ways stand out. They are ways in which you find it...it is hard enough for you guys to communicate as is but these ways she is making it even more basically hard because you just can't empathize with her. You can't comprehend them - they aren't you. What I am trying to say is it is a way she feels far from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not so much that I can't understand her roles. Like, if I were in a situation with her family...the problem is I have never been in that kind of a situation. If I ever got in that kind of a situation, I just stepped in the middle of somebody and left. My folks were never like that. I might have felt like they were at times but I know damn well that they weren't. I have pretty well lived my own life since I was her own age. So if I were in her situation, I could understand where...although I wouldn't put forth a role for them, I just would not be around them. I would just be less of me so that there is less for there to be conflict about. What I can't understand is that situation. She talks about the troubles that come up in it; the hassles - the emotions it causes - and I just can't understand. The first thing that hit me was just saying, "F*** it," and just walk away. Kick somebody in the face and walk over them. I just have no idea of what it must be like to try and cope with those situations. Just like I am sure she has no idea what it is I fear. We are just getting more and more alienated as we come farther and farther apart. 0:20:49.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess maybe that was what I was hearing: something like there are more and more areas of her that you can't get to and it seems like the same thing for her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I left last year, I was rapping to her then that two people can be in a very close relationship and should they separate...regardless of what she thinks, I have watched it in her so I know even what she thinks she is doing isn't true. People continue to evolve and so do their ideas and their missions. Although you still may feel a very close relationship with that person, it is more with that person's image that you remember, instead of what that person has become. And unless you can maintain a close enough understanding in the relationship, your images of each other start to come back, instead of straight across a time line to what you each are. It is back to what you were at one time that you remember. She poo-poohed the idea then that that just can't happen. Although she hasn't admitted it in as many words, she has written me and said exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she has gone back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I have struggled and done everything I can but I really don't know how we are going to over come it since we seem to have such sloppy communication anyway. It is kind of a beat the clock: which is going to win first? Will we get back together before we hit an impassable gulf between us or whatever. The thing that concerns me about that also is that I don't expect that easy to get back together. I mean, getting back together isn't going to cure it. It is going to leave us where you not only have the problems that you normally have when two people get together on a situation, but you are also going to have to make up for all of the problems that you have been putting off for two and a half years. You are starting in the hole and going down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sounds like you are not really sure the relationship can take all of that weight, or all of that problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am virtually positive it can't if things continue the way they are. I would hate to do it and I would feel bad about it - and I am sure Jessica wouldn't understand it - but I think I would end it myself next summer if things continue at this rate, not because at that point we don't get along but because I know we will have reached a point where that position that we are at is maybe comparable. That position - plus the troubles of getting together; plus all the time we are still going to have to go is just going to be more than we could possibly handle. As of yet, I don't see any sign that things are changing. We just seem to be continuing. We go steadily from one crisis to another. Something will happen, things will come back a notch and then slide back down, and come up again, and it will slide back down, and it goes about a three month schedule. It's March - it's about right. No, it's probably not that - it is probably about a two month schedule. It seems to happen fairly regularly: it seems to be polluted by about the same causes and about the same situations. 0:25:06.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What that makes me think of is, like, there is some knot in there that is wanting to be untied and as long as it stays in the knot, it just...I am not usually one for a one cause theory, but sometimes when there is one outstanding issue, things will happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We have agreed that if we could get together; if we could be together; if we could even see each other with some commonality; then I don't think we would have a problem. I'm just proud that we have made it a year and some odd months now. I don't think there are many people that have known each other for maybe a month and a half at the most that could do that. The fact even, if we were an above average compatibility relationship isn't good enough if it can't last the entire time. It is just going to make it that more painful to break up. The communication bag is just shot all to hell being separated by 937 odd miles. I can't seem to get her to write; I can't afford telephone calls - they don't seem to be any good anyway. I don't know if letters are but I know they do some good. This letter did a lot of good: it is just that it is three weeks late. But mostly, we just don't have the understanding that we should have. It is kind of strange that we hardly knew anything about each other for quite a while. Like after a year, we were better - we kind of feel like the oldest of friends. It is so strange: the relationship started not on the basis of knowing each other but instead on knowing that we were happy with each other and we went from there. And we have been right: we have been happy together. It is just that we aren't together and that isn't too happy a situation. 0:27:49.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's writing those notes (inaudible 27:53)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is kind of a two-sided coin to consider what seems to me to be an obvious situation - that the relationship is falling apart - in that Jessica seems to just take it on her added faith that it is not going to fall apart no matter what happens. I wonder if I am not being a cause by considering it. If I were just to take it for granted that a year and a half from now we would still be together - we will be together and it would be peaches and cream - would it happen? I don't think it would. I have been there before: I went with a chick for about four and a half years and we had problems that we just didn't bother with. If something would come up, it usually turned into a contest of harsh words and sulking and glaring and feeling mad and pissed off and hurt for a while, and then we would get back together and forget about it. We didn't really do anything about it - we just forgot about it - and eventually it did break us up. I think it is a completely different situation and problems here but I still feel the same way. The problems just don't damn well go away because you act like they aren't there. 0:30:46.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is like a principal of communication that you think is important, not the content of the problems or whatever - the way you deal with them</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I think the principal of communication is the problem in the main part and these other things are caused by the fact that we can't seem to communicate. We don't have any trouble getting along together when we can talk things out, even on points where - in the originality when it came up - we seemed to differ greatly. We work them out until they are perfectly acceptable, I think, between us. These things that we can't...just small things that build up - you don't bother to mention them or you don't put them in a letter - it is just built up. We eventually get farther and farther apart. You don't understand all of these small changes. They add up to where you don't understand a person in the end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that is the ultimate thing that you see happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you won't recognize each other in some psychological way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very much so. It is very seldom that a person changes drastically at once. I can only think of maybe one time that that has happened to me and maybe in a four month period. I was radically different - very noticeably - than I was before. It is very seldom that I see that in other people. If there were a sudden change like that, it is the kind of a thing that you are so aware of yourself, that there is no doubt that you could at least bring notice to it if somebody else didn't notice it - and do something about it. But this slow changing is the kind of thing you just take for granted - it is just being alive. You never consider the fact that you have to explain part of what living is to somebody - that you are changing. This is a change - you prefer to do something different - you are not quite sure about something that you used to claim as fact. 0:33:36.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you are saying, "It is slow but you have to keep up with it."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and it is also so general and expansive that with our shoddy means of communication it is inefficient in the least and almost improbable in the possibility, but not making an attempt guarantees it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So right now, from the way you are talking, it sounds like you are pretty pessimistic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well, I won't say pessimistic. I am super pessimistic about the way things are now but I think there can be an improvement can be made. If nothing else, I think that by next summer I will be seeing a lot more of Jessica. If there is luck, she may be out of the house. If not, I may be able to afford trips back to Boise considerably more often - although I shouldn't. There is no use saving money for the event that we get back together if we are not going to get back together. But then again, the problem is solved by something like that. It is a situation where we can cure the problem by getting rid of it but not by getting rid of its cause. I would much rather develop an understanding of communication - and then not have to use it!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I would much rather solve the problem as it stands now and then get rid of it. That way you have got both benefits and you are not only rid of the problem, you are rid of being vulnerable to the problem. 0:36:13.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is kind of like: so you have got to...well, I guess it feels to me like you have a good sense of what is the matter and what you need to do but I feel this kind of sense of frustration for you. How on earth are you going to get that across? That is where I feel blocked about it. Now as you tell it, how are you going to convey the necessity of this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We both seem to realize that it's the communication: I'm sure we both realize that is what is bothering us. I feel like there has got to be something done about it and Jessica evidently doesn't. If she does, she doesn't state it and she doesn't take any action on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And even that is sort of non-communicative. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's just like not answering means that. It leaves me to hold the problem from my end because at her end she just ignores it - it isn't there. It's like maybe if she were to say it, it is like there is a pole of problem between us. I am holding my end worrying about it and she says if you'll just drop it, it won't be there. I don't think that will work.</p>

<p>Does all of this make a continuum to you - from one time to the next? One session to the next? 0:42:23.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean do I see themes that run through that get taken farther and farther?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. In a sense I suppose I could take a crack at trying to say something about themes I hear again and again, but it doesn't seem to work with you or anybody else. You know, real systematic progression. There is an order to it when you look back on it or when you step back, and often there is forward movement but it is not...people don't always take up exactly where they left off and sometimes things get dropped for a long time. Like, it feels to me like...I don't know, people get into things differently. It seems to me that this time and the last time, you are into something in a different way now. I am not sure I could say how.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I was wondering because it is like a threshold or something. I come along, and such and such happens, and I come up every now and then, and you see that much of it, and you are supposed to guess what's happened all the way back to this one back here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are supposed to or I am supposed to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are: I have been doing it all the way through there so it makes a continuum to me but I was wondering if these different angles and different points of wherever I happen to be when I come in here seems to make any parallel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is interesting: it is like thinking about themes is not a thing that I do a lot. It doesn't bother me that you do a lot in your head. If I need to know something, I don't mind going with things that come above the threshold, so that I don't feel deprived of information or something. Like, sometimes I will ask you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, I was wondering like...I will come in here and bring up a new subject, like I am in a position where I am waiting to find out what happens with Jessica, I will come in next time and something's come up, I will rap on it - I will talk about it - and what has happened now will just submerge or come up in a completely different shape or color next time. Is there any connection between the two? Like do you remember this could come from that or that there could be a connection here in all of this? I was just thinking: this position here - looking back, I can think on other things that I have said and things like that. I don't even remember if they were here or not, that were along the same theme; the same ideas; the same situations. I was wondering if, like, you remember a session to the point where it's a continuum of it, or is it the session comes up - something comes up - and then you remember, "That is where we where and this is where it has come." Like, before I walk in here, do you have any idea of what I am going to continue on? 0:46:02.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no - absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not even from the last session then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, now, this is a little different. I would have probably laid a bet because of this situation - you were going home to possibly make a phone call - that you probably would have said something about it. But I wouldn't have - depending on what would happen - I wouldn't have necessarily laid a bet that you would spend all that time on it. I was maybe a little more sure of this, because this was something involving something coming to a head but I usually don't think about what people are going to talk about and I am sure that I would be a very bad predictor. It is like I don't...I just don't do that a lot and I guess I don't try and fit pieces and people together in my head. It sounds pretty disorderly as I am talking about it, but what it is, is more like just following the person where they are from moment to moment. If something strikes me from back there, I may fit it together in my mind and if I think it is helpful to the person I may throw it in, "Hey, from memory this sounds like such and such - does that make any sense to you?" But it is not a strategy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just thinking what it must be like to see somebody twice a week and have a very open session at that point and not see them at any other time. I was wondering just how clear an image you have of what their life pattern must be like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I certainly don't - probably - have a very clear image of the kind of work you do in your head. You are often talking about stringing something out. I can see that it is involving that you do a lot of psychological work in your head but I couldn't tell you what it was like. I guess in terms of your patterns: just what you tell me, most of...I don't know...in other words, I don't do a lot of inferring about somebody. I don't know how good I would be if I tried. What effect does all of this...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I wasn't asking for something: that was just pure curiosity. I was just wondering what it was like to see somebody from that side and wondering what they looked like from over there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's mostly...I think when somebody asks me a question like this, I am mindful why I started in this business. I was in a different school of therapy where you did more things like diagnosing problems; you put names on people's problems and calling them something; and you set goals for them - and you can tell that I don't think much of it from how I am talking about it - and you would tend to fit something together - you know, try to do that - because your theory tells you what to think a lot of the time. This one doesn't: the thing that (inaudible 48:59) tells you to do is listen to what a person is trying to tell you. 0:49:03.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 49:04)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean that is pretty much essentially what it is. So, you know, that means I work hardest at trying to hear what you are telling me and trying to do something with it now and not trying to make sense of you as a whole. That often doesn't strike me until somebody asks me. It sounds so disordered! (Chuckles.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is more to be found in random than in pattern. More to be found in the immediate pattern than in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The pre-set pattern. Or at least that is how I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is a method to the madness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I never, ever found a way that I like...by "I like" I mean gets across what I would like to say. When somebody asks me about, "Why do we do it this way?" or that kind of thing, I always feel that it just doesn't make any sense when you try to tell somebody, even though I believe in what I do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've read a little bit about the (inaudible 50:11) and I have talked to David quite a bit about it, so it makes a little bit of sense to me. The amazing part is this kind of interplay is the kind of thing that I used to develop and consciously work for when we used to have a rap session, no matter with whom or where, or whether we were straight or not. I was kind of surprised - and then a little curious - as to what the co-relation - now, this is just me; I am not asking a question - what the co-relation was that I should run across this and jumped into the middle of it at one point and then run into it in another completely different situation like here in an office with a tape recorder and it is all a set situation and it is supposed to be therapy etcetera. I used to do it just for the hell of it because it is fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it probably has something to do with you; it probably has, good God, it may have something to do with that David and you come from the same family and David came here and you came here - who knows?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mark and I are awful different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know you are - I know you are. What it sounds like is that in some ways, this is not very different from the kind of thing you are used to, so how come they call it something special? And not that you are putting it down, but it is just that one might expect therapy to be a little different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Your perspective on what is said is far different from what it would be in a situation where I would exchange ideas with someone - I can see that. The idea of putting forth an idea and have other people try to look at it and play on that idea, instead of responding to it with their idea, is the kind of thing that isn't new. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we will wrap it up. 0:52:29.8</p>

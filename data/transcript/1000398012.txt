<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Silence) Ah, I was just thinking of the fact that uhm, something that's been very much on my mind, uhm, the last day or two, but particularly, last night and today.  Uh, and it, and it strikes me just because clearly, it's not very important to me, compared to what else could be on my mind.  Uh, i, it's connected with FDO, and uh, my feeling that there's something that she's not, I mean, it's not that she's going around unhappy, but there's just something that she's not happy about.  And I don't know whether it's that she wants to be more a part of things than she is, or that I'm not keeping her busy enough, because she's uhm, I don't know, just somehow, things, she does the same thing FMC does.  And yet, FDO seems to do it much more easily, and uh, and anyway, then, she's living in, so she's around more.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>I don't know, but I just sense th,th, there's something that she's really not happy about, or, I, I, I don't know, I get this feeling, I have to appease her, or be nicer to her, so she won't be unhappy.  And yet I know that that's not the answer, whatever the problem is.  Because I think I'm being nice to her, anyway.  And uhm, well, I, I don't know.  But then I, it just strikes me that I'll think about that, uhm (Sniff), instead of thinking about, well, mainly MSCZ, and then to some extent, FSO.  And how the way I am affects them. </p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause) oh, and then also, I could think about what was a question to me yesterday, and what I suppose, essentially was a question on, uhm, Monday, although I think I got further in understanding it Monday.  Then I feel I repeated again yesterday.  But, th, the whole thing of uhm, (Sniff) well, playing stupid, I suppose, is basically what goes along with all of the things that we talked about.  But, I mean, I think of coming across my father with, not dressed the way he wants to be.  Never, with nothing on, but at least, not dressed the way he wants to be and uhm, my going to the table — I, I suppose that's where I mainly stop understanding — with a slip on.  And uhm, (Sniff) and then what I did at the BFM's keeps coming up again and again.  And uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Also, I kn—, I know this comes to my mind, because I say, just thinking about the BFM's at all.  And I don't know whether I talked about going to see MW's father in a different way yesterday, or if I mentioned this.  But anyway, just now, I was thinking about the fact that uhm, we did go to see him.  I think I did mention that we did go.  And uhm, (Sniff) just now, and I think, I don't know, I think I would have felt it was important for us to go, anyway, because I like him.  And it isn't that we've seen him a lot, or seen MW's parents a lot.  But we've always had a nice relationship with them, and I think they've always liked us for ourselves, and as friends of MW and FNI's.  And so I think, anyway, we would have t—, made a great effort to go.</p>

<p>But then, I think mixed in with it is this feeling that that is one way to make up to MW and FNI for that Saturday, or to say I'm sorry, or to excuse me, or to make them feel (Sniff) better about me, or I don't know, somehow anyway, to cover up that Saturday, or erase it.  Or (Sniff) uhm, in other words I'm, right now, I'm just thinking about feeling as if somehow, I used er, an unhappy situation.  Uhm, it bothers me that that would be part of the motivation, although I mean, I don't know, I don't suppose it changed how I was in the visit and what it did for Mr. BFM.  But uhm, (Sniff) but I want it to have done something for me, I guess is it.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, as you say, what you'd like to do is to be able to cover it up and erase it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause, Sigh, Sniff) Well, and of course that makes me think of u—, something I had a problem with that you said.  Although, I think I came to understand it again Monday, and then I, I went back to where I'd had a problem yesterday with it.  Uhm, of when I saw the rabbits, and then well, you're suggesting I didn't tell my mother.  I don't know what it was at this point you were actually suggesting, but I have the feeling you were assuming, anyway, I didn't tell my mother.  And it became very important to me to think that I had.  And uhm, maybe as a way to not understand what you were saying, I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yes, because the important thing was, that it, whether you told her or not, you were afraid to tell her.  Because you had seen something you shouldn't have been seeing, and that's sort of the idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, well, th—, I mean, that's part of it, uhm, that I'm denying that I was afraid to tell her, I guess when I say I told her, it's what I'm saying is, that I don't, at least I don't remember now being afraid.  And maybe I once told you I had felt afraid, or someh—, I've said something that has led you to believe I felt afraid.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) You did.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   But denying it now.  But then, the other thing I just thought of, uhm (Sigh) is that somehow a nei—, the neighbor who, I guess, had the rabbits, is involved in this.  And of course I know my mother knows, but I don't know whether she was the one who told my mother, or me.  Or, I mean, I'm mixing the whole thing up, and, and yet meanwhile, I'm saying, you're wrong, I didn't feel afraid.  And I don't know why I'd be saying that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   See, I think what you've been struggling with started with the  Sunday afternoon when you and MSCZ made love while FSO was left out, so to speak.  And the reason this is important in what it started without your realizing it, was the whole set of ideas that really referred to just the opposite.  A time in your life when, in fact, your mother and father were together in the bedroom, doing something, (Sniff) and you were left out.  You were outside.  And you had some theories about what was going on, and what they were really doing.  And those theories are indicated by your memory of the rabbits and the dogs.  What happened was that the dogs were trying to kill the rabbits. </p>

<p>PATIENT:   And I think your theory was further indicated when you acted the scene out with MW.  You did something and got him very angry.  And he had a tantrum.  So he was kind of like the dogs, really going to harm somebody.  And these are the clues to what your idea of whatever your mother and father were doing, really was about.  Something violent, something in which the man is cruel and brutal, and shouting, angry, hostile, or destructive, like the dogs.  And I think that kind of i—, th, those ideas were your ideas about what they did together when they were alone in the room.  And it's been part of your whole, unwitting idea of, well, not so unwitting, but your whole idea of what really, sexual relationship is all about.  It's a man attacking a woman.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Now, the thing I have to add is, I think the way you've handled this all your life, is to sort of completely forget it, push it out of your mind.  All these indications of things you're trying to do now, is just to deny what you know, or what you think.  I think what you're trying to always push away, is this kind of idea.  It sticks with you.</p>

<p>Mm, well I can s—, if I really think that, then I guess I would.  (Pause, Sigh) Well, I don't know, I, I suppose I'm mainly wondering 2 things right now, both of which might be kind of, well, I don't know, they just seem important to me, I'm not sure why.  One is, just wondering, well, why would I try to enact what I thought happened between my parents, with MW and me.  I mean, set that whole thing up, because I, I mean, I know I did.  I was just thinking now, that the way the bidding went, uhm, in any other occasion when I felt unsure as I, I really did feel unsure then.  But, in any other occasion, I probably would have passed, because of being unsure.  And uhm, anyway, I, I think I had the feeling that that was the thing I should have done.  And, and of course, I didn't pass, and that was what drove MW so mad.</p>

<p>But I don't understand quite why I'd want to set it up and uhm, play it out between MW and me, I, I don't know.  And then, then I was just thinking of so many times when MSCZ wants to make love with me, how I have to make him get angry with me first, before I can sort of give in and make love with him.  But then, I've always been thinking of that just as well, then I'm not responsible for the choice.  Although maybe I had that idea about my mother, too, I don't know.</p>

<p>And then that gets me to the other main thing I was wondering is, it seems like such a uhm, well I suppose, not far-fetched idea, but I must have seen or heard something to make me think that.  And I can't imagine what I would have seen or heard.  And uhm, and I don't fully, I guess, feel I, (Pause) I, I guess it is, because I don't get a feeling of myself.  But I don't know if I fully get a feeling of what you describe as probably my concept of what happened.  Uhm, because I suppose I'm wondering if I had that idea, then I'm wondering, well, what did I think my mother's attitude about it was.  And, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Good question.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   And, and I guess I'm wondering too, what, what did I see or hear that made me think my father was so much the aggressive and, and brutal one.  And uhm, and I guess I'm wondering too, if, I don't have a memory now of hearing my father shout, in connection with wondering what went on behind the closed door.  Though, I, I'm sure there are times when they fought, and he would shout.  But often he would do his shouting right in front of us.  And so I, I guess I, wondering if I, since that was so much the way I saw him with my mother when I was younger, assume that that would just continue behind the close door, and worse, because then the door would be shut, because of course, it would be too awful for us to see. </p>

<p>Uhm, of course that, then that leads me to think for my mother's attitude, that when he shouted at her i, in front of us, she always was very quiet and took it, and never fought back, or said anything, or uhm, so it was, I suppose, if, if I thought his shouting continued, I would assume too, her being sort of the willing victim, continued.  Or uhm, (Sniff) yet, I don't know, then I, then I think how one, there was one time when I was thinking a lot about my mother, and, and how I revised my whole feeling about thinking that she was the one who was so aggressive.  And uh, well I don't know if damaging is too strong a word.  But anyway, hostile toward my father, and, and that it wasn't my father toward my mother.  But of course, that was a new idea, I don't know that I had it, as a child.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>Well, then I go back to wondering, well why would I set it up at the BFM's ? And uhm, w—, I guess, what I was thinking, well, the only thing I can think of right now, is why, is just simply, if I'm curious about what happened the on—, I suppose I think the only way I'd find out, is to set up si—, what I think are similar situations, so that I can find out what happened.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then, that makes me think of my coming to the table in my slip is, uhm, I'm not sure this is what you were pointing out Monday, but in whatever that I'm having such trouble with.  But uhm, when I think of it just now, I think of it, well, I suppose that could have been another way for me to try to set off what I thought was going on between my mother and my father, if part of it was my father being in a rage, and shouting.  Because that certainly would get him in a rage and shouting.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But uhm, (Sigh) mm, I was just thinking that I'm still approaching this as, if I thought those things.  And, so I'm not really, I'm sort of holding back from really thinking I did.  Or uhm, (2-minute silence) well, I, I guess when I've thought of this, and then I've just kind of cut away from thinking about it at all.</p>

<p>Uh, because I was thinking that this w—, this uh, I don't know what word to use, but the way I'm holding off from thinking I really think these things, uhm, I keep thinking, well, the only way I could, I, I guess I have to get beyond uhm, thinking well, yeah, it makes sense, and stuff like that.  Which is sort of the way I am right now, to something that leads me into really, I suppose, recalling the feeling I had when I thought of it at the time.  So, it's as if I'm really directly thinking it again.  And uhm, so I keep wondering, well, what did I see or hear, I suppose, is the way to sort of jog me into directly thinking it again. </p>

<p>And uhm, and I, and I was thinking about that again.  And  then I just started thinking about getting ready to go to PTN, and the fact FDO's going to give FSO a bath.  It's the first time, not that there should be any problem, but just that it's the first time, so I don't quite know how FDO goes about it.  And uhm, well anyway, just i, it seems like really getting as far away from uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What about a bath?  You used to have fantasies when you were in the bath when you lived down in PNY.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   You mean, of being attacked?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Sigh, Pause) Yeah, well I, I guess I can see how uhm, because it was sort of uh, wondering if FSO would be okay.  I mean, wondering things like if FDO, there are 2 bathrooms she could give her a bath in, but in the one near FSO's room, the tub has a — because it has a shower in it too — a glass panel that uh, comes halfway along the tub, so it's very difficult to get at the faucets, and uhm, reach FSO, if she's in that tub, although you can.  And so usually I bathe her in our bathroom.  But I think FDO felt a little, or just, she wanted to be sure which one I wanted her to bathe in, I don't know.  But anyway, our bathroom has heat right now, and, and FSO's bathroom, the heat's turned off, because it's too much to have it on.  But if she were going to be bathed there, then it would probably be good, because otherwise the bathroom's drafty, and FSO's just gotten over a cold.  And so all these things are sort of leading into well, will FSO be okay?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But uh, why would FDO not want to be in your bathroom?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, I assumed she wouldn't, but —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) I know, why do you assumed that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Because of MSCZ, I guess, who's not home.  That somehow, that's I mean, like the attitude that I had about my father's bathroom, that that's an area nobody but me goes into, and MSCZ.  (Pause) Well, I c—, I mean, just for a moment I felt sort of, assuming FDO felt what I felt, in terms of uhm, my parents' bathroom, uh, of really, I mean, it was just, a place you didn't go unless you were sort of invited in, which would only be by my mother.  And then, always, I felt uncomfortable being in there, even though my father might not have been home.  So that I suppose, I was assuming the same for FDO.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, and then I got to thinking that my par—, I mean, I, I was, I guess I was wondering, well, what about a bathroom beyond that feeling, because that sort of uhm, I don't see the connection beyond just that was part of my father not wanting me to see him naked, or uhm, undressed beyond a certain point.  And of course, he would be in the bathroom.  And yet, my mother could be in there.  Because I also had a problem imagining my mother in there too, when he was.  Because he was so excited at any of us being near him.  Uhm, so I sort of assumed, well he must get excited at her seeing him too.  How could he stand to have her see him?</p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, then I got to thinking about the way the 2 situations are different.  I mean, both the bathroom in our apartment and my parents' bathroom was connected with the bedroom.  But my parents' bathroom also had a door into the hall, which we all had bedrooms off of.  Although, only MLWZ's bedroom was near the bathroom door, and then there was sort of a long narrow hall until it widened where all the rest of our rooms opened off it.</p>

<p>And uhm, our bathroom is sort of like, is a dead-end, even though it's well, in a way, in the middle of the apartment.  It's next to the dining room and you could have a door going in from the main hall, when you come in that all, the little hall for the bedrooms are off of it, and the other rooms.  But, but there's a closet between it.  So really, if you go into our bedroom, then you go into a bathroom, and, and that's the dead-end.  And you're furthest away, in effect, from anything.  So it's if you want to be private, it's the place you c—, you can be for most privacy.  And I was thinking of that, and wondering, well, is that part of it?</p>

<p>But then, I don't know, the fact that, in a way I felt that way about my parents' bedroom and bathroom, because they didn't use the door into the hall very much from the bathroom.  But it was there.  So generally, I thought of it as the bathroom being off the bedroom, and you were getting further inside by being in the bathroom.  But, uhm, I don't know if I'm quibbling because of the door into the hall.</p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) well, it just makes me think of the fact that uhm, (Sigh) I know I had a feeling of discomfort.  If I were in the bedroom with my mother, and probably in the bathroom, although I don't recall anything specific about the bathroom, but if my father came in, like, for instance, if my mother was in the bedroom just before he was coming home, and then I was with her.  And then, if he came home, or came in from outside, or in some m—, way, anyway, came from another place, so that it wasn't that I knew he was coming — maybe I would know, maybe that's why I wanted to be there — but anyway, I'd feel uncomfortable, and afraid, and that I'd better get out fast.  And of course, being in the bathroom, getting out fast was harder.  Because the way I think of it, you don't, I don't think of it as going out the hall door.  I think of it as having, coming, to come back through the bedroom.  And uhm, (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You notice how, right now, it seems to me, that the whole idea of playing stupid fits very well.  Because in a certain sense, that's what's going on right now.  You're able to ignore a whole series of things that are very much like the theory I just described.  You dropped the whole idea that you had these fantasies in PNY, that you were going to be attacked, sexually.  You ignore all of the fantasies that you've had for so many times and in the trains, that you're going to be raped.  You forget that you uh, had a bargain with MSCZ that he wouldn't try to have intercourse on the first night of your marriage.  You ignore that you thought of his erect penis as a fierce, angry, aggressive thing. </p>

<p>All of these kinds of things you're able to completely shut out.  And think gee, if you had such an idea, when there are all these indications, that that's exactly the kind of idea you've always had.  I mean, you know, not always, but you've had for a long time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then, the one you yourself brought up too, which is how for so long, so consistently, you had to pick a fight with MSCZ, to get him mad before you could go on and have intercourse, make love.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, well I guess, what I'm having trouble with, too, is uh, I mean, it might be a variety of things.  Because one is, I k—, I, I guess I keep thinking, well unless I can think of how I came to have the idea, then I won't accept I have it, even though there are all these different signs.  And the other thing is, a confusion over uhm, my clearly uhm, m,m, my thinking it must be that there's something terrible, and yet, also my seeking it out somehow.  Or I mean, like my having fantasies of being raped, and all.  On one hand, they'd make me afraid, but on the other, the fact I'd have them, I think I'm thinking means that somehow I want something along that line.  I want to be attacked.  And uhm, I guess that gets me back to wondering what my mother's, or how I read my mother's reaction, or if my mother's reaction, or how I read it, has anything to do with it now.  Or, I don't know, uhm, but I keep thinking, well, if I have this idea, then it would seem as if the last thing I'd want would be to have intercourse.  Or to uh, (Sigh) well I suppose superficially it has been.  But —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Superficially?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   No, I mean, uh, I have this other feeling, I think.  And uhm, I don't understand how the two work together, I guess maybe that's it.  Well then, I was just wondering well, I don't know how much just uhm, having a certain idea about my parents, and then feeling I have to copy it, is part of all this.  But that uhm, if I just have this fixed idea that's the way it has to be, however unpleasant.  So I try to make it that way, because that's the way it has to be.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Sigh) Well, uhm, I'm thinking about what I was just trying to say, and I don't know, uhm, (Sniff) well, I don't know if I'm just again, making it, being stupid so then I don't understand something, so I can't go any further.  But uhm, I mean, i, it just was coming, I'm just sort of coming to thinking uhm, that maybe I'm having trouble with something, because I'm trying to make it too much, all one way or all another way.  And there's a mixture of feelings, and I, and I keep thinking, it has to be all one feeling or another.  And then, if I think that enough, then I'll confuse myself enough.  So then I don't know something, and I can't go further. </p>

<p>Uhm, (Sniff) in fact, that makes me think that there was an element of that in, in the way I had trouble understanding whatever it was I came to understand on Monday, which I've now stopped understanding again, or conveniently stopped understanding.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How did you choose partners, that night?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   We didn't or at least uhm, it didn't seem to me we did.  Because uh, when we sat down, I thought we were going to sit down at the table, so that there would be a man on either side of me, or, and FNI, so that FNI and I would be opposite.  And at that point, there was no thought in my mind of bridge.  But as it happened when we sat down, MSCZ sat opposite FNI, and I sat opposite MW.  I sat down first, because we were serving ourselves, so as guests we went first.  And it was sort of, MSCZ and I sat down at the same time.</p>

<p>And, and then, MW was opposite me.  But a,a, again, I don't know, well w—, bridge hadn't even been mentioned, at that point.  And I really, maybe in the back of my mind, I knew we'd play bridge, but I wasn't really thinking about it.  And then when it became clear, because FNI said okay, now, you want to play bridge now, or she had some dessert that she hadn't served, or of right after dessert.  And it turned out, that uh, I didn't say anything, yet I didn't say — which I really could have done — well, I really don't feel like playing bridge.  Uhm, but MSCZ said, well, let's play after dessert.  And then uhm, somewhere, I don't know, when I began thinking of, I'm going to be MW's partner, but at some point, it became clear.</p>

<p>And even again, I could have said, well, let's draw for partners.  I could have said something, and I didn't.  Uhm, but I did think, oh no, because I know well, MW also bids in a crazy way, which I find difficult.  And, and then there are always situations, even if I'm trying to play well, where he'll get mad, because I normally make mistakes, like I suppose, anybody.  But then, given my attitude that night, and uhm, so I didn't, well, (Pause) it just seems when I think about it now, as if I were sitting here thinking, these things are happening to me, I don't want them to, but they're out of my control.  Whereas, I know they didn't have to be, at least.  Maybe I would have ended up MW's partner, but there were things I could have said, uhm, that would have been acceptable to say.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and that reminds me that, of just uhm, lots of times when I'd make MSCZ get mad at me, again it would be sort of the attitude, of well, these things are happening to me, and I have, I can't do anything about it.  And then, I would react by causing MSCZ to get angry, just like I did with MW.</p>

<p>And I can see where, from the way I saw my mother with my father, when he would scream at her in front of us, I would assume that was her idea of uhm, that there's nothing she could do.  And sometimes i—, I know, it did seem to me that fact that she didn't fight back seemed to enrage my father more.  That she would keep silent.  And I can, I, I suppose I see now, or maybe I sensed it then, it was almost, more of an aggressive way of doing it.  Because it was as if she was just thinking, well, it doesn't matter what you're saying to me, I'm thinking something else anyway, and I know I'm right.  So he'd scream more, and get more angry.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Maybe what's well, I don't know, I mean, even thinking, well, maybe that's how I understood my mother's attitude.  I guess what's puzzling me is why I would feel this was just happening to me, I had no control.  Uhm, particularly that night at the BFM's, where I know, I mean, where it's easier for me to think of things I could have done, so that I did have some options, or some control.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I guess, well, I was just thinking that, with MSCZ, and m—, I don't know, I'm not going back to what I might have thought with my parents, but just with MSCZ, it does seem as if I'm thinking, well, it's out of my control, and I have to make love with him.  Uhm, because of just some idea that well, if MSCZ wants to and really insists, then I have to.  It's my duty, or, I don't know, just no question, I have to.</p>

<p>But then, I guess my way of fighting, well it seems like, now I'm getting into uhm, thinking that I'm fighting, instead of thinking that uhm, it's the male being so aggressive.  And uhm, well, it's s—, I mean, I guess, or, I'm trying to make it too simple, too.  Because uhm, it seems almost like, well, maybe the way I wanted to hear what you said, when you were describing how you thought I must have thought about what happened behind the door is, uhm, that, that it was the male being very aggressive and destructive and threatening, and all that.  And the woman being very, my mother, being very, well, like the rabbits, h—, defenseless, and having to take whatever happened. </p>

<p>And now, I'm coming around to thinking, well, this was a way to fight.  I suppose, then it doesn't have to mean I don't think of the male as being aggressive.  But I somehow have this thing of i, if I'm fighting, that I have to thinking of MSCZ not being the one fighting.  Because in reality, I, I suppose maybe that's part of what's mixing me up, because I know he wasn't.  Uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So after we spoke on Monday –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I went home—well I told Franklin that I wanted to speak to him about everything that's been going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —when we got home. He said, "Sounds good." So when we got home we decided to talk about it. I was just really nervous. Just about if I would be able to say the right thing, if it would go well, if it would—and at first it was going okay. Then—and I was able to say a lot of things that were on my mind. Then we reverted back a little bit to him focusing more on the me issues that were brought up as opposed to the us issues or him issues. And then I kind of said something that I don't know if maybe scared him or made him—like something clicked—I don't know. [0:01:01.5]</p>

<p>But I was saying that one of the issues I have which is my tendency to blow up about things—like just get really frustrated. And you know like we talked about in my childhood like scribbling on math papers and all that. And that I've always had somebody to kind of like—I guess like act as a punching bag a little bit. Just having somebody there whether it was my mom or my dad or a close friend or a boyfriend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who cared about me enough that they're not just going to leave me alone to suffer with whatever I'm suffering with and want to help me. But what I end up doing is not accepting any of their words until everybody is really upset and then being like, "Okay yeah you're right." And it's all worked out. So I pointed that out and I said, "One of the issues that I think I might have a hard time—one of the reasons I might have a hard time dealing with this particular issue is because I've never really been single. [0:02:01.6]</p>

<p>Never been on my own in a place—been in a place where I've been on my own and had to deal with it by myself. I've always had somebody there to kind of say, "Well I can't. I'm upset." And that maybe in order to figure that out I need to be single or something." And was saying it more like speculation like kind of just talking with him and trying to figure out what's going on. And kind of thinking myself, "Maybe that's why." Because he was talking about how upsetting it is to try to bring me back up from these things and I don't listen, don't listen, don't listen until the point that he's down further than I am. </p>

<p>And then I'm willing to get back up and say, "Okay. Fine." And he was expressing how upsetting that is. So anyway I said that and so then for a little while we kind of discussed that possibility. Like is that what you need? How could we make that happen together? Blah, blah, blah. And then I don't know. [0:03:02.5]</p>

<p>I guess the ball ended up in my court at that point because he then kind of reverted on all this stuff that he had been saying. I asked him what he was working on himself and he pointed out working on reactions to me and making sure he's not saying things so that I'll misinterpret them and things like that. And I pointed to him that that's still about me though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's about you and that's great and I want you to work on these things but it's still about me. And so then I was able to feel comfortable enough to bring up things that have been an issue in the past. Like Facebook bullshit. Being really upset about the relationship status change thing and how what the fuck? Drinking stuff. Him not having friends and going out with his own friends stuff. Stuff that he's always been defensive and kind of been like, "It's not my problem. It's not a problem." [0:04:03.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he—I don't know. It was like a turning –. It was almost as if—I don't know. But it was great. It was great because he said, "You're right. And I'm really, really sorry that we had issues about this. I don't know why I do this. I don't know why I did that." And you know talking about the drinking. I told him how it upsets me. Like drinking before bed because I don't like the smell. And how it reminds me of my mom. And I don't—and I need him to be really sensitive to that even if he doesn't take it as seriously. That it's serious to me. Talked about him not drinking as much just because it's uncomfortable. And it's not good for him and all this stuff and money and whatever. </p>

<p>And it was really great because he apologized. He recognized things. [0:04:55.0]</p>

<p>He accepted my push to say, "I want you to go out even if you think these people are fake or lame or whatever. Just do it." We decided to just take the relationship status—the in a relationship thing—completely off of our profiles. Just because of the whole changing—I was just like, "Let's just leave it. Who needs to know our business?" Our friends that are on Facebook and our family that know that we're together know that we're together and whatever. And then we moved to talking about how we can really concentrate working on these issues as opposed to just recognizing them and saying, "Okay I'll change this. You'll change that." And then kind of then just doing everything the same. </p>

<p>It was almost as if we were able to push a reset button on our relationship a bit. And so we had that talk. And it was a really long and tiring and tear filled night for both of us but it was necessary. And the rest of the week has been wonderful. I mean—yeah I mean we've been talking about all sorts of different things we want to do. [0:06:17.7]</p>

<p>We've been looking up—I mean things that we haven't really done before. I think because we didn't want to accept that maybe we have to put in a little work to make sure that our relationship can work. And so started looking up date night ideas and making your relationship work ideas and stuff that I think we've been maybe nervous to cross the threshold of because it meant we were having serious issues that we wanted to resolve. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:41].2)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When it came down to it we love each other. We see our future together. There may be things that we find later that can't be worked out but we just didn't want to drop it just because of issues. And I think for me the biggest turning point was him finally recognizing things and not fighting me on everything. And not being defensive on everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And seeing that he has faults that need to be corrected and apologized for not being as patient with me. And apologized for putting pressure on me. And I felt really good. [0:07:22.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it looks like we're good right now. I mean I just feel like a weight was lifted. It just feels –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot more peaceful in the house. And we decided that in terms of chores rather than me getting pissed at the dishes I've piled up or that the—okay, Franklin, so you handle the dishes. You feed the cats. You clean the toilet. You clean the floor. </p>

<p>Okay, Trina, you do the laundry. You do the cat litter. You whatever—dust. And clean the sink. Like whatever. And even just like that—just like drawing a line and not saying, "Oh well I'll do it sometimes." Like literally I'm not going to do dishes. I mean I will obviously sometimes. But –. [0:08:11.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like this is your responsibility. That's my responsibility. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So nobody has to be annoyed at the other person for the sink being full of dishes or the laundry being wrinkled or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's our responsibility and just handle it. And that's it. And that's really helpful. I mean it's a small thing but it's really helpful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess just thinking of new things to do. Thinking of things that we haven't done together. Like maybe take lessons together. Look on Groupon and Living Social and see what kind of fun things are happening. Like for tomorrow it's going to be a nice day and we wanted to plan something to do. And I would've wanted to say, "Let's take a bike ride or let's go and hike around a little." My toe is still hurting a little bit so we decided on just going to the park, bringing a blanket, walking around a little bit, bringing some snacks, and having a little picnic. And I think even that will be really nice. </p>

<p>And talked about making specific date nights as opposed to just going out and having a rush dinner or whatever. You know making a date night. And literally looking at these online ideas and doing them because I think that will really be helpful and it'll help us discover more things that we might have in common. And also help us discover things that we don't have in common but that we can enjoy together. [0:09:29.3]</p>

<p>Like have a little bit more flexibility with spending—he says he really does want to do the belly dancing. And he really wants to learn. He admitted that—I mean I guess he realized that the reason that he gets tense at these things and acts kind of like, "All these belly dancers. Oh they're such show offs." Is because he is shy. He can dance, but he is shy in terms of new things and what not. And I talked about—of course it does make you feel uncomfortable and out of place but if we're doing it together. Just if we're going to be together or whatever but we also talked about the possibility of maybe taking a couple of private lessons that would help us kind of connect a little bit more with it. </p>

<p>And so I'm really excited. I'm really excited about—I don't know—like just kind of refreshing things a little bit. It just seems like we haven't ever—well not ever—but in a really long time made an effort to do things as opposed to just like, "Oh this person says this thing is going on. We should go to their party." Or "This night is going on. Maybe we should go like grab a drink." Making more like us things as opposed to just stuff. [0:10:39.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's happening. And just I don't know. Otherwise we've just—it's allowed us to just be a little bit more sweet with each other at home. And be a little bit more romantic. And it feels really good. Because I really didn't want to not be in this relationship anymore I just wanted to work it out. And I think I was just really scared about what the possibility of that was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm feeling good. I mean there is still work to do. But so far so good. And so far—and another thing we talked about is not holding things inside. So if something bothers me to kind of be able to just say it right away as opposed to swallowing it. And saying, "Well maybe it's not a big deal." And then it happens two, three, four times and it becomes an argument at that point. Yeah. There is a yoga studio behind our house that we never tried. And so we're going to try that together. And take a yoga class, which should be fun. I don't really do yoga but should be interesting. [0:11:49.7]</p>

<p>I guess a lot of the questions that I kind of was like looking to other people to help guide me with how to approach the situation were just things that I—again I think I was just too scared to bring up. And then once—I think it took –. For him I think that it was—I don't know. I think maybe he had to actually think about the possibility of breaking up and what that implies and what that means. And how that made him feel. And kind of made him realize, "Oh shit. I actually have to recognize some things in myself." And I think that was hard for him and it was upsetting for him. [0:12:47.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was able to do it. And I'm really happy and proud of him. And it was really good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. So we talked about the school thing. I told him that—I had been telling him before, "You know if you don't want to do it just let me know. Like I just want to know. I don't want to think you're registering for classes and you're not." Before I kept trying to kind of do that. And then this time I said to him, "I don't know exactly what's going on with the school registration stuff but I really would like to see you get a degree. I don't want you to feel like that's me nagging. Or when I'm asking about these things I'm nagging. It's because I care about you. And I really feel that even if you do want to make dancing or whatever a career that it's really important to have a degree. And that it will help you no matter what you do. I mean it will just give you that much more credibility and personally I think it's good because you'll learn more things. And kind of be more aware of how you speak and how you write and how you read and what you're interested in." </p>

<p>And he said, "Trina I really want to. I think I –." Whatever. I guess the issue with the school now is that the term had ended. And then another term went by when he was trying to figure it out. [0:14:10.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or dilly-dallying or whatever he was doing. And then now another term doesn't start till July. So right now he's working on reapplying for financial aid and figuring out if the other loans will roll over. Doing all that stuff. And so of course I said, "If you need help please let me know but if you're good to do it on your own then just get it done." Like just do it. Like I'm starting class on the 24th and I'm going to be super busy. It's going to be hard for both of us taking classes and doing work but we can make plans to go to wherever. The coffee shop or anywhere to do our work together. And that's another nice thing. It's the summer. We can go take our laptops outside. And he's going to do that. And I guess he had thought about—so he's doing his associate's degree now. And it's in business management, which he's not enthused about. I mean for an associate's degree fine whatever. He started it and now he doesn't want to do it but he's still in the program and should finish. [0:15:10.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he's thinking about maybe going to an art school—which I think would be great for him. I mean sure. He had talked about a university before just because they have a lot of options and it's right there near our house and all that which is also great. But you know if wants to go to the Art Institute go to the Art Institute. College is college. Do what you want. Really. And I was kind of proud of him also for seeing that, "Okay. If I have all these interests, how can I connect them to an education?" The Art Institute would be a great chance to do that for him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then as far as I go I mean I have a class. So that's starting. And that will give me a chance to see if I really want to go forward with the religion program or not. And I'm giving myself the freedom to be okay with if I don't want to do it. If I realize that I don't want to do it and I have to figure something else out or whatever then I will. And I think that I've pressured myself a lot to do this program because of the discount and the extension school. And I want to. But if I don't love it then you know I don't love it and I'll figure something else out. [0:16:14.8]</p>

<p>And we talked about my going out with friends. And if he isn't going out with friends that night he told me that, "I really want for you to do this. I think that I feel a little bit lonely when you're not here and I need to kind of figure that out for myself. And not make you feel pressured to come home earlier." He said, "But if it's okay with you I want to ask if it's okay that when you are out, if you're out for a long time or the whole day, I would love to have you send me some text messages to say hi or whatever." I thought that was really nice for him to say. Just because sometimes I do forget to check in. And if that's something that he appreciates then of course. Why not? </p>

<p>And another thing that I need to work on I think honestly I feel—I mean still need to work on them and I think that this is a good place to talk about some stuff that I have going on. But I think that just him acknowledging that he was pressuring me and kind of giving me a harder time than I deserved or need is helpful because it makes me feel calmer. It makes me feel less like I'm walking on eggshells at home. Because I don't feel like he's watching my every negative statement. [0:17:30.9]</p>

<p>Or how I react to every little thing and saying, "Well you're not working on that." Which I kind of felt before. And now it just feels more like I can—if I am feeling that way I can say to him, "Listen I'm feeling this way right now. I'm figuring out how to work through it but just so you know this is how I'm feeling right now." And not have it be like, "Well just stop." And maybe even getting some help from him. And that kind of thing. I mean I think that some of the stuff that I have—like the issue of getting frustrated and not really knowing how to control that—is still something I'm nervous to work on because I don't really know where to start. Maybe some part of what I said about not ever really being alone—so like always having somebody to react to. Maybe that does have something to do with why I haven't been able to figure out—I don't know. [0:18:36.5]</p>

<p>I mean because really it's always been my mother calming me down. And now Franklin. Or my father. And it's literally the same pattern. I'll have this temper tantrum. These people will try talk to me about how—why are you feeling this way? Or well let's figure out how you can do this. Or give advice about this is how other people might do it or whatever. And I literally fight it, fight it, fight it until the other person is just kind of like, "Well then I don't really know. Go have some crying." </p>

<p>And then once they do that—I don't know maybe I feel like abandoned or something because they're fed up with trying to give me advice that I'm not accepting or that I'm still being super defensive or negative about. And then I'm like, "Oh. Oh you're right. Let me calm down." And then they're so pissed that it's like, "Well good for you. But now let me calm down." [0:19:38.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'd really like to stop that pattern. I think it also affects work sometimes. Just feeling upset about things at work. And it was reflected in my review—I had a really great review and everything was (inaudible at 00:19:55].1) but the one thing that she pointed out was, "Trina when frustrated tends to handle things –." I don't remember exactly the wording. I don't have it with me. But basically it was about how sometimes when I'm frustrated it shows. And I don't—and my supervisor was very super understanding. She's like, "I'm the same way." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean we have the same issue. And we are very similar in that regard. But I would really like to work on that because I don't want to put myself through that. I don't want to put (boyfriend's name) through that, my parents through that. In the future my kids. I don't want it to be something that continues. I mean like kicking the couch in frustration and then having a fucked up toe. Like I did that to myself. I didn't have to kick the cushion. Like it wasn't (boyfriend's name) that made me so mad and made me kick the cushion. It was me. It was my own thoughts. [0:20:53.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And whatever. Clearly what I thought was a cushion. And so I think that this discussion has really made me feel better about being able to work on these things but it didn't really bring clarity as to how I think. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it still kind of remains. And I'm still kind of thinking about—I guess I don't even know how to start to think about it really. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that I had an even harder time starting to think about it with Franklin saying, "You know I don't understand why you've been working on this for three years and you can't figure it out." And duh, duh, duh. I think it was harder for me to think about how to do it when I felt that I had that attitude coming from him. And now that I don't I feel like I am able to think about it more. I just don't really know how to start. And I guess—I don't know. [0:22:08.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:22:11].6) (pause at 00:22:11].6 till [00:22:32].1) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. Go ahead. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No no. Go ahead. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to say I guess I feel like it's nice to have somebody there that loves me and cares about me and is kind of a cheerleader but I don't want to have to depend on somebody to be there to talk me down and let me have my temper tantrum. I don't want to have to go through all of that. [0:22:51.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause at 00:22:53].0 to [00:23:45].1) Well (pause at 00:23:45].2 to [00:24:16].9) I guess I'm wondering if maybe the things we were talking about last time— and it seems to me there are sort of two things you're talking about today. [0:24:31.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The first of which is how the conversation with Franklin went. And what made you feel so much better about things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about how it went made you feel so much better about things? That would be part one. And part two is—and how can you deal with the –. I don't know what to call it. Temper tantrum issue. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And last time one aspect of what you were talking about, to my mind, was sort of looking for other people's advice about what to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I imagine that each of these things may be a different facet of a similar issue. [0:25:40.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To do with—(pause at 00:25:42].1 to [00:25:54].2). Well let's see. It seemed that it was sort of that you were looking for advice from other people in part because it was really hard to think about bringing up the problems you were having in the relationship and consider the possibility that it would end. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As a result. You were really going to lay on the line because you were really upset about it. And you might lose him over it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was a hard thing to bear. And so I guess kind of unconsciously the strategy you were using to deal with that was to ask everybody else's advice (inaudible). [0:26:33.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which makes sense in a way. Of course. And then today I guess it seemed to me that as you were talking about the first part of what you've been talking about to do with how when you did lay it out there—what you were upset about—and really focused on the difficult part I think. Which was how he needed to step up and take some responsibility for his own stuff rather than turning things around and blaming you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me at least in one respect that was kind of maybe part of what had been hard to do before. [0:27:24.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what you felt really kind of a risk in doing for fear that he would just say like, "Fuck this. I'm walking." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But very happily he didn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he owned up to some stuff. And that's contributing to making things a lot better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you were talking about it with me it seemed like you were really relieved. And pleased with how it had gone. I guess I also sort of had the feeling like you were looking to me a little like, "Does this sound okay?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Did it actually go well?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "I feel good about it but is there something I'm missing?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which I think is generally kind of tendency—like you said—to seek advice. And just kind of –. [0:28:28.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that seems sort of in keeping—clearly there is an authority out there that knows better than you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Right. Right. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In this case I guess that's me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For some reason. And that you feel a kind of—I wonder if there is –. I mean the pattern from the other day was that you were doing that sort of subtly to cope with something else that was very hard to deal with. I wonder if there is something like that in this version as well. In other words, earlier in the week it was to cope with the possibility that you guys weren't going to be together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if there is something similar with this. Like if you have a worry that you're missing something. Again probably that actually points back to—"Well actually Trina it really didn't go as well as you think." [0:29:31.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "There is really this big problem and you really weren't paying attention to it." And I guess you must have some worry about that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think that I'm always—I guess I always just want to make sure I made the right choice. Yeah. Exactly. So in this case I feel really good about everything but it's almost like –.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe something's really wrong. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like right. Or was that stupid and I shouldn't have given it another try? You know what I mean? Which is ridiculous because it's—especially this situation. It's not like buying a car. I mean like, "Oh yeah you're really paying an arm and a leg for that." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my relationship. If I want to make it work and want to do all of these things that we talked about to make it work then great. Like God bless. If I don't I don't. And it's not really anybody to say, "Well Trina I mean you talked about all these things but I don't know. Like is he really going to do this? And the Facebook thing. That was really unacceptable. Are you sure you're going to forgive it?" I mean –. [0:30:43.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe there is a bit of that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's specifically related to maybe you're kind of letting this stuff go too easily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're being too optimistic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're not really sort of asserting yourself enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you're giving him too many chances. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that is what you're worried about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Even though I feel confident that that's not the case. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me like you feel maybe half or two thirds confident. Or that in a way you feel confident but you worry somebody else is going to see different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think honestly is really more your own worry certainly than mine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. I mean I can see some of my friends—I haven't really told everybody exactly what was going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they were at the height of the drama. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can certainly see some of my friends being like, "Well are you sure? Because of all these were really big issues for you. Are you sure? You were feeling like you might have to break up." So I think there are definitely some friends that will kind of have their doubts about is it really the right choice. [0:31:52.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Well I don't know. He did all this stuff. I didn't like the way he talked to you when I saw him that time." Or whatever. Even if I say, "We talked about those specific things." And how I don't want it to happen and all of that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I think another part of the looking for the like, right it's okay, does have to do with my own issues. Because obviously in talking about this stuff with him and what we're going to figure out with our relationship it implies that okay I have to really also work on stuff that affects me and my relationship as well. And so I think there is maybe a little bit of—I don't know—uncertainty or concern about that. </p>

<p>I mean I've always been the type of person—literally I'll buy a pants and I'll question for like three days or however long the trip back home from the mall is, "That was a good buy right? I mean they look good, right? I mean I'm not going to find anything better, right? Should I return it? Should I leave the tag on just in case?" I mean literally like I'm buyer's remorse all the time. And I mean I don't have a problem shopping. But I'll buy things and then question if it was the right choice. [0:33:06.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Even like weeks into wearing it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "This looks good, right?" I mean –.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. So this is a little bit of relationship buyer's remorse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe remorse is too strong. Maybe it's really more questioning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:33:22].7) than remorse. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And I think that's exactly what is kind of going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So there are—I think that there are sort of two main worries that we're talking about here. One of them was the one more from earlier in the week, which was the worry about losing him. The other one sounds to me like a worry about kind of losing your shit at yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you bought the pair of pants. You get home. You realize oh my God they were too expensive. And they don't look good. And whatever else. Like basically figuring out you fucked up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or deciding you fucked up. [0:34:07.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: At which point I think what you're really worried about is not just that you fucked up but that you're going to really get furious at yourself. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I get that's where the temper tantrum part comes in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess it seems related to me to the other stuff in that—it sounds like sort of like a little (inaudible at 00:34:49].3). Like if you get home and you realize the pants were too expensive and you put them on again and you don't like the way they look; it gets pretty black and white at that point. It's not, "Eh. Oh well maybe this wasn't the right call. And yeah the lighting in here was different. Or I really don't like the color as much. Or geez when I sort of think more about our finances—yeah it was a little impulsive to get them." Whatever. It's like you've done something really horrible. [0:35:18.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:35:20].3 to [00:35:40].2) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah like there is some authority out there that's making a judgment call. And sometimes that sort of sits on somebody else's shoulder. Like mine the other day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or sometimes it's kind of like just in your head. Like your sort of shopping judge or whatever. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But either way that's kind of like this almost separate, very judgmental part of you that I guess can react very quickly and very intensely. (inaudible at 00:36:17].7) And then I don't know. Maybe what you do with other people is like maybe you need somebody else there to help calm you down because you need to project that authority out again a little bit. [0:36:31.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know like when you're being totally harsh on yourself you need somebody else to sort of take on that increased stature and tell you haven't done such a bad job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. And I mean so like kind of recognizing that, let's talk about my father for a second. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this could very well date back to him—like literally nothing is ever enough for him. I think that we've talked a little bit about this before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that in childhood obviously it wasn't as pronounced as it is now to me. But I just think that maybe that has—I think he's always second-guessed everything that everybody has ever done. I mean he second-guesses himself. You know what I mean? Since I was a child I remember him saying, "Ah I should've just listened to my mother and just been a lawyer or a doctor or something." [0:37:36.9]</p>

<p>Whether it was my mother about whatever, some decision she made or me and Michael with lessons. Or me and Michael with schoolwork or me and Michael with Hebrew school. Or me and Michael with our decision not to go to the art opening of whatever he wants to do—not doing things with him. And so there was always this (sighs) kind of just second-guessing. I mean just literally everything was second-guessed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to this day I mean, "Oh you did your taxes at H&R Block? Well you should've checked online. Turbo Tax does it." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got mint chocolate at the ice cream store? Weren't you going to get cookie dough? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Just to a crazy point. [0:38:32.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean it's because he second-guesses himself. And it's because he's a mess himself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:38:36].1) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean everything. I mean like honestly the only thing that I can think of recently that he hasn't second guessed is my decision to take a job at the university and my decision to study at the extension school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But pretty much everything else. I mean it's just really difficult to deal with that. And I think that it's left scars. I mean obviously not literal scars. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Figurative. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that that is something to look at in terms of when he was that person that I had to look to for advice it was probably even harder for me to get out of those things because I'm looking to this person to be the authority. [0:39:30.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A father. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like who really can't because he second-guesses everything. So I think that may have an effect on why I have some of these issues. And I mean some of it could just be personality stuff and whatever. But I think that our parents affect us greatly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—right. I mean maybe there is kind of an innate pressure that I put on myself to be a little bit perfect because of Michael. And feeling like I kind of have to compensate for what he didn't do as a son. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of accomplishments and things like that. So maybe that also could have to do with why I'm so hard on myself. Yeah. And it's also just a lot of big stuff that is scary to take on. Like I got really upset at (boyfriend's name) when he brought up projects that I hadn't started working on in the three years that I've been talking about them. [0:40:50.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I got upset at him and kind of blamed him for putting pressure on me but I think it partly upset me because I want to do these things and I don't. Like for example simple things. Like putting things up on the walls in the hallway in the house. I mean or organizing my photos. I mean just little things that for some reason become kind of a mountain and I have difficulty starting. And then I become frustrated. And have a temper tantrum. I didn't get the pictures up on the wall this weekend but I planned to and so now the world is over. (chuckles) And I fail. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I guess I am not really sure why. [0:41:41.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it seems like it's kind of unclear. You know it seems related to some other things in your personality. It's not hard to imagine some places it could've come from from the past. But it does seem as though we—there's some stuff I clearly don't understand about how this works for you or what some of the sort of emotional issues that underlie this are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And so I'd really like to kind of try to work harder on them. Or try to concentrate on talking about it and looking at things that happened throughout the week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And seeing—I don't know—how I can figure out I guess some methods of –. I mean not necessarily like fixing it because there may or not be anything to fix. [0:42:51.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that sounds workable to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah I just think methods of handling it and working through some things so that I am able to lean on somebody for support but not look to them to make me feel better about myself or whatever I'm upset about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is I think going to also be especially important as we do kind of have our reset of our relationship and are doing all these things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to be a really big part of that I think is making sure we look at our behaviors. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I mean I'm certainly clear that this is more anything if not the main thing you want to work on sort of (inaudible at 00:43:42].8) in your life. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It affects your relationship. It affects how you think and how you feel about yourself. [0:43:49.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah work. (inaudible) I mean everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. But yeah I think it's doable I just have to actually think about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm. (pause at 00:44:06].2 to [00:44:23].8) Yeah (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:25].3) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess we can continue to work on that. I mean I think the one thing honestly though is to—one important step is going to be me really concentrating or being a little bit more cognitive or conscious I guess of not putting pressure on myself and of how I approach things. [0:44:46.7]</p>

<p>I mean Franklin said something to me last night. Like I said, "I feel like I have projects and I don't want to start it because I might not be able to finish it." And he said, "Well it's fine if you don't finish it. But let's say you want to do your scrapbooks. Start by making some piles of photos. Even if you don't finish making the piles of photos in that one hour that you want to put towards it at least you started it." Kind of things like that. Like not making things be so big. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yet again it's like you tend to recruit somebody to get in the way of you and possibly doing something (inaudible at 00:45:22].0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you do it sort of without really realizing that you are consciously meaning to but in a way that makes you feel kind of needy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And lacking confidence. (inaudible at 00:45:38].1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah. Kind of like inept or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more this time next week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good. So I will see then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care, Trina. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a great weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. You too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. [0:45:50.6] [End of audio]</p>

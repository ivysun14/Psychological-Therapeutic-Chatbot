<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The last time you were here two weeks ago we spoke about - you know just how sometimes the sparks flare when you're relating with people that you are acquaintances with, just happen to meet at the moment or people that you're close with that just happened in a wide range of situations. </p>

<p>And then we had spoken about or I mentioned to you just the idea of just trying to be aware of how you feel, if that should come up to you in the next couple of weeks. Is that where you would like to start? Where we ended or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's okay. I mean my sister was here and that's why I couldn't come here. And you know, she said to one of my aunts on the telephone that she was also talking about, you know, my business (inaudible at 1:35) and that she'd seen me and I was sitting right opposite her. She says, "Well, you know, it's just the usual thing. I mean it's - I just rementioned (ph) it with her completely and basically, yeah. I mean she just aggravates me all the time. Right in front of me she says this to my aunt on the telephone. I never even bothered to say anything to her afterwards about it except for the fact that, you know, she gets pretty rude. Plus, at one point she said - well, we stayed up late, had a long talk and again - and that was what she does. Something that she was like - unrespective (ph) of me. And then I said, you know, something about maybe how I had dropped weight from Jeff the last time and then he said why didn't she adopt the baby or something. [2:27] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, say that again. She was saying -</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were talking about Jeff, and I had said that Jeff had said why didn't my mother adopt the baby or why didn't my sister adopt the baby. So I said to my sister, you know, "Jeff even asked me why didn't you adopt the baby." And I was just talking a little bit about that, and then she said callously, "Oh, you know, I kind of feel sorry for him. I mean he did produce a life." No. And to me it felt (inaudible at 3:00) at the same time when (inaudible at 3:03) very elderly. And George had - I had stayed with him on and off for a few years and then he complained to my parents when I was a little girl and then when I moved back to the town where I grew up, you know, they wanted me to housesit and then somehow I just kind of became a member of the family and went down there a lot. </p>

<p>And then she got sick and was going to die of cancer, so she decided to die at home. So every week I would go down there for a certain amount of days and take over her shift to help her out or whatever, and then eventually she died. And all my sister could say to me was "Well, why did you do that for? I mean you were inherited, right? And I said, "No, I wasn't inherited." So I shared something (inaudible at 3:52)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A judgmental - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that's really - I mean well, where did that come from?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all, you know, why would that be the first thing that comes into somebody's mind and why - I mean that really is gross, I think. That's what she would do? [4:10]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does come into her mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I'm saying? And then you respond. And what I want to do, if you feel comfortable with this, is to talk about what you are feeling. Go back to that moment on the phone, which just happened - when was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last Friday or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Friday night, okay. Let's go back to that moment when you - because your sister had just said something quite judgmental with you and in front of you, almost like acting like you weren't there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then knowing full well that you were there, so difficult situation. What were you feeling? I'm just - what was going on inside of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know a lot of it really in the most traumatic case from -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You mean during the week. That's not the one you really want to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I really want to talk about happened about two afternoons ago, whatever. I saw a friend of mine who hadn't seen the baby yet and was very excited about me seeing the baby and, you know, there was some time that he happened to put about the whole issue and I've known him for years. And he like really came down on me (inaudible at 5:36) you don't even have a tone phone. I said I know I don't have a tone phone anymore and I don't need a tone phone and the pulse phone is $3 cheaper a month than the pulse phone now. And then he like - to get to the phone he dropped something that fell off like this, a card or whatever that I - where I keep my phone numbers. And there's like one of those cup of noodles things. He's like "Look at this." I said, "Well, that's what I normally eat now. I eat this and I go to the market and get the baby meats from the butcher." And he's like... And then finally he said, "You know, Christina, this is getting extremely tiresome. I mean there are many people in situations like this, and you know, what do you want to do? But you know, I don't really want to hear about it anymore." [6:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He didn't want to hear about -</p>

<p>PATIENT: The fact that I wasn't like - I said "If you expect me to be frivolous and - " I mean we laughed and then he went off (inaudible at 6:46) or whatever. But why should I lie about my circumstance, or if it annoys him that I have a pulse phone, well, then I'm sorry that's just the way it is right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what happened to you when he -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I just totally - and that was really - and I started crying and I said, you know, "I cannot believe you're talking to me like this. You know how sensitive I am right now. You know how difficult it is for me, and I don't see why I can't be honest about the situation. I mean you remind me of memories of my family that don't want to hear about any of the realities of what I'm going through. You know, if you're supposed to be my friend, then be my friend." He goes, "Well, why don't you just stop sobbing," instead of not coming straightforward out and saying my life is shit and help me, instead of that, why did you just put innuendos saying how bad everything was."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you - what was that like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said "What am I supposed to do, you know? Start sobbing on the phone every time I speak to you? Oh Peter, help me. You know, you're the one that's here. You're the one that's trying to use the phone. I didn't ask you to use my phone and find out it was pulse. I didn't ask you to have to push aside my cup of noodles, you know." You know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So all of a sudden he was saying - he was frustrated somehow, and you felt frustrated back and angry at him back for his frustration. I mean in some ways  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say that that was part of what was happening? He was expressing somehow a frustration in the relating and maybe even a disappointment? It sounds like to me that felt incredibly difficult to hear or receive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it's like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like "Why do you even have that point of view? Why are you laying it on me?" I mean in a way it was like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, another friend of mine who held my hand throughout the birth process and then afterwards when I say something like - I said "Anna's getting upset." She goes "Well, are you sorry you had the baby now?" I mean I don't need to hear that. I'll never be sorry that I had the baby, of course not. I mean the baby's here. What do you think? She's sorry that she had the baby; a horrible thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After you had the baby she -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a fight with Jeff, and then I told her about having a fight with Jeff and then she said "Are you sorry you had the baby?" And this is someone that saw the baby come out. I mean how could anyone say that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this is what's going to be tricky about this therapy, because - or maybe you are  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not expressing myself correctly? I'm not like laying on the floor saying "help me"? I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no. Let me get finished on this thought. It seems to me that while there might be more than one reason why you've chosen to come here and talk to me, you know what I mean, and one of them is that, as we talked about before, that somehow the tension and stuff applying to people in your life. And last time you said you just sort of felt sad about that. On the other hand, there's a part of you that looks at what's being said, and it sounds like maybe sometimes you're wandering from me, "Well, how would you respond? I mean can you believe that, that they said that?" [10:36] </p>

<p>And so there's kind of two sides to this, if you know what I mean; one is "Maura, can you believe these people are out there saying this," and looking for maybe some validation that this is ridiculous. The other is [a bad you] (ph), you know what I mean? </p>

<p>And my response to both of those things is that whatever people may be saying to you, see, I don't really believe necessarily - I mean I can't really do anything about what they say, you know what I mean? They're just not here. The only thing that you or I could really work on is how you respond to these different relationships, these different conversations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I turn the fan off?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Go ahead. So I do believe that people are saying it because you're telling me that they're saying it, that you've seen, and that people are capable of saying a lot of different things at different times, you know what I mean? I don't - so I can believe it. The question is, there's something about what's happening that it's hard for you to believe that somehow, "If you care about me, how could you be saying that?" It's kind of what I'm hearing you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, then Peter says, "Well, you're not paying any attention to (inaudible at 12:13) so what if that means I can (inaudible at 12:15) what he's saying. You know I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's a practical issue, whether you pay attention to it or not, but you're having a very strong emotional response.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. I can't help it. I've always had these issues with what people say. I've always been very sensitive. I'm overly sensitive. I'm [not your] (ph) old friends right now than ever. And it's each little statement (inaudible at 12:43) pays attention to me. I mean you know what is that kind of function that I have if I can't feel deep down that it will roll off my back? The garage attendant calls me stuff like "bitch," that would be an awful thing for me. [That's why I get them to be like close relationships is people treating me nicely] (ph) even if it's totally dysfunctional, even if they're treating me much too nicely for having just met, maybe I should (inaudible at 13:14) that they're your buddy-buddy from the first minute but they're really not close to you at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So people treating you nicely, you're kind of magnetically drawn.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But then they're really not being nice, truly nice, they're just trying to get me. That's why I probably (inaudible at 13:37) these like very shallow and fun level relationships, and then on the other hand, and I mean it meant more to me - I'm like having such a hard time with is going to be happening in my life that I did something I would never do. I contacted somebody that I would never even come to the range of contacting, because I'm really in a bad situation and I have to use every contact I have. </p>

<p>So I can't believe what it felt like to call them and for the receptionist to say, "Well, who are you or what is this about," or like even know you or whatever, and then to get him on the phone right away and then "Where are you, how are you, da da da da da." </p>

<p>And then I went to drop my resume off there yesterday, and again, "Who are you, I don't know when you might be in the building, I have some visitors, (inaudible at 14:34) and then to go up and then to hear the receptionist to say "Well, okay, thanks. (Inaudible at 14:40) here's the baby, I want to show him the baby." So she said well, the workplace. And she calls me back and she tells the secretary or whatever, you know, there's this woman her and she wants to show him the baby (inaudible at 15:01). So then the secretary comes back and says now, Okay, but she thinks (inaudible at 15;08) who are you and doesn't even know you or that business. And it's not like I've seen him in five years or whatever but he does know me.</p>

<p>So he immediately comes down (inaudible at 15:20) and I'm just like - you know, I almost started crying when I get to the elevator, because I didn't want to keep him or anything (inaudible at 15:29) just said I brought just my resume. Whenever you get a chance then call me (inaudible at 15:34) and talk to me about it (inaudible) and then I left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the crying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean the guy was like someone you know (inaudible at 15:51) huge position, but right before (inaudible at 15:58) even opened and it's like really - you could just see the cast going on. For five minutes while I was there and the fact that you know they've taken (inaudible at 16:07) respect and then there would be a [cut out] (ph) like that minute. And I haven't seen him in like five years and it's not like we've been hanging out together at all for the past 20 years. But I did have a scope (ph) when I was nine years old. It's just like it's a huge deal for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Please remember me if you really -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. But how do I know whether it actually is for you? Maybe it is nothing. Maybe it's only being polite, because you know, I'm one of the few people that he's known as long as (inaudible at 16:50) together. But he haven't really known me. It's not like you see each other or anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What just happened? You started to feel something, and then you said "How do I know what it is for him?" Well, tell me about that shift, when you were feeling like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because it's as if - I mean I kind of feel hurt that (inaudible at 17:12) too, that like you know, that he honestly - maybe he wouldn't go out of his way. Maybe being polite is something he knows how to do and that's how he got to the position that he had. But if I really ever asked him for something maybe - you know maybe - I mean there are people that do things for people and it's very easy for them. How do I describe it? "Thank you for not breaking the leg." I found out he used to be - we started out as actors together and then he became a huge director and now is the director of the Art and Gallery Theater, which you know is (inaudible at 17:56) and in my mind. [17:58] </p>

<p>And 10 years ago they were in L.A. and I found out they were in L.A., I heard them on the radio or something so I called him and I said hi and then he said "Oh, I didn't know you lived in L.A. Just call the box office and tell them how many you'd like to have come and how many people you want to bring and that's fine and just tell them I told you it was okay." So you know I mean I must have taken like 15 people to the show, which you know, it's not anything for him. I mean it's nothing. It doesn't take him any time. It's nothing he has to pay for, it's nothing. So other people might think, you know, it's nothing. It's just like it's sort of this thing over that way. So maybe he is capable of doing just things like that which don't really take anything from him, you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're wondering if there are deeper concerns that isn't just this kind of sort of this level, what you'd do for an acquaintance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But would he do it for an acquaintance? I mean I don't even know the guy so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, you don't know, right. You're wondering how he does this stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is he available for me for -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't feel I have people available to me for the real - you know, the real thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 19:28) real thing? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like understanding what a difficult time it is, you know, coming over and like bringing a pot of cheese (ph) under their arm and saying "Let's just sit here a watch TV." She's probably sick of being with the baby alone for the next 1700 evenings by herself. I don't know. How come I don't have those type of things? Or you know, either that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is he going to be able to be nurturing of me? Would he be available for that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, to all of the things that he was, we haven't said more than three sentences to each other at any one time over a year so at any given time maybe I run into him once every five years. So but why do I hold those types of relationships like why do I hold out, for instance, like he is the one last thing that I had hoped for? One, because it is legitimate that I would be good to work in the ballet company they worked at, but why do I always do that, like before I came here - [20:51]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that? Back up on the question because I want to stay with you and I'm just losing track for one second. One moment you were talking about sometimes you feel so strong a desire of nurturing and so longing and sometimes so desperately that sometimes you wonder if somebody who, like someone can, how nurturing would he really be of you? Would he take care of you? And then you say why do I do this? Why do I put this on this person I haven't seen in five years (inaudible at 21:38) Let's just talk about your - what does that feel like to you when you wonder that? You ask me how and why do I do that. [21:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know how that works. I mean if always in my lifetime that has always worked out would he because, you know - I mean for instance I had a crush on a boy in school. I moved to Chicago. He comes into a place where I'm working and I immediately know that we're going to be going out. I mean how do I know that? How do I know that here I had a crush on somebody like four years before. We were in (inaudible at 22:19) Amsterdam together and I run into him in Chicago. And then how do I know that Jeff Daniel's father, you know, somebody said "Oh, you've got to meet him, he's the greatest, da da da da da," and then I have him checked out. A few months go by and then, you know, it's like if you could have a luncheon and invite him to the luncheon and it's my birthday or whatever and how did I know that - how do I know that when somebody says to me I have worked as in a very, very small capacity on a movie, I talked to the producer, but I came back to Chicago. I worked for a company that had been folded, so I didn't really have a job and I had unemployment for a few months then. </p>

<p>I just said to myself, well, the guy has given me the name of the person to contact in Chicago so I'll just (inaudible at 23:13) And I hadn't even called the woman and I went away for the summer and I told my mother that I was working for that company when I got back and I had no idea (inaudible at 23:23) even talked to the manager.</p>

<p>And I came to Chicago, and again this whole thing (inaudible at 23:32) it was like (inaudible) situation yesterday. I procrastinated, I procrastinated, until almost the whole month of September had gone by and that appointment had [become a black day] (ph) and I then I called and the woman said "Well, we don't have anything but why don't you come up and meet me anyway, I'm Rose." And she said, "Well, I don't really have anything." And then I went away for two days and I came home and she had hired me. [23:57] </p>

<p>Why do I do this? Why do I like put all my - like I'm sure now that somehow either I am thinking that I mean you offered some kind of job, everything's going to work out there and that's the end of the story, or you know, can (inaudible at 24:16) get married? We've known each other for almost 30 years. Why don't we end up getting married and you know... He came from a family with 10 brothers and sisters and he was raised in Connecticut. You know, he comes from a good, solid and - you know, his father has a baking company. I mean why isn't he the one? All this time we've been waiting now you know... I mean this is my thoughts about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that somehow, one way or the other he's going to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Save the day into one (inaudible at 14:47).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you start feeling desperate somehow this idea of being saved by somebody else comes into the picture.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And usually it always happens. I'm not saying, but whenever I have like this premonition, you know, that - I mean how was I sure that I was going to be going out with Jeff? How is that sure that I was going to go out with him? I mean how am I sure if I make this decision and then all of a sudden, you know... It's not like I do anything to get him. I mean I don't do ridiculous things -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, for it to happen, yeah. So sometimes you wish very hard and it is just coming out -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wish kind of like in a weird way. Because why don't I just like - why isn't it easier, you know? Because other things have not worked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it not easier?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why do I have to like wait until the end? Why, why didn't I, the minute he became the director of the - why didn't I six months later say - call him up then and I wasn't desperate and say, "You know what? You're the artistic director, and you must meet people that you feel comfortable with and now you (inaudible at 26:04) and then I say that, why did I wait until like Jeff is going to cut off his share of the babysitting and I'm going to run out of money and blah blah blah? Why am I like - [26:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you get yourself into a desperate place and then you have somehow to be helped? And when you're feeling stronger and not so desperate, is that how you were going six months ago -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost six months. I mean six months from when he became the artistic director, I'd say about three years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Three years ago. So you're wondering how is asking for help somehow connected to the desperate place that you've got yourself into? How come you're not just going on thinking about your career and development without these feelings of desperation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean why do I go on with this babysitter until it gets so bad basically my friend, who I was reading her book yesterday so I had her meet me at the children's museum so she could answer questions. She took one look at the babysitter and said, you know, "I wouldn't trust her with your child, that babysitter. I mean I wouldn't get that babysitter. I mean there's something not right; she's hostile, she's not listening to a word you say, and on top of which she's like a space cadet."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're wondering how come I'm staying with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Why do I wait until it like gets so bad that everything I say to her is just like this disdain because I can't stand her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you just get so frustrated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's a breaking point for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you might say to her what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean every day she comes in, the first thing I say is you know you told me you did this, you didn't do it. [28:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You said you found that; you didn't find it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're just kind of like pointing these things out to her, thinking that, what, that she'll change, or no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I told her 20 times to please not wipe - when the baby does ka-ka on his like 17th little item for the day, do not soak them together with like red things. You know, then they get ruined. A white turtleneck cannot go in with red pajamas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then that's what she -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything was wrong. Oh (inaudible at 28:32) I didn't think it would (inaudible) "The mere outcome is you can ruin as many of your own clothes as you want, but in here I can't afford to just go and buy the baby new things because you ruin the clothes (inaudible at 28:45). You know, it's not the first time I've told you. You know that it doesn't work out." And this morning I just said, you know, if you wouldn't be so lazy about what you do... Well, you know, that's a really rude thing for me to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're so frustrated and you're so much wanting her just to be different but she's not going to be different. I mean from what you're saying, you told her 30 times and she's basically saying "This is what I do and I'm really not changing." But you're wondering how come I stay with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, it's her last day but you know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, I'm still accommodating her. She wants cash and I'll say that makes me have to go all the way up to the bank and blah blah blah. I mean, you know, like the whole thing is a pain in the neck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But have you told her today is her last day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told her (inaudible at 29:33) weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That today was her last day? And you have someone new that is coming? So how did you get yourself to do that, to tell her and to get somebody else? I mean I've kind of heard you saying that you kind of wanted to see yourself act maybe in a more effective way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I wanted the other person to start last week but she couldn't so that's why I had to pay someone (inaudible at 28:59)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how did you do that? How did you get yourself to kind of make this change with this person? [30:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 30:06) choice of time and then I just have them try out a day, kind of see how they might be like and - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you just said how come (inaudible at 30:19) very annoyed. But now you're telling me more about the story which is you kind of started to take action several weeks ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long ago did you take this action?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything's really started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there wasn't much lag time between when you realized it wasn't working to when you started looking for somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. She hasn't worked in the beginning like she was cheap and I thought she liked the baby but like (inaudible at 30:47)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in the meantime you started to look for someone right away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you started to take action pretty quickly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you interviewed and it's a long process and you think you found someone that you like more and you told her and now she's leaving. So I'm wondering as I'm listening to this, what's bringing you to be critical of you in terms of "how come I'm waiting until the very end?" It sounds like you dealt with it right away but it took time to deal with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, how did I even make that misjudgment? Why did I hire somebody for my baby that is so incompetent? I mean who knows, you know. Why am I trying (inaudible at 31:25) and it's like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you think that somehow this should have been picked up right away? [31:28]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible at 31:30) I just I mean why did she work (inaudible) the woman I picked, she's not the be all that ends all of my existence and I think that maybe that's a good thing because I don't think maybe my judgment is that great and the person that I would think would work out so great I and the person that I was (inaudible at 31:45) wouldn't work out so great. Somebody who I think is just okay but - who I believe takes the responsibility fine, I mean see I - this is where probably she's going to say that (inaudible at 32:02) you don't have to love the person that is working for you. And here I think that she's going to be like a sister to me or she's going to be like my mother or the baby is just going to be like a shining star; every time the baby sees the person, they're just going to radiate with joy, you know, I mean why do I want that? That's kind of working by (inaudible at 32:27) I want a working mother full of - not just mediocre. </p>

<p>If I am going to a job it's still not my work. My work always since day one, unless you're living and breathing it... I mean I was trained as a actor/singer/dancer and you know, even if I took a job at Denny's, I would want to be the best person that worked at Denny's. Now why in the hell would it make a difference what work I did at Denny's? [33:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it would to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because either you do it correctly or don't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you feel like that towards other people when they're performing or they're doing something that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If she doesn't care about the job she shouldn't be working at it. And if it's all about money they shouldn't be working - I mean this is what I first said. Here I am living on a cup of noodles, really walking places because I didn't want to spend the money, and yet, you know, I still go to (inaudible at 33:36) and I'm like - well, I mean I shouldn't ask, if I really like flowers, that I won't get it. I always feel like if (inaudible at 33:47). I mean I think that's how (inaudible) got those in my life because I'm too nervous to ask for anything to be compensated now. Or I like push such a thing you know - if it says to be paid $100 an hour then (inaudible at 34:03) get $100 an hour, but I bring it up in like a weird way so nobody wants to pay me $100 an hour. [34:09] </p>

<p>Like the last for sale contract I did I underbid myself for one contract. So when the next contract came up I said to the guy - I wouldn't say anything, and then like a week before the shoot I said, "You know, by the way, I'm not accepting the same compensation as I did on that other one" and that turned out to be legitimate and it's the going rate and I expect to get that. </p>

<p>And so "We never talked about this and I'm not paying you that and you tell me this a week before? Why don't I just get somebody else?" "Well, fine if you want somebody else." He's like "Well, who am I going to get a week before we're supposed to charge?" Then he just was just furious. He had so much animosity towards me when we were shooting I thought we weren't even going to be able to make the take. I said "You know, the circumstance is different; I'm pregnant now. I can't accept low range. You either pay me the real fee or I'm not working." But somehow it didn't come out right, and somehow it was wrong from the whole beginning that I didn't have (inaudible at 35:21) there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What made it wrong?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he shouldn't be trying to scam me to begin with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The people - so that's what so interesting is that it sounds like to me like for example in this situation you're not getting a response that you would have wanted which was you know that he said, "You know what? Yeah, this is the going rate and you did good work before and yeah, I'm going to give you the (inaudible at 35:47).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In your hardest heart. But what you really wanted was a non-conflictual (ph) negotiation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so when there is conflict and someone doesn't see it your way and only sees it their way because of their selfishness, there's something that strikes within with you which is - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean why did I even have to justify the fact that I have a baby now that I have to take care of? I mean it should be - why should there be -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you know why? You know why? Because people aren't going to offer you  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean even when I took the baby to Mike's yesterday I'm -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, stop a second. What did it sound like to you and people are going to see it their way? More often than not, perhaps is what you're me from your experience, that people tend to see it their way and not your way. The tendency is there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm not good at showing people my way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what my family always says; that I never explain something correctly; that people never want to hear what I say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That somehow it's your fault that they (inaudible at 37:00) that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That somehow I never can present myself correctly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is all about (inaudible 37:05) correct.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And whatever I need my newka (ph) I never ask for them in the right way so that's why I'm (inaudible at 37:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even a boyfriend in my -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whoa whoa whoa, wait. I wanted to stop - I need to really do - just because there are so many examples that you have that as a listener I just need to slow it down so I can kind of make sense of it all. How does that feel when I say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Somehow when you don't get what you want and there's a conflict, you have an idea some of the time that Christina you did it again. You asked for it wrong. If you just would have done it differently then this would have gone your life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think about that. I just think somehow something (inaudible at 37:57) maybe happened there, something wrong happened. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something happened wrong with the other person, or something happened wrong with your presentation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't really think that far. [38:10] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Something's not right - because one of the things that I'm going to be trying to help you with and that's how I'm going to try to slow some of these examples is because it's important to try to understand what's happened in these interactions. I don't really know. I mean it's probably not one thing for all the interactions. Just because there's conflict often doesn't mean that it's all stemming from the same thing. You know what I mean? I couldn't make a global statement about every single conflict that you've ever had, but you have some idea after the fact as to what went on. You know, after the fact you start wondering - it was me in this case or the (inaudible at 38:58) in this case. </p>

<p>What I'm going to ask you to do during the week is try to be as aware of the - kind of how you're feeling at the moment with people so that we can try to understand that it was happening and can happen. So that we can understand more that your own emotional response was not just this hypothesizing the fact that we're throwing out theories. I want to try to help you understand you as you're in the moment. And we'll work more on that in the next few minutes. We can go over some ideas about that between now and next week (inaudible at 36:36) able to learn more about you right in the moment of the emotions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my sister had said that (inaudible at 39:44) which (inaudible) that was the only thing heard in our household and (inaudible at 40:00) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, (inaudible) this is about how do I get people to do it my way? And your sister has a strategy which is just say more please and thank you, and you haven't said any of that. Maybe you don't like ask the right way. And I really don't know what - in my way of thinking, it's not like a magical style that that needs to be applied across the board and everything will go your way. Some of what we're talking about is how to manage life when it's not going your way, when people stubbornly refuse to see it your way but they see it their way and you've got to be in there negotiating for yourself and hanging on somehow to the part of the relationship that works.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 40:57)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So (inaudible at 40:59) something happened. That when someone sees it their way that the relationships get severed. It's like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's somehow the conflict doesn't get tolerated and worked through. It's kind of like you're the enemy, you know, you're the enemy. And it just - there's separation.</p>

<p>So the way I look at this is that something happened where people wind up being enemies because people are thinking differently, you know what I mean? And "If they would have just seen it my way they wouldn't be my enemy." Well, what are the chances really of most people that you're out there communicating with seeing it your way just because you say please and thank you or just because you act nicely? What are the chances?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I did ask nicely they probably would, which means the whole thing -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. If you expected this man to say - "Well, please, I want more money for this, please." What are the chances because you told him please to do it that way after asking nicely - sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. [42:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Often life's just more complicated than that. People have budgets and they're going to - they have their goals and they're going to try to do what they think is going to be best for them. And somehow you're telling me that when people have their goals, like your sitter has her goal, which is "I want to do it my way" and somehow when people kind of get headstrong in their goals, these conflicts come up and (inaudible at 42:49) and the relationships just end. It's like no way of stating there was a conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what I don't understand is how I end up still making people so mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean what are you the enemy of? Let's just talk about that. Because during the week chances are, again, that there's going to be tensions that will arise in relationships with somebody and your chances are it's because seven days, your chances are that someone might not see it your way. You know, whether it's the grocery store or it's in the store... What I'd you to really try to do is - I don't know if you need to write it down for yourself when you're in a moment but I want you to try if you can to notice (inaudible at 43:55) when you're in the middle of the tension, try to see if you can focus on "What's going through my head right now? What am I feeling? What is this about for me? What's my experience in this? Am I feeling trampled? Am I feeling misunderstood? Am I feeling unnurtured? Am I feeling discredited? Am I feeling bullied? Am I feeling like I want to explode? You know, am I just full of rage?" I mean what's the experience? And try just to allow yourself to notice your experience. Just try to notice it. Try to be with it. Try to kind of accept that you're having it. [44:42]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I know what's happening in regards to if somebody somehow comes off incorrectly or whatever and they give a bad impression and then just (inaudible at 44:53) anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's them, Christina. That's an example of what they do to you. That's an example of what the (inaudible at 45:05). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but what am I doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I want you to notice. I want you to notice your experience in the moment. You might say to yourself, "Well, what was I doing? I was needing something. I was feeling incredibly desperate. I was -"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but for instance me telling (inaudible at 45:24) that she is so lazy and that is the reason why she keeps on ruining the baby clothes, is that going to help me at all? Is that going to help her not ruin the baby's clothes? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: is that effective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Obviously not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So somewhat effective is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know how to be effective at all. I mean I'm a terrible manipulator.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what I want to do is ask you for starters because you really want to know "What's going on with me, what's going on with me? What's for me to like get such a short fuse that I think somebody is too lazy? Is this less going to make them want to be - cooperate with me?" [46:05]</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all, it's the truth and why can't you just be honest with somebody and say, you know, she's not pulling the wool over my eyes. I mean I know why the red's there and not the white; because she didn't want to do two sets of pants (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So on one hand you're saying you kind of value this concept of honesty; that you really want to say, "Well, why can't I just say it like it is? You're lazy." And there's a part of you that just feels like in those moments, well, I'll lay it out here, because you're really my enemy. You're really not cooperating with me so I don't have to really care about your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So at some point when someone becomes really just kind of like not even worth while to you, you just kind of let it rip.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I want you to do, and again, I can sense from your feelings what good is this going to do if I'm aware - if I'm more aware of myself? You're kind of saying to me - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know - I need to know how to avoid saying things that are not necessary to say and that are not helping the situation at all and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you want me to be able to give you a strategy for that, and I'm telling you that part of the problem with that is (inaudible at 47:28) is being mindful of what happens in the moment, because right now you have automatic responses. It sounds like you're too - you're conflictual moments in your life that you have these automatic kind of almost it's like reflexive responses where things just spark out and you might be able to follow a (inaudible at 48:02) or because it's so important to say this. But in order to break this automatic response we're going to need to slow things down, really slow things down for yourself to the point where you're not just quickly responding but you're increasing your mindfulness as you seize the moment. You're looking very tired. [48:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am. Well, I think that helps a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With the baby, yeah. I wonder if I say that as a [self starter] (ph) but I don't have - </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 48:48)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Does it feel like pressure then (inaudible at 49:00). </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I just I can't remember anything anymore. I don't know what happened. I mean like an elephant memory and now. I mean I try to send someone's name that I've known for my whole life and I'm like (inaudible at 49:17) and fallacy that I can't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what makes you think you're not going to remember? Because it's interesting, you remember a number of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't remember what you just told me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then all of a sudden it kind of faded out (inaudible at 49:29) bank on 79th Street. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow you've been - it's interesting, Christina, because for me, my experience about it is that there's a lot of intensity there; why am I doing it? Why am I doing this? And then as soon as I'm talking about something that's not so kind of quick and easy and not so emotional - </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 50:04)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just kind of gone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I mean? I mean all of a sudden it was like, well, ahhh, wrong answer Maura, you know what I mean? It's like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not quick and easy, but like I'm not good at tai chi either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not good at what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not good at the slow, even - well, this is like my whole life. I don't have any relationships with (inaudible at 50:27) maybe and then once a week and then year after and - nothing in my life has ever gone like that. I said I went to Tokyo, I went to Tokyo.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That quick. That quick. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to learn a language, I learned the language.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the decision was that quick but how - when you went to learn the language did you find yourself learning quickly, once you made the decision? Did you pick it up quickly or was it frustrating for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm dealing with and I got frustrated with the Japanese.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How many letters did you learn? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 51:08)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just have to apply yourself and study hard or just kind of sit back and one day you woke up and you knew how to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 51:18)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean did you have to concentrate on it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 51:23) good at concentrating. Like I wanted to be able to balance (ph) for five minutes and have a balance (ph) for five minutes, I practice every day and (cross talk) If you don't remember you can practice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you made a decision that you (cross talk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I made a decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm finding that now, that you haven't really made a decision to really work on that in this way. What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean if somebody told me okay, now learn how to balance, actually the first step in learning how to balance is that you have to go in and out of the door 17 times and walk in a straight line before you can practice balancing. And I would say, "Forget it, I'm not going to balance then." You have to like go to the bar, balance (inaudible at 52:15) well, I can't. And first I do 20 seconds. Then I do 30 seconds, then it's 40 seconds, then I do a minute and a half. You know I mean it's not quick and easy. That certainly is not -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 52:30) easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like maybe I don't understand how might it say (ph) to help my problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, so you need to know ahead of time. You need to be convinced ahead of time before you involve yourself rather than find it from your own experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could I have said that would convince you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible of 52:50) present itself that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I can't prove to you that you have an experience, that you're going to have an experience. Like when you're sitting back and saying, "Well, before you get me to do this, prove it to me. Like you do all the work, you know? Like convince me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Cross talk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, in this area it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not lazy. But I don't do something unless I know what is going to happen with it. If somebody says, "Okay, just put that (inaudible at 53:33) in a ball, I'm like, "Well, what is that going to say to Christina (inaudible at 53:39)?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, convince me. and my sense of that, when you say that to me, is I'm hearing your sadness and your feelings of desperation, and again on the other hand what you're saying to me is "before I go [in this first instance} (ph) prove it to me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't try - yeah, why should I? I mean because so many times people say things and then it can hurt you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, some of this is the risk is (inaudible at 54:15).</p>

<p>PATIENT: The risk is that for me I'll be wasting my time doing that and it won't (inaudible at 54:21) and then -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then just let it happen. Let's say you go along this week into the next few weeks we're trying to practice something (inaudible at 54:33) and you find out that you're still not seeing any benefit to it. Who said that that happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It just seems to me that that's really not fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you might have to - that you might end up putting some managing (ph) into something that you (inaudible at 54:54)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it's like - kind of guess it's like kind of contact lenses. I have been to contact lens doctors ten times with different contact lenses. Now when he makes me try them on and they feel uncomfortable there is absolutely no point in going home with those contact lenses. Why did they make me go home with contacts and you say "Well, maybe (inaudible at 55:15). They're not going to get more comfortable, you know. I know; I'm not stupid. I wore contact lenses before. You know, I take a very difficult prescription. So why is he wasting my time? It plucks (ph) my money (inaudible at 55:27)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is like some more things like - you might be asking (ph) a waste of time. And what I'm saying to you is that I respect your choice completely. It is your -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is there something else you can think of that I could -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just stop a second. I respect your choice that you may decide that you don't want to take the risk, and that is your choice and I respect it. I mean there's no have-to here. There's no rule that says you have to go and do this. You know what I'm saying? There's no like formula in that way where you're forced into having to do something. It's your choice whether or not you want to (inaudible at 56:16) a risk or not. And I can't prove to you that taking a risk is going to be worthwhile for you; that would be borne out of experience. I can't tell you ahead of time that your experience is going to be with something. It would be kind of rich (ph) whether or not you want to take the risk or not. (Inaudible at 56:35) know today that right now you're not sure you want to take care of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I really can't remember what I'm supposed to do. I mean I tried to stop my conversations before, before they got any animosity in them and I just can't do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All I want you to do right now is try (inaudible at 57:03) if you can to try to focus in on your experience of your own emotions. What goes through your head? What are your thoughts about you, about what you're wanting, what you're needing, what your frustration is. Try to stay with yourself rather than just kind of responding to the (inaudible at 57:33) by speaking out or just try to stay with yourself, just try to be with yourself. Or even after an episode, if there is an episode with tension, try to stay with it rather than try to justify it in your mind. "Well, of course I had to say this -"</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm just annoyed all of the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I want you to, if you can, pick some moments and try to stay (inaudible at 58:11) and try to understand yourself. Try to be accepting. Try not to push away anything. So you're the person necessarily who you - the experience, the emotions, just try to have it. Maybe we should pick something less charged than the anger, because that might seem less confusing. Maybe we could try something else, try to see what it's like for you in the morning to be with yourself as you're walking down the street, maybe try something pretty much charged. What is it like for you? What does the air feel like on your body or there's some thoughts going through your mind? What is it that you're seeing? What is it that you're noticing? Are you feeling pleasure? Are you feeling sadness? Just try to be with you as you kind of sensate as you have your experiences in the morning. This therapy is really about you as you're trying to negotiate and navigate life [59:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, which I obviously don't know how to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the only way to begin to do that is to slow it down and get more mindful of you so that you can begin to take apart the change and the chain reactions that you might have and emotions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 59:29) started to cry (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 59:34) for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's happening for you now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible at 60:07).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to give (ph) that sadness a moment (inaudible at 60:15) for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that part of you (inaudible at 60:34) alone and sad. Yeah? Sometimes it may be just lost in (inaudible at 60:47) that you might be feeling this - some very deep sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 60:56).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 60:58) to the choice which is deciding that this is a journey that you want to embark on and you might - it seems like it's going to - you know, that there's some strong feelings there, or maybe not. It might not be the time that you want to do this and that's your choice. It seems like it's slowing things down (inaudible at 61:27) that are not being addressed in this fast-paced style, where things are just getting discharged and so some of this journey is going to be about feelings, some very intense feelings that are not necessarily anger feelings but other kinds of feelings. But the anger -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Cross talk) positive so that when I go home I'm a better mother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. you're asking me to help you with these sparks that are flying all around in your relationships with people and the tension that you have with people and the conflict and the enemy-making. You have come in, and after therapy, after each session, are you going to be leaving soon really happy? I can't tell you yes. Because some of therapy is about understanding and learning about other emotions that you have and learning how to respond to them differently. And if you're going to hide these emotions - wait one second - these emotions, these emotions of sadness and loneliness are somehow eclipsed by some of these other emotions [put you in the angle you're in] (ph). Then if you slow things down, you might be more in touch with some sadness going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 63:00) I can only come here and kind of share something and then I'll be (inaudible at 63:07) those things because I don't want to have a whole week (inaudible) of chaos to myself (inaudible at 63:11) going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 63:14) emotionally tends to be. I can't promise you that all that's going to happen in 45 minutes to an hour is that we're going to touch things but at the end of the hour we're going to somehow fit you back together that you're not going to feel anything during the week and that you'll come back in for 45 minutes and that will open things up again. Most of your life is spent outside of therapy and most of the opportunities for work on this will happen outside of therapy. And in here I'm going to have to try to facilitate change and help you to make due with that work out there (inaudible at 63:55) during the week.</p>

<p>So it is going to mean that for the rest of it that you choose to be (inaudible at 64:05) experiencing things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like how many other (inaudible at 64:08) talk about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As far as I know, for me it's fine. You need to check with the person responsible for this particular project to proceed, that's okay. I mean I don't have a problem with that. We're going to need to end. I think what you might want to think about between now and then is this idea of choice. How open, how desirous do I want to be to this kind of practice, this kind of thought, because it's not going to just be coming to the session for 45 minutes, it's going to mean opening stuff up to different types of experiences during the week. And you'll be feeling some feelings that are difficult while learning how to respond to them differently, and that's a choice for you. And I would respect that it's not a quick choice, but it's a (inaudible at 65:18).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because (inaudible at 65:21). I don't know. I do have so little time anyway this summer. (Inaudible at 65:43). The week goes by and I don't know, I'm just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something for you to consider. There's time being spent on this conflict and a lot of energy being put into things not working out. So really it is a choice of trying something different and seeing where that leads you. So it is something to think through, and I respect that it's a choice. I would also add that the way things are going, certainly it's very time-consuming and very innovating for you. It's not like one option is a big time saver and the other will consume time. (Inaudible at 66:30). It's different. It's seeing therapy a little bit differently than perhaps you might have been thinking of it, which is "I'll just go to my 45 minutes and I'll be on my way." Normally just sitting in therapy is much more than that; it's kind of commitment being open to other kinds of experiences out there -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know but I - you know - and the divorce (ph) is the prime thing. You're going to go pick up the baby and da da da da da.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're making some predictions about whether (inaudible at 67:00) you're already very upset.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I'm saying? It's not - again, it's not like "Well, one way I feel great and the other way -" It's really not around how am I going to use this time and energy that I'm putting into my emotional life anyway. Do I want to invest in a different way and try something different, or do I want to keep doing what I've been doing? And again, I respect that it's a choice, but you know it's not easy to think through. And I'm not going to strong arm you in any way, you know what I mean? Because I do respect it's your decision and it's your choice.</p>

<p>So would you agree that you'll think about that this week, concept of choice in therapy (inaudible at 67:50) working or not? Is that something you'll think about this week, between now and next session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean I'll think about doing what you said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I'm not like so adverse to anything. I just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll think about the emotional exercise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And at this point as we're talking are you feeling like you remember what you came to do here with regard to emotional exercise? Are you feeling more connected to what I had been suggesting you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So next week, 12 o'clock, and I'll see you then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye-bye. </p>

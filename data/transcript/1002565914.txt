<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, whatever you say.  You're so interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] research.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I try to help out when I can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't.  Not for my own profession, and it's a shame that more people [INAUDIBLE] don't, um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it, it's pretty hard, you know, in a lot of ways to do this because you have to have, um, so many, um, um, there are so many hoops I guess you have to go through to, um, to do things, uh, ethical, legal.  It's just a hassle.  I feel that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I have to set my alarm.  Is your clock right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, I'll get you out of here.  Is 9:00 okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nine o'clock's okay.  Promise?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I was just sitting out back.  I saw you pull up.  I said kind of stay out as long as I can.  I used to sit out front sometimes, but then all kinds of people come by.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've seen people and I've left before heading towards the bus station right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I don't know, but, uh, it gets kind of annoying after a while, people looking for money and whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I barely made it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got here.  I got here.  I overslept this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?  That's not like you.  You up too late?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yep, but I've, my alarm clock broke in my bathroom, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've had to use my cell phone and I forgot to push enable.  Oops.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm here [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has it?  You got a full day today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Tuesdays are full, but not, Tuesdays I'm driving all over the place.  You know, I finish with work at 3:00, and then I meet the bus, pick up the boys, come back, do a job in the house, go pick up a child, you know, it's just back and forth, but it's done at 5:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Is that good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because for a while, it seemed like you were working, um, my hours, too late.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep, on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get done about 7:30, 7:45, but, um, it works for me right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's good to be [INAUDIBLE] you know, see some of my patients back to back, and I'm dead at the end of the day, but I'm done and use my time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what part of town is your home in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, heaven forbid, I can't live anywhere else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, is that it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh absolutely.  Started out in [DEIDENTIFIED] and moved up to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've considered rebelling and just moving to [DEIDENTIFIED].  If I didn't have to uproot the kids, I, I would love to do that, but I'm not.  That's one of my like dreams, like oh, just go buy one of those new houses—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In one of those developments where they all look alike, little plastic houses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What schools are they, uh, moving towards then, uh, high school eventually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] but right now [NAME OTHER] at [DEIDENTIFIED].  You know, [NAME OTHER] in one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then the higher level classes seem to be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And everybody else [INAUDIBLE] you know, middle school, but it's all right, and he's learning cuss words.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's learning bad words.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He can watch that, see that on TV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I mean he could.  It's, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You could, but he, you know, the only cuss words, unfortunately, he's heard out of my mouth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my Dad's mouth on the tennis court, but he's learning a lot, asking a lot of questions, and he doesn't understand why people call each other motherfuckers.  Mama, what is that?  Even honkie.  You know, he's learning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is an MF anyway?  I mean, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  Anybody that says that or uses that is obviously ignorant because they don't know what it is.  It doesn't mean anything.  What is it, but, you know, he's analytical, concrete in a lot of ways, but analytical as well.  He doesn't understand why students want to disrespect the teachers.  Why?  Why in the world would you talk ugly about a teacher?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are great teaching moments for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, try to get it into his head, and go that's a good question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's, what's, you've obviously thought about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, tell me what you think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take notes and let me know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but he's, um, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice that he can talk with you this open though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were fortunate to have that good relationship with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's had people calling him gay, nerds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.  He almost got in a fight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have no racial stuff there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd like to say not, um, I know sitting on the basketball stands during basketball games when my nephew played sixth, seventh and eighth grade, there was a nice mix with the parents and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think that's because whites are minority.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  He was the only white boy on the team one year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how old is he now, the nephew?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's a freshman at [DEIDENTIFIED], but anyway, my kids [INAUDIBLE].  I can't move him to [DEIDENTIFIED].  They're comfortable and I'm not going to do that.  I'm not moving to [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's a nice little fantasy that I can enjoy sometimes in the middle of the night when I can't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but then you got to put up with the high schools out there.  I wouldn't be excited about them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and there's, you know, there's disadvantages in every school.  I mean I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're just huge, plus the mixing out there [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, see [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] was at [DEIDENTIFIED].  There's 300 students at [DEIDENTIFIED].  There's 300 students in the sixth grade in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I wouldn't uproot them from their schools unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's all this talk about uprooting and moving them about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my, you know, that's my nice little escape world of, you know, being completely independent.  That's just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, I thought that fantasy world would be out of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I like my job in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I really do.  [DEIDENTIFIED] a long way away and with the [INAUDIBLE] as soon as you cross the river, you're in another country.  I mean if you cross that river, that's, that's far enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would like to live further away from my in laws.  They are a huge problem, have always been, and I'm sick of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They won't always be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last week we had a family funeral.  [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] Dad died.  He was [AGE].  That's old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is, and [NAME OTHER] parents both lived in their upper 80s and upper 90s as well.  That's not, that's not very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I guess I wasn't thinking about their demise.  I was thinking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About, uh, other things that, uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm thinking about how, what's it's going to be going to be like, and do I want to take care of them, no.  I really don't.  I don't want to care of [NAME OTHER] when she's old.  I don't want to do that.  I told my sister in law that she's [INAUDIBLE] unless there's a drastic turnaround, I am not going to be around to help her take care of [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There must have been a, a change here since we talked last anyway for you to be even talking about this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's been a very rough 2 weeks.  It has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry about that.  Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, no it's been good.  I mean it's been a good rough.  You know, I feel like I'm moving further along in the grief process of what's not to be.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean the accepting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe moving further along.  I don't know if I've accepted it completely, but I think I've acknowledged that there's still a little part of me that goes hmm, you know, I lived with [NAME OTHER] this long.  If he could make some major changes, then I think I could do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's like about 2% of my thoughts out of 100%.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  That's the fantasy too, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If only.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've, um, I don't know.  I've just, I've just had a, well several things happened in the past 2 weeks, but you know, it's kind of locked in some thoughts and finished, put some closure on some things that I've kind of had going in my head.  I did go, you know, I told you that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], the marriage counselor, said he thought I needed to go to this other counselor within their practice, and I did go see her, and I liked her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the first thing she said when I walked in, see she and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] completely conferenced and shared everything.  First thing she said is you need to put the oxygen mask on you before you do the [INAUDIBLE] and I thought I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] says that too.  I like you.  She's kind [INAUDIBLE] little woman.  Her desk was a mess.  I liked that.  You know, I immediately felt connected because wasn't this little neat freak.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stole my anecdote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She stole your anecdote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She read it in the same book, but it is common sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There was no book.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  It's common sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just thought about it when I [INAUDIBLE] once.  I was sort of wondering why they said that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said you have to take care of yourself and we need to figure out how we can do that for you.  I don't know if I want to work with her or not.  I need you to help me decide about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you can't see 2 therapists.  You can't see her and I.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, and I don't know that I need that.  I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd be too confusing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you could do whatever you feel comfortable with [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, but one advantage there is that she's talking with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I've had one session with her.  That was enough I think for her to get my information so she and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] can meet, and [NAME OTHER] meeting with him this week by himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I'm not going to joint sessions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, you know, I just, yeah, I'm done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you had the final one, didn't you?  Didn't you have one since we talked last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't?  You were going to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were going to.  [NAME OTHER] canceled that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, some stupid excuse and then he met with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] to discuss the results of his evaluation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] like went over the whole report with him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Step by step and they didn't get any further, so he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Going to meet with him by himself Thursday, and then we'll have a followup with all four of us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And the purpose of that is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what I told [NAME OTHER] because, you know, that's, I want a decision.  I want some progress.  I want us to all come together and say okay, look it is what it is.  This is what it is.  This is the accountability that [NAME OTHER] needs.  [NAME OTHER] you got to work on your own stuff unless you step up and do that on your own.  You know, because it's not going to be me and [NAME OTHER] working with the marriage counselor.  That's stupid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He has too many issues.  We've worked for a year supposedly.  There's been no followup.  We go meet with him, there's no discussion between the two of us afterwards about what we've talked about.  There's no, it's just nothing, and I need more than that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your marital counseling, do you have, um, in other words when you kind of started and did you have specific goals there were set forth and did they give you kind of homework sort of things to work on and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You come back and go what progress have you made on this and that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We didn't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I set forth very clearly I am not going to initiate this.  You know, [NAME OTHER] I think this communication model that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] recommended is great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd love to use this with you if we talk about some things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I am not going to initiate practicing using with smaller issues like he does.  If you want to practice, you do it.  So I was kind of going in reverse.  You know, here I am going to marriage counseling and then I'm like you take the initiative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think he needs to.  If he wants to continue to be married to me and have a relationship with me, he's going to change his ways because we don't have a relationship.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like a line in the sand, doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does.  There's no, it's, it's just, it's hopeless.  I, I don't see that there's going to be anything different.  I've been real ticked off in the past week because [NAME OTHER] had to take an antibiotic that the doctor told him he cannot drink.  So he has not had anything to drink in a week and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] he's, he's actually talked to me.  He's clear headed.  You know, he's, he's more of the [NAME OTHER] that I remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  That much difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, he comes to talk to me.  He, he's more, he's just clear, he's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well he gets like that when he drinks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean he still gets silly and stupid [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's been a difference, and now he's taking Adderall.  So, you know, he's fixed it in his head and in his parent's mind both, and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that helps him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really think it does.  I can tell a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it doesn't change who he is, but, um, you know, and, and I think that part scares me because oh hell, now he's getting better, and he's going to be on the road to improving himself and I have to hang on for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is what you wanted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  So how stupid was that?  That would be my, that would be kind of my realization in the past 2 weeks is oh hell, look what I've done now.  This is what I wanted.  It's too late, or is it too late?  You know, like okay, there's that little tiny seed maybe, but I can't do it.  He's got to do it on his own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're listening to that voice in your head too much, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That OCD voice is pretty strong.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.  It is, and [INAUDIBLE] in good faith past 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You really need to recognize that every time you hear it, cut if off and do not respond to it because that'll only encourage it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so when I think oh, he's not going to get any better, just stop it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	OCD is illogical, correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We agree with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, you know, whether it's checking or washing or whatever, the repetitive doubts and all, it's pointless, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what about the part of really needing to stop and reflect?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doubting doubts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Well that's all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Reflection is different.  That's not obsession.  We're talking about repetitive, irrational, um, pointless discussions in your head.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pointless.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, weighing things beyond belief, you know, should I get up or should I sit in this chair or that chair, this chair or that chair.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't really do that with other things.  It's just [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, I don't know about other things and I think that's been a problem for you in the past.  Now, now the focus is mostly on him, but about so many different topics, you know, mostly has to do with your ability to make a decision, and then feel comfortable with that decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it'll be done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  That's where you get hung up is you making a decision and, and being okay with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well how do I get out of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Make a decision.  Move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, do you think the reason I'm stuck there is because I've got [INAUDIBLE] in my head, this OCD thing or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That makes it worse.  That makes it harder, makes it much more difficult for you because you doubt your decisions.  Your confidence in yourself is not where it needs to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With him and with marriage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean that's, if you look at your priorities in life, that's a, that's a pretty big one.  I don't think you're, over the course of your life think your doubts have been on different things and right now that's what it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's about him and your decisions and how to handle things, how to handle your in laws, how to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But yet part of me is like with the in laws, just as an example, I feel like I make a choice and I follow through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then that's still getting stuck if I think about it later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you always do that though, or do you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words, make a decision—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and then you say that's all it is, and then do you actually do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And follow through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I have a big problem with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so that has, that gets back to the questioning your original decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe I shouldn't have done that.  Maybe I was just being or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and for me, it's more I'm not being honest.  I should be more authentic.  Like right now that's kind of what I'm thinking is I didn't like sitting at the funeral with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	By the end of that, I had a horrible headache and I was pissed off because I had a headache because I knew exactly why I had it.  It was tension, and it was because I had been sitting there in the funeral going oh I got to be here.  I do not like that lady sitting there.  She is waiting on the money, and you know the whole time I was just, the whole time pretty much thinking I'm not sitting by [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's two children between us.  He sat in the limousine in the front and I sat in the limousine in the back with a child each.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you just wanted to open the car door and run, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.  I mean I, I was in so much pain by the end of that day, and then I, I was just mad because I knew exactly how I ended up that way.  It was that cycle of thoughts and it just ended up like grrr.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you had, you had to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, but I wasn't able to take the deep breath and be at peace, I mean despite that fact that [NAME OTHER] and I and my niece played the ABC game with [INAUDIBLE] you know, trying to find letters and signs.  It didn't work.  Despite the fact that on the way back my nephew and I tried to think of five syllable words through the alphabet.  It wasn't enough.  So what do I do about that?  Learn how to breathe deeper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Learn how to tolerate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've tolerated all that for 16 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're not now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to tolerate it, and I think that's what got me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, is that what you're asking though, how do I tolerate this stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's frustrating.  You can sit over there and smile because you don't have to deal with this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not smiling [INAUDIBLE] it's not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not funny, it's not.  It really does, but over all that, here's two things that have concerned me the past 3 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've had to stay up later to just catch up.  Last week was hell.  We [INAUDIBLE] Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of the death and all that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just all the family gathering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I wanted to be there a little bit because my nephew was there, and my newborn niece, you know, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were there, and I, I wanted to see them and that was, so I did want to be there partly.  I didn't want to be in the same room as [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't want to be with any of the adults and this has been a consistent pattern for you with this family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  You've never wanted to be with the adults.  You only want to be with the children, whether it's the extended family gatherings or it's with your own immediate family because you had said before if you didn't have children, you'd be gone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Yeah, I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you survived, how do you tolerate this?  You tolerate it because you're with you kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I go and play with my [AGE] nephew.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  You just zone out and you're on a different planet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But their parents, of course, I was doing a good deed because, you know, I said you all go on and visit.  I'll be glad to watch [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and, you know, blah, blah, there was 3 or 4 of them, and oh really, you don't mind?  Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Say it works out, say that works out perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it does.  It does, but I always want to be with the kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I'm at any special gathering, I'm going to gear more towards the kids than talking with the adults, and I, I do know that.  I like it that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What  if it was your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With my family I do both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or do both at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it would be different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you enjoy talking with your, your mother and seeing your sister.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, and my cousins and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, but then, and you spend time with them.  You can spend—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But for [NAME OTHER] family, it's an escape.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when my nephew was born 14 years ago, I latched right into that, and we were like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Immediately.  Okay, so I've gotten through the [INAUDIBLE] in my marriage using kids as a shield.  I've realized it.  I want to continue doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even grownup relationships.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, but you do want grownup relationships because you do appreciate—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The people that you work with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when I've been away from [NAME OTHER], like when I was at the beach with my parents for a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Came back and went oh wow, I've had adult conversations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now that I'm, my schedule's fuller, I don't have time to get together with a friend and go walk.  I have a little bit of grownup talk, [NAME OTHER] and I meet once a week for lunch, but it's business as well as some chat, but she avoids her life through work too.  So we're a good pair.  All right, so let's go back, what's concerned with, you know, I was with the kids all that time.  I stayed up late the past 3 nights because I've had to catch up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With what, your housework?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some housework.  Mostly I had 2 reports I had to write for work that had to be done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got this parent I'm meeting with this morning, and I had to get that stupid report finished.  The only time I can get away and have some quiet thinking without interruption was after the kids were in bed.  Um, so I stayed up, I stayed up and I mean like till 10:00 and 10:30, that's late for me, but if I'm up that late, I can't take an Ambien.  If I don't take an Ambien, I wake up when [NAME OTHER] comes to bed partly because he's noisy and partly because I go, oh my gosh, I don't want to snuggle.  I don't want to touch him.  I don't want my foot to touch him and so the past 2 nights I, I haven't slept.  I mean I, I think I got maybe 5, 6 hours last night and about 4 the other night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still pretty good considering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, but I can't function if I don't get to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got a fuzzy head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That's the last thing you need to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I am not comfortable in the bed with my husband not that I've realized oh wait a minute, I don't have to be used like that.  Wait a minute, I have rights.  I don't have to just serve you and do what you want to do.  I appreciate that you want to have sex, but sorry I don't.  And that's major because I know as I let go of that, and hug him, then I will sucked right back into where I was because he'll think everything's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you hug him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll have to be on my terms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's something that you would want to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean you said you didn't want him to touch you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  If I did it, I'm okay with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would want to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To hug him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Touch him, whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I can do that.  He woke me up 2 nights ago when he came to bed and said oh, I'm so glad you're awake, can you scratch my back?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're saying that it'd be okay if you instigated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm more comfortable if I'm in charge and in control of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you have that urge?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't today.  Maybe that little tiny 2%—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe, but it's more of a motherly, I feel sorry for him, oh, poor [NAME OTHER] oh let me [INAUDIBLE] and you feel better because I know when I give him comfort and praise, he, he breaks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's screwed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you said [INAUDIBLE] well I really messed things up, didn't I?  I got him better.  Now I don't have a reason to leave.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You said before I can't leave because he's, he'll fall apart.  He's not healthy.  If I could get him healthy and I knew he'd be okay, then I could leave.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, all right, the difference there is that I don't want to be the one to help him get better, and now that he feels like he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you haven't been.  You've said that, you said go to this person, that person and he's done those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well I feel like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't give him medicine, right?  He takes his own medicine.  You feel like you've—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel like I'm going to slip back into that role.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of giving him his medicine you mean kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I don't actually give him his medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that sort of behavior.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because since he's not all tipsy and silly, I don't feel so angry at him, and you know, Saturday he was like what can I do to help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I appreciated that, or Saturday [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have to look at, again, the bottom line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All this other stuff is fluff and distraction.  You got to look at the bottom line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] is not going to help the [INAUDIBLE] and I just don't think I want to be with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, don't think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to be with him, but then when I say that, there is that, so is that OCD, like when I say that and I think, oh well wait a minute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's your [INAUDIBLE].  That's a voice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you think that has, is what's kept me there all this time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think it's what's kept you there.  It just makes it more difficult for you to be able to trust a decision that you make.  If you were to just listen to your instincts—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And go on your gut feelings on this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like you did when you get together with him, you know.  You didn't like, uh, check with an accountant and an attorney, you know, run some background screening on him.  You just went with your gut and.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then that seemed like the right thing to do at the right time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  I think you had doubts about the relationship with him from the beginning, but you know, you had fun when you were together just the two of you, but [INAUDIBLE] changing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess I didn't realize how immature he was until I actually lived with him and then I immediately thought yeah, we need to make changes since they've always been basic stuff and the basic consideration for me is not there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's, that's, uh, the heart of all this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not about whether he picks his stuff up or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's the fact that yesterday morning I said I only got 4 hours sleep last night.  He said oh, wow, do we have any sausage biscuits?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's what you have to deal with [INAUDIBLE] you're sick.  You're in need.  You're having a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you tell him and the response is, um, can you make me lunch?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see that's what hurts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you didn't sign on for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To not to be considerate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not for this to be an equal relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And though you say that he's better because he doesn't drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it was just more pleasant to be around him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it's still not balanced equal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No because then this morning when I said oh crap, it's quarter till seven, I'm going to have to get up at 5:15, and [NAME OTHER] go put [NAME OTHER] waffles in, and [NAME OTHER] get up, you know, let's go.  We're running late.  [NAME OTHER] I need you to feed the dog.  I don't have, I'm not going to do that.  Feed her now please, she's under my feet because I can't, I can't walk.  I don't have time.  I'm running late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what he says?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're, you know, running, you have other stuff to do and you just have to speed it up.  You still get all your stuff done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm using to putting my makeup on in the car now.  I'm very good at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As opposed to [INAUDIBLE].  It's like we're in this together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, these are our kids.  It's our dog.  It's our house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In order for him to help, or for me to get him to do anything, I have to tell him what to do when he does it, and then when I ask him, he says no.  And then when I try to talk with him about any major, any issue that's beyond the surface, don't get all counsely on me now, just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  You're just telling me what you already know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  Well I'm tired of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again, back to the bottom line.  You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't think I do.  If I can't tolerate being in the bed with him, I must not love him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, okay.  Do you love him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take, take away all this other stuff, the kids and the in laws and it's just you and him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I say I love him, does that mean I have to stay with him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See.  See what you did?  You're already on the next step.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If I do this, than that, than this and that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is, this is, you don't have to do anything.  It's just a question.  It scares you for some reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not a question that I can answer comfortably.  How am I supposed to know that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you were to say, um, I don't, and stay with him, you'd feel like the fool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I've been there for quite a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you say that you do, and you leave, then that doesn't make sense either.  You're trying to make a decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In reverse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well how about if I say I do have a little bit of love for him and I love him so much that I want him to get out and learn to be a man as best he can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you marry him again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, absolutely not.  Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just answered my question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I don't love him.  If I wouldn't marry, okay, if I wouldn't marry him again [INAUDIBLE].  I would not marry him again.  He does not consider me, and he, [INAUDIBLE].  It's basic simple.  We have the kids [INAUDIBLE] we have the kids between us and that's it.  I would not marry him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what you do, what your, your OCD does to your brain is it brings all this other stuff into question when you make a decision and you say I'm done.  I'm out of here.  Then you bring all this other stuff in here, and then you can't make a decision.  It just gets too cloudy.  It's too confusing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, don't you have some kind of medicine that I can take that'll help with that or something that might help to fix it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fix, fix what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well fix that doubt, fix those thoughts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know if you want it fixed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, because if I wanted it fixed, I would do it and I would make a decision.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah because you've said many times I'm capable of making a decision.  It's the fallacy that I get stuck on at times because I start bringing in all this other stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's not that you're incapable of it.  You're a bright and logical person and you have support and if you make a decision, let's say you're going to change careers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could do that, you know.  It'd be a huge adjustment for you, but you know, if you decided that I'm getting kind of tired of this.  I need to do something different, you would figure out step wise on how to do that.  You'd, you know, get some support and you'd do it in a way that made sense.  You want to move, you know.  If you're going, no matter what kind of decision you make, then you would gather up your resources and do what you got to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The reason I'm not able to do that right now, or not taking action to move forward with that now is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Innumerable reasons, but you know, it's basically about your self confidence [INAUDIBLE] and guilt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] do that more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well it hasn't hit you yet because they don't know you're leaving, but as soon as they do, then it's going to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because your kids will be upset.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like conflict and I don't like people to be mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you don't like change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So then why am I even sitting here and considering all this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, here you are, good point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That doesn't make sense.  In fact, if I don't like change and I'm not going to make change and I'm not going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We didn't say you're not going to make change, we said you don't like it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I'm not comfortable with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, and what you're realizing though is that you don't like change, it happens anyway.  Like your kids, you know, when they're babies is pretty cool, but they're going to get bigger anyway.  I'd just assume keep them like that, but sorry.  Like stay at a certain age, like things to be okay the way they are, but change happens.  So you change or you can be changed, your choice.  It's going to happen one way or the other.  That's what it comes down to you and that's what you struggle with, you changing or them, the life, environment, whatever changing you.  You can be in charge of it, or you could control someone else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So then I just need to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do it meaning you need to do whatever it is that it is that you want to do, what makes you happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's that part of me that says who says I have to be happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But here you are.  You've said you deserve it in the past.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So change or be changed, I realized that I have been changed over the years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From where I was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of that which you don't like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You mean being changed or where I was?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Being changed or the effect that these people have had on you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Changes you've made on your own you're pretty happy about, things that you decide to do, your work, your career.  Very good.  Those are decisions that you're making.  When you do this work instead of that work, those are decisions that you make and you're content with those.  You do good work.  You get paid for it.  People appreciate it and it works out well because you're doing what you want [INAUDIBLE].  You do good, you know, you're great with your kids, good job as a mommy.  It's something you love.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I was thinking [INAUDIBLE] because my marriage is not a real marriage of what I would think a marriage should be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, don't know.  I guess it hasn't been that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  So—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) 2 things were on my mind while I was waiting.  One obviously was my boots.  And I was sort of surprised because when I was thinking about them, I was thinking I just want to keep them on and see what will happen, mostly within myself.  And then it just made me feel silly but silly in a way that I just wanted to laugh.  (Pause) And also I felt sort of distant from it too because I didn't know what I'd do when I got in here.  And I could very well make up my mind that I'd keep them on out there but then I didn't know if I'd do it when I was in here.  And then all I can think is that the whole thing seems so ridiculous.  (Pause) But even though it seems to me ridiculous, maybe I'm thinking it's ridiculous as a, some kind of a defense.  Because on the other hand, it's obviously very important to me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you felt like laughing and thought it was silly, can, can you say any more about, eh —?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) I just —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Were you, were you feeling like laughing at yourself or what?  How was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, but also that, I don't know, it was partly that.  And I was partly thinking what you'd think when you saw me coming with my boots on, the old — I don't know, it just struck me funny.  (3-minute silence) I think it was mostly a thought of laughing with you, assuming you'd be laughing, at myself.  (Pause) But it didn't make me feel unhappy that I would be.  (Pause) And it's strange too because even though I've done it, I don't really feel uncomfortable but I still think now, I wonder if I'll ever do it again.  Because there's still something about it that seems to be wrong.</p>

<p>The other thing that surprised me when I was waiting, and I don't know whether I was trying to recall what I said yesterday, but at one point it did strike me that usually I can't remember what I was saying the day before or, if I remember one thing, it's st—, it's kind of a vague recall on what I was talking about.  And when I was thinking that, I realized that I don't know if I could recall everything, but I have a much clearer idea than I usually do.  (Silence) But it always strikes curious, even with this clearer recall I can't be sure I know what I was talking about at the very end.  (Pause) It's funny, this is something I usually don't even say but it just strikes me very curious that right after I said that, my thoughts went to the, nearly to the end of today and, uhm, my taking a boy down early to meet his mother.  You see, he goes for I suppose, remedial help.  I don't quite know why that came to my mind.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What did the mother look like?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Very tall.  She's attractive but I don't, I don't know, I can't think that clearly about what she looks like.  And I was just thinking, I wonder if it's because of what seems to be her relationship with her son, but somehow that, that wasn't what I thought of at first when I thought of taking him down.  But she's always, they seem to be truly affectionate with each other and — (pause) I suppose what it is is so—, something — because then my thoughts will go to other members of my class.  And it's probably my questioning how much am I doing just what I said my mother did, and not really enjoying these children that I'm teaching.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think I do at times, but other times I know that the feeling that there are certain things that I have to get done and they have to get done, because the school expects it, make me feel under enough pressure so that I don't really enjoy them.  And I know at times like that, I must seem very grim too.  And I think something about a feeling that maybe I don't think of them as individuals or what I could do for each of them individually, was part of what made me think of that boy when I did.  Because his mother asked for something that she had questioned earlier and I'd forgotten she'd even asked for it earlier.  And, just, I suppose I was, well, feeling I should have remembered and should have done something about it before she asked me again.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>It also seems strange to me, in a way, that usually by Friday I seem to have so much on my mind and today I, I guess I feel I'm resisting something but — (shifting and sniffling, pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you have some ideas about what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, all I noticed was that in thinking about my class, I thought just about a few individuals for a while and then just generally, that there are times when I know that I'm not thinking of the children individually at all and I'm really thinking about myself and my reputation and all.  And then it makes me feel that I'm a very bad teacher.  And I — oh, then I thought of fact that my headmaster came in today with some visitors and we were about to do a lesson that involves writing on a particular type of paper.  And some classes like it but most classes find in the beginning they don't because it's very hard for them to do it.  And since I've allowed my class to speak freely a little bit, they were all kind of groaning when they got the paper.  And (sniffle) since the headmaster was there with his visitors, I felt rather embarrassed and then I just wanted to laugh.  And I don't quite know why, whether it was just from being nervous or sort of a defiant kind of thing, because I'm pushing them because I feel he wants me to push them.  And I think my feeling at the time, too, aside from thinking, "Oh, no!  They can't do this to me"  was that, well, now he can see what happens when you do push them.  And then after thinking about that, I just started thinking about how I didn't have anything to say and this feeling that, well, that I'd really started to resist whatever else might be in my mind.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know whether it has anything to do with the fact that when I left yesterday, there was something further that I'd already begun to think about.  And when I know there is, then I always want to recall it the next day and I can't recall it.  (Silence) It's funny, too: after having sain—, said I can recall what I talked about yesterday, I've, I was now thinking about the fact that last night I felt sort of exhausted but also that I, I don't know, that I was getting at something or understanding something new.  And I don't know what it was, now.  I don't feel any feeling of having gotten at anything new.  And there've been many times when this has bothered me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's, for some reason, I draw an analysis (sic) between being upset at not remembering, or having the same feeling about what I do remember a second time and I, to, uhm, how I reacted to school.  And I was never aware, all through my schooling, that the thing I should be concentrating on is the method with which to approach anything, any problem.  And instead I was always just trying to remember everything, so that I would have it.  Because I didn't think I could ever get it again if I couldn't remember it.  And I think there's something similar in the feeing I have about forgetting things that seem to me so important here, that I'll lose it if I forget it.  And once in a while I'll tell myself, "Well, if you could think of it once, then you can think of it again."  And, anyway, cer—, there are different things that seem to be coming together in my mind when I'm not here, so that I do think I am learning a process.  But I still don't really have any confidence in it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And something similar to this happened today in an art project that we did.  Because I had, I'd done it for 2 years and last year I changed it somewhat and I'd been really pleased with what happened.  And then this year, in setting it up, all I could think of was, "What did I do last year?"  And I couldn't be sure I remembered.  And this really bothered me so instead of thinking it out again, I kept trying to remember what I'd done last year so that the thing, they came out so well.  And I didn't really get involved in it or feel any enthusiasm for it, or think of anything new when I was doing it because I was just, on my mind always was this feeling that somehow I'd forgotten something from last year.  And I was disappointed with what happened.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just wondering how much this disappointment comes from the fact that the first time, or the time when I changed it, I didn't know what to expect so if it came out reasonably well, I'd be pleased.  And then I don't remember exactly how the things were, I just remember I was pleased and, and so I end up the second time expecting too much.  I, I, I don't know quite what's — but it's almost based on the fact that if they come out reasonably well, I'm amazed that I could have led a project that would come out that well and so I'm doubly pleased because it seems to prove something about me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I just noticed something else that I noticed yesterday.  Both days when I came in, my eyes, which sometimes will bother me by evening, were really bothering me and everything just looked sort of hazy.  And then about halfway through — I, I just noticed now, too, for this time that — I can just literally see things more clearly.  And it's almost as if I were under a lot more tension than I thought when I first came in both times.  (2-minute silence) I began to think again about something I know I mentioned either yesterday or the day before on, well, sort of a how people are selfish.  And h—, I'm still feeling mixed up whether I think it's good or not and, or bad, or just what my attitude is toward it, or just what kinds of selfishness there can be.  And I was thinking about it today because everything I've said shows how I am always, for some reason or other, thinking of myself first in everything that I've done.  And then sometimes I throw in some reason connected with other people, for instance, if it's my class, what might be good for my class.  But that definitely comes second to my thinking of myself first.  And right now, I think I'm inclined to think that it's bad and wrong for you to th—, a person to think of himself first and for me to think of myself first.  But it just seems that it's a natural thing for anybody to do and I can't decide how it could be right, or the circumstances when it can be right.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I suppose there are times when, if you're involved with other people, you, before you do anything, you also consider how the other person's feeling to be right and to sort of balance what you might do, because of what you would guess the other person's feeling.  (Pause) And I've often thought it was strange that, although if I'm not involved I can often guess correctly how another person's feeling, if I'm involved I seem to be unaware entirely of how another person might be feeling.  (Pause) Either I don't think about it or else I'm so busy being defensive that I'll think of them in a hostile light.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But I've already known this about thinking about other people, too, and I, it seemed like maybe it was the answer to what was bothering me in the question of being self-centered but I can't believe that's the whole answer.  I suppose it's a case of not always knowing it even though I know it.  Because if I think about it when I'm able to act that way, things do go well and when I'm not, I'm upset.  (Pause) Now I just began to wonder about my boots again.  And I used to wonder what was so important to me to keep them on.  Or, or, well I don't know, I'm twisting it up now but when I didn't keep them on I was thinking about why did it upset me, the thought of keeping them on.  Now I'm wondering what is there about taking them off that bothers me so that I do want to keep them on.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I didn't, I wasn't aware of wanting to do this when I first came in, but the thought occurred to me now: sometimes I have wanted very much to ask you how you react, would react, or now react to my keeping my boots on, if you mind.  But then I never feel I can ask that because I don't think you'd answer.  Or even if you did answer, then I'd just end up doing something because it, it would be for your approval and not, somehow, for me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

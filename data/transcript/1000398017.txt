<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, Silence, Sigh) Well, the thing that's very much on my mind is what I've just come from.  Uhm, because I got together with FEN Z, the mother of one of the children, and then uh, FNAZ KRL, who's the mother of the other, and then the girl who's living with the KRLs was there, uhm, to talk about our starting the pool.  And, uh, I don't know, I suppose in a way I had my usual feeling of uhm, you know, not feeling as if I'm like the others, the other mothers, and, and, you know, somehow feeling more awkward and less confident.  I don't know, uhm, well I guess that that would pretty well describe it.  </p>
 
<p>And uhm, and, but then the other thing I've been thinking about is, again, what I'm going to do, how I'm going to solve the problem of who's taking care of FSO.  Because uhm, after what FEN had told me yesterday, it was clear she doesn't have confidence in Mrs LDJ, even if I can continue to, and think well, FEN is inclined to be a bit over concerned, or, you know, I mean she expressed some concerns today that I don't think are valid.  And — not directly about Mrs. LDJ this time, but about the situation — and uhm, FNAZ KRL was strong on pooh-poohing them.  I didn't say much either way.   </p>
 
<p>But (sigh) uhm, at some point, I just felt I had to ask, because I, I just have seen very little of Mrs LDJ with FSO, since she doesn't live in.  And then either I'm home, and she's gone, or else she's there, and I'm gone.  Uhm, and everything's been fine while I've been there, and she's been there.  But, i, it's you know, very short periods, and nothing much is going on then. </p>  
 
<p>And uhm, so at one point when FEN wasn't around, I just said that, I asked FNAZ, something which I shouldn't have done at that point, because her, in effect, baby-sitter was there too, and it really was poor judgment on my part.  And I was sorry as soon as I did.  But I felt absolutely driven to.  And uhm, she answered by asking a question.  You know, I said something to the effect that I had never seen Mrs LDJ take FSO out, and would she feel comfortable about her handling the three, because I just couldn't judge that.  And uhm, she just answered by saying, "Well how is she with discipline at home?"  Which says to me her discipline's not very good outside.  And that was, in effect, wa— one of the things FEN was saying.   </p>
 
<p>And so then I started thinking well, one of my solutions was to have Mrs LDJ work during the day, because she said she will, uhm, if I can find somebody to live in for the afternoon and evening.  And uhm (Sigh), I don't know, at this point I don't know whether I'd want to keep her.  Because if she's not very good at disciplining FSO, then I don't want to.  And I can get into a very confused arrangement, if I keep her.  And I'd only want to do it if she's uhm, as good as her references have been.  And uhm, when she started out, she seemed to be very capable.  And so I'm feeling all confused about that too.  And I guess not knowing where I can trust my own judgment, or even where I have enough knowledge to judge.  Uhm, and then the usual thing of feeling somehow inadequate with these other mothers.  </p> 
 
<p>And uhm, I don't know, yesterday I was sort of bothered because I was thinking, well, maybe some of my feelings about it were that ob, obviously FEN wasn't pleased, and I was feeling driven to please her too.  But today, I don't think it's wanting to please them, but just simply uhm, you know, that I might have, if I make this a permanent arrangement, it would be making a bad decision, and I uhm, well I, I don't know, I just — well also, I, I'm feeling as if I have to start all over again, because the girl that was considering the job, did not call yesterday at all, or last night.  And she may still call at some point, but I'm assuming that she's not very interested, or else she would have called me.  And I've decided not to call her, because if she's so indecisive, I would rather not get involved.  And I had suspected that that might be true, but on the other hand, I'd been hoping that it wouldn't be true.  And so, I don't know, it's just like now I have to start all over again. </p>

<p>And then I was thinking too when I was coming here, that one of the (Sigh) problems, I mean, MSCZ keeps saying that it's what's causing the whole trouble, is that I want to keep a separate cleaning woman, and uhm, and so I thi—, I don't know, I guess maybe part of my depression is that uh, everything I've been doing has been an effort to keep a separate cleaning woman.  And the whole situation's getting more and more confused and involved, so that I don't even know quite what's the arrangement, or how I want to work it out.  And uh, then it's not going to be good for FSO, all for keeping a cleaning woman that is good and that I, you know, I would like to keep.  But I can't adjust to the fact that probably I can't keep her, yet, or I can't accept that. </p>  
 
<p>And then MSCZ, when we were talking about it last night, suggested I should run 2 types of ads.  One on the basis that we really wanted to keep Mrs LDJ and FYR and uhm, who's the cleaning woman, and then find somebody just to live in, in exchange for baby-sitting, as FMX did.  Uhm, and then at the same time, run another ad for somebody to do the full-time everything.  And I just was thinking, well, how can I do the two together, I'll be very confused.  And I realized one reason why I'd feel confused, was because I really was wanting one thing.  And now I'm wondering if, I began with wanting to have the jobs separated, and if the whole thing has kind of gotten out of control with me, you know that I, I've lost touch of where it's not an advantage to keep it separated.  And you know, I'm sort of hanging onto thinking of it in my original way, and I'm not you know, sort of uhm, being flexible, as the situation is clearly changing.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>Also, I think of the fact MSCZ and I were talking about quite a number of things last night.  And uhm — I mean, this is tied in with what we, what I've just been saying, but leads to something else — uhm, because we were talking about how much I would pay somebody.  Because that's been part of the trouble, too.  Uhm, especially if I want to keep a cleaning woman, and then have somebody else do other things.  Uh, a lot of people just don't want the salary that I'm offering, and they would want something higher.   </p>
 
<p>Uhm, MSCZ said well, maybe we, a,a, and all along, he'd been saying we could not go higher than a certain amount, however I worked it out and divided it up.  And uhm, I had thought about well, how much am I making?  And thought well, if this is just so terrible finding somebody, then I might not want to work another year, because it's just not worth it.  It takes away any of the, well, it takes away a lot of what is positive about my working, for me.  And uhm, and then, we'd have to, on his salary pay for somebody to take care of FSO, assuming, you know, that I was still coming. </p>  
 
<p>In any case, I was thinking, why am I paying for all the baby-sitting we ever need out of my salary?  Or even less than my salary.  When, if it's just so horrible, I won't work, and then we'll have to pay for it out of his.  And, so that got us into discussing, well, we just have to decide our priorities and where our money goes.  And something that I guess, I've never really said, maybe I've tried to some other times, but not said it very clearly.  But, well he was saying I, that he thinks I have this feeling that he has the money and he doles it out, and I don't have any, and I'm taking no responsibility for it.  And he was meaning too, I'm not taking responsibility of knowing what money there is, and then deciding how it can be spent, and then sticking with it.   </p>
 
<p>And I realize that he's right to an extent, on that.  Uhm, and I do have this attitude, sort of, he has the money, and he can decide what he wants to do with it.  And I just have to tell him what I need.  And then, I do—, you know, I'm m—, I'm vague about how much there is, altogether.  Uhm, and then, I suppose in a way, again, it gets back to my being a martyr, because then I feel, well he has all the rest of the money, and if he wants to go buy something, or if he wants to go out for lunch, or if he wants to do something in the entertainment side of things, he can just say, alright, we'll spend the money this way.  And uhm, I'm  not saying, well I want money for, you know, things that are pure pleasure.  Everything I have money for is, is a necessity.  And then uh, originally it was supposed to be, I had money for clothes, too.  But uhm, it was the first budget I've ever done, and I didn't do it very well.  So it ended up that I had money for FSO's clothes, but not me. </p>
 
<p>Uhm, and then, MSCZ's taking this course down at KWN, and I have had this feeling — and it's for his pleasure — and I've had this feeling that he doesn't consider that as part of it, and he's constantly telling me that I have to curtail what I'm spending.  And he's not thinking of that as, you know, sort of on the other side of the balance.  And uhm, you know, sort of that came in as a necessity.  (Clears throat) And then his desires for entertainment were another necessity, and he wasn't balancing those two.  Uhm, and again, I guess I was feeling the martyr.  He's doing what he wants, and I can't do what I want.  But, for the first time, we really talked about it, last night.   </p>
 
<p>But he does have a way of scaring me.  He was talking about that, and so I said, well I don't fully know quite why it is.  And he doesn't like it when he does.  But he ne—, I think he was even trying to do it last night, he, he naturally tries to intimidate me, so he can get his way.  And to some extent it works.  And, yet he doesn't like it, and I don't know if he realizes that he does it.   </p>
 
<p>But it seems to me he was, last night, or I, I just, I don't know, but I was thinking about he kept saying that we only had so much money to spend on whoever lived in.  And I was talking about the problems, having to do it on that little bit of money, and uhm, I said, well, maybe we'll have to spend more.  We'll just have to not do something else.  And uh, he would reasonably consider that.  And then the next thing I know, he'd say, but we can't spend more than whatever the, you know, figure we'd be saying at the time.  And generally, it's $75, or 70, is what he really wanted, or 65.  Uhm, but we were willing to be between 75 and uhm, I guess it was going to be close to 80 with FDO this year, because of Social Security, too.   </p>
 
<p>Uhm, and so that was really annoying me, but I hadn't said much.  I just kept thinking about it.  And I don't know, I, uhm, again, it was sort of well, MSCZ knows, MSCZ's handling the money.  And anyway, he's telling me, and so I'd feel resentful, but I wouldn't really uh, directly talk about it with him.  But then, as I say, I'm just thinking now, there still was something about his approach of it, i—, u—, of sort of, well, we have to decide together, but you better do what I want.  At least, how I saw it.  I don't know that he saw that he was doing it that way.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>I don't know if I said it here, or if I were just thinking it at home, but there's something else that struck me that was part of the whole pattern of my feeling like a martyr.  Uhm, I think I mentioned that we talked about, awhile earlier, my wanting to please him, and how sometimes it annoyed him, because he didn't feel it was sh—, really showing love to him.  And also that sometimes, why should I be wanting to please him?  It's probably partly because he's thinking, well, please myself, first.  And uhm, and, you know, then I was just thinking, well maybe pleasing somebody is not, literally, loving somebody.  You know, that maybe loving somebody would mean then, you'd please them.  But that doesn't go the other way.  And because then, it's sort of like an obedient dog pleasing his master, rather than real love.  And uhm, so I was thinking about it that way. </p>
 
<p>But then also, I was thinking last night, I think, I mean, I don't think I mentioned it here, that, sort of, if I'm try—, if I'm approaching it all by pleasing him, and then if he's not p—, I don't know, somehow it gets me into the role of martyr again, I was thinking yesterday.  I guess mainly because if I'm trying to please him and he's not pleased, well then I can think, well I really tried, and what can I do, and poor me.  (4-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Mm, I was thinking back into that meeting of the mothers today, and I don't know, you know, sort of the general feeling of being a bit out of place, awkward, or I don't know what, exactly.  Not being able to live up to something, I guess.  And then, also, uh, uh, uhm, you know, this feeling of uncertainty now, about Mrs LDJ.  That she came in near the end, and in a way I suppose, you know, there was nothing, nothing in the atmosphere.  But somehow, uhm, I felt as if there was.  You know of, I don't know, we—, because she was a bit awkward because she'd never been to the LFM's house before.  And I suppose she wasn't quite sure what her role was. </p>  
 
<p>And then uhm, well, I don't know, it just seemed like, mm, there was an awkwardness, which might come partly because from what FEN has said, uhm, she doesn't really like the way Mrs LDJ hans—, handles things.  And uhm, well anyway, I just, came away from the whole thing with a very uncomfortable feeling. </p>  
 
<p>And, (Sigh) and then I thought back to MSCZ's and my conversation about all this, last night.  And uhm, and another thing MSCZ said, which I almost never consider, and he's said it before, but he almost doesn't, I don't know if he considers it or not.  Maybe he doesn't, because I don't.  But he said well, you know, you do have the money that, it's not just the mon—, I mean, he doesn't mean the money that my father's given us, uhm, you know, the money that he gave us with the idea of an apartment.  But uh, I suppose, the money that came with me when I married MSCZ, because it was money my father had given me earlier in stocks, and stuff.  Uhm, and he said, he was referring to that, saying, you have your own money that we could use.  Meaning mainly to pay somebody if I had to run higher than, you know, our budget could really maintain.   </p>
 
<p>And uhm, (Sigh, Sniff) I don't know, I just have this feeling, I can't do it.  And I thought of FNA almost right away, who is, I think, using that money sometimes.  I think she has, I'm not sure.  Uhm — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Why can't you?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  I don't really feel it's mine, I guess.  And also, uhm, well, I just, I don't know whether this is it, it seems like it might be too easy an answer.  But uhm, my parents always, maybe partly because both of them (Clears throat) were pretty poor during the depression, and had to support themselves, and support going to school themselves, uhm, so that they have a, an, and many people who went through the depression around the same age as they were, have an attitude about saving that young people today don't have.  Or, you know, people who didn't go through the depression.  Uhm, but, you know, it was sort of always drummed into us, you've got to put your money away for a s—, day when you might really need it.  And you never touch it, because you might really need it sometime.  Uhm, and so smaller needs, you don't touch it for, because you never know when that major need might appear.   </p>
 
<p>In a, in a way I mean, that's true, because you co—, i, if there's any kind of a need that you can get around, well then you don't really need it.  Because there might be some horrible thing that will happen, but that's such a fatalistic, or pessimistic attitude.  And, and I don't know whether that's what it is, th, that I can't consider using it, aside from having some kind of a feeling that it's not even mine.  Or whether it's uhm, you know, sort of, it's my father's, and he didn't tell me I could use it that way, or something.  Because if we were going to buy apar—, an apartment tomorrow, I would have no hesitati—, hesitation to use the money that he gave us with that specifically in mind.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>Uh, well, I was just thinking, too, that the money has never been real to me.  Uhm, because my father managed it, uhm, before I was married, and then MSCZ has managed it since then.  And, partly because I've had no interest in managing it.  And I guess partly why my father managed it before, was be—, you know, after I was old enough to, because I had no interest, because I'm sure FYC had a different attitude about it.  And that might partly too, be due to what she did for work, because she worked in investments and so forth.  But maybe she also already had that kind of interest.  And I me—, I do—, I don't know quite why I never felt that it was real.  Uhm, I suppose my father would tell me, anytime he bought me new stock, and put it in my name.  So I must have known that much, but you know, it was just, it was something that I never had any dealing with, never handled, never saw.  And uh, well I never saw, I never handled.  I suppose somehow, it is representative of my father's penis to me. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Yeah, as though it's not money.  Right, you don't treat it as though it's money. </p> 
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, the very thing I thought of next, was well then, if I start spending it, it's going to be like chopping up his penis.  Uhm, and it immediately made me think of something that uh, I don't know, I thought it was just kind of curious.  I've known it from last year, but when I saw the dentist the other day, he was evening off a place that I had thought was an area where I'd lost some filling.  And he said, "No, it's really your bite causing the filling to uhm, become rough."  And he said, "As I told you before, you have a very" — I've forgotten what word he used for it, but it means a very hard bite.  And uhm, I, I, I remember thinking this time when he said that, you know, it was sort of like the way I like to, when I'm feeling frustrated, chew something.  Like nuts, or something like that.  And, and how I have in past, associated that with chewing up a penis, or doing something destructive. </p>
 
<p>And then, I was just thinking of that meeting today with these mothers, that I, i—, I think that's part of what upsets me so much, that I h, have the feeling I have, and I know that I shouldn't have it.  Uhm, because I feel like a clod, really, I feel like awkward.  I feel as if I can't do anything, that I can't make judgments, that I'm not in charge of even you know, a small part of it, like my own side of the three-way arrangement.  In a way, I, I did feel I was, because I said if, if the arrangement goes as it may possibly, assuming that I find somebody to live in, and keep Mrs LDJ, that I'm not so sure about, anymore.  Uhm, that uh, there were certain times when I did not want to have to be responsible for the coming and going, if it would be agreeable with the others.   </p>
 
<p>And uhm, but, but still I had this very strong feeling of being incompetent, and all.  And, and then I, I don't know, I don't feel that way at school, at least in my own classroom.  But then again, I do, I do feel that way at home, I suppose, if I'm dealing with help.  (Sniff) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   So here you are talking about your, the money that your father gave you, and how it doesn't seem real to you, it doesn't seem like it's really yours, and you have to keep it that way, so you've never handled it, and you've never seen it.  And then you think, that sounds like your father's penis.  And indeed, that's the way you seem to be treating it, as though it's a secret thing that has to be kept hidden.  You don't treat it as money.  And as soon as I agree with that idea, you start telling me how incompetent you feel.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Uhm, I'm, I'm just not quite sure.  Uhm, I guess what I'm thinking is well, uhm, I mean, the question I'm asking is why do I uh, think of being incompetent, after you agree with what I said.  And I suppose in part, I'm thinking exactly, again, what is it I'm doing?  Why do I have to feel I have to keep it, the money that way?  Except I, I suppose if I, if I'm seeing it as somehow my father's penis, then that is my way of having it.  Uhm, but I'm not, I don't know, except it seems as if you're agreeing with what I said would then be proof that I don't have it.  And that would be why I think of being incompetent.  Or inadequate, or whatever.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And, eh, but I was also thinking of when I thought of it, the first time when I was talking about it when I first got in, I didn't have the same feeling that I had this time, when I thought of being with the mothers again, and, and those same feelings that I had been talking about earlier.  Because this time, right after talking about the money, and how it made me think of my father's penis, I had a very strong feeling of anger, that I know I'm not what I feel I am, in these situations.  And uhm, (Sniff) or, you know, that I don't have to be.  </p> 
 
<p>ANALYST:   So, then what's your anger?  That in fact, you really have your father's money, and not his penis?  You do have the money, after all.  But you don't have what you wish it were.</p>  
 
<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, which, I mean, that just makes me think of another reason not to spend it, because I don't want to even recognize that I have it, if it isn't what I really want it to be.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>But then, I immediately thought, well, when I was growing up, I would, in splurges, spend a lot, and then not much at all, for a long time be very frugal.  And that's been typical since I've been married.  Although, when I was working before FSO was born, we had more money for our needs, you know, that could be spread around.  So that, uhm, I didn't run into so many problems.  But now that money is tighter for us again, I'm running into the same kind of thing, of being frugal for awhile, and then splurging, mainly always with clothes.  And that was true at home, sometimes at home it would have been with books, too.  Uhm, and then I'd have to go to my father and now to MSCZ, and get a hand-out.  And I mean, I don't know, it just seems like again, I am putting MSCZ in the same role.  And I guess somehow I was, when I would do that, I would then for temporarily, accept that kind of a substitute for what I really wanted from my father.  </p> 
 
<p>But with this money that he had been giving me over the years, that I now don't want to touch, you know, in terms of spending it, uhm, a—, a—, I don't know, it seems like well, because I don't want to accept it as a substitute, or just to see it, I suppose the other thing is just to see it for what it is.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, and you know, curiously have exactly the same idea about him.  You sort of implied that well, you musn't spend it, because he wouldn't want you to.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Hmm. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   He wouldn't want you to see it, or handle it, or use it.  That's your idea.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uh, I, I'm wondering if, you didn't use the name, you just said "him".  And then, at first I was thinking, well that is how I felt about my father, you know, about the money, about his penis, either way.  But then I was thinking well, did you actually mean I, that I'm feeling the same way about MSCZ, as I do about my father, w, with what you just said.  And then I j—, I don't know, I can think of it about the money, but then I think, well I don't have that feeling at all about his penis.  In fact I feel the opposite way, that he's always forcing it on me, in, to an extent, you know, of wanting to make love when I don't want to, and wanting me to respond to him, when I feel I can't.  And uhm — (Pause) </p>
 
<p>Well, and I was just thinking another thing, uhm, (Sigh) because I don't know, I just have so many mixed feelings about that.  I mean, on the other hand, if he didn't want to make love with me, I'd be upset.  But I do have this feeling of sort of being forced, it being his penis being forced on me, his wanting to make love being forced on me.  And uhm, (Sniff) and again I guess, I'm not thinking about the part of it that I probably want to think of it that way, but I was thinking about how, often I think I wish he would withhold it from me, so I could beg for it.  And, you know, or plead for it, or ask for it, and if I think of it myself, in that position, I think of myself trying, you know, sort of playing a little girl role, and, in, how I must have wanted to you know, sort of charm my father around to giving me what I wanted.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>I don't know, then I think back to what you just said, and I, I'm not sure, maybe I just didn't hear something that you said.  I mean, I'm not sure that I should have the confusion about it, that I do feel.</p>   
 
<p>ANALYST:   What do you feel confused about?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  I guess who the "him" was, or who you were referring to.  (Pause) I mean, what I heard, I guess, is, "You must, you seem to feel the same way about him."  And a—, I think at first I was assuming you were going to say I was feeling the same way about MSCZ that I did about my father.  But then, what you said only sounded to me like the way I feel about my father.  And, I don't, I guess, quite understand. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, you're answering your own question.  Because in a way, you're focusing on me now.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Mm, then, I'm not sure if I understand that.  (Laughs)  Uhm, (Sniff, 3-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, so why do you keep things to yourself?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Hmm, well, I think I have this feeling that probably there's something obvious that I'm not admitting I see or don't see, I don't know which it is.  But anyway, but I don't have this feeling that I'm purposely not understanding.  But I have this feeling I'm not understanding something that I should be.  And then, I think I get the feeling, well you're going to be disapproving, because it's obviously there.  And, which also makes me think, well I must be trying to avoid seeing it, if it's obviously there, and I feel you'll be disapproving, and uhm — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   So I too, have something you can't see.  Our time's up.</p>

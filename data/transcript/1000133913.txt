<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they talked about Ms. Lockhart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all over a couple months ago, something - I forget what (unintelligible) title is. Oh, you're right. Oh girl, see this is the last time. So many things (unintelligible) don't remember. You know what? I was here before. I don't know if I care much about this. We were going to talk about explore avenues - explore what I might be doing wrong other than what other barriers there might be between me and getting to know men other than the physical part. Because I don't know if we discussed that much; it sort of got thrown aside. I think you told me just before the summer vacation that you thought that that was the major problem, was the physical thing was the main problem (0:01:08.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if I said that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you said well, you know what? You just sort of said do you think, you know, early on you said, I remember this (unintelligible) you said well I think that it's possible but difficult. And I said why? And you said well I think that your deformity turns them on. And I said - then you elaborated and you said well, they're just not turned on by you. And you said further that they might care what other people think or friends like them. Or physical things might bother them (0:01:58.6).</p>

<p>And I said well is it possible that someone would like me and not date me because of what other people think? And you said well, they're just not turned on. So, you know, I sort of let it drop right then and I sort of stopped wondering about what I might be doing wrong. Well I shouldn't say wrong but wrong, you know, in terms of getting to know men. Because I felt that maybe there wasn't - the only thing that could be a barrier would be, you know, maybe lack of confidence, if there is anything other than that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay well I just want to say something about what you said that I said. Because I don't want, you know, I was pointing out some of the things that might be barriers to some people. I mean I want it to be very clear that I only meant some people. And also I didn't mean by that, was I didn't mean (unintelligible) these barriers that are permanent. I meant kind of some things that might make some people hold back. That's what - I mean I just want to say that (unintelligible) somehow I feel that I said it much more tentatively and maybe you took it as I was saying it more definitely when I really wasn't (0:03:22.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see the thing is, you know, we've talked a lot about everything being relative. Like one person with a handicap is different from another because they might have something else (unintelligible). Or someone else may have less. So it makes me feel that if I want to attract anyone then I must not have anything else. Because why isn't there enough - why don't I have any out there that would overcome, that would make some people overlook it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see (0:04:08.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think it's true that some people have none of that sort of - and some peoples' eyes that anything is physically wrong (unintelligible). So sometimes when I think about - a lot of times I feel confident. And then other times I think well, there must not be anything there to make up for it. I might (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes, you know, a whole area you should look at and say what do I have? And it sort of comes out nothing. Or at least sometimes (unintelligible) (0:05:12.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You were saying that if there was something somebody would see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that they don't know who you are (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really stopped wondering about what (unintelligible) because I - there doesn't seem to be any way that I could find out what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you felt (unintelligible) that's where (unintelligible) (0:06:01.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just like this friend of mine, this one friend I had (unintelligible) married a man (unintelligible) depend on what it was. And apparently no one ever sees me in this light. No man who I've ever met has ever though that I had enough going that he could see that would make him overlook the physical thing. Apparently this is what has happened. Apparently there's nothing else that's appealing. There must not be anything else appealing about me. Because otherwise (0:07:00.1)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'll tell you it's not just that you're trying (unintelligible) it was only about four months back (unintelligible) really interesting. And I guess what I'm wondering is how interested are you in (unintelligible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm interested in other people. But you know, I found out - another girl who found this out too, when you show interest in men it - sometimes it (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay I'm not talking about interest in them and getting them to like you. I'm talking about interest in their (unintelligible), interest in (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean doing this without showing interest in one particular man? You mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being like this in general.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Partly I'm talking about that, yeah. But - yeah. Partly I'm just (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think I'm fairly friendly. I don't know. I mean - I don't know what you mean by doing things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, here's what I would really like. And I'm not sure...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I speak and talk and ask people if they've mentioned something about themselves, you know, I'll bring it up (0:09:05.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're interested if people are feeling bad too? Are you interested in (unintelligible)? Are you feeling happy? Are you caring about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, if I know them, yes. More so than they are in me. Do you mean like if someone's walking down the hallway and looks sad and I say, what's wrong? Sometimes I do that. Sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or if they're your friends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's what I'm getting at. I think that one of the most important things that attracts other people...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is - and this is hard to do - is to spend less time thinking about how much they like you and spend more time thinking about how you feel about them and how you can do something to add to their lives (0:10:12.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean everybody I meet? You mean in general, people that you meet and like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm not sure. I mean I'm not differentiate - yeah, maybe everybody. Not that you have to, you know, need to do this every minute. I'm talking about in answer...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Less emphasis on the more interest in other people, even if it's just smiling or speaking or (unintelligible). In other words more interest in them than them in myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not more interest. Like say I really think it's true that (unintelligible) genuinely interested in other people it would just happen, in many cases (unintelligible). It does something (unintelligible) (0:11:14.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought about it I just (unintelligible). But no I agree, even though sometimes - of course a lot of attraction between men and women is physical. It really doesn't have anything to do with liking them as people. Yeah, no, I agree. And when I sensed that I wasn't appealing to men or that I felt that I didn't have anything appealing, I know that sounds like a contradiction from what I said of valuing myself by the way they value me. It's just that I just didn't have anything that was appealing to men, not necessarily that what they thought about me (unintelligible) (0:12:01.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I get - yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I'm still not going to hate myself even if there isn't anything. But I do agree with you that, you know, that's something (unintelligible). That I should think more about what I think, my own feelings than what they're thinking. Besides it's a good idea anyways. It's much more relaxing to think about what I think of things. Because if it's kind of tiring to be always worrying about what someone thinks of you. Kind of a miserable life anyways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (0:13:10.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why is it if I have been too self centered, why doesn't that affect my relationship with girlfriends? I wonder I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder why it only affects my relationship with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you sure that it doesn't? What I mean by that is maybe what you need is a better relationship with girlfriends (0:14:00.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's true. Because - well I mean I'm not looking for extra girlfriends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I see what you mean. I see what you mean. You still have girlfriends so why - so it makes it feel like (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like I wouldn't, you know, people wouldn't like me at all. I'm not saying that I don't agree with what you're saying. I'm going to work on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, no, I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Course I guess with a man there's an added element of attraction that's not a problem with girls. Because with girls it's just friendship. With men, I - you know, I don't know if it's really that easy to be friends with men. I don't know of any friendships (unintelligible). A man sort of has to like you as a woman, or he's not interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) (0:15:02.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that what you mean by having something extra besides the - having something that makes up for (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) in part. It's, you know, there are other things, you know, all sorts of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe this friendliness that I was talking about sort of comes out, the type of friendliness that turns them off, maybe it's not really friendliness but sort of an anxiety thing, syndrome that they sort of sense. If you zero in your friendliness on one person, they sort of think well I was friendly and it turned him off. See, friendship doesn't work. But I just think maybe (unintelligible) to this, they sort of sense the anxiety (0:15:56.7).</p>

<p>And then some men I guess are scared. You know, they're paranoid about women.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it somehow - this is a tricky thing in it has - you're not just being friendly in order to get someone to like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But sometimes if you're friendly and, you know, to people because you feel like it makes you feel good to be a friendly person and you brighten their day and it makes them feel better. Maybe that feeling is only what you need because it makes them feel that feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, it's like, you know I told you last time I didn't see any hope of attracting a man. And I'll tell you since I've been feeling that way and not getting depressed about it I do feel that when I see people that since I don't expect them, anything from them it's sort of easier to be friendly, not being selfish. I think also feeling better about yourself, all those other thoughts creep in, what does he think of me, what does she think? But I think I have much less anxiety about attracting a man and I do feel that there's more honesty (0:17:41.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More honesty?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what - if I see somebody coming out of (unintelligible) I used to think I wonder if I can attract him. But now I'm - there's no - lately I don't even think of that. It's sort of - I think it might be me because I don't know it's sort of a like, well I don't care anyways, nobody is going to look anyways so (0:18:12.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just - I'm not saying that out of self hatred.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound like you're - it's (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm giving up and not giving up. I don't have to give up hope but it's just sort of like if I missed out on that part of life it just doesn't seem like it's really that tragic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem crucial (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm getting what I can - I still hope - I get depressed but I can live with the idea better than I used to be able, you know, I can look at it. I can face it square on without becoming despondent (0:19:05.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of face the fact that it's happening to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that it might continue that way forever. And at least I can see nothing on the horizon, nothing in the near future that resembles anything like that so. I can look at that and still feel pretty good. What's that last little thing - you didn't think that I never attract anyone. You thought I had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well those dates were with, I think quite a few - those dates were with men in the asexual category. I know that sounds funny but there seems to be a crop of men around that - my friends run into them too, they're not effeminate but they don't seem to recognize any sexual (unintelligible). They would - they will ask you out to a movie or something but as a friend. Of course they become offended if you misinterpret what they're doing. And of course if you're friendly to them like invite them up for a cup of coffee they're frightened away. You're supposed to interpret everything they do as friendship and they interpret everything that you do as (0:20:47.5)....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: As a setup. And the reason I know because I know other girls that go through this. I, you know, I talked to one (unintelligible) as a friend. They're really a funny bunch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah I - just the one that I played tennis with. And there was one last - a couple years ago that was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they're people who weren't attractive. (Unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: They misinterpret it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they think because you're a girl they're supposed to pay for everything. They take you out and on a date, but yet in our society a date - maybe it's not right but in our society a date means just a man who's attractive. At least a girl can reasonably think that a man asks her out because he's attracted to her. And it is kind of misleading to be asked out and yet it doesn't mean anything. Because with, you know, I guess we're trained to think that way (0:22:00.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well they may be attractive but (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They why do they give up and - they always end up not calling. You mean they might be attracted but not attracted?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know everybody...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They always end up not going through it huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody has a kind of a certain (unintelligible) other people. And sometimes some people (unintelligible) they get too close they get a little uncomfortable and then they sort of back off. And they come real close again and if they're uncomfortable they back off. When maybe they're (unintelligible) (0:22:56.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Built why do they do it? I mean don't they know that this is - this might happen - this is what might happen. That they might have called (unintelligible) even as a friend. Don't they realize that they're getting into a situation that might scare them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (unintelligible) have you been in situation where you had kind of mixed feelings? You know, you feel one way and you don't feel the other way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think girls know as much because they don't do the asking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, let me get back to the (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm fooling with your clock because I had it at 1:30 instead of five (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay (chuckling). Think about when we started coming to therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I have a feeling that you kind of wanted to come and that you probably weren't sure if you wanted to come.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you mean this. Yeah, yeah (0:23:57.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe that's how some of these people feel. They kind of want to do something and kind of afraid to do it, not sure if they really want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That could be true. What time do you have?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have 4:30 - 5:33 (unintelligible). Are we getting to what you wanted to talk about or not (0:24:55.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I'm thinking about right now? You know, you told me about being interested in other people? That - I'm wondering if that means that I've been so unfriendly, all my life I've never been able to attract anybody. Have I been that unfriendly, that unapproachable?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just worried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just wondering. Not worried, just wondering if that's possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm certainly friendlier than a lot of people I know who - or do you mean this in combination with a physical handicap?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know what you mean by combination. I mean I would say that anybody needs to (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why do some people attract and then (unintelligible). They're selfish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, let's think about that. Some people attract other people because they're attractive and they're beautiful (0:25:56.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some people attract other people because, you know, (unintelligible) for the dramatic, you know, getting somebody else (unintelligible). There are all kinds of reasons. But...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My guess is that in many cases they're not always like this. Because people don't like to trust everyone. They don't want to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels when you're the kind of person that is always thinking about what other people think of you rather than what you think, how does this present - how do you think this presents a barrier? How do they know this? I mean is there a difference in one behavior?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think the - and my guess is yes (unintelligible). Because then what you're thinking about (unintelligible) you're anxious and you're worried and you're upset. And during that time because you're so distant and you're concerned about it, you don't have the kind of time to really pay attention to the other people around you and think about what they might need right then. And really looking to them (0:27:15.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'm 25 too [ph]. Like wants to be with me. I don't know if they need them less than the others do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What they like (unintelligible) what they like. Plus who frightens you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You mean like telling someone they have a nice (unintelligible) or something? I don't know, see I can't (0:27:56.5)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what I mean, is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What they might need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well let's take something. Let's take (unintelligible) because we haven't really talked about anybody that you know really well. What do you need from people (unintelligible)? I mean I guess what I'm saying...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Their approval.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And so (unintelligible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wanted to think they like me. I might need that. Or to feel that I look attractive that day or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I need different things from different people. There's some areas which I want one person to respect me, wouldn't care if another person didn't (0:29:03.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well say if someone asked me what a movie was like I might care what that other person thought of my opinion and really care (unintelligible). Or I might care what one person thought of my opinions but not another person. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Also the ones who you like and respect (unintelligible). And the feeling that you think they're really listening to you, pay attention to you (unintelligible). But maybe the people where you'd like them to listen to (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible) to turn those thoughts away from yourself that completely (0:29:56.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're for our security.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about, you know, I'm just giving some ideas (unintelligible) I'm talking about thinking, you know, realizing when people might - could do with a little favor. (Unintelligible) you know, give you a ride somewhere or maybe (unintelligible) helping out with this or that. Or things like, the other thing is somebody else is over in a corner and maybe going over and talking to that person awhile so they won't feel so left out. Or, you know (0:30:51.3)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'll tell you something - you know about the fellow that I met, that I played tennis with who lives in (unintelligible). You know, he was a substitute teacher. He doesn't work full - all the time. And teachers - regular teachers very often don't talk to subs that come to the schools. And so he was sitting in the lunchroom one day reading. And I just sat down and asked him, you know, what are you reading? I did this very (unintelligible) because if people are reading, I want to know what they're reading because I'm interested in that. So he started - he really started talking and we just talked for an hour. And, you know, we sort of made friends after that. But that has come to nothing. I mean...</p>

<p>((Crosstalk))</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well but he - so he'd call me up - well he - well, because he's stand-offish. You know, he's - I can't explain it but he's (0:31:56.0)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but no wait, no wait, wait. All right, that's fine. All right. So he's stand-offish, it means he's probably shy, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can't keep calling if he's - you know, like I didn't want to, you know, behave as though - as if I was chasing him. You know, I think I've done...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you ever see him around school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No he doesn't come around anymore. The last two times I talked to him, you know, I called him trying to be just a friend. And then after he played tennis with me, once he found out I was a beginner he didn't want to play with me anymore. Then I didn't hear from him until he asked me for a movie. Now - so that's a case where it didn't make the relationship good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I think he might have seen the (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe. (Unintelligible) But it can't - it wasn't a mistake to sit down and talk to him that day in the cafeteria. I mean it wasn't, I mean that wasn't (unintelligible) (0:33:07.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's something there. Well of course I know there's people who like, people who don't pay any attention to me. I've seen that too, masochists [ph]. You know, I compliment people and tell them it was nice or they have a nice...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I like it. If I like somebody's tie I'll say I like it. Not so that they'll like me. I don't think I do. I mean I don't lie about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah (0:33:55.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't make them like me any better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about listening to them? Sometimes that's another example of something that people often very much appreciate. Doing things that people appreciate, maybe that's a better word for what I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I try. I've known instances where women, a man took them out, not - I didn't do this. And the girls say (unintelligible) and they thought that the girls was (unintelligible). I've seen that happen too (0:35:02.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, (unintelligible) if you invite them over for, you know, it depends on how long you know them too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he was working there. But I've invited people (unintelligible) and you kind of rehearse it, you invite, then they stop (unintelligible) tell them how you feel about them. (unintelligible) But isn't there something else involved between attracting friends and attracting - isn't there a different feeling involved do you think, attracting friends and attracting the opposite sex in romantic relationships? Now I think just being open certainly helps you make friends but I don't know (0:36:04.4)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I think that it's (unintelligible) yeah I think that it's a different (unintelligible) talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean - yeah. I mean men like me as a friend, they like me (unintelligible). I mean sometimes they go and ask the first...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess they're (unintelligible). I guess I'm asking you something that (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you're feeling like - what are you asking me (0:36:55.9)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean what I'm saying that is on the friendship level I don't have that trouble. I mean I don't have any trouble knowing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I'm not sure that that's true. That's I guess what I meant by it. I'm not sure how good of friends you are with that tennis player. See, I mean I'm saying to be better friends with him. And sometimes friendship does and sometimes it doesn't lead to romance. But it's one way to get to really know people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think I've been nice. I've been - well, I don't know. I can't explain everything that has happened. But I'm going to be very honest and think that I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going to be very what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to be very honest with you and not hold back and say that I think I've been and open person. I'm certainly not a person that could shut (unintelligible). I don't think I (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't shut him down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No (0:37:57.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, right, no. It doesn't sound like you have. There's also another thing, I think I'm just trying to pack a lot of things in too. There's something about another way to get to know (unintelligible) people is to really try understanding them. Like now I mean, you know, it sounds like you really have (unintelligible) but like sometimes you have to do friendly, you have to draw people out sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like one time we played - went down, played tennis, he had asked me and then I - afterwards I says well when can we play again? And he said oh, we'll see. You know? We'll see - I guess I wasn't as good a player he said - that - as he was and so he didn't want to (0:38:54.4)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you sure that's what it might have been? That...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You see I can't do it all by myself. I can't be the only one who's open. I don't know what else to do. I've seen up on the tennis court, the tennis court's right across from my building and I've seen him come over there and practice on the backboard. And he didn't call me and say he was coming over to play. And I have been outside, you know, passing, coming from the store and I've seen him out there. And I've seen him, oh, when you're finished would you like to come over for, you know, coffee or Coke? And he has said, once he said that he was, you know, he was going out that night and will make some excuse. I just don't know what else I can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe he isn't interested in being invited in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that - yeah (unintelligible). But I'll certainly think about what you said and, you know, certainly getting my mind off myself is something else. And worrying about what people think of me (0:40:17.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or how often do you try and be considerate of people, to try and do something for them like that? Not just him but other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't have a car. I can't give people a ride. Or if I get a ride I give them gas or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thoughtful. I mean is that a thing you think about, being thoughtful of other people when you do it? Do you (unintelligible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I listen to my friends' problems and discuss anything - problem that they have that are wrong. And I sit with them a long time and we talk it out (0:41:04.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that sounds (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a friend who once took a (unintelligible) in Europe and I bought her some books to read on the flight. And she really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I bet she liked that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I know little things - I never thought about that. Well see I like - well it's just something that I like to do so I didn't know if it was being thoughtful or not. I just never thought about it. And I - do I speak to people? Are you saying - well, no, there (unintelligible) that I speak to in the halls. You know, not so they'll like me. If they speak back they know me. But they'll ask someone else out (0:42:28.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) you know, that's one thing you're speaking to them but you - in order to get, you know, in order to be their friends, you probably need to develop more than just speaking. You need to have conversations with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there are a lot of men that I have conversations with that don't ask me out (0:42:54.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everyone has conversations with men...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there is not the opportunity with the day schedule to get to know everyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People that people happen to talk to. Well people that you talk to depend on many factors. Depends on who you have lunch with at the same time, depends on crossing paths. It depends on interests sometimes. It - I think there are a lot of accidental factors involved in who you end up talking to for any length of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so who do you talk to - how do you talk to those people? What you make of that time you spend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I've analyzed the conversation. You mean listening to them (0:43:59.6)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't - I never analyze my conversations. You know, men are kind of funny. I'm not using this as an excuse. Men have - a lot of men, I don't know when we'll talk about - a lot of men have a tendency to be interested in talking to a woman that they're physically attracted to. More so than because it happens to be a woman that they know or they have similar interests. I know this may sound like something I'm dreaming up but I've seen this element where they see (0:45:18.3)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I know what you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The person and they like them first, then they talk. They don't talk and then decide that they like them. (unintelligible) So a lot of men are not going to talk to me in the first place simply because they're not attracted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true. That may be true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean I'm just going by, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This isn't always...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there are a whole lot of other men.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I like - certainly I'm interested in a lot of things and I certainly like to listen to people. You know, I'll have a - I'm not shy about talking. I'll certainly try to talk. Well what I'm saying - I know you're telling me all these things and you're helpful...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But (chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the thing is no matter how strong or weak I might be in these areas that you're mentioning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I might need improvement in those areas, I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm not so unfriendly that no...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean (unintelligible)...</p>

<p>((Crosstalk))</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no one's ever liked me because I'm so closed up and I'm so self centered and so selfish that how could anyone ever like me. I just don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm just making all of these gross errors.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean to imply that either. You know, but so what you're saying, if I'm not making those errors it feels like there's some other error that you feel (0:46:58.2)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I might be making errors - or I don't know if I should even say errors. I might be doing things that don't work, but I'm going to improve but I know that I can't - like if I have to become Saint Cecelia...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: To impress somebody I may never know them. Because I'll never be that perfect. I mean I'm never going to be completely without fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like really hard and unattainable when, you know, it's (unintelligible) is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, I don't think you're trying to tell me to do something that's not attainable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Watch it. No the door is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) (0:48:00.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess the only way - I guess the only thing that counts is the way I feel. I suppose I'll just stop, like I have been doing, stop worrying about what I'm doing wrong. Maybe if I'm not so worried about myself and what I'm doing wrong, maybe I'll be more natural.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe your worry gets in the way of your attitude.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe if I'm more spontaneous and more confident. Don't you think an air of confidence, to show an air of confidence?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (unintelligible) (0:49:00.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you - see the thing is when you tell someone that you don't know socially, like I'm telling you, why don't I trust people? What's (unintelligible)? Since you really don't - I know you might say well, you know, I must not be friendly or something like that. Because you can't think of anything else that it could be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well some of it just is I don't know enough about your situation. Because I'm not in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think what you're saying is true and I think you're trying to get at whether I'm really friendly or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not the word friendly because that's the word that' bothering you. Interested in other people is the word I would say. And warm to other people (0:49:57.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think there's another thing. I think what you're saying is very true. And that's that, unless we, which we don't have time like today to do. You know, what might be helpful, you know, is to day, you know, this is what happens and this is what you tell me (unintelligible) then we'd role play and see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well how can I find out if I'm warm or not? I think I'm warm but maybe I'm not. You mean warm, being responsive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) I wouldn't have thought of that word, but I guess, yeah responsive is certainly part of it, yes. I still don't have the feeling that (unintelligible) (0:51:18.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is it that people that are cold attract me? You know? Sometimes I can attract - like I think this guy is cold. And someone else that I like too (unintelligible) is cold. You know, if being warm is what attracts, well I guess I'm attracted to cold people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know there again, I haven't seen (unintelligible) time to get into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So what do I do after this (0:52:00.7)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what you do is you go out and take the test.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mr. Doublier will call you up (unintelligible) and then would you like to, you know, (unintelligible). And I guess we should stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well and there's no one to be companion to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she cannot because my sister husband had a, a, heart problem that is bothering him and the son has, he's having, uh, chemo for his aneurysm in the head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean the son and the father?</p>

And so I'm telling you.  Because sometimes I know that it's very, very seem to have something to do in your life about God but I'm just think, that's just looking about it but just like I'm kind of sad, very, very sad for what's happening to me.  And I cannot breath sometimes that's not sometimes but mostly all of the time like I doubt, I doubt my heart, like I doubt like what's wrong like, I'm not doing anything wrong, you know, that's the what I'm saying.  And like I want to stay in the hospital and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] when I, but I get sick that time for two weeks and he wants me to go, he, he tells me he wants me to let him, let me stay in the hospital but then I said no, no, no, no and then I told him okay doctor, when I'm going to see [PHYSICIAN NAME] I'm going to tell him.

And then like, I'm so, how come I'm so sad, how come I just want to, just like I don't even want to go out to the living room.  I go out but even for a while and then my sister—in—law said, what's, what you going to do again and then I said, I am going to lay down.</p>

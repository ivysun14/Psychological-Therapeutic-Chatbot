<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> So what’s happening [PATIENT NAME] ? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I had a decrease in my Zyprexa. I was accidently taking 30 milligrams a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Accidently how did you do that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I lost the 2.5 so I said well I will take the 10 and when I do that well and I couldn’t figure out why I was sleeping all day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you were taking the 10’s instead of three 5’s, three 10’s.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You were sleeping all day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah all day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That is good so she stayed out of trouble.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah well it helped me out because I got rid of my cold.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really, more rested</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hm-mm, so now I sleep on 2 milligrams, I had 20 milligrams.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, why did you go up from 30 to 2?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I didn’t want to sleep all day. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The two times we went</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I didn’t want to sleep all day. So I took 20 milligrams of and 60 milligrams of Geodon, a half a milligram of Klonopin and 1 of Vistaril. Now the Klonopin, Geodon and Vistaril didn’t seem to make much of a difference so the last 2 nights I have been just taking Klonopin 20 milligrams and I go in bed between 11 and 12 and I wake up around 9 and 10.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> 20 milligrams you can’t take 20 milligrams.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Of Zyprexa yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh the Zyprexa, but how much Klonopin? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Half.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Half a milligram?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What is the milligram on the Klonopin? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Half a milligram.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And now you are taking 1 pill?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No I quit taking it entirely.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So what are you taking now, just the Zyprexa?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just the Zyprexa.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And nothing else?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, because it doesn’t make a difference except for my back, it helps my back and my knees because they hurt. Other than that I have been taking Naproxen and Aleve for that during the day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. So you are not taking Vistaril or are not taking Klonopin…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you are still able to fall asleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That is great. Is it true?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That is what she says.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you sleep the whole night or you don’t?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well sometimes I am up until midnight and then I sleep to 10 or 11.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you sleep from 12 midnight until 10 straight through?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you wake up to go to the bathroom?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Occasionally, but now that I am off of the Lithium I don’t have to go to the bathroom now as much.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you are getting plenty of rest I hope.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I dream the whole time. I dream like 5 times a night and that is why I don’t want to get up because I want to keep dreaming. [NAME OTHER] is the one who is not sleeping. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No I have been sleeping.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He gets in bed 11 or 12 and sleeps until 9 and then he goes to bed at 4 in the morning and wakes up like noon and we miss church.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> One day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> One day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why, are you feeling more tired or you feeling?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well I am trying to go to bed and she’ll keep me up until 11 o’clock, one night she did.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What did you do to keep him up?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was talking to him.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She wanted to talk.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah you like to talk, I saw that you left me 5 messages and sometimes you talk so fast.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I talk really fast so I don’t run out of time on your answering machine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does she talk that way at home too?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Always talking too fast.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Unless I am leaving him a message I might talk really fast because I only have a second to leave him a message.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you are sleeping better and you are not talking too fast, are your thoughts racing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I mean they are at times I am not going to lie to you but basically they are not racing anymore. The only time they start to race is about 10 o’clock, I get really mad</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> At night or in the morning</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> At night, and then I take my Zyprexa and I fall asleep in two hours.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The one thing I’d say I notice about her is she will be talking like this and then all of a sudden I don’t what happens, something happens and she just gets real angry, real fast, like that. We will be talking and all of sudden she will think of something that got her angry and it will be like boom.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is it coming from the outside or the inside?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> From the, [INAUDIBLE]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That is something inside of you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I’m angry about the vacuum cleaner. [NAME OTHER] yelled at me about the vacuum cleaner and it pisses me off because the vacuum cleaner was broken so I used the steam cleaner to steam clean your room and the vacuum cleaner [NAME OTHER] got really mad and he was swearing up a storm, yelling, screaming, not at me, just at everything else in the world and I told him he had to vacuum the house then. It took him a half an hour to vacuum the house with a wand because the belt was broken on the vacuum cleaner.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The belt was broken on the vacuum cleaner. She is using the steam cleaner to try to vacuum the house but there is all this stuff flying around and you are not supposed to use the steam cleaner as a vacuum cleaner.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The steam cleaner is also a vacuum cleaner if you don’t push down the button. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> See that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It is. I vacuumed the entire house with it one night, I know it is. My sister watched me. So, now we finally got the vacuum cleaner fixed so it is not an issue anymore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you are not arguing all the time?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, it is just short little spurts that I noticed she gets….</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am very angry about the kids not being home.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It could be something totally off the wall.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well you are not ready to have the kids’ home yet.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They were home yesterday.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Just for a couple hours…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They spent the night.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And they spent the night.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Everyone all right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Everything went good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We are going to pick them up again tomorrow and we are going to go to his grandma’s birthday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She is going to be [AGE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My parents won’t let me go to [DEIDENTIFIED] it is 600 dollars.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well you said it was your sister’s fault.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah my sister is a snob. She is like you can’t go to [DEIDENTIFIED] with us because you will ruin the whole vacation. So mom and dad have to lose 600 dollars.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because they already paid for your.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why can’t [NAME OTHER] go?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because [NAME OTHER] can’t go either because he will ruin the vacation too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] said that too?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I don’t think so.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes she did. Do you want to hear what my mom told me about you, she was mad. She was like your husband is never going to change. You are not having the kids back because your husband can’t help you. She said I am going to keep the kids forever and they are going to stay at my house. Then she called me back up an hour later and she told me she was teasing me about it and she is not taking her medication on a regular basis. She tells me the reason she is having pancreatic attacks is because of me and the kids. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Having what?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Pacreatic attacks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is she drinking?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah she drinks wine and she tells me that it is my fault because the kids are stressing her out and I can’t watch them and [NAME OTHER] is not going to change, so you can’t have the children.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well why does she want [NAME OTHER] to change?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She wants [NAME OTHER] to start helping more and which most of the time he is changing and he is, but my mom said men don’t change look at your father. I go well dad doesn’t hit you anymore does he or scream and swear at you, he is just not home all day. So he is changing too. So my mom teases me about stuff like that and it gets me mad. I talk to [NAME OTHER] my neighbor and we are planning on going to the doctors and getting a letter saying that I can go back to work and then just go back to work just for [INAUDIBLE]. Then my mom is like no you can’t apply for a job.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You haven’t heard anything?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [NAME OTHER] had just sent a new letter or something to him this week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, but, now I don’t think you are ready to go back to work?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If you live with me and my mom you would understand. She is the most…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you don’t live with your mom.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No but she calls me all the time and she tells me that I can’t handle the kids, they can’t come home or she calls them [INAUDIBLE] home.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She let them come home.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but she calls when I am home right and she goes, I can’t talk to you about this I need to talk to your husband, and she asks [NAME OTHER] if the kids can spend the night, but she couldn’t ask me and I am like why don’t you ask me and then I’ll ask [NAME OTHER], but she won’t do that. She says that I am incompetent of answering such a question.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She said that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah so I live with that every single day. I have to put up with all those phone calls and I get about 4 a day. She goes don’t talk to me I am in class I just wanted to let your mom is at school, [NAME OTHER] is at [DEIDENTIFIED] and [NAME OTHER] is in Kindergarten. She will call me like two times a day to tell me that and then she will get home and I will call her and ask if I can talk to the kids. She will say you can’t talk to the kids’ right now I am too busy, I am trying to cook dinner. I am like put me on the phone with [NAME OTHER] and I will [NAME OTHER] and she goes no you are going to have to call back later. So I will call back at 8 o’clock and she won’t pick up the phone, call back at 9 and she says, Oh sorry the kids are in bed, you know, we were reading books and I couldn’t call you back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Your sister is trying to keep them?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah she is and she is driving me nuts and she goes you know what I am their mother, they stayed with me for two years, how long have you been? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who said that, your mother?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My mother did. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I get very angry about that and that is the majority of the time that is where all of my anger stems from is my mother. She doesn’t take her Cymbalta, she drinks every night, she drives me nuts, and then she blames her illnesses on me and my kids. My dad said, your boy ain’t talking, is what he told me one night and I said, yes he is talking. He walked out the door and stomped away because I would not put him in speech class. Now they are putting him in speech class in [DEIDENTIFIED] and paying the money for him to go somewhere 3 days a week from 9 to 11. So if they want to spend the money to do it they can, but I am not, because he is talking very well. I talked to his preschool teacher and she said that stuttering is talking normal, do not push him, keep him home this year and I will put him in for next year. So I told my mom that and she said, no, and that is when she decided that hell no I will never have the kids again. Then [NAME OTHER] goes over and she says I was just teasing your wife about it and then [NAME OTHER] made her call me back and say she was kidding. She said you can go to [DEIDENTIFIED] as long as it is okay with your sister. My sister is such a snot and she will not let me go because she is mad because I can’t find [NAME OTHER] pajama top that cost 60 bucks. I am like, ‘Why are you buying her pajamas that cost 120 bucks?’ She said, [INAUDIBLE] girl. So I don’t know where the pajama top is, I never seen it in my life and they keep pestering me about it. Then my father tells me that I dress too much like spring, so the next time that I go over there I am going to wear shorts and a short sleeve shirt and snow pants and just piss him off. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No that wouldn’t help I mean, you know…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He says that the blue and the white is too springish and so I should be wearing different colors, where did you get the blue top from? I told him I got it from you. Where did you get the white top from? I said my neighbor gave me all of these clothes because she is moving to [DEIDENTIFIED] for free. He said, ‘Well, what is the neighbor doing giving you clothes, they belong in a [INAUDIBLE] house.’</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He said that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah he drives me insane. If I stir the soup counter clockwise he actually takes my hand makes me go the other way. That is why I ran away when I was 22.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like he is controlling.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He is very controlling, he has not stopped that. The only thing he stopped…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why don’t you try to limit the amount of contact with him?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I try. I have very minimal contact with my father. I saw him once this week. And everytime he calls or anything it is just very controlling but he stopped swearing, he stopped throwing batteries at me. That is probably all that he stopped doing and he controls my mother like a puppet and it drives me nuts. I told my mom go to the hospital, give me the kids, I will have a babysitter watch the kids and they can fix your pancreas. ‘Oh no I can’t do that.’ I go, we have stem cells from [NAME OTHER] if they match.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Have what?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Stem cells. If they match because you can’t get a pancreatic transplant and she had 3 attacks in two days, she can’t function to watch the kids.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I gave her an attack yesterday.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Oh Gosh.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She called me up and asked me if I would pick [NAME OTHER] up from school and I said yeah. So I went and we figured out what was wrong with the vacuum, so I left that at about 2 o’clock, went to [DEIDENTIFIED], picked up the vacuum stuff that we needed and went and picked [NAME OTHER] up from school. Then we have fish and our fish tank was turning yellow or orange so I wanted to see if there was something that we could add into the fish tank or whatever, but we found out that we were just feeding them too much.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Feeding them too much?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And, yeah so the left over food will turn the tank orange I guess or yellow. So she told me what to do with it and after we left there we went to [NAME OTHER] house and in a matter of 15 minutes I had 4 phone calls.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had 3.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> From [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> From [NAME OTHER] calling me, my sister called me, my mom called me, and I think you were the other phone call.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, my mom called me 3 times in a matter of.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> My mom lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] and she finds out about it all in 15 minutes because my sister [NAME OTHER] was talking to my mom and I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like maybe we need to do a family session.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My mom called me at 3, 3:15, and 3:30. She told me that [NAME OTHER] got into a car accident and the kids aren’t here and I have to call the cops.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I wasn’t even in the car, or I was at.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Then [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] is calling and she is calling her mother and her mother is calling [NAME OTHER] and I am like mom he is on his way it is only 3:20. She said he was supposed to be here at 3 o’clock. The kids don’t get out of school until 3:15. Unless he physically parks the car and walks in the school to get her he couldn’t have gotten her any earlier. She is calling the cops, she is calling my mom, they are all frantic and I am shaking not knowing what is going on and then as soon as I thought oh he went to the pet store, I really didn’t care because I figured that is where he was at anyways. Because If I would have known 3 o’clock I would have told him to go into the school.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They don’t get out of school until, well, they get out of school at 3 but they don’t bring them outside until 3:15. So I got there right around 3:16 or something…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just the afternoon, right?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, I got there right around 3:15, 3:20.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But this is what I get angry over all day. They drive me nuts. I mean I get so angry, you just have no idea. I am dealing with this 4 times a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well that is too much maybe we need to set limits on how much contact you have.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think maybe my mom can call me once a day, at night to talk to the kids.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did you suggest that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I did and she told me that you can’t talk to your children because we are eating dinner and it is 5 o’clock, you can’t talk to your children now they are in bed it is 9 o’clock.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What if you set the same time?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I tried 7 o’clock; she won’t pick up the phone. She tells me that she is playing with the kids, she can’t pick up the phone, they are her children, and she has had them for two years. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She hasn’t had them for two years.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well that is what she tells me, ever since I got sick she says she is watching these children not me. Then she wants me to get a nanny. I do not want a nanny right now. I do not want [NAME OTHER] to come back right now because…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [NAME OTHER] wouldn’t come back now because she’s involved with…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and that didn’t work out very well. So she is like why don’t I get you a Polish nanny and I am like no I don’t want a nanny that doesn’t speak English.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The idea though is if there is a nanny in the home then the kids can move back is that it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No if there is a nanny in the home she can clean my house for me and then the kids can come back once a week. I told my mother that I will give her permission to have my kids cross the state line because the kids cannot go to [DEIDENTIFIED] without my written consent. And then I go after that they are staying home 3 times a week after [DEIDENTIFIED] because I am missing my daughter’s birthday party because they won’t let me go.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why are they going to [DEIDENTIFIED], they can’t ski, they are too young?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] can ski, [NAME OTHER] can’t and I know they are going to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are they taking both of them?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I told them…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When is this trip?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they said no.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are both going.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When is this trip?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In 10 days.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And for what a week they are going?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A week. So we are having this huge birthday party.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Everybody is going?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But me and [NAME OTHER]. And we are having this huge party for [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED] and my birthday is the day after hers so we are going to all have a party together. [NAME OTHER] doesn’t even know that mommy is not coming yet. She thought mommy and daddy were coming and she is very excited about it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to go?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I want to go, but she won’t let me go. She definitely won’t let me go with [NAME OTHER].So I told mom don’t let [NAME OTHER] go, we will take [NAME OTHER] to [DEIDENTIFIED] to visit his mom and dad, we will transfer the tickets and she just had a fit about that. I was going to go and take [NAME OTHER] sledding and snowmobiling, and maybe pull him on skis and have fun and celebrate the birthday party with them all.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How do you feel about that would you like to do that?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Go to the birthday party?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, in [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, no with your parents. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED]. We were going to originally go with them.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, I know we were originally supposed to go with them. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, I mean to take [NAME OTHER] and let [NAME OTHER] go…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> By herself?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if [NAME OTHER] went with your mom and you took [NAME OTHER]., but what about [NAME OTHER] is [NAME OTHER] going?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Everybody is going, the entire family.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [NAME OTHER] called, their two kids, everybody’s going.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My sister tells me I’ll deprive my child of a great experience if I don’t allow him to go. This is what she told me last year when I didn’t let him go to [DEIDENTIFIED]. So she drives me insane and she is really annoying. She comes over my house to have dinner with me, says my house is a little bit dirty, I have to pick up the dirt but I think you can go to [DEIDENTIFIED] with us now and then she changes her mind again because my dad comes over and gets all mad about how I don’t want [NAME OTHER] in speech class 3 times a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think that is the thing that her and [NAME OTHER] like to argue a lot?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well my father is almost impossible to deal with and he doesn’t want me having the kids so I don’t know what to do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So the fear is that if you go to [DEIDENTIFIED] you will argue with him and make it unpleasant for everybody?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, is that possibly true?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I was talking to my dad this morning, I got over this spring thing I didn’t push it at all.And so it seems to be going fine. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What if you meet with [NAME OTHER] and discuss it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I did, I called her over the phone and she absolutely refused. She said if you go I won’t take the kids. So I am just not ready to say you are not taking any of the kids and we will take them on our own vacation. That is how I feel about it. I am their mother here. She goes I am the grandmother and I want your kids, I have guardianship and you are not taking the kids. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just like you are fighting over the kids, that is not fair.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, and that’s what gets me angry the whole time. The vacuum cleaner I can get over, but the kids are really pissing me off. Because now they are like [NAME OTHER] can’t take swimming lessons until the summer because they are going to [NAME OTHER]. I said no they are taking swimming lessons this spring.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now, part of this is the pattern of the control issues that are going on with you and your parents over the years anyway.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, so now it is just refocused on the kids. There were other control issues before.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They tell my kids that mommy is too sick to watch you today and then she winds up bringing them around anyhow. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah in a few hours later she changes her mind. She is everything about the trip, and about the children.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well I</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] she turned around and told them to go right in the house.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think the way we need to change that is add more structure to the routine. You know, have them come certain days, certain hours and everybody agrees in advance so we don’t have to be switching them and that is the way it should happen. If you are well enough to do that now.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We should set up like a routine. Could you talk to [NAME OTHER] about that because that would be healthy for everybody and then you won’t get into these arguments?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I tell my mom on Sunday she can come over, I will take her to school on Monday and then she can go to your house and on Wednesday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well knowing the controlling nature then that they are going to have to be part of this. So, if you just tell them when it’s going to happen they are going to immediately react. So why don’t you have them come up with a schedule and you come up with a schedule and then we will kind of compromise. How about something like that? Say I have certain ideas in terms of how we can.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That is what I told her, I told her 3 times a week and she said if it is okay with your husband, I said I am sure. I go to [PHYSICIAN NAME] right before I go on vacation and do you know what she told me? She said, Fuck [PHYSICIAN NAME] That’s exactly what she told me. She drives me insane.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. why don’t we write it down instead of being just doing it verbally, the two of you write out a schedule and we will present it to her and you can give it to her and say think about this schedule and then give me a compromise that you think would work and we’ll kind of alter it. That will work.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay because that is the most thing that I get angry about it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, in the middle of it, but at the same time this is just an extension of all of the control issues of the past going on.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do you know what they tell me, they tell me my dad goes [PATIENT NAME], ‘I am so sorry that I yelled at you when you were a little girl, I am making up to [NAME OTHER] now she reminds me of you.’ That is what he is doing. He is as sweet and kind to [NAME OTHER] now, he doesn’t yell at her like he yelled at me. He told me outright that…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well he doesn’t yell at anyone, now he doesn’t yell at your mom.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He still yells at my mom, but.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But it is less. I think part of it is his working out; he works out like a maniac.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Which is good. Are you doing any working out?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No I am trying to [PHYSICIAN NAME] but I want to go horseback riding, it was going to be…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, it’s too cold, you can’t go horseback riding.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I have a little tread mill in the back and I go to my neighbors almost everyday and we have been kind of working out on our own.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Doing what?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yoga.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I showed them how to do it and I gave them my paintings and they gave me trees and plants and clothes for exchange.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is this the one that is moving?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you are going to miss her then?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I really only became good friends with her within the last month. So I won’t be, oh yeah, I wish she wasn’t moving but it is not like she is my best friend.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When is she planning to move?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The [DATE] of this month. So I have to go over there and get a copy of the painting because it was my mom’s painting. She told me to sell it so I did. [NAME OTHER] might be moving, now I will miss [NAME OTHER] a lot when she moves.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She is the woman from the church?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No she is actually from, the woman from down the street. The one from the church is [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you still spend time with [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. Because her dog keeps coming to my house and I keep bringing it back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And what about the cat situation?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It has been going really well. You can tell him, I’m sorry I talk so much. You tell him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It has been working out okay?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh.<B> </B> Yeah are you going to tell him about the other thing with two little ears. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The rabbit?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> All right, so maybe I got a rabbit, I told [NAME OTHER] I bought the rabbit but we are taking it back.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I just found that out about what two days ago?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had it for a month.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Where did you keep it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In the closet under a blanket. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that’s not right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, we had food and cage and water… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Do you want a rabbit?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Do you have kids?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do I have what?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Do you have kids?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I have grandkids, but they don’t want a rabbit.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Maybe your grandkids would want a rabbit?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Rabbits they are not, you know</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s a little dwarf rabbit</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Best pets, I guess, it’s a dwarf rabbit. How about [NAME OTHER] give it to [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If she wants it she can have it because it has no place to go.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really, I will ask her.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We have the cage and the water bottle and the shavings and everything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is it hard to take care of?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No all you do is give it food and water and you pick it up and it is already going like this, it is like a big fluff ball. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then you hold it real close and it holds you and eventually you could put this thing in a harness and walk it down the road.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, when we go out we’ll ask [NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would recommend it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You mean a harness, we’ll ask her if she wants it. But I am okay with the 20 milligrams of Zyprexa I mean it seems like you just take it all at bedtime and the only concern about that is the sugar level.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The sugar level has been under 120, I stopped checking it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Until…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, don’t check it, but just watch your sugar intake.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well you know what I’ve been am having a lot on sugar because my blood sugar has been dropping down to 78 and it won’t go back up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you are not checking it, how do you know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can just tell by the way my tongue tastes and things smell. Right now my tongues and my sense of smell taste a little bit like candy. So I can tell that it is either 78 or it is 120 right now. So if it starts to get worse I will.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That is a good range if you can keep it between 78 and 120.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah my face starts to sweat and my tongue gets really full of candy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you are not gaining weight?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I lost 8 pounds and now I am in size 4 pants and they are starting to fall off so I am going to be in a size 2, 3. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well keep the exercise, the yoga and the tread mill and you know when the weather warms up, if it warms up.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It will eventually.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Next week it is supposed to be in the 20’s.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that’s not that bad I can ride the horse in the barn.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You can’t ride it in the barn; there is no room in the barn.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, we will work on [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Work out and other stuff </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. So the only thing that you need then is the Zyprexa.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I will give you a prescription for that and then do you want to try to go two weeks or do you want to.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Up to two weeks seemed to works out okay. If I wouldn’t have lost my medicines, and my parents it would have been fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, you can you pump up a letter or something or?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No you and [NAME OTHER] are going to work out a schedule together and then we’ll give it to your mom. </P>

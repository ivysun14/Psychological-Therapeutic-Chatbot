<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Uhm, well the thing I started out thinking is of the mood I was in today at school, and I realize probably this was my outlet for uhm, well I, I, I, I assume it's an outlet for feelings uhm, resulting from things we were talking about yesterday, and maybe s—, last night.  But uhm, I can't directly relate, I mean, I just think, well, it must be, because there was nothing at school to really warrant this reaction.</p>

<p>But uhm, I was aware first, of this feeling when I went upstairs to the roof.  And yesterday, I'd spent a lot of time reorganizing the shed where we keep the blocks.  And we tal—, talked about how we would try to reorganize them, so that they could be kept in better state.  And today when I went up, everything was just thrown around, and it was in worse shape than it had been in for quite awhile, so that not only was everything I did undone, but it was even worse.</p>

<p>And uhm, this one teacher in particular, who was up there with the remains of the class that's before us, who, I've always felt, is kind of lazy about helping the kids learn how to clean up.  And usually she just kind of stands around, or, and talks with FLMZ at clean-up time, doesn't even do anything.  But this time she was left with a small group, and it was apparently her group that made such a mess.  And she made no effort to straighten it out, or anything, just said, well we had to go down, and uh, although she didn't say it at the time.</p>

<p>So anyway, I just felt, well this was it, that I'd just made efforts ever since we got back to uhm, keep that place straight.  And then when I'd really straightened it out myself, uhm, you know, w—, it was not so much I was taking it personally, that they knew I'd straightened it out, so they did it, but just simply that it was useless.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, but then I realized well, I, I'm probably using that as a way to let off steam.  That it really wasn't so serious.  Uhm, but I really just felt very angry at the time.  And then uhm, and then we kept going, you know, the day sort of went on, but there was sort of that feeling overlying things now, where I'd already sort of expressed feeling angry once.</p>

<p>And then near the end of the day, I found out we were having a faculty meeting today.  Uhm, and I knew that Mrs BBF had decided to have them on Thursdays, when she had them.  But u—, she used to post a note whenever we'd have them.  And she hadn't said anything, and we'd had a meeting yesterday that was unexpected to me.  (Sniff) And right now, with Mrs LDJ having to leave at 2:00, I, I really don't have much leeway if we have meetings uhm, to stay longer and finish up anything I was going to do that I would have done during the time we had a meeting.</p>

<p>So I, so again I felt very angry, that you know, Mrs BBF hadn't decided to tell us, and she hadn't told us yesterday.  And, but again, when I think of it now, I know that I was reacting all out of proportion to the situation, and uhm, (Sniff, Sigh, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, a—, a—, a—, I don't know, maybe I wasn't saying this at first, because I just feel, well, I've already really said this.  And, but I really don't want to go on to think, well why am I reacting this way.  I suppose that's why I think this next.  But I was thinking that yesterday when I'd straightened out the uhm, block shed, and organized the blocks, uhm, I had anticipated this happening.  Maybe not as badly as today, but I had anticipated that it, it would not be kept the way we had agreed we were going to try to keep it.</p>

<p>And so I had uhm, had Mrs BBF see what I'd done, in part just to see if she agreed.  Because FSL, who was really in charge of this, was not there yesterday.  There was no point in my continuing, I had half done, and I thought, well, there's no point in continuing if uhm, the feeling is, it's not going to work.  But the other motivation was so that it will be clear it was done, and then it will be clear that it's somebody else messing it up, and I did not have the courage to be more direct on who I thought was, well, of course I didn't know, so I really in a way, couldn't.</p>

<p>But I was finding it very difficult handling more directly the situation, and uhm, you know, being more specific about the s—, just calling it a mess.  Today I finally did, but I've never really even been able to be that direct before, because then it's it could be criticizing the people who leave it that way before me.  And uhm, today was the first time I dared, or whatever, it might not have been dared, uhm, to say something.  And it probably, probably I dared, because somebody in higher authority had actually seen how it was, and, and then the last class yesterday, uhm, also had left it that way.  So it became very clear, it was down to just 2 classes.  I knew which of the 2 classes I thought was responsible, but I just couldn't say.  And yet, uhm, until something more direct was done, I felt nothing ever would happen.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I, I know this is just kind of silly to keep thinking about this, because it really doesn't (Sigh, Sniff) I mean, except for the fact that I got mad today out of proportion to the event.  Uhm, because then, I was thinking, well why, why did I use that, you know, what was I really getting mad at.  And uhm, I can't, I can't think that it was, because of being here, and things that we were talking about.</p>

<p>And then I think, well, last night, uhm, MSCZ probably really wanted to make love, although he wasn't insisting.  But he was being affectionate, he wanted to hold me, and kiss me, and then I guess, he was going to see, if I wanted to make love he would have.  And I, I just felt, I can't, but I was enjoying what he was doing, I didn't feel the way I sometimes do, that I didn't even want him to be touching me, or to be near him.  But I didn't want him to then insist that that must lead to making love.  And uhm, as long as I felt that he wouldn't, I was finding I was very responsive to what he was doing, except obviously not enough.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, of course I, I don't know, uhm, when he started doing it, I said, but he had just said, "Let me kiss you good night."  And sometimes he does that, and he really just does kiss me good night if I'm reading longer than he is.  And uhm, but this time he wanted to continue.  And it was, I mean, I didn't have to ask this, but I did, because I just felt, I have to get things clear.  I don't want to go on thinking, well, he probably really wants to make love, and do I, or don't I.  And so I said, "Do you want to make love?"  And he said, "Well, I am," uhm, meaning you know, that he was in effect, loving me then, and it could go far as I wanted it to.  And I just said, "Well, I don't want to have intercourse."  And he didn't get mad at me, or you know, I think it upset him, uhm, but he accepted it.  And he didn't get mad, or didn't do some of the things he does do w, when I say something like that.</p>

<p>And I don't know whether that, I mean, on the one hand, I was relieved, uhm, and I felt a certain closeness with him, and I think he did with me.  But I don't know, maybe it bothered me too, that he didn't get upset.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, I just was thinking about school again, and I, I am aware of having this uh, well, doing what I've so often done, is to turn to school as a way to avoid thinking about my real problems.  But, only this time, I'm, aside from the fact that I'm a bit upset, in that uhm, when I was getting upset over these other things, which really weren't what I was getting upset over, then I also became more jumpy with the children, and snapped at some of them.  Or I don't know if I really snapped, but I feel as if I did.  I certainly wasn't as calm and patient as I am days when I feel differently.</p>

<p>And uhm, there were situations where I felt I reacted unfairly.  Uhm, although I think, the way I, I mean, it was nothing — I've done some worse things — it was nothing really extreme.  But it's just — and I know the kids can take it — uhm, but I just feel kind of badly, because it wasn't (Sniff), I don't like doing that.  But uhm, I'm also just very aware of wanting to think about school this time.  Not even pretending that it's thinking about problems that are really concerning me, but just that it's more comfortable.</p>

<p>And uhm, again, it's a place where there's, if I think about it, there's something I can do about it.  And maybe it, gives me a feeling, well, here's where I can do something.  And uhm, (Pause) well, I mean, th—, you know, th—, the other part would obviously be that here I feel I can't do anything, or what I want, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Hmm, what do you mean you can't do what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, first I was just (Sigh) after you said that I realized, well yes, that is it, except that I cannot even think that uhm, what is obviously in both of our minds when what I want comes up.  I can't admit that it is what I want.  I mean, I just, I can't even, uhm, now I was just thinking, I'm not even having fantasies anymore, about having an intimate relationship with you.</p>

<p>Uhm, and the next thing I thought of, was of a cat that I saw today when FSO and I went out to do grocery shopping.  And it was kind of a pretty cat, and it was, looked like it was clearly a stray, although it might have been a cat connected with, there's a, it was right outside of a meat store.  And I think they do have some cats in there.  But it didn't occur to me at the time, now I think of it, and it makes me feel better.  But at the time, all I could think is here's a nice-looking cat that's a stray, and what's going to happen to it?</p>

<p>And FSO was interested in it, so we kind of stopped.  I think have might have gone on, because I couldn't stand the feeling I get, and I get it whenever I see stray animals, of thinking of them being out, homeless.  And uhm, I don't know whether that's part of, been my feeling, you know, because of the w—, thinking of it right now of, be pathetic, because I can't have what I want.  Uhm, or just some kind of a feeling that I get because I feel I can't, of being so totally alone and isolated, and everything.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think the thing I went to thinking next, was of, uh, after I was quiet, was of, you know, the feeling I had at the end of school.  And uhm, I had to call a parent, and it, there might have been quite a problem that the parent wanted to bring up.  And one that uhm Mrs BBF wanted to deal with, if it were true, because I'm really not involved in it, because it involves the girl, this child, on the bus, rather than in my classroom.  But uhm, the mother just wanted to do some other things.  I don't know, maybe she knew there was this problem and wanted to just find out how her daughter was doing otherwise.</p>

<p>But uhm, anyway when I, I was returning her call, because she called when I wasn't free, and uhm, I, immediately, instead of saying CWGD School, I said LKC School, which I've often had on the tip of my tongue, but I've never said.  And I don't know whether it's because of habit, and it's easier, or if there's some other feeling.  Uhm, but today's the first day I think I've actually made the mistake.  And then I started thinking about, I had to call school, because uhm, Mrs BBF had left before I checked whether or not I could buy something.  I'd wanted to make some apple sauce tomorrow, and so I called in to see.</p>

<p>And I, then I started thinking about making the applesauce.  And I don't know whether what I was really thinking of was cutting up the apples, or uhm, I mean, I was putting it in terms of thinking about exactly how I wanted to write the recipe down for the children, because there's a couple of ways I could do it.  And, but somehow, I have this feeling, it really came down to thinking about cutting the apples.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Okay.  What does LKC remind you of?  What do you, what do you think of when you think of LKC?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  A lot of boys.  All boys.  And also a feeling of uhm, (Sigh) well I was in charge of only boys, and they were, and somehow I think I had a feeling I was looked up to more, and in, you know, the whole school system, and, and from the parents, and everything.  Because a lot of the parents at the school I'm at now really, they want the school to be something more than this, but on the other hand, they really look at all of us who are teaching there, as s—, you know, really baby-sitters, and servants to be given orders.  And that was much less true at LKC.  Not because the parents were different so much, as it was just at a different stage.  And uhm — (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know what really strikes me is that when you are, reacting the way you are today, with this total uh, you really obviously don't want to pursue the matter.  But at the same time, you do it in such a way that if anything's going to happen, I have to make you.  So, in a certain sense, the way you're reacting is a challenge to me to force some of these ideas into you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, well, it made me think, that just made me think of 2 things, (Laughs) made me think of 2 things.  I thought of 2 things.  Uhm, one was, that I almost had that thought of uhm, because when I was, I don't know if it was when I was coming here today you know, or actually coming down here, or whether it was when I was going home, or, you know, at some other point.  But where I was thinking of, well, what's next in the day, and what other things am I going to do in it.  But it was in, it had to be after school anyway, because I wasn't thinking about coming here until after school.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I did have that kind of a thought, of almost you know, I'm not sure how I can get back to thinking about things today that I was thinking about yesterday, but how, but yet, still the thought of, I want to finish this year.  Uhm, or at least, you know, have it as some kind of a goal, whether or not I actually do finish.  And to accept that I could finish this year, and, and that I could accept not coming back after this year, seems to be important.  Uhm, and, and then sort of wondering well, are you going to be able to make me handle these ideas in time, was kind of like the way I was looking at it, I think.</p>

<p>And I also had that uhm, I guess, fantasy, or whatever, returned again, of when going up the subway stairs at one point — it wasn't when I was actually coming here, but uh, I think it when I was going home — and there was somebody standing in the middle, you know, sort of halfway up the stairs, to one side.  And I don't know whether I would have thought it anyway, because there he was and then he was going to be behind me, and sort of wondering, what, what's he doing just standing there like that?  Or whether if was, there was something lying on the ground, and uhm, I'm really not sure what it was, except that it, it was, you know, sort of like a long tube, plastic tube.  And uhm, must have given me subconsciously, the idea of a penis, i—, i—, or you know, perhaps even more than subconsciously.  Because, again, I thought of something could be stuck behind me, into me b—, from behind.  (Sigh)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And if I won't use my penis, then you'll settle for my words.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, then I think of yesterday, when uhm, I was thinking about, I mean I, I think, if I recall I was still thinking about it when I left yesterday, and how powerful I feel my words can be, or words can be.  And uhm, I don't know, now I, I just, after you said that, I was remembering again the feeling I had when I was older, and, and you know, would ask my father questions, usually to do with political situations, probably because he liked talking about those things.  And I thought at the time I was interested.  I don't know, maybe I really was.</p>

<p>But it seems like, right now what I recall was mainly, wanting to hear my father talk.  And then of course I uhm, would use his ideas, his words, in, in other situations where I would be asked what I thought.  And it makes me think of yesterday, how I was sorry to be leaving talking with that fellow out there.  And yet it was in contrast to probably wishing that I had that kind of relationship with you, where you would talk and tell me your ideas, your opinions.  And uhm, I don't know, it's just that I had that memory of it.  It was always at the dinner ta—, at some meal, anyway, probably mostly at dinner, that I remember doing this with my father.  And uhm, the words, his words did seem to replace some other thing that I'd wanted in our relationship.  And I don't know, it could be several things, because it seems like there was a lot missing.  But uhm, that was the only way I felt close with him.</p>

<p>(Pause) A—, but I don't know, I mean, it's easy then to think, well, so I want you to tell me what you think about me, because it's the only thing you'd tell me what you think about.  Uhm, well, maybe it's both.  Because the other part is to make you make me (Sigh) think about things, or you know, I guess I really even thought of it in terms of do something, although doing something here is to think about something, consider something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, you're saying it's not enough, it's not what you want.  No, that's not what you're interested in.  What you want from me is uh, the sort of intimacy that you felt with your father.  The closeness you felt, among other things.  I suppose you'd like me to tell you what I think about AVP, the whole political situation, etc.  And that way, we could feel close, hum?  And that could lead to other things.  Then we could have a sexual relationship.  We could make love.  Those are the things you want.  And you're asking for them today, very indirectly.  In this disguised way, by the way you behave, inviting me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's funny, I'd forgotten this, but last night, uhm, MSCZ was talking about it, because obviously, it's something that had come up when we were having dinner, but uhm, you know, the political situation.  And, but, I mean, at first it was give and take.  But then he got into sort of a, I don't know, I mean, i,i, it was almost like lecturing me, although he wasn't le—, he just wanted to air his ideas.  And I didn't have as fully formed ones, or else I had, had some questions.  And uhm, anyway, he was talking on and on.</p>

<p>And, and at some point, I was very aware, here he is giving me all his ideas, just the way my father used to, you know, sort of like a parallel situation.  And I was thinking, well I do feel closer to him.  Some evenings I feel I can't sit here much longer when we're having dinner.  And I was enjoying the fact that he was telling me his ideas, and there was a feeling of intimacy, and I suppose that was continued when we went to bed, to an extent.  Uhm, but it bothered me too, and maybe because he's the wrong one to be doing it, and here he is doing what I wanted you to do.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Exactly.  Exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well I'm, I th—, uhm, I don't know.  First I think, well what does that mean, exactly, too?  Uhm, (Sniff) because I've said it, and you've said it, and, I d—, I'm beginning to feel, well I can say it, but somehow I'm, it meant more to me at some point than it does now, or I understood it better.  Or uhm, all I could think right now if I thought, well what does it mean to me right now, that, that that is the way I'm feeling, is to think that well, here I could have it with MSCZ and I'm rejecting it, and I can't have it with you, but I keep wanting it with you, so I keep rejecting MSCZ.  And at some point it's going to be too late with MSCZ if I keep going.</p>

<p>And I thought of this girl that uhm, is the only one who's applied so far that I've really liked.  And the question now is, do I wait any longer about the CHN girl that I don't know, even though the recommendation was good?  And how committed should I feel?  Because I expressed interest, so that the woman who knows her wrote.  And feeling if I wait too long on something that I had thought I wanted, because the CHN girl, when I first heard of her, was exactly what I thought I wanted.  And we have often thought it would be nice to have a CHN girl.  Uh, you know, that then I could lose what is possible for me.</p>

<p>And I kept thinking today — I tried to call the woman regarding the CHN girl, and couldn't get her.  And I kept thinking, by the time I do straighten out exactly what I want to do and then call this girl, I'm going to find out she has another job, and I'll have lost her.  Even though she told me that she would wait until Friday, and that she implied, by saying well, "I'd like to know Friday."  Because I'll know whether I should start looking again in the paper.  And so then I could infer she's not looking right now.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, but you're really talking about, if you keep this up, you're going to lose MSCZ.  He's told you as much.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, but because I am in this feeling of uhm, not wanting really to lose him, but yet on the other hand, not really wanting him when here he is, offering to me what I've thought I wanted, only not from him.  So then the threat of losing him isn't enough.  I mean, it's enough to keep me trying to sort of cover things up, and everything.  But it's not enough to really uhm, I, I just have to feel he's what I want, in order to f—, for it to be enough.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Sigh, Pause) well, so then I think, well there, there I go again to being able to take the chance that we would have to separate.  (Pause) Because you know, I'd, that would come as a result of still wanting you.  But, I don't feel, I don't know, I mean, I'm, right now, anyway, I'm thinking, but that won't happen.  So what will happen is I will end a marriage that I have now, and be alone.  And I won't have anything.  Because I will have kept with wanting something that I can't have, and then what will happen?</p>

<p>Well, well I don't know, it's almost like again, a parallel to the way I felt about when I've looked for somebody to take care of FSO, of you know, sort of feeling, well here's somebody that's nice that's come along, but will something better come along if I reject this person.  I think maybe that's what I'm thinking if I think, well, if I let MSCZ go because of you.  But then I won't really ever have you either.  Will somebody better come along who will take your place?  But somehow, that's how I ended up with MSCZ, to start with.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, I remember, that was your feeling.  You better get him lest you get no one, or no one as good.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There we go.  All right.  Now, um, [PATIENT NAME]'s [AGE].  Um, and this is her second visit.  Her major complaint when she came in the last time was temper?  She has a [INAUDIBLE] temper trigger; she's explosive, can't focus, couldn't sit still, uh, had cut herself and not feel pain, um, she felt scattered, clumsy, um, thoughts jump around for her, feels on guard all the time, but primary is explosive, unpredictable temper.  Okay.  Mom has also responded to Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And has done well with that.  Um, she is in school, has had behavior problems in the past.  Was she ever diagnosed as having, uh, ADHD?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She sure was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Back, uh, elementary school age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice tune.  Um, okay.  Now, last time, we put her on Lamictal 25 mg to 50 a day.  You on 50 now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Seventy five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seventy five, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She did, uh, 25 for a week, uh, 50 for a week.  Seventy five, she just started last Thursday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right.  Um, okay.  What's the difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a lot of people have noticed it.  Um, I don't feel like I want to yell at them all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, I'm not into yelling and [INAUDIBLE] and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll get mad for no reason.  If I get mad, I do for no reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.  Are your thoughts still racing in your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not that I noticed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Your eyes are still dancing back and forth, so probably not slowed down completely.  Um, what about, um, have you cut yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Oh, not in years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's long over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A long time ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about your focus and your concentration?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Okay.  Can you read, can, can you, can you, can you block everything out in order to focus so intently that everything else goes away or are you still being distracted?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm easily distracted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Easily distracted, okay.  Um, okay.  All right.  Do you have, do you have a lot of thoughts that pop into your head still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  And you're just at 75, so we're probably not there yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  What about, did you have, did your hands get cold before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they sweaty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you sweat under your armpits and on your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have blushing attacks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Blushing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like you get red faced and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've always been that way ever since I was a kid.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some, okay.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can feel it now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about, um, all that nausea, diarrhea when you got real nervous and jumpy?  Didn't have that, okay.  What PMS, have you had a period recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about, how was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I was kind of irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got irritable and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mom says yes.  All right.  Um, that should go away, okay?  It should go away.  Um, okay.  Um, I guess, no side effects from the medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No rashes, no nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel wired or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, you just feel normal, you feel, what's the difference in how you feel now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can just tell I'm not as irritable about stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right, so no, how about anxiety?  Is that still as much?  Any difference with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nah?  Can't tell, okay.  Um, all right.  How about the fidgets, you still got the fidgets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got to stay busy all the time, moving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Momma nods her head yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.  She can't sit still.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She can't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  No, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about, um, biting your fingernails?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I bite my nails, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How far do you bite them down to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, there is not much of them left, is there?  Okay.  Um, all right.  Um, how about tick and count your fingers, you do that too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only count my fingers in math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In math?  Okay.  How about bouncing your leg up and down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't do that.  It bothers me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can't do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you like to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, good.  I think we're there.  I think we're getting there.  Um, okay.  Um, is this okay what we're doing?  You like it?  You see a difference in yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I can feel it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can see it, if I think about it I can, I can tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, what your going get some, some of this stuff is, um, it's sort of a transition period that goes through this.  Okay?  Before you start, there's a lot of, sort of, wild feelings, emotions, and energy, and stuff like that you get.  People have trouble giving up sometimes.  And they like the burst of energy and the burst of this and the burst of that, and so what they tell me is they get real tired of being bored.  You know, because it feels like, "Ewe," like, they just feel calm and slow and this kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always feel like I have to have something to do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have noticed that, the past couple weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, because she sat home Sunday, which was the first time in eons, and I could tell she was just, like, it was killing her.  She was bored.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It really was and I didn't even think anything about it, but it was bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And she used to do it all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I could tell it was just like, ah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  What should go on is this after we get to the right, to the higher enough dosage where everything's quiet and everything's locked down, this kind of stuff, you're going to find a lot of this stuff that you thought before, is going to come back.  It's going to come back in a more modulated form.  Like you're going to get irritable, okay, mad, like everyone else does—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you'll, but it'll be something that sort of slips up next to you and taps you on the shoulder and says, "Do you know you're mad?"  You know, it won't be the jumps all over you, and you become mad, okay?  It'll just sort of tap you and slowly you get just a little bit irritated and say, "Okay, I don't like this.  This is not good," that stuff.  Okay?  Or, if you get anxious, you get a little bit nervous rather than having a panic attack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  And, uh, if you feel, if you get agitated, if you feel jumpy and this kind of stuff, you get a little jumpy, but not overwhelmed.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be able to sort of sit down and relax and not fidget.  And being able to sit down and read something rather than feel like you got to get up and move all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, sit down for three minutes and get up and go do something else and sit back down and do something else sort of thing.  Okay?  That should go away too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right.  Um, so.  Now, do you want me to call you in?  If you give me the name of the drug store, I can call you in some, the prescription.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you've got some, you got some left.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's got a few, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can write one or call it in.  It doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me call it in.  What's the number?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Walgreens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Either one.  [DEIDENTIFIED] you can call in.  We can get it either way or [DEIDENTIFIED]'s good.  I just happen to know the number off the top of my head.  I'm pretty sure.  [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].  Okay.  Well, I'll call you in some 100's and after she's been on 75 two weeks—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then go up to 100's.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then we'll stay there for a little bit, and then if things are not locked down completely the next time you come in, then we'll go up a little bit further, the 125, 150.  We're going to try to get you on just a little bit of medicine, as low as we possible can.  Okay?  I know that 100 mg does sound like lot, but it's really not that much.  Um, and what we want to do is to get you so you don't have any problems, okay?  Now, one thing you have to do here, we have to look at, um, I'm going to be embarrassed.  Okay?  Um, make sure that you're taking some folic acid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I am.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Took a lot of time finally buying [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Okay, good.  All right.  That's good.  We don't want any open spine babies.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So I couldn't figure out why she needed that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay, we don't want to do that, okay?  So, that's the thing with that.  And you're not taking any kind of birth control pills or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are?  Okay.  Um, are you having any breakthrough bleeding or any kind of problems with that or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But that's why she's on them, but she's not having a problem now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Now, if you do have any kind of problem with that, okay, you may want to, uh, increase you dose a little bit, because sometimes Lamictal can decrease the Estrogen level by about ten percent and that can decrease the Lamictal by ten percent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  So, you need to watch out for that.  If, if things aren't as regular as they normally should be, then, well.  Other thing, there's some birth, you might not want to do this, but there's some birth control pills which she'll have a period every four months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if want to do that though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's scared of weight gain with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the pills?  You get weight gain with menstrual cycles, with birth control pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, but I think she's kind of iffy about waiting four months.  You know, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I thought that you gained weight from that kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, what you do is you gain weight from, uh, increased Estrogen before you have your period, so you have more water retention, and then the bloating all gets up there and then that goes away once you start—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's not true weight gain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not true weight gain.  It's just water weight.  Um, although some people do gain weight on birth control pills.  Some people lose weight too, so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just kind of play that by ear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we'll do that.  All right.  Um, I guess that's it.  All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All righty, uh, and I'll need to see you back probably in about a month or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?  Click.</p>

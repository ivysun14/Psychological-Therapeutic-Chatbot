<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) Mm, I was just thinking about being late, and that (Clears throat) had a particular feeling about it.  And it reminded me of a feeling I had after I left yesterday too, a similar way of thinking, I guess.  And I don't know, I'm very hesitant to say either one.  I, I think it's because (Clears throat) both of them seem to be uhm, well I suppose one way,  it would be just thought of as self-assertive.  But in another way, I, I, it just seems very selfish, or something.  Or (Sniff) it's, anyway it's the kind of thought that I guess I never like revealing to anyone. </p>

<p>But (Clears throat) when I was, when I knew I'd be late, uhm, my feelings about it initially were much more, I was keeping you waiting, rather than thinking that I was losing time for myself.  And uh, then when I got here and saw the meeting going on, I knew there were meetings on days like today, but I th—, I guess, usually they're over.  Or I don't know, but anyway, when I saw it going on I felt even more guilty about being late, because you'd had to l, leave early and then you could have stayed longer, or something. </p>

<p>And uhm, but then when I came in here I started thinking that just, just more I don't know why I should be feeling, always feeling guilty fo, for your part, and not, I don't know, I was just thinking, that there is a lack of feeling, well I've missed something for myself by not getting here on time.  And what I was thinking yesterday when I left, was uhm, mm, it's hard to remember now exactly, but I think, I think I was feeling that, well I mean, it was clear, I kind of got off what for a short time was concerning me.  And that obviously you think is important on my basic relation with MSCZ, and, and just what's going on there.  And uhm, I can't remember now what I was thinking about at the very end, but when you said the time was up, I interpreted your tone of voice to mean sort of uh, I don't think exactly criticism that I hadn't stayed on the other, but sort of resignment, or something. </p>

<p>And, uhm, and at first I suppose because I read this into your voice, I was also feeling I hadn't done what I should have done, and you were disappointed.  And then, then when I left I felt sort of angry, probably at you and at myself.  And uhm, I don't know, it just, i—, i—, somehow it seems similar to the way I was just thinking about being late, but I can't remember (Sniff) exactly what I was thinking.  I'm not sure I was thinking a—, i, in, in a sort of angry way, well, I'll, I'll think what I want to think, or whether it was more just sort of it wasn—, it isn't so terrible to get off the subject sometime, although it seems like I'm — when it gets on to this type of subject — I'm usually managing to get off. </p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) and the next thing that comes to my mind (Clears throat) — I really don't understand why this would come to my mind next  — uhm, something happened today that I've been afraid might happen.  And I've known I could do something so it wouldn't, and I've never done it.  Uh, FSO, I have some plants out in the foyer by the elevator, and uh, usually when I water them, I, I do it very quickly, and FSO often likes to come out while I'm doing it, a, and walk back and forth across that little hall.  But I today I gave one plant too much water so that it was spilling over, and — or actually, it came out underneath — and I had to clean it up. </p>

<p>And she'd gotten kind of tired of playing out there.  And I think she, it was very close to when I was going to feed her and she was going to have a nap right after, so she was tired and hungry.  And uhm, she was sort of fooling with the door, and I had the doormat so it would take a while to close it, although she could push the doormat out of the way.  And all along I've known that all I have to is push one of those little buttons, and then it would cause the thing that locks automatically not to lock.  And I've never done it, I've always gone out thinking I've really got to watch, because FSO might lock me out.  Well, today she did.</p>

<p>And so I, I can't help thinking, I really sort of wanted it to happen.  And then I just had an awful feeling, well I was afraid of one thing.  Uhm, right now the front elevator's not working and I assume there was a way, well I mean i—, there are stairs, so even if they only had the front door keys, which is what it turned out, we could go up, climb all the way up the stairs again.  But uhm, I was afraid they didn't have the back door key, which they didn't.  And all I could think at the time that she locked me out was, what if they don't have any keys? </p>

<p>And th—, I, I don't know, it was a situation where I felt very upset and nervous, but yet I wasn't worrying so much about FSO as long as I got in again fairly soon, because I knew she would be alright for the time it would take me to get back in, which, which was true.  And she sometimes shuts doors on me in rooms where I can open them again, and, and I knew that initially, she'd go through just being sort of angry.  And then it would take her awhile before she'd get frightened. </p>

<p>But I still felt very upset, even after I got back in.  (Pause) And when I think of, o—, uhm, in a sense, I suppose my thinking about wanting to shut MSCZ out, and wanting him to go to work yesterday.  And then, last night he came home fairly early and was still not feeling well.  And so I was thinking, well maybe he'll stay home today, and I didn't want him to.  I mean, obviously, if he felt ill, then I'd want him to.  But yet on the other hand, I was hoping he wouldn't feel ill so he wouldn't be around.  I, it was sort of a feeling of, well I think of it now as shutting him out.  And — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And in a very similar way, it seems to me, by coming late you sort of shut me out.  At least you, you're saying something by it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Yeah, I suppose I am, but I, first I was thinking  well — I mean I did make a choice at some point — but uhm, I was thinking that before that point, it had always been possible for me to be on time.  But in a way I suppose it really wasn't.  Because uh, w—, originally what I had wanted was for FMX to baby-sit longer yesterday, because it's easier for me to do anything I have to do after coming here than before.  Because then, if I'm a little late getting back home, I can just pay FMX more.  And uh, mm, today, since I get out late, I was afraid I wouldn't have enough time, if she baby-sat on that side.  So she could come an hour earlier.</p>

<p>And at first my reaction was well, that really won't be long enough.  Then, then I thought well, I don't know, I just decided to do it.  I don't really know what I thought.  And all along I knew that it really wouldn't be enough time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I think, you know, that really the main part of it is, that uh, it's very clear that you do want simply to not think about, and not consider and not dwell on your angry and destructive feelings toward MSCZ, and your ideas connected with him.  And at the end yesterday uh, you attributed to me resignation, because you'd changed the subject.  But that's, that's, you don't want to.  And I think essentially, that's why you didn't come.  Then you can stay away from the subject as you got away from it yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) Well, right now I'm feeling I don't want to go off the subject, but I, I don't know whether it's just another side of it, or if I have, because I keep thinking of well, 2 things.  Uhm, one was just some article in the paper I was reading, or I don't know if it was the paper or MBV, or what, but, about uhm, somebody's ideas on couples marrying, so that I don't know, you'd really be living in sort of a community, all married together. </p>

<p>And I, didn't give any details how it worked, and I was just finding it impossible to imagine how it would work.  But on the other hand, I wanted to know the details, and uh, and then I was thinking also about Winston Churchill's mother, and the TLB is right now running sort of a uhm, shortened edition of the second volume about her.  And uh, just thinking about how she had innumerable affairs, and again I guess I probably was wondering how she could do it, how she could feel an attachment to so many men and change so much.  (Sniff, 4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, I was also thinking about, just various things that show I'm always thinking about being pregnant again, or I mean, it's on my mind in someway or other because, well I was, I don't know what I thought of before this, but I was thinking about the winter coat I'd gotten right after FSO was born, and then I had to have it taken in quite a bit after I lost weight.  And I guess I was wondering how it would fit me after I have a second child, er and I don't even know if I'd want to wear it then, but uhm, (Sniff) th, this is sort of typical, the way I've been thinking about my clothes, lately.  And it's almost as if being pregnant, now it's going to revolve around how I feel about my clothes. </p>

<p>And again I, I'm just very aware of thinking of it as something I'll do, and it's almost as if MSCZ will have nothing to do with it.  And there's no feeling about the baby after, I mean, anticipating a baby after it's born.  It's being pregnant, and then I guess probably finding out what I was pregnant with, and that's it.  At least with FSO I guess there was some I, I couldn't think much about how it would be after she was born, I remember I had trouble when I was pregnant.  But I don't know, it seems like any of the feelings that I'd had sometimes about having children, I, I now satisfy just with her.  And so, when I think of being pregnant, I'm really not thinking of having 2 children.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking too about some feeling I get from being thinner.  And it seems like I in some way get the same feeling, either from being thinner, or from being pregnant.  Uh, and it's uhm, I don't know exactly what it is, but somehow it seems like it's an aggressive thing toward MSCZ.  At least, certainly being thinner seems to be, even though he'd wanted me to lose weight, and I did too.  But uhm, he really was putting pressure on me to and uhm — (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was thinking about our bedroom, then I started thinking about clothes again, and uhm, this time resale shops, but there are 1 or 2 I know of w, where people I've either heard of or I know, have gone and found some very nice things.  And I was both thinking I should go to them sometime, and then also just thinking about the people who sell their clothes there, and I don't know, I guess wondering what that's like too.  Because th, they must have a terrific turnover in their wardrobe.  But uhm, th, then I start thinking about the bedroom again,  nd I don't really want to think about it. </p>

<p>Uhm, and I'm coming around to feeling maybe I do have an attitude MSCZ has said I have, that I've always denied, because that's the one room in the house now, that essentially is a mess.  And uh, it can only be that way, probably because we have probably no furniture in it.  But still it is almost a mess.  And I have all these reasons why I still haven't been able to pick it up, and things I haven't gone through or thrown away, and that's where any of my piles are.  And uh, I always sort of feel I intend to get at it soon, and then, well today, I was planning to, and some aspect of it took me the whole morning.  And I don't really know why it — I'm thinking maybe it really shouldn't have — and it was more, I really don't want to pick up the bedroom.  And it's driving me crazy now, too, so that I would think I'd want to.  But uh, mm, I guess I was just wondering if maybe it is some kind of a, again, aggressive thing to do to MSCZ, because I know it drives him crazy. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

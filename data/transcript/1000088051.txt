<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'd just like you to - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Huh?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'd just like you to start wherever you feel you want to.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it sure would. It would be fun to meet here if you would ask questions. It doesn't go that way, huh?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'll ask you (audio gap) how you're feeling or what is on your mind.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that kind of depends on, you know, what mood I'm in. Today - about all week everything (audio gap) running pretty smoothly. My husband has been nice to me. And I really don't have that many gripes. Now, next week might be another story. You can't say. It really, you know, if he is all right, then I don't have any complaints; which makes my life sort of uneven all the time. You know, I don't know from day to day what he is going to be like, if he is going to be decent to me or not. Sometimes, I think he is just sort of looking for something to fight about [and say these things that is kind of cruel] (ph). I mean, that might be my own exaggeration.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it sounds like - so now, it just seems like it isn't anything you do at all is just like the way he is feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so, really.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And sort of like the way he is feeling is a detriment. [0:01:42.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think (ph) so. I don't know. Yeah, like last week, I had thought about all these things I was going to say, and then I found out I was [taking a test] (ph). That just sort of shot me down.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it must been a heck of an anti-climax for you, so upset to come in.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because you really have to work yourself up to it. It is sort of the pits sometimes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It must have made you feel - I don't know what exactly.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But kind of cheated or - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I thought. Well, I am now am going to have to build myself up again. But I didn't. I took the children all day, and I didn't have time. It is easier for me in the morning if I think about it during the night. I can't sleep, but I think about it. But today I'm feeling all right. Tonight we'll see where it takes us. So are there any answers for any questions? Do you ever answer anything? You know, like what can I do? Am I going to solve all - some all my problems - if they're solved, myself?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. I don't know. I kind of think we're going to do something together or something. But [you're kind of] (ph) coming into this sort of expecting the most minimal kind of response from me.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I really don't know what to expect. And I don't know, you know, what I - if I'm just supposed to sit and talk for an hour about anything that is on my mind, that is it? And then what happens then? [0:04:03.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you don't see very much happening from that kind of thing?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't know what to expect. I don't see that it can be that beneficial, because I could sit and talk for an hour or two with myself, couldn't I?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But by - sure. It might as well be you. If you're saying if all I do is talk for an hour, I might as well be talking to a blank wall. What do I need you for?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Is that what is going to happen?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so, but - 

</p><p>PATIENT: I hope not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I kind of sense you're sort of poking at me a little bit. I'm not clear. Is it getting apprehensive?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I do, because you know, like I've - I think on the surface, you know, people would be just utterly shocked. Well, not everybody. But like, my neighbors and friends would, you know, what is wrong with her? And I'm not real - and I don't, you know, I have never told anybody that there is anything wrong with me. So why start now? [0:05:30.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That sounds like - 

</p><p>PATIENT: It is kind of embarrassing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It is embarrassing and uncomfortable to be here and to say there is something wrong with me. And you don't like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't. But it works sort of, you know. For years you work to keep it covered over. And then it is kind of blown apart.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like - it sounds like years of effort trying to push it down and smooth it over, and then have to come in and show all your ragged edges?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I really have never really thought - I really guess I've never really thought too much about what was wrong with me. Because before Jim (sp?) was interested in psychology, I thought every thing was - well, I didn't know what to expect out of a marriage. Who does? And we looked around, and we thought we were doing okay. But I think when you get in a college atmosphere, it really - the people are so much different than our friends in Springfield (ph), cooler (inaudible at 0:06:58.0), who really have nothing between [them that couples] (ph). The husbands realize that on the golf course or in the beer hall or someplace. And I thought because my husband was home occasionally, I was doing pretty good. Of course, we still aren't doing anything at home. I mean, there isn't that much conversation. I'm not interested in doing enough in what he is doing. I don't even know what he is doing, you know, what he is studying. And I just really think he has really kind of grown away from me. [0:07:39.3]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're really out of contact with him? He is like in some ways a stranger?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, no. I probably don't even know him that well. You're quite used to them being one way. Like any night you'll see a stranger, and you'll know just about the same amount about them as I do about my own husband. I wish I could cry and get it all over with when I kind of start this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could get all the tears out of you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Out, so I could talk normally.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You're sort of stuffy and you can't breathe?] (ph) You can't talk and you can't cry.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I really feel like I'm going to have to change myself, because I'm not going to change my husband. But I don't want that. But I don't know what to - really what to do other than get an outside interest, whatever they may be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It kind of sounds like you're sort of given up on getting closer to him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think I could be closer to him. So I read his psychology book. But he doesn't, because I don't do it that much. I'm not interested in that much, you know. I like to read, but I like to read novels - historical novels. And he doesn't. He really doesn't have the time. I think he has read one novel in seven years. I mean, he reads all the time, but it is not the same thing that I read. I mean, I try and pick up through the papers or in a Newsweek or a Time. I don't know all of the history that has gone before. And I can't catch up. So pretty soon, I loose interest in that, too. Because I really don't know, you know, I base my opinion on what I read in that column. And then he says, "Well - " [0:10:30.3]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you only knew - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah such-and-such - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - you wouldn't think that.

</p><p>PATIENT: So maybe he thinks I would think that, anyway. I thought about getting a job. It would have to be a part-time job, because I don't want - I was brought up so that you were the wife and mother, mainly the mother. And you don't go out and work. So I'm really kind of trapped. I don't really do that much at home. I'm not that great a mother that they wouldn't, you know, they could survive for a - every morning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They could do without you, but the kinds of standards you carry around, it is kind of though you don't do that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is wrong.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think - I don't know if I really think it is wrong. I know that my parents would, [but I don't mind]. (ph) "Leaving your children? You don't know anybody in New York. Who would you leave them with?" Nobody is good enough. I don't know. Jim (sp?) is not (inaudible at 0:11:57.8). He is coming home from work and he is - [0:11:58.7]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So nobody is [still trying to be] (ph) working with you?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Really, the women I know think that the woman should have her own identity. And I really feel like, I don't have the ambition to go on to school. I'm not a student. I don't enjoy that kind of studying and doing that. But I'm sure that they would think higher of me if I was out doing something, having my own life. But I don't know if that - I mean, I know that's important to me, what other people think about me - more so than what I do. It is like how are they going to feel about it? But I don't know if want to that far or not - getting a job to please anyone. The money would certainly be nice. We don't have any.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The money would be nice, and your girlfriends would think, "Boy, there goes someone who is having their own life." [0:13:29.3]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. We were talking about that last night. And I wasn't real sure what Jim (sp?) thought. He doesn't really agree with the Women's Liberation. It is a complete division of labor. He doesn't want that, because - he'd like me to work. He has already mentioned that it would be nice, because he couldn't find a job. That's the only reason. He would have to get the (audio gap) some money or [some clothes]. (ph) So I guess that would be - I really wouldn't mind it if I had a part-time job. Maybe. I'm not that sure. It would depend on how it would work out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by that? I don't know what that means.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, if I worked in the afternoons, if Jim (sp?) was home to watch the children, because I have to have a babysitter. And I wouldn't want my children with a babysitter. And that babysitter gets sick, and then there is somebody else that comes in. And it is just too much of a mess; although, they would like a babysitter. Their friends' mothers' work and that would be - [0:15:14.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, what you're saying now sounds like you've got kind of practical considerations on the sorts of things that matter about whether you get a job. You could get a job if the practical considerations were all work out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. If it was an ideal job, where you had your hours. If your children were sick, you didn't go in. If you had somebody responsible to take care of your children, I mean every woman would do that. I'm sure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you'd jump at it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really would, because I really get bored and especially in the wintertime. I mean, the kids are in the house all the time, and you can't move without the - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Tripping over a child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you can't go to the bathroom. "What are you doing, Mom?" "I'm standing on my head. What does it look like?" And there is no time that you can be alone. And Jim (sp?) said, "Well, they're outside playing all day." Well, you try and do anything even down to polishing your finger nails. Somebody comes in and you have to leave. I mean, a woman's plight is really bad. They never, ever have any privacy or any freedom. Well, Jim (sp?) says you don't need freedom.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:47.3) But when you're sitting there with the four walls in December and the children are screaming, you've got to get a moment for yourself. It feels like your head is going to split.

</p><p>PATIENT: I just can't explain [it to him at all] (ph) or think fast. I'm working up to trying to (inaudible at 0:17:09.1). And that's another thing, I never really argue with him, because I always know he is going to win. So all I do is scream. [0:17:21.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you know that you're not going to (inaudible at 0:17:25.8)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. For one, you're going to get [it wrong.] (ph) Really, he is so logical. And I'm very illogical. I'm right and he is wrong, and why even talk about it? He never agrees with me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like not only does he never agree with you, but he always - I'm not sure if he gets you to believe what it is he is saying?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, he does. And you can see that, really, he is right. And that really deflates your ego year after year, day after day.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Has it made you feel - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Very stupid.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - second rate?

</p><p>PATIENT: Mainly, when it comes to disciplining the children. He [doesn't like to.] (ph) He has always read something that says you do [it this way.] (ph) (inaudible at 0:18:30.2) I think the longer I've lived with him, the stupider that he makes me feel or be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like day in and day out, year in and year out, he sort of whittles away at your self defense in the sense of being or having any intelligence at all. I guess some days you feel like (inaudible at 0:19:07.7)?

</p><p>PATIENT: There are a great many days I feel like that. Unless, I'm with my friends. And they let me speak occasionally.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel all right with them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do. But he is a little jealous of that, too. In fact, (inaudible at 0:19:29.4) I have two friends that I'd rather be with than him. Really, I have more in common with my friends. We sit around and talk about things or books, which I think that either of them read. We read novels. It's not always, you know [it's the traditions here] (ph) you use. And that is really kind of a shame, I mean, that I would rather be with my friends than my husband. I mean, [a good lot of the] (ph) marriage that I - we just followed each other around, because we lived next door to that. And I think - I mean, they really do. They have a good marriage. I would think. But I'd be awfully bored with the same person all the time. [0:20:27.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you don't want that, then it sounds like you're also feeling like it's just - oh, I don't know - sort of a waste that you go see your friends, because now you're married?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's not what marriage is all about. Is it?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like that to me.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if I had to live that anyway.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem right.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it really doesn't. I don't know. My parents always talked about things (inaudible at 0:20:59.8), which was fine then, I guess. It was what my father did, and that's what they talked about.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They shared things.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Some things in Behavioral Science are interesting, but I'm not going to - I can't. I'd have to have a Ph.D. to even go to the same courses as he does, to be able to talk about it. I mean, that seems very unreasonable, because I couldn't even get through college.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you couldn't even make it through something that is relatively simple in college, how could you be expected to experience more of higher-level, more difficult courses you were expected to do? It sounds like you're saying, "I didn't even have the - "

</p><p>PATIENT: Gumption to study. And I still don't. I still would not have studied, you know? I don't have that interest to go to school, whether it's (inaudible at 0:22:17.0) or not. I think if I could take my courses, (inaudible at 0:22:23.1) Educational Psychology. But you all have to go through that, before you get to anything that interests anybody. If could pick and choose my own courses, without having a prerequisite. It's like somebody ought to shut up and fail, I think. But it would be the same thing as it is with the Time and Newsweek, I wouldn't want to back track. I wouldn't be able to show my opinions [there] (ph). [0:22:58.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that wouldn't even work either?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, but you have to try, maybe. It's something to do to pass the time, but I just wish that I had some sort of interesting hobby besides reading. Even [to sew]. (ph) That's not something that we could talk about especially, but he could at least compliment me if I put something together right. And that's the real problem with that. But especially, my real big problem is I don't have any interests, really. I'm a really superficial person. I guess that's probably why I feel stupid all the time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you say superficial, it sounds like you feel like you don't have any core or substance to you. You're just sort of flighty.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't. Well, I'm not flighty, but I'm not really too deep - shallow (inaudible at 0:24:18.5).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, nothing (inaudible at 0:24:24.4).

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Why sort of waste your time? If you're already doing something, isn't it something constructive? Everybody else seems to be doing something constructive?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Are you simply watching it all pass by] (ph), doing nothing?

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't seem to be interested in anything anybody else is. Jim (sp?) wants to get involved in politics. I don't know that much about the candidates to really voice an opinion. I may be on the wrong side. You never know. [0:25:32.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like you've finally found something that you're involved in - 

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's the wrong people.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - but you're around a terrible person.

</p><p>PATIENT: And in New York, you can never be really safe. No, I was asked to work over in the [Central Park] (ph) (inaudible at 0:25:56.1), as a - I don't know what they wanted me to do. It was something volunteering. But that would mean I'd have to get a babysitter for the children. And that is something again, that would be kind of fun to do. But it would cost me money to volunteer to do this. And when you're a student, you just can't volunteer. I mean, if you're going to be outside the home paying a babysitter, you better be making money to pay the babysitter for that. Somebody's going to come up a little short if you're not [making money] (ph).

</p><p>Because I really do feel like we're doing everything for my husband, all these sacrifices.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that he can go to school?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, you've been at school, and what am I getting? I'm not really getting anything out of [my life] (ph) or his school. It is going to mean that he is happy in his work, but that's not going to change his home situation.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He is going to be the same toward you and your - what you get out of it then is something like boredom, emptiness, and resentment? [0:27:23.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: But until he started reading books on psychotherapy, I was not - I mean, I was just really content. I just kind of floated along daily, looking forward to Bridge games. Our house was clean. The children were all right. And he is the one that has really disrupted my whole life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were doing all right until he started dabbling in this. And all of a sudden, it's not right anymore.

</p><p>PATIENT: If he messes up my life, and then he skates about doing what he wants to do. I'm going to be very bitter. (inaudible at 0:28:10.4) if he doesn't watch out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he leaves you to pay the consequences?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, he is the one really pushing me to come here and go through this. Well, I don't know. "If you aren't going to put anything into it, then that is not really helping you out." You're just going to be the same. It's just going to be a waste of time. So he is really not expecting very much out of you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying that I'm here because he wants me to be here.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that's why I came in the beginning. But I would like to improve myself, just to prove to him that I could.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of as a challenge, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, like a dare. "You can't do this."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'll show you.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I'm really not that confident that I can, because I think our problems - and Jim (sp?), since he has been going here to school and reading, it's gotten worse. I don't want anything to do with him, because he is - well, he says it works both ways. And I guess it does, because if we have intercourse then I expect him to help me and be nice to me. But then I think that when he is nice to me, then he expects me to get into bed. [0:29:49.7]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like if he does something, like he says a nice word - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, then he expects you to hop in the sack with him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that is - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That is not how you operate.

</p><p>PATIENT: That is not my function in life. Well, I guess it is, but I don't enjoy it. And I never have really enjoyed sex, but it has been getting so much worse.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Since he started reading?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, not because he reads; but because he tells me all this and that we really don't have a good sexual relationship. And I know that. But if nobody mentions it, I can (inaudible at 0:30:35.9), where he can't. It doesn't mean that much. I mean, I would like to climax. I think that would (Interruption: Telephone) that I should. (inaudible background conversation) You should but it would never - yeah, I guess maybe if was time for you to die and you'd never had - you've been married so many years and you've never climaxed, you'd really think you missing [something] (ph). [0:31:37.6]

</p><p>I mean, I really think that I would really enjoy sex if only I got something out of it, but it's getting so much worse. I mean, when we were first married, it was all right. I didn't cry (ph) about it, like you hear all the jokes. "Oh, she has got a headache." "She is tired." It wasn't something I wanted to do, but I did it. And I tried. I thought I tried, but I didn't know how to try I guess. You can read a lot of books, but they just don't - I mean, they don't say sex. So how do you reach your climax? I don't know what you have to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were saying, too, something like when you first married, you didn't like it especially, but you tried. And you did it (inaudible at 0:32:44.3).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, we had troubles, because we were so ignorant. We didn't even know where his penis was supposed to go. I mean, that is really stupid. We didn't know anything, and it hurt. Well, I didn't even know it - well, my mother said it does, but it's a wonderful experience. It might have been to her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All it was to you was sort of pain and difficulty.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't think it is all it is cracked up to be, for me. I mean, a man always gets their pleasure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And your life is just empty?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I'm really - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You do it for him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but my whole life is for him and the kids. So why not intercourse, I guess? But I want to get something out of something sometimes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Instead of nothing out of everything all the time (inaudible at 0:34:03.7).

</p><p>PATIENT: In the last week really, I did kind of get sick to my stomach when we were in bed. It's just I've had it. It's not fun. (audio gap - muffled) And he did it. When we were first married, he tried awfully hard. And now, he said, "Well, it is not going to do any good." So my thought is just get it over with.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you've given up. He doesn't even try to bring you to climax.

</p><p>PATIENT: I used to even be in the frame of mind, and now I can't even get worked up to where I [ever - I wonder] (ph) we knew what we were doing. [Why don't you go to Master's Lab?] (ph), and that doesn't sound too bad (ph). [0:35:13.2]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You could have thought of something there?

</p><p>PATIENT: Supposedly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sure feels like you're not going to move it all?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think that - I mean, I'm not going to feel differently about him. We were talking about were we even in love when we got married or was it just convenient. My folks wanted me to marry him. His folks wanted me to marry him. He was in the Service. He was lonely. I wasn't getting along in school, and I'd get migraines when I'd head for a class. And I had to go to class a lot. And so why not get married?

</p><p>And I don't know if I've ever really felt - well, I don't know how you're supposed to feel. He really doesn't turn me on that much. He never did. He is a nice fellow.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He is a nice fellow, but not someone that sort of makes you - I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, he really isn't. And I don't think I'm doing that for him anymore either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Doing what for him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Turning him on just by being around.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you've sort of ceased to mean all that much to him either?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm sure. We're just kind of used to living together. We have children. We don't fight, but we don't have that much - we don't have anything together though, except our kids. [0:37:02.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just started living together out of inertia - inertia and the children.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I doubt if either of us [could just] (ph) pick up and move apart.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How come?

</p><p>PATIENT: For one, I have the ammunition (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Beg your pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, I couldn't while he was in school. He'd have to try and find a (inaudible at 0:37:36.6) to support, you know, pay child support. But I wouldn't have the courage to leave him, unless he started leaving me or - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Unless he drove you out of the house.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would have to be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because the thought of leaving him is frightening thought for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I wouldn't like to live alone, it would be a pretty boring life. I mean, even if you were working, there is nothing to come home to. Taking care of the children without someone to help - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That is even a duller, (inaudible at 0:38:23.3) existence?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's hard. I don't think you can do it. I mean, the children would suffer, because it's not like we are openly hostile to each other. I mean, in that case, if you just really - you couldn't stand the sight of either person; he couldn't stand me, and I couldn't stand him; then I would.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like if it were openly negative between you two, that would a clear cut case where you could just pack up and leave?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there is something about the fact that you all don't scrap and argue so much?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, we get along if he is in a good mood. I can get along generally with most anybody. If I get to know someone like a friend and really get to know them, and I really don't accept all their shortcomings, like I would his. But I'm starting to be convinced that he doesn't have any. (laughter) [0:39:37.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: From that laughter, it sounds like he hasn't done such a good job.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, everything I say (inaudible in 0:39:51.7). He will never show any warmth or affection to me. Well, he will say he can't, because there was never any warmth or affection in his house, you see. And he can't change his behavior. That's why he is going to come here, to change his behavior, so that he can be a little more affectionate (ph) and warm. I don't know that much about behavior. (inaudible at 0:40:27.3) a little more affectionate and warm, then he just can't be a little more affectionate and warm. I'm not quite sold on that - if he worked a little harder at it, because he is very good with the girls.

</p><p>He is a very good father. He tries to look affectionate and warm with them. Why can't he be to me? So his father wasn't with his mother, so consequently, he can't. And I sometimes wonder if he isn't using just that education. A little education can be very dangerous with my husband. He reads something and comes home, and we're not supposed to do this with the girls. We're supposed to do this, this, and this. [0:41:12.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like all he had to do is read a little bit and then he goes off half-cocked, relating everything to - seeing with whatever theory it is he happens to be reading.

</p><p>PATIENT: And he usually does say things, too. And he usually is right, except with the children. You'll never know until like say, they're grown and they say, "Listen, folks. You really messed it up with us. If you'd had not done that, we'd have turned out a lot better," which is what I think about my parents and Jim (sp?) thinks about his. And so you're never really sure. It is a question of (inaudible at 0:41:58.7) a little girl is saying, "I hate you," to her parents.

</p><p>And I don't think that really sounds good. Well, [he added] (ph) such and such and said, "You're supposed to let your children have their own feelings and say what they feel. Otherwise, they'll become pent up and hostile like me." I can't quite buy it. It just - I don't see any other kids on the block saying, "I hate you, Mom." And I don't like my kids being quite that free. I mean, they can think that, I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're (inaudible at 0:42:38.9) - you'd be happier if they'd keep it to themselves. (crosstalk)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really would be. Yeah. How do you know what's right with children?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [They might come] (ph) 20 years later.

</p><p>PATIENT: So that's really what we argue about is how to raise the kids and money. That's a kind of a sore point in any marriage, I guess, if you don't have any of it. I don't have (inaudible at 0:43:16.6) home. If there is a little bit of money around the house, I might spend it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he doesn't want that? [0:43:26.1]

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't imagine why. Can you?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sound so pleased with yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he is not that severe that I would ever - I don't think I ever will run us into bankruptcy. But if he doesn't crack down, I'm not - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: About to knuckle under?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible at 0:43:54.6) period of time. But if I see something I really - well, even like I need shoes. I can get by with these if we ever go any place, but he has got a new pair of shoes. So why can't I? But if you only have so much money and he has already spent it on his shoes, he would think, well then, I shouldn't have any.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, what it sounds like is kind of like, we've already spent the shoe allotment for the month.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The fact that it went for my shoes is irrelevant. The point is that it has been spent.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, so you don't have any money to spend. But I don't really listen that much to what he says about money, because I can write a check, I guess. And he doesn't know. I get myself some shoes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I beg your pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: And I get myself some shoes. That's really a minor part of our arguing, too; because that's like once a month. He says, "Why did you spend the money?" We don't really have any good discussions about it. He is like, "Well, if you need it." I mean, he lets it go. He is not that strong. If he had taken my checkbook away or something long ago, we'd be in much better shape.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he has let you kind of get away with that out of not being so strong? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. What we argue most about is the children, after he has read a new - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Theory.

</p><p>PATIENT:  - theory.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The way you talk about it, the books make him sound like an interior decorator who reads about a new color scheme or furniture scheme and comes home and redecorates the whole house. [0:46:14.3]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then regularly, every two weeks.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sure he is not that bad, but it sure seems like it. I like the fact that he does help with the children, and he knows that they're his. Some husbands feel like they're the woman's child. And they have no part in them at all. They're just kind of strangers that they happen to (inaudible at 0:46:48.3). But the woman has to take care of them. But Jim (sp?) at least, never sits there - they're part his, too. And he does help. But I kind of would like to set that, you know, how they behave.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because like on the one hand, you're appreciative that he does take that responsibility. But on the other hand - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but sometimes I think he goes - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - too far.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He kind of switched over into the mother role, and that might be because he is a student, too. And he is home so much more.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But he doesn't leave you any authority, or very little authority.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you wish that he - did I cut you off?

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, we should be stopping in a couple of minutes. And I just wanted to check with you if this, is the kind of thing you expected or what kinds of feelings you may have?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think it's really a lot easier for me to talk to if I was going to (inaudible at 0:47:48.5).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it does sound like it feels less - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think it'll be much easier for me next Tuesday than it was for the first time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it is like it sounds like it feels less painful or - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:  - (inaudible at 0:48:08.8) than you expected.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because even if I want to Jim (sp?) - like the last time I came home from you, I really so embarrassed that had I cried. Jim (sp?) said, "I don't know if I want to let you go crying (inaudible at 0:48:29.5)," but he wouldn't say, "You can get out of it." I had a beer, and then I could really talk to him. Like there are a lot of things that - he is reading the paper and he doesn't want to be disturbed. He is reading a book and then, you know, things start popping into your mind that you'd like to have someone to tell them to. And he is not there. When I'm reading a book, he wants to talk. [0:48:57.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he bloody well talks if he wants to talk?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he gets sort of loud then he says, "Don't expect me to talk to you if you're not going to talk to me."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it just sounds like you're saying this, is one-sided. You can't talk to him, but he crashing in on your [silence] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, or else he gets a little bitter when I don't talk back.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I wanted to also, before we stop, I wanted to kind of be clear - have us both clear about appointment times and stuff. I guess the secretary tells you about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If that's convenient for you, I'd like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And usually, it works about 50 - 55 minutes or so, depending upon where we pick up. While I'm [trying to get standing up] (ph) I want to tell you - I think I want to check something out with you, and I wondered if you were having feelings about the tape recorders. I mean, I thought I noticed you noticed them when you came in.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I knew they were going to be on. I did look at them. (inaudible at 0:50:10.6)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I guess we can stop. Let me write you out an appointment slip, and what I'd like you to do with this, is to drop it in the box by the receptionist's window. I can't remember if it is her window or the window that you'd face or to the right of there. There'll be two windows. And that way, we'll have a record of your appointment. (inaudible at 0:50:37.3). Is today the ninth?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's Thursday.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay, thank you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thank you, too. Leave it open please.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. Other way.

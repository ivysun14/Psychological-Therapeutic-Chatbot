<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you like to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And please, again, no whispering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I just wonder if, if things are similar to some of their problems (inaudible 00:08:00). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They all are. That's okay. Don't worry about that. (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Ah, well, my problem is ah, I do executive placements in employment (coughs) and I work very well with people at hand and I work very well with the companies who are calling, in other words, a company calls, and they're looking for a particular person, I would get all the information and I will work with the applicants that I have and I can use it very, very quickly and that's my, my manner is very, very fast. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My problem is solicitations of new business.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which means you have to call them... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to call them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have to find out from various companies who they're-- in which I procrastinate. I put off interview and I would do all sorts of other things rather than pick-up that phone... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if I pick up the phone and call, what might happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That might be demands it. (indistinctive sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if they were and I think specifically some people will. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if they weren't, then why ask me that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would feel the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If there was, you can't deal with due respect. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Depressed and hurt. I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right because what are you telling yourself to create that...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you kind of create the fact that if that was with me, well, I wish that they treat me nicely. But they didn't. This is a bad day, they have problems and they have to see you. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't have to feel perfect. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you have to make it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't reach personally... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You are hurting me right... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Because-- then what did you specifically said when you feel hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm not worth that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because they don't like me, they don't answer to me? I can't right this. Right? And how does that (inaudible 00:09:57)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They really don't need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's a stage, isn't it? Because they don't like things, I can't like this, right? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, how does the second part, I can't likely follow from because they don't. What's the connection between these two statements?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what it does it's from... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then how can you think they need it? (indistinct sound) I needed you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (inaudible 00:10:22). I do it every day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you do read their thoughts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it doesn't make sense, but I believe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But at the time, you do read that they-- because you have a perfectionistic philosophy that he doesn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't-- you know I, I listen to this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I thought of all things, I have been trying at being a perfectionistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you are, because what are you perfectly demanding? You're not perfectly demanding like he is that you do your math or your poetry or so on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, what are you perfectly demanding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm actually-- I am demanding that every single person who I contact during the day would give me something to work on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That, they all will like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That all-- yes that if they...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:11:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... are all likely to say I already said that if they are (inaudible 00:11:07). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You're, you're not saying in order for me to like myself, I need seventy percent of the people in the world to like me. You're saying, "in order for me to like myself, I need a hundred percent of those with whom I am in close contact to like me. Isn't that perfectionism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (indistinct sound) Do you have to be really that perfectionistic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I meant to get myself on the, on the telephone I mean I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how do you deal with that idea? Because, suppose your proposition were true. Let's say the both to be true... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... for the moment. Then if a 100 percent of the people you've talked to don't like you, you can't like them. Let's suppose that were true. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now in that case, as in this case again it becomes too risky for you to call. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You better not call. That's why it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm. You know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have to get rid of the proposition, which you really believe in. Now you don't believe that 100 percent of the time, you get the right question you wanted right now. You believe the man who (inaudible 00:12:04) for a minute that the... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But 59 minutes to reach out (inaudible 00:12:09), and that's the point. How are you gonna disbelieve in a 59 minutes to reach out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's something that, you know, took a long time to adjust. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:12:23) was not prepared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been we don't have to say adequate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, it didn't have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And exactly the reason it took a long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I mean it's the same thing, you know, I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I hate it (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, you can't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, enough is enough. I'm not saying that I can't. I haven't been able to, and I've been...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you see-- then you got another nutty problem. Because I haven't been able to face it so far, or really because half of my patients are-- aren't never will be able to be. See what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now does that bother you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I haven't made it go up, it will be difficult for me to take, is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or having to get used to begging?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's no evidence that I can't.?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you really believe it? You got the ability to (inaudible 00:13:11) at this time. I might have all their love and unless I get a guarantee of all that love, I can possibly think it. If you could, it would be difficult, but you could. Isn't that so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not, I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I just want-- am I really looking for all these people's love and affection, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In this situation or they won't take all their love and attention. They don't...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:13:48)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... call like to marry you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Finally, all their... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you were looking for them not to say any nasty things to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if they say nasty things, I must sharpen up those deadly things. (inaudible 00:14:04) they are mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's suppose they say nasty things and now you call three people in the whole street. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After you say nasty things. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right now why must you take those nasty things so seriously?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, well I don't say (inaudible 00:14:22), you know, because up here I can say, well (inaudible 00:14:30).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, because that ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean (inaudible 00:14:34) now is a... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... great deal of sense that ah, no, no reason in the world, yet this is obviously something that I am doing. I take it very, very personally and very seriously because I'm not worried as much as everyone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because these three people said nasty things. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... said nasty things. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I, I, I wonder if in my mind I have a block on these. How much money I should earn because I think if I were on the phone...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah(ph). Right(ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I would probably triple my income... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... within the next few years. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's assumed. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wonder if I'm, you know, if I'm thinking in my mind I'm not worth that much money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. That's a possibility, but, but, but why would you not be worth that much, is that (inaudible 00:15:22). Now, what would make you unworthy of three times as much money as you now have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would make me unworthy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and what about you were so... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... not thinking that you don't deserve three times as much. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my own imaging.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where did that come from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It started, you know, when I was probably three or four.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But how did you start then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How did I start it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, how did you start the negative image? You have to start someday. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I mean I started probably in the time when I was in first grade and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ( indistinct sound) And, and you feel right(ph)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not working. Not completing homework, assignments... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... getting very bad grades. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if I completed my homework... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... homework I might get good grades, and I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, possibly it was a way of getting attention from my parents by getting good grades.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, if I completed my homework assignment and I got good grades, my parents would ignore me...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they wouldn't like me or they wouldn't give me much attention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would-- and I need attention. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need attention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, so there's the sign again it is the same basic terms, that now you need attention... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. They didn't (inaudible 00:16:33)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, same crack?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... same (inaudible 00:16:36). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now. Now what can you do about this 'coz you are still counting the crack... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I have been trying to get rid of it. And it matters one now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess it's by going out and getting on the zone and proving, ah, proving that my theory is wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not proving that the principle, if I keep doing it, I probably will despite the rejection I get a lot of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there will be few rejections... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that it's still get a lot of these. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And secondly, proving that despite the rejections, which you will get... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you're bound to get rejections. I won't be distraught.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is what you'll see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, I was working with a man recently. He was the president and I rejected him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and I-- it's-- my problem's been-- has been-- I need a very good opening sentence of thinking well, I mean so I can respect myself. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be nice that if you had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I had it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I went to my boss on this and she wasn't any help at all. And she is like different every time and I was getting some ideas that she's gonna have to recommend me nothing. So I finally got myself on the phone and we had this (inaudible 00:17:54) and I said that I am wondering what's going on and he catch his breath and ah, (inaudible 00:18:02) I wonder if we can be of service to you and he said, "Well, why don't we get a new executive? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want to get a what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wanted to get a new executive. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:18:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're doing executive placement (inaudible 00:18:14). Really, it hurt, you know, why did you get an executive? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:18:22) If you'd take that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he turned around and said, "Yes, they were looking for a copywriter."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And attention, they readily talk to you (inaudible 00:18:30) of that. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:18:30).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... if that is this is what (inaudible 00:18:31) if you (inaudible 00:18:32) to think they felt they were irrespectful. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so he gets his crack on his check... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... but you don't really do anything... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They made me find it (inaudible 00:18:44) and you give it up right now. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't know what is that. Maybe his wife gives him bacon and eggs. (audience laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then he said, we're looking for a copywriter but he has friends in acquiring the business and he was very busy. I said, fine, I think it's, you know, nice to deal with people that you're friendly with me now. However, I would like to call you back in a week and a half. If you filled it, in other words, and if then you haven't filled it, I referenced to you and he said fine. So I called them back and he said, "No, they hadn't filled it," and I said, "Well, you know. I know that I don't have that much money, you know largely because we work on a small budget as if taking a-- to go out and take a trainee, you know, I am big enough. It's not to be fair, I mean, if they don't have the money. Yeah, I am going to expect someone in," and, you know, he don't like that. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he wasn't willing to admit that they got the money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that-- so I have been trying. I have two people and he said, "Well, I can't see anyone this week. Call me back next week." I called him back Monday, and he said, "Well, they are putting the office," so now (inaudible 00:19:57). You know if this guy is just giving me the runaround or if they have still the job?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but, but the only way you'll find out is by persistence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, but... (inaudible 00:20:06)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why? What, what are you telling yourself to get (inaudible 00:20:10)? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, because I'm not worthy of-- well, I'm not -- I'm beginning to see that this guy is right. I'm not an executive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And they applaud you, putting you on because they recognized you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. No, no, no. But I feel myself, you know, am I interested you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I could have sustained myself-- Yeah, I, I got myself into this, but am I good yet, you know? I'm doing a good job, but uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're really saying is what I can give. I'm doing this job. I got myself into it, but am I myself... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... am I worthy (inaudible 00:20:45) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... (inaudible 00:20:45)seeing that I don't always make out in every signs that facing that I have to please people or (inaudible 00:20:54). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't that what you're saying? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:20:58)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I do the job perfectly, I'm probably not worthy of it at all... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...which is exactly what the fellow we have here, (inaudible 00:21:10). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is the same kind of perfectionism. And incidentally, as I said to him, with that perfectionism, you've got to denigrate yourself, unless you are perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in your particular ah, I could feel that (inaudible 00:21:85) again. We said that difference between him and the man... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... while it's between you and other people... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you have no control over that. So to be perfect, you have to be a magician. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ain't God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. We have to really tell all these people how to respond and have to write their script as well as their own block... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and you can't do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I, I, I know I can but the words must have been personality problems, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You realize it, but you ended it out whenever you beat yourself. You're saying-- you're saying, but in spite of the fact that I can control them, I should be able to. Otherwise, I'm no good. You see? You've seen these all irrational things but after things you bring them right back in. And it's always you who should be able to be a great executive, to make no mistakes, have a brilliant holy mind would work with everyone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which-- what, what line in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I, I don't think it was really-- I am so far from being the perfection. It is more trying to be perfect, you know, and it does for people that really just trying to be less perfect. Everything (inaudible 00:22:57)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In their work, in their work that you were trying to be perfect in yourself at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't agree (inaudible 00:23:05).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, a good artist tries to do well in his work, and he enjoys the work, but to protect it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But people like you, they're not really interested in the perfect world. They are interested in a perfect explanation of themselves. They've got to be perfect, and therefore, as I said to the other fella here, they don't perfect the work. They give up on the work because it's really no use.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what? I was trying to be a perfect human being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, a god.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I doubt it. Not right now. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, and even if you think (inaudible 00:23:40) suppose you call up a hundred people in a row, (inaudible 00:23:42) and you won't get a hundred, but you fitted it perfectly as anybody could do. Even that won't be satisfying to you, but then you want a guarantee that the next hundred is gonna be the, the, the-- or out with something well with me, which are continuing evaluating you, and you won't accept the fact that you are and always will be an imperfect being.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, I just wonder if it could really, subconsciously or consciously, the way I think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: According to what you said up here so far, you don't like yourself and to relate this may have been self of you to imperfect performance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's always been that started at third grade, uhm, probably high IQ. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Always in school, uhm, with the matter of my parents getting into right uhm, good private uh, prep school. I took a test but couldn't make it on my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And therefore...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then, well therefore, (indistincy sound) ah, I probably I couldn't even work. I was (inaudible 00:25:11) in school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you make these... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... meaning. If one thing goes wrong, if one has to fail, or one (inaudible 00:25:20)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm (inaudible 00:25:20)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... like me it's hope. Now that's why you get discouraged because any encouragement to you means, as I said before, any series of absolute successes and being a prediction of absolute successes to come, and anywhere along the line is a failure... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:25:39)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... it's all hopeless, I'll never be able to succeed. Now, that is irony perfectionism because there aren't any human beings who can always do well and it's known that usually they could do well and who won't do well in the future because they've had a few errors along the line. They don't exist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I keep telling myself that, you know, by getting in the end and ah, fight it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, sure there's going to be a lot of failures, but there's going to be a lot of successes too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, but you also ended up that each failure mean what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, each failure means, I'm not a word that's (inaudible 00:26:26). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. They have two conflicting value systems. One of the sayings was, in order to succeed in life, I have to go through a lot of errors. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other saying was-- and if I have any errors whatsoever... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I'm an unworthy individual who never will be able to succeed at all and deserves that-- and I know that very diverse fragment that-- one is probably true because it is factually true. You deserve it. They don't want to succeed at anything, they have to have everything. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the second, that in order to be a worthy person, I must do well and, what I said before, (inaudible 00:27:01) feel like it. Pure definition because why do you have to do well to be a worthy person. Why can't you accept yourself as a human being who deserves to be happy even if you could consistently did poorly (inaudible 00:27:19)? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really did consistently did poorly, (inaudible 00:27:23). What do you think now? Why? Because (inaudible 00:27:24) yourself as a being who deserves joy, pleasure, happiness, wherever you can get.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I, I'm-- it must be (inaudible 00:27:37) what he's saying is, I guess perfect stated to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because my being myself, my evaluation of me only it would get (inaudible 00:27:47) when I do externally in a world, or be right. And by your saying that, that every man (inaudible 00:27:53) would immediately have to (inaudible 00:27:54) mother, (inaudible 00:27:59) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm hmm. I think you, you know (inaudible 00:28:02) uhm, some act that you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... to really have-- have a name (inaudible 00:28:14) self or they lack ambition. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:28:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They plan and pray.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You condemn that they (inaudible 00:28:19) people. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could get in-- at, at people (inaudible 00:28:21). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but you (inaudible 00:28:23). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you need that. That is unfair to them as you are to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. They ain't learning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't they deserve to be happy even though they're shmucky and (inaudible 00:28:33) and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you're right (inaudible 00:28:38). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The same way that (inaudible 00:28:39) and the major one really is, no, they don't know, I don't. That's your majority belief-- most of the time, (inaudible 00:28:49) that unless I and, incidentally, other human beings do very well, they observed the (inaudible 00:28:56). That's your-- the ultimate and that's not the event. Let's have question and discussion.</p>

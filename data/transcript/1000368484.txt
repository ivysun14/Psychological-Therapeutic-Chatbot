<p>Note:(This hour has not yet been prooflistened.)  (Just as PATIENT and the analyst came into the recording room he remembered that he had not turned on all the switches on the recording apparatus which was outside in another corridor.  ANALYST excused himself briefly and left the recording room to turn on the switches — none of this could be seen or heard by PATIENT — and then returned after a few moments to find PATIENT lying on the couch.)</p>

PATIENT:  (Pause) When you left just then I had to go through the decision of whether or not to lie down because I've always found it's very uncomfortable to be lying down when you're up.  And I think at least once before you had to go out for a minute and I don't remember what I did.  But I think I must have not laid down until you came back in.  And it made me, just now when I was going through that thought, I also realized that whenever I'm in a doctor's office and I'm lying down on something, even though I'm lying down I always have found it very uncomfortable when the doctor comes in if he had to go out or if he was out before I lay down.  And it's uncomfortable anyway.  I never liked being in the doctor's office, being examined, but the worst part, I've always found, is, is when he's coming or going and I'm just lying there.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does it bring something to mind especially that you'd rather not think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I just did now.  Uhm, I just thought that the times when I've gone to bed first and then MSCZ comes to bed, if he wants to have intercourse for some reason I find it even harder if I've been there first.  Somehow it's more threatening when he comes in and I can tell from the way he looks that that's what he wants.  And the other thing and the, it, it's connected with this, is the feeling of being vulnerable when you're lying down.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Something else is on my mind too that, and I thought of it earlier today.  I remember thinking to myself, well, I hope I won't think of that when I'm here.  But as a result that's all I've, really been on my mind the rest of the afternoon.  And it concerns a puppet that I made in art class last, I guess it was last week, or it took 2 weeks to make and the first week — it was out of papermach�.  And the first week I made it I was just thinking of it as an elephant.  And I had wanted to make a face with a short of sharp nose but instead it turned out to be an elephant.  And it had disappointed me.  But then last week when I went back to paint it and so forth, I suddenly thought that what it looked, what the elephant's nose looked like was a penis.  And it was very upsetting to me.  And I found it very hard to sort of let people look at it and to paint it because I was afraid it was very obvious now to everybody.  And then I took it home, uhm, just yesterday and it seems even more to look like that to me.  And, and I don't know, for some reason I find it extremely upsetting.  And of course, MSCZ just teased me about it all evening.</p>

<p>And I think that when we were doing, when we were painting them we, we—, we had been asked to look at the form of whatever we'd made and sort of try to understand what feeling it evoked and then carefully choose our color and so forth so that we did sort of carry through a kind of a theme.  And I remember wanting this puppet's head to be kind of fierce and violent looking or to suggest a kind of fierce or violent feeling, something that is to be afrai—, something that one would be afraid of and that would be uncontrolled.  And I chose to use red and, mainly red, and then yellow and orange colors.  It sort of, feeling was, sort of giving the thing a — I was trying to anyway, a feeling of very strong emotional quality.  And, I don't know, somehow it all ties in with the fact that the nose of this thing looks like a penis.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that the way you think of a penis, fierce and violent?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I think I must pretty much.  (12-minute silence)</p>

<p>While I've been thinking about the reaction I've had to feeling I can't say what's been on my mind, I keep finding myself thinking that, something I've talked about before, that either I'm not confident I have the correct terminology or that I don't have it at all.  And so I just get so afraid of — well, there's something I'm afraid about talking about it anyway and that, that makes a good excuse.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's almost as if I'm afraid to admit that I even have noticed MSCZ's penis.  And I have to keep telling myself that it's perfectly natural that I have but I'm still afraid of that.  (Pause) In fact, I've sometimes been afraid that I have an unnatural curiosity about it.  It's almost as if I'm making up for all the years when I wasn't supposed to know anything about a man's penis and I'd, — certainly not my father's.  And I, I think I just built up such a curiosity that now it makes me feel very, well, perverse or unnatural.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>But before I was thinking about the difference in my feeling, or, well, that I think of a man's penis in 2 ways, or MSCZ's penis in 2 ways.  And one is, when it's erect and I have a much more of the feeling that then it's the thing that's violent and fierce and unyielding and passionate and everything.  And then when it's not erect, it's, well, I suppose it's controllable and sort of nice and then I don't mind it.  But when it's erect I'm almost afraid of it.  And when it's erect I think of it as something separate from MSCZ.  I don't think of it as being part of him.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was thinking, after I said that, that it was a relief that I made myself say it because I think I, more than saying it now, I dreaded having it unsaid when I left so that I'd feel it was always on my mind and I was always trying to escape it but it would always be there.  And though I, I tell myself, "Well I don't have to say it any time." or "I won't have to say it next time.  It might not come to mind next time,"  I'd still know it would.  And I think that kind of fighting with myself would bother me more.  At least that's why I said it then.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's parallel to my whole tendency to procrastinate on all sorts of things.  And I know from experience if I can just say, "Well, it's an unpleasant thing but if I can just sit down and do it right now I'll feel so much better."  And yet, I hardly ever ever do that.  (Pause) And it's also as if, having said it, I don't have any energy left to think about that subject anymore.  Or I feel sort of almost as if I've done what I should have done and I don't, I shouldn't feel I have to.  (7-minute silence)</p>

<p>The thing I don't understand is that while I've been quiet I've had a lot of different things go through my mind and I haven't felt that I wanted, I guess is really it, to say of them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't have any ideas why you wouldn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, because after what I said today, which was so hard for me to say, these, none of these things would have been that hard.  They just didn't seem very important.  I somehow felt if I started talking about them I'd either just say it and then I'd stop or else I'd make something more of it than was there.  Or, well, thought came, a phrase that came to my mind was that they were hardly worth saying.  And then it occurred to me that so much of what I think I feel that way about.</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) And yet it seems to me, in a way it's an indirect way of feeling or underscoring how terribly important you feel the things you were feeling and thinking about a penis really is to you.  By comparison anything else seems unimportant.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) And this, in feeling that way there's something that increases its important to, importance to me because I feel I'm wrong or I'm sneaking.  Or if I really believed it was perfectly natural and right and everything then I don't think I'd make it that important to me or feel that it was that important.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think in thinking of it as wrong I connect the feeling that first, it's forbidden, which I can understand how I got and then, that it's dirty.  And I don't understand how I got that feeling.  I don't see why I just didn't feel it was forbidden until you were an adult.  
Pause) Except, when I think about using the dirt—, the word, "dirty," it doesn't seem to be quite right.  (Pause) I think what I was associating with the word, "dirty," is the kind of thing when people tell dirty jokes and there're words or thoughts that are sort of forbidden to polite society that are passed over in these jokes.  And that's what makes them funny.  And I'm not sure I quite understand the use of the word, "dirty," except that's the same kind of use I think I'm making here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's what you mean by it, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think so.  I, I think the fact that I might think of it as dirty upsets me enough so I don't even want to admit that it is the right word.  But whatever the term I put to it, it's, the whole thing is something I feel I shouldn't be doing and thinking about and noticing.  And I just, in my mind I keep comparing it to children when they go through the stage of bathroom talk and getting silly over parts of their body and their functions, when they think that it's sort of a forbidden thing that they shouldn't be noticing or laughing at.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too happy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Kidneys.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] tumor, twenty, they are under thirty percent.</p>

<p>CG: Twenty six to thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What is?</p>

<p>CG: Function.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Function.</p>

<p>CG: And it went up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, it did go up.  Well that's a good sign.</p>

<p>CG: No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, that's a bad sign.</p>

<p>CG: Bad sign.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a bad sign?  Why?  Oh, the creatinine went up. </p>

<p>CG: Too much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The function went down.</p>

<p>CG: The function went down, the creatinine, and it went back two tenths in four months instead of one tenth which has what is has been, so she's starting to talk about dialysis and transplants.  Not yet, it just, it's when she starts thinking about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thinking about what?</p>

<p>CG: Twenty percent you go on the list.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For?</p>

<p>CG: Transplant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  Wow.  How are you feeling about it? Scared as hell, huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Scared as hell.  Scared.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CG: I mean she said there's still time it may stop, but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there anything that could be done?  Nothing? A diet.</p>

<p>CG: Well, she said not really, not even not much you can do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even with diet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you can't have that diet, that protein diet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, right, [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<p>CG: Not too much protein</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No she said make sure you don't do that, I remember you said I could have like sausage and stuff like that.  Well now I got to, you know leave that</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mood, yes, mood, it might help mood, but no, for function it wouldn't help</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  In fact it's too hard for, I guess it's too hard for it to take protein for the kidneys is that too much?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, so there's no way to know if it's gonna stay the way it is or it'll just-</p>

<p>CG: The only way they can monitor is through the blood test and-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Every what, couple of months?</p>

<p>CG: Every four months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But right now-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pray, pray. Cause I remember you said that one lady got better. So, maybe, maybe; I don't look forward to it.  I don't look forward to either one of the options but when the time gets there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think he said about fifteen percent function is where you really run into problems for dialysis, right?</p>

<p>CG: Ten percent she said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ten percent for dialysis, okay.  So you're still aways away from that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm praying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the screen on all the other tests everything was fine so-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's a good sign.</p>

<p>CG: She says you're a good candidate for a transplant.  But it's not too many bone damage, which she says is the main thing that the kidney damage shows up right away as bone damage.  There isn't any, so-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<p>CG: She thinks it's just all from the Lithium.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  She said there's no sense in going in there and taking a piece of it, you know, what they call that.  She says because the Lithium does damage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the Lithium did good for me all those years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know, yeah.  Well it wouldn't it help to verify if that's the problem?  She didn't think it would-</p>

<p>CG: She ran all the other tests so there's nothing else </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She thinks that's what it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Except to take a piece of it.</p>

<p>CG: A biopsy, but they don't need to do that</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What?</p>

<p>CG: Run a </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Biopsy</p>

<p>CG: Like a biopsy, you know, to see if there's anything in there</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of the what</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of the kidney.</p>

<p>CG: She said all the other tests are normal so it really, there's no need to do it.  You could if you wanted but it really isn't.  It wouldn't do any good at this point.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well there's a certain kind of damage that Lithium actually causes.  You know it's not in the tubes so much as in the tissue itself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Plus when you get older some of it does.  But this doesn't seem to be older, this is the medication itself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She reminded me that it's toxic.  Well, it did good for that length of time</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's just now we're at another point in time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many years were you on it?  Twenty five or twenty, or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.</p>

<p>CG: Twenty two, twenty three.  Somewhere in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Was that all?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now your mood has restabilized though, you seem emotionally stable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah except for this news now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just got this information?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, last week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been more depressed as a result?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah a little bit.</p>

<p>CG: Not bad though, she hasn't been really depressed.  I mean it's upsetting but-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's one where you think no, one day at a time.  When that times comes then you have to make the decisions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the bad part.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's no way to tell, I mean it could be years or you know, you have no way-</p>

<p>CG: Well if it continues at the pace it is, it's not gonna take too long if it continues to deteriorate because it accelerated this time.  The pace accelerated, the deterioration pace accelerated this form of period</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Was it the creatinine.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah but she does, not just stop the creatinine, there's other stuff they do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well she said it went up two points.</p>

<p>CG: It went up two tenths instead of one tenth which is what you're doing.  She was hoping it would go the other way and stop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: But it didn't.  It's still active.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing that can be done, I mean no, nothing-</p>

<p>CG: The damage is already done.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<p>CG: It is a matter of stable, it's either going to stabilize or it's not</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The hope is that it stabilizes-</p>

<p>CG: Then stay where it's at and not get any worse.  That hasn't happened yet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It can't better, right?  It just-</p>

<p>CG: No.  There's no getting better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stay stable, if it stays stable then it's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  There's the hope, but you didn't get any percentage chance of stabilization?  Nothing like that?</p>

<p>CG: No, she just said it wasn't encouraging to see that spike in the creatinine.  You know, but it could still stabilize.  I mean there's still a chance that would happen.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe it'll go on for awhile.</p>

<p>CG: You got time.  Like she said, you have time and all they can do is monitor because the only way they can see what's going on is through the blood tests.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which reminds me, you got the blood work finally on your testing?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah,</p>

<p>CG: What was the Depakote </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was in the nineties.  I don't remember-</p>

<p>CG: In the nineties?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it was where I want it.</p>

<p>CG: Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we're okay with the Depakote and we're okay, you know, with your mood.  I mean you're not having any manic spikes at all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not really depressed despite this information.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Except for this information.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean it's really sad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But like he said and like she said, the kidney specialist.  You just have to wait and find out.  Every time I go then they'll you know, every four months.  Then they can find out what's going on.</p>

<p>CG: It's not right away but it's down the road.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean it's hard not to dwell on it all the time.  Yeah, when you think about it probably most of the time during the day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.  We think about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you can't do anything about it.  So a lot of times I get doing something else, you know, well now I wanna discuss it because that way then I can some of it out and then I don't have to think about it as much, cause there's nothing I can do to stop whatever is going on.  I wish.  Cause I told her, I said, two, is there a third one?  And she said, she came in, she said yeah you can die.  </p>

<p>CG: What do you mean two?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's only two choices, or options I should say.  And I said is there a third one, you know.  Not being cute, I just said was there a third one you know-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But a third one</p>

<p>CG: Do nothing and then terminal</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It stabilizes</p>

<p>CG: The third ones do nothing at all if it doesn't stabilize then it's terminal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then the other possibility is stabilization which you said can occur.  </p>

<p>CG: It might occur.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well yeah, there's a chance of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You gotta have some hope, I mean-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, I didn't put that, I told you I said prayers.  I don't look forward to either one.  Somebody, you know the transplant is one thing and then the, what do they call that thing?</p>

<p>CG: Dialysis.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dialysis.  That's Monday, Wednesday, Friday and thatt's a couple hours each day.  I don't look forward to that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They already described-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I know some people that have gone through it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you talked to them recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I heard it off somebody else.  You know, somebody else told me that they, my cousin told me that she knows somebody that's on dialysis.  We have-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would it help to talk to somebody who's going through it?  I mean would that make you less afraid if you, I mean that's a possibility-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm just gonna wait and see, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just wait, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know that's gonna take so long and you're gonna have to maybe read a book or take a nap or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think what you'll find too is that you know, you just heard about this last week and it's fresh in your mind and it's overwhelming emotionally but as, you know, time goes through over the next four months it won't be as intense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know you're psyche will kind of acclimate and adjust to the idea, so, which is good.  You know I think that's one of the defenses human beings have to cope with things like this.  Then as much as you can to try to get involved with other thoughts and other activities.  You know, I don't know, the girl isn't with you any more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you're pretty functional in the day, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Except that he's supposed to go back to work pretty soon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that mandatory or is that-</p>

<p>CG: Well, they're probably gonna be sending me paperwork pretty soon so I don't know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sending you what</p>

<p>CG: Paper work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have they talked to you about it?</p>

<p>CG: No, no.  They're very liberal about it right now.  But the time ended on [DATE] so that was a year.  So I'm sure I'll be getting something in the mail here pretty soon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How do you feel about going back full time?</p>

<p>CG: Well, you know, I don't like cheating them either, I mean if she doesn't need me around that's one thing, I mean-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you feel she's well enough.</p>

<p>CG: Well she's doing pretty good, yeah.  I mean-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't go to your sisters any more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah on Saturdays, she goes [INAUDIBLE] once in a while</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We go and we bake and we make dinner and we talk and-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel as stable now as you were all those years on Lithium or different or could you tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd say 90%, he says 85%.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's close</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I feel that much better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your thoughts don't race any more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, no.  Not before, not after finding this out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now we also, cause we had lowered the Depakote quite a bit.  I think last time, you're only taking what?</p>

<p>CG: She's on a thousand milligrams.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: I told her that's not much, I says I know people at the store, they're getting three, four thousand a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: And it's not real heavy and neither is the Abilify.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just, it'd get me up from the bed sometimes.  I sleep.  He always calls me about eight thirty, eight forty five and sometimes I'll sleep till nine o'clock or nine fifteen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're sleeping through the night, the Abilify you're taking in the morning then?</p>

<p>CG: No, at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At what dose?  Just the five?</p>

<p>CG: Ten.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's at the ten.  And there is no side effects at all?</p>

<p>CG: Well, the wiggling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still going on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: The Cogentin helps that some.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It always seems to be in the morning like when-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think we should try to lower it any more now though.  You know, maybe give you some chance to acclimate.  It's not gonna hurt you physically and if there's no overwhelming side effects you probably as a boost to your mood too, you feel okay at this dose, I mean you're not too tired?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm tired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're still tired.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Well she's not as bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not as, no.  But I still like, I like certain amount of sleep and then sometimes during the day I get sleepy.  It depends.  Like if I'm at my sister's and I'm busy then I'm not as sleepy.  In fact I watch her go to sleep.  We were sitting talking and all of a sudden she conked out.  But she has a lot of problems and we sit together and we discuss and-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is she still working during the week?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she lost her job but they gave her a part time job instead.  So she's got something but it isn't enough income.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see.  So she's having a hard time making ends meet? Or is she-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's making ends meet but not too well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She lives alone, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She has a daughter that lives with her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  But you wouldn't want her to move in with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think she'd want to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you want that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then where does she work, she has no way, there's not much around.  At least, see she can't drive very far because of her eyes.  Where she's at now she's, you know, there are places that she could work in close by because she lives on what is it, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p>CG: Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Plus we don't want to leave her daughter alone, right [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't get come</p>

<p>CG: She's an adult, so-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's old enough.</p>

<p>CG: She's [AGE] years old.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Move out on her own?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she's old enough, she can move on her own.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll see, I mean nothing has to happen right away, so-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The other thing in terms of the Abilify, what we could look at is when the weather improves does this improve when you get out a little more and do some walking outside we might consider lowering it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have been that doing that.  Him and I and then sometimes myself.  It's been warm enough to go out with a light jacket and go for a walk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been trying to remember to do the exercises along with it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you coping with this, I mean are you feeling pretty depressed too, or are you-</p>

<p>CG: No, I'm just, you know, what can you do?  She gotta punch her way through and just do what you can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You walk with me.  He does, he comes sometimes.  We did twice in a day I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you been enjoying that extra day off though too, you spend the whole day together, right?</p>

<p>CG: Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: And I haven't been doing anything else.  If I'm not at work I'm with her, so-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're gonna miss him if he goes back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Miss my little helper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Could it be extended?</p>

<p>CG: Well, you know, we'll see. I'll see what kind of feedback I get from her.  I mean I'm overdue and I already sent one in this week and they didn't say nothing, so they'll come up with it eventually.  We'll cross that bridge when we get there.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Has it been busy at work too?</p>

<p>CG: No, It's always busy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean to try to do it in four days instead of five days.</p>

<p>CG: I can do it in four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh you can do it.</p>

<p>CG: I mean I've got enough help, it's when we start getting vacations and that kind of stuff then I gotta start putting on a little more.  I mean we do all right, I mean I was all right at Christmas working around it, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't desire to go back to substitute teaching do you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not with everything that could happen now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get bored at all during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes.  I try to, I do like Spring cleaning so that takes a little longer and then I have music on, and ah, more like I used to do, you know.  More heavy cleaning, maybe instead of just wiping it you put some lemon oil or something on and you wipe it off and you clean the lamps real good and you go through that and then pretty soon we're gonna be able to be outside and work.  Right now it's a little mushy and wet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you do a garden?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he won't let me do one but I got flowers so I've got that to take care of.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're looking forward to doing that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Just being out like walking now is nice.  We walked before we came here, we went walking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Yeah it's a beautiful day today.</p>

<p>CG: It was nicer Sunday, actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.  Too windy today.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's still nice out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They said it's supposed to be seventy?</p>

<p>CG: Mid-seventy, yeah, it doesn't feel,.I liked Sunday better it was calm and clear.  It was pristine Sunday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's windy out, but it's nice.  It's real nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well now more good weather will be coming so you can hang out outside.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep</p>

<p>CG: It's all down hill after today though, for the rest of this week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's supposed to be cold again?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.  They're talking snow by Friday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So enjoy today.  Get out a little bit of warm air out there even though it's breezy it's fine.  I know it's breezy.  It always happens, I get my hair cut and I get them to fix it up and then I go out the door and my hair goes all over.  But that's okay, let it go.  I could make it like either one of you and make it come back like this.  It's thin, it's really thin.  And then she says, and then she says nicely to me, she says "And it's a little bit course and I don't know why it's course." And then she says, "Well, it could be that it's graying."  Since my hair is thin like that I wouldn't wanna put any of that stuff on.  That would make it even dryer.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't want to use hair spray.  That's fine.  I can live with that.  I mean I got hair, some hair..</p>

<p>CG: You've got plenty of hair, I will trade you</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you work outside you wear a hat usually?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, yeah because I have light skin too, so gotta have a baseball cap or something on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you really seem normalized to me.  I mean I see you even less hyper with these medications than when you were on Lithium for all those years.  You know, you seem to have more of an edge to you.  Now you're a little bit more quiet so maybe it's the increased contact with you is a possibility too.</p>

<p>CG: I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Might be less lonely.</p>

<p>CG: I think she's not quite as sharp as she used to be.  You might call it an edge, but I call it, she's just slowed down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, she is more slowed down, I noticed that.</p>

<p>CG: That, you know, the things register right away sometimes.  Better than they were but not where she used to be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you almost like that in a way that she used to have.</p>

<p>CG: No.  That was the gal I married.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cause this seems in some ways more peaceful to me, you know, the increased quietness. She's more quiet than she used to be.</p>

<p>CG: No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not always</p>

<p>CG: I don't think so.  She's just not as quick.  You know if I say something it's like there's a delayed reaction.  It's like watching TV and you know [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] you know they're talking in a run and you have to wait.</p>

<p>CG: That is what it is kind of like</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what he's saying.</p>

<p>CG: I mean before it would be zoom like that, you know, so</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that makes sense.  Do you notice it too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes but not all the time.  Sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that doesn't bother you too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  The only thing is I'm doing better. That's the main thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, even if it's not perfect.  Even if it's not exactly the way I was that's the main thing that I'm doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  I mean from where you were, what was it about a year and a half ago or-</p>

<p>CG: A little over a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A little over a year is dramatic.  I mean-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See and I don't know because-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you don't remember what you were like then, yeah, boy.  That's a dramatic improvement.</p>

<p>CG: You just gotta wonder how much of that had any effect on her kidneys too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mean what she went through?</p>

<p>CG: Because I remember you telling me about organic damage with taking [INAUDIBLE] well how much organic damage was done down there besides what was already there?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, there's no way we're gonna know that, you know?  I mean to try to understand that, I don't know.  All you can do, like I say, at this point is pray and just hope that there's stabilization.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, stable off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And wait, you know.  Your mind will adjust for the next couple weeks and then four months we'll check again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. That's like in July.  You check again.  She's, you know, we both said she's nice and she's being honest, you know.  She says these are the two things, you know, and she wasn't, she didn't seem how do you put it?  She didn't seem like it was gonna happen, like-</p>

<p>CG: She was telling us what</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The possibilities</p>

<p>CG: The possibilities, to be prepared</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The possibility might level off and then those were the two options if it doesn't</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well just enjoy one day at a time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need refills on anything, or-</p>

<p>CG: I think the Depakote and the Abilify are okay, we just need the Lexapro.  I didn't check before we came but you know, if I get low I can always call in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<p>CG: I think we're okay though.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And then how, when does she wanna come back again?  How much time?  Five weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  All right.  Thank you for this.</p>

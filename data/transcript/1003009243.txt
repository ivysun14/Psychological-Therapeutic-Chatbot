<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me about your work.  What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, working, struggling, working at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you're still doing it, how's your business?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not doing that good I bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But [INAUDIBLE], from what last year was, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really, that's very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much are you working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, four days, we've been working Monday through Thursday and occasionally on Fridays, uh, if, if I'm needed on Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many house in a day say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, anywhere from, anywhere from 6:00 to 8:00.  It'll, it can be different every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going back today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we're actually, think we're actually heading to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a delivery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, you might get a little overtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Yeah, I've been putting in a, putting in a lot of, a lot of hours each week, so it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't think they delivered to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they deliver, let's see, we had to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you guys deliver?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you deliver?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, anything, sofas, beds, ottomans.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wouldn't want to pay that delivery charge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's not bad.  It's pretty reasonable, but we've had big-time deliveries where I would have rather just made the drive and picked it up myself, but, it's fun.  I mean, it's better than sitting around and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  Where's the store?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What city are you in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  A good friend of ours, a good friend of mine, my family -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Owns it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is this an upper-level kind of good, really good stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's, it's, let's just say my house wouldn't be furnished with it.  It's pretty -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's pretty expensive.  So, I mean, it's like a several thousand for like a sectional sofa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's pretty pricy, but it's good stuff.  It's good furniture.  I like it.  So I'm doing that everyday, which is nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get some tips when you deliver?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Not every time but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe 10 bucks or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Nothing too big, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It'll get you lunch, so that's, that's, that's a plus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing on the weekends?  What'd you do this weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, actually, this weekend, Friday, my buddy that works at [DEIDENTIFIED], when he got off work, we headed up to [DEIDENTIFIED] where a friend of mine and his wife live, and the 3 of us went, uh, went up to [DEIDENTIFIED] to go snowboarding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And came back and Sunday was the birthday, so we kind of went out in the woods and make things for his birthday and came back into town, uh, Sunday morning, early afternoon I guess, and just kind of hung out last night.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It probably wasn't that crowded was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I figured a lot of people probably went that previous weekend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everybody stayed home for the Super Bowl.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So that was fun.  We did that and when, uh, when duck season ended, uh, we try to find something to do on the weekends whenever duck hunting season is end.  We probably do that every weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got rid of all the doves huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try not to.  [LAUGHING].  I, uh, I only shot 2 this year, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get out there and get rid of the deer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we did some deer hunting, but we didn't have as good of luck out there with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How can you miss deer?  I mean, they're everywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you didn't see any, that's the thing.  We saw some but they kind of came out of nowhere and were behind us, but I don't, I don't think I want to shoot deer.  I don't like shooting deer.  I don't like shooting a sitting, standing-still animal.  I don't like doing that.  But I'd rather shoot a bird or something.  It's a little more challenging.  That's what I've been up to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still staying with your folks still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's that?  Is that working out these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not nearly, not nearly as frustrating now that I'm gone and working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Employed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they don't, like, when you getting a job.  What do they bug you about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They ain't really bugged me too much.  I mean I, I, I don't really catch any heat from them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, not that, not because I'm working, but just I don't know why.  I guess because I'm not there as often for them to think of something.  [LAUGHING].  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we parents don't need a lot of time with you to bug you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  True.  But things seem good as far as that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they're not like, the want you doing something you're not doing or what have you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  They've been pretty pleased with the way I turned out.  I don't, I'm not that son that goes out and gets in trouble and makes them worry.  I'm working and just keeping it cool, I reckon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you turned out?  Are you all done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think, I think I've got a little bit more to go.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that little bit more to go, what do you think?  Like, I'm thinking like, you know, I'm trying to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm think I'm on a pretty straight path.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they don't try to guide you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In a particular direction?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think so.  I, well, no, they don't say take this path.  They, they know that I'm going to take the path that I'm going to take, but they'll encourage or they'll support me either way, but they don't try and like close off options and make me go one way or the other.  So, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would have figured as much time as you put in college, they'd be on your case about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well they, they'd like for me to go back and I, I tell them often that I'd like to, but it's that same thing I've talked about before, is which way to go with it.  There's so many, so many options out there I'd like to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get any encouragement at all, why don't you go into accounting then or something, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've did that.  I did that but at the same time I like so many other things.  I'm looking at schools right now but since I'm working and stuff like that, I'm, I'm taking things and get as much work time as I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to save any money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, I it seems the first time in a long time that I haven't had to just do random work to make money to pay off whatever and stuff like that.  My bank account's looking good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got, you working anywhere besides the furniture place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, whenever [INAUDIBLE] come up, you know, I'll go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do any of those come up lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not too lately.  [INAUDIBLE] cold season for [INAUDIBLE] roping course, but [INAUDIBLE], but then, um, that friend of mine that lives in [DEIDENTIFIED], they, uh, when they got married they got a real, real nice house right on [DEIDENTIFIED] I think, but they're in [DEIDENTIFIED], so a nice house, and he's been doing a lot of work on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I go up there every now and then on the weekends or something and help him do some work so he'll, you know, he slides me a couple bucks when I do some work for him, so, but it's pretty much just the [DEIDENTIFIED] as far as work goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See anybody, like a girl?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I actually met somebody last night that, so yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about that, well, you know, I've only been asking you ever time I see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was bound to, bound to happen ,I come in and say oh yeah, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where'd you meet her at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At my friend, [NAME OTHER]'s house.  He's actually an old buddy of mine that I work with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've known [NAME OTHER] since I was tiny, my parents, our parents went to college together, so, we've been good friends for a really long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you kind of hit it off huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might have to call her huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, she gave you her number?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I wouldn't let her get away without getting that.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going to call her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I think we're getting together at some point soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she live around here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, well, she goes to school here now.  She is usually in Colorado working out at some ranch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  [COUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might like to go out there too huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's she do out there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She works with like all the horses and stuff, and like just all that fun stuff.  Yeah, just the horses and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really, where's her home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's from [DEIDENTIFIED] I think.  She actually knew some friends of mine from [DEIDENTIFIED] when I went to, went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's she studying here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Biology.  She's a biology major.  Was an art major until art history came around, it seems like anybody who was an art major, once they hit art history, it kind of turned them off from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's an artist?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um-hum.  Sure is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your age?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your age?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, maybe a year younger, I think she said like [AGE], around there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So her family's in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  So I'm keeping my fingers crossed on this one.  I, you don't find girls like this one too often around [DEIDENTIFIED], real big into outdoors, and rock climbing, and kayaking, and backpacking, and all sorts -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's her thing huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, oh yeah.  So you don't find those too often around here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's her name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].  Nice name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you give her a call.  What's your med been like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd have to say so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still taking your Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, that's, I ran out of that, the prescription and not too terribly long ago, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What have you noticed since you've been off of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was thinking about that the other day because I knew you'd probably ask and, uh, I can't tell a big, too big of difference, but I, but I don't know if I was working when I started taking it, when I was taking it every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, so since I, you know, now that I'm working, you know, I'm pretty just focused on working, so I don't really think about too much else, you know, as far as, you know, my mood or nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I, I think I found myself probably just pretty much the same mood, but just not as short on things, but just, you know, I think I'm, I think I'm all right without it when I'm not on it, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I don't know because I don't see myself.  I just do what I do.  So I couldn't tell you either way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but you know what it was like when you would obsess about things.  Get thoughts stuck in your head or have to repeat things, or check things, or, have things just so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, I, if you put it that way, probably.  I, I see myself doing that kind of stuff, I think a little bit more, but I, I do that anyways just because I think that's who I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I don't know, if we'll set, we'll put a piece of furniture in somebody's house, I don't know if it's just because I'm being nice, or if it's because I didn't, that I didn't take the medicine, but I'll, I'll make sure their furniture is straight in the house, but you know, that could be just being nice and making it look good for the person you take it to.  You know, or if it's, you know, OCD.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So when you take it there, you have to get it just right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not just right, like I don't like, set it up and like step back and then like measure it and make sure it's equal distance from the wall or anything, but you know, if one is inches off the wall and the other end is like right up against the wall, you know, I'll pull it out to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, make sure it's not crooked, but I don't obsess about it.  But I definitely like being on that.  I definitely, I definitely -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You felt better on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if better, but I just, I felt like things went smooth with it.  I think things are smooth without it as well, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're right.  I think that when you're working, you're busy and I think that helps, to occupy your mind and it worse when you not have an occupied mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I can definitely, I can definitely, definitely tell that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've been off it for a few weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you having troubles getting refills?  I mean, you've got, there should have been refills on this one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There was a refill on that one?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, there should have been.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I didn't see a refill on that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Never run out of your medicines, you know, it's important, just call me and I'll call it in for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, the last time I was here, um, we didn't make an, I didn't make an appointment when I left because they were, I don't know what they said why we didn't, but they said they were going to call me like the first week of, um, January, and make an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we never did huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that never happened, so I, I ran out of my medicine just a little while ago.  And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm sorry they didn't call you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, I mean, it's, it's no big deal about that, and I just wanted, I went ahead and called just one day before anything got too filled up and luckily somebody had a cancellation so I could get in now because it was going to be in like a month or so before I could get in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we can always call them in for you.  And your other medicine you're taking, which is the, is it just the tablets or are you taking the long-acting also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The who?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking the 30 mg, extended releases and the 10 mg and was it 40, 40 mg [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oxiphen, that's a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can never remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Your driving's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nobody's put a gun to your head anymore have they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That still flying through your head once in a while?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean, I think about it on occasion, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would think you'd say, I think about it, you know when I'm out some place around town at night, I'm thinking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] warned me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Look around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A friend of mine, it's like, "[PATIENT NAME], man, there's an, there's an apartment down there for rent, you ought to look into it since, you know, now that you're working and say you want to get out of your parent's."  I was like, "Well, what, what street is it on?"  "Down, down on the end of [DEIDENTIFIED]."  I was like, "Oh, I'm staying away from [DEIDENTIFIED], that's the street that it happened on."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is off what road?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], right off of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, it could obviously happen anywhere.  You heard about that woman at the bank.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, that was during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The bank was open.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was right down the, like, my house is off the turn, down towards like [DEIDENTIFIED], and so that was just right, right down the street from my house.  I heard about it that morning when I got to, when I got to work.  That's a gutsy move right there.  At an ATM right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just probably a drug addict.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something, I don't understand, it's crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, she was a nice lady.  I knew her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh did you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was always really nice.  Anyway.  Your family's well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm glad you're getting away a little bit too on your weekends, not just a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I try, I try and get off and do some fun stuff as often as I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's equally as important as, you know, trying to contemplate your future, is being out there and doing different things and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been, I've been trying to, trying to get out there and do what I like to do, but at the same time, you know, do other things and, and that just so I can meet different people too.  Meet new people.  I've probably met several new people that just happen to have known a few of my friends now, or friends now from before and stuff.  So, it's fun.  Keeping busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not worried too much, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Getting enough sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'm finally getting back to my, my good sleep routine.  I get in bed early and get up, get up early, so I can't sleep past 8:00 now, which is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're going to be talking about horses and Colorado and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They going to open up a roping course on the ranch out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Brand new roping course and I'm sure they're going to looking for somebody to run it, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, maybe.  Maybe somebody with some experience.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe, maybe I know somebody that has experience in roping courses and wouldn't mind just roughing it out there in Colorado on a ranch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Long way from South Carolina.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's not a bad idea, not bad.  I could use a little -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Distance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Away from South Carolina time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That might be a good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it would be.  I've been actually thinking about doing something like that for a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, you're thinking about the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, working on a ranch has been in my minds for years, and I never, I never actually tried it.  I was going to but I hadn't committed to working out at camp this summer just yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you sent you app in for a reason, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I told them last summer that, that last summer very well could be my last summer out there.  So I told them, don't, you know, don't count on me being there this summer, so I gave them a heads up and I'm weighing out my options right now.  I'm kind of leaning towards heading towards the west.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, we talked before about, you know, just kind of figure out exactly what you're going to do, but you don't know what's going to happen and what possibilities there are unless you're living a life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's what you're doing more now of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking I might head out there for a little while, something new, something I've always wanted to do.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you seem pretty content at this point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your brother doing well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is.  He's, actually, I think he just got home from Texas last night.  He went there, or maybe yesterday afternoon.  He went to Texas for a weekend long conference or something like that for camp counselor.  So he's, he's doing that stuff and working out at camp everyday and stuff like that, so he's doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you better get out of here and go deliver to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you get low on your medicines at some point, please call me.  Give me a day or two notice and I'll mail them to you or you can come by and pick them up that day or the next day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that's, yeah that was really what I was calling about the other day to see if I could come get them, but when she said it would be a good while before I could get an appointment, but luckily they had a cancellation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we always have people that have a change of plans.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're busy.  Take care of yourself.  It's always good to see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll do that absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eating okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think, I think I've, gained, gained a few pounds on me and probably lost a few, and then gained them back in muscle.  I eat, I've been eating real well when I, when I have time before work, I'll eat a good breakfast and I eat lunch and dinner every night, so now that I'm out up and about and busy, I work up a good appetite.  Before I usually just snack on things the whole day, but now I'm you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eating healthier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm waking up, eating about 5 eggs, 5 sausages.</p>

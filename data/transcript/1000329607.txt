<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) I'm having to make myself begin today (sniffle) as I suppose I often do (clears throat).  And every time — there are probably a lot of things that are on my mind.  And every time I s—, think well, I'll start here, then something else (clears throat) comes into my mind.  And I, I know that when I first start I always feel I want to think through what I'm going to say before I start saying it (clears throat).  For instance, when I first came in I was thinking about giving you the check and the fact that the first time I did, from your reaction I took it that this had never happened this way before and, and that you didn't expect it.  And so then I concluded that I'd done the wrong thing.  And so I didn't know what to do the second time.  And I decided that there was no reason I couldn't give it to you and, and it was almost, again, testing myself to do it because it made me nervous.  And having decided to do it, I just sort of did it and I felt very awkward doing it and then that made me (laughs) feel uncomfortable.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Do you have any recollection at all of, eh, what you felt indicated that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Just your going, "Oh!"  Or s—, as if you were surprised.  (Clears throat) Which I took to, to mean that it was unexpected and then I, from that, drew the conclusion that it —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Unacceptable.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I suppose.  Not, that's awfully strong.  More just that it, it hadn't been done that way and, and I don't know if I could tell how you felt, but just that if it hadn't been done that way then it must be wrong for me to do it that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Ah!</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) And then I thought of the fact that, uhm, I was wondering if I could come earlier on Friday if it would be possible.  And actually, there are many Fridays when, if it's possible and it doesn't make any difference to you, it would be easier for me if I could.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What time did you have in mind? /</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I kn—</p>

<p>ANALYST:  If I recall that you said the earliest you could be available is 1:30, or 2:00.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  2:00, 2:00.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  2:00, Mm.  I'll look into it and see, okay?  I'll let you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking about the fact that today I had (clears throat) some more conferences and they seemed to run longer than usual.  And I was just thinking about why they took longer.  And in some cases the children being discussed were children with more serious problems and some of the others that I've talked about and ones that I've felt were hard to express so I didn't know exactly how to express them.  But then it just seemed to me I had done all the talking in the conferences today.  And I was thinking of one in particular when the mother didn't really say too much.  And, ah.  If I indicated at all I was going to talk then she would listen and not make any attempt (clears throat).  And so I sort of felt compulsive about talking on and on.  And I was just thinking of the fact it seemed like I just went around in circles instead of trying to find things out from her.  And there were things I wanted to find out.  Some I did ask her but, I don't know, it was just almost I was filling a void with talk.  And (clears throat) I think she was the kind of person that didn't feel the need to be constantly talking or would have talked constantly.  And so she didn't fill things in when I wasn't talking.</p>

<p>And just remembering that and I think I feel uncomfortable in remembering it.  And I think part of the reason I do is because I had the feeling she was just sort of sitting there and, in a way, perhaps, she was interested but then the more I went around in the circles — I don't know whether I really did but it just seems as if I must have — the more I did that, the more she must have been thinking, "Well, why doesn't she come to the point and just say it?"  And I think people who do listen carefully and just listen and not try to talk too always make me feel uncomfortable.  And then I always react by getting nervous over it and talking more.  (Clears throat) And I think the other part of this particular time, it was because I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to say.  And, in a way, I think now I should have just not said anything.  But yet I always have that feeling that I have to say everything and cover everything.  And so really, in this boy's case, I was saying some things I didn't really need to.</p>

<p>And of course, there were several conferences afterwards I realized that for the parent's sake you should start by positive remarks and then go to things that need work.  And there are several I can see I started the other way because the things that I wanted to talk about were so much on my mind I was trying to find ways to say them.  And I wasn't thinking of putting the parent to ease first, at ease.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And then another thing out of probably many (clears throat) that keep coming to my mind in regard to MSCZ and just my relationship with him, is on Monday evening, after I got home, I had to do the laundry.  And I have always just hated that more than almost anything else that I have to do.  And I wasn't, I was feeling in a pretty good mood but I can just, I just suddenly realized when I was going to the laundry I was feeling sort of put upon or that because I was doing this, it meant that I was, I don't know, almost doing something that would deserve attention or deserve some nice thing in, in place of it, that MSCZ should be particularly nice to me or do some favor for me or just be appreciative.  And when I've done the laundry I'm always approaching it that I've done something that he should be appreciative over and, and, ah, as if, if it's some great accomplishment.</p>

<p>And I used to feel — I don't so much now — but I used to feel really put upon in that same way over so many of the different things, over having to prepare a meal all the time and to clean the house and just, just about everything.  I don't mind taking MSCZ's shirts to the cleaners any more.  But I used to hate doing that.  And I used to, ah, oh, I still do feel annoyed at him if he doesn't do little things that will help me like turning his sock—, not balling his socks up when he throws them into the laundry chute.  And just little things like that really annoy me and then I feel almost like getting back at him if he, if he can't pull his socks out then I won't either and they'll just wash that way and too bad for him.  Or almost like I'll make a bargain with him: if he'll do that, then I'll so something for him.  And sometimes I don't get particularly annoyed but sometimes I can, I just get so mad at him when I open up the thing and there are all these balled up socks that I hate to handle.</p>

<p>Or sometimes when I'm cooking supper — and this used to be true a lot more — I'd (clears throat) be really annoyed at him when he was going to be late.  Especially if he didn't tell me.  And even sometimes when he told me he'd be late, I'd just be mad at him for being so late and I'd have to be doing something so late in the evening.  And sometimes I would almost consciously plan it so I'd be, I'd finally give up waiting and start eating just about the time he'd come home.  And it's almost like I was going to show him, or something, I don't, I don't know exactly the feeling except I know that I wasn't thinking about him at all, it was all thinking about myself.  (Pause) And I know it just seemed to me that he really wasn't trying to come home.  He could have if he'd really tried to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it makes me think it's almost, it probably is the same thing as the time that his grandmother died.  And this was the grandmother who'd been very important to him in bringing him up.  And so he was quite upset.  And it was over the 4th of July weekend so that this meant plans we had had had to be cancelled.  And although I felt sorry for him that he'd lost his grandmother, I was very annoyed that that weekend had to be cancelled because it meant I'd be doing, I'd be staying in PNWN when I didn't have any plans and I didn't really know what to do with myself.  And, ah, then he found out he could come up Saturday to see me.  And so I was looking forward to that.  But then he was quite late and I just got furious.  And I was feeling very hurt and put upon again that if he'd wanted to, he could come on to, he could have made it on time or he could have called to let me know.  And so by the time he got there I'd built up a temper and I was just furious at him and very unpleasant.  And of course, here he was already upset at something and, again, I wasn't thinking about him at all, I was just thinking about myself.</p>

<p>And it's the same thing as really, with the conferences when I did all the talking.  It was being too busy thinking about myself.  (Clears throat) Or I've done this with my assistant a lot.  Sometimes I'll go for days without really ever asking her anything about herself or talking about anything sort of personal to her, which she likes to do.  And it'll, an—, I'll have all these things on my mind for school and instead of stopping to think about her a little bit, maybe comment on her nice dress or something, I'll just talk about the school things.  And it's almost like a rejection of her, I think, almost like she's not important enough to even think about.  And it just made me think that in my family, the things we'd talk about an—, at home or when we came home from school, as far as I can remember right now, were always things connected with school.  I can't believe that was really true but, again, it was almost like that's the kind of personal question you could talk about and you wouldn't talk about other little things like who did you walk home with or who did you see during recess, or anything.  It was never that kind of concentration.  It was always "Well, how did you do at school?"  And, "Do you have any papers that you want to show us?"  And things like that.  So that it showed that school was the important thing or the school work was the important thing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Then I was talking to a girl today who in some ways has had a similar upbringing in feeling that you don't leave a job when you have one, that you should develop it to the best of your ability and use your abilities if you have them.  I think she was trained more that way than I was but somehow we felt a certain sympathy for each other in, in our attitudes.  And she wants to leave teaching.  She's the one I used to be the assistant to.  And her, and she's finally decided she's going to.  But it's hard for her to do it because she's always felt you don't leave something when you've started it.  And you go as far as you can go in it.  And it just occurred to me that it just seems like it's almost suggesting a lack of confidence in yourself or the person who's training you that that person has no confidence in you because of all this planning ahead and sticking with something once you've started and going as far as you can go because you have to really work at it.  And, I don't know, it just, it all just seems to suggest that you don't think you can do anything else or that you're, you can't just suddenly leave it and, and you won't be able to find anything else or that that's the only ability you have (clears throat).  Or that it's going to use an awful lot of hard work in order to really have one that is worth anything.</p>

<p>And this almost frantic need on the part of my mother to plan ahead on everything, again, it just strikes me right today, anyway, that it's not only suggesting that she doesn't have that much confidence in us that we can suddenly pick up and on the spur of the moment do something that would be equally good, but that she doesn't have the confidence in herself, either, first to handle the problem of having a child on her hands suddenly without summer plans or z____ plans for a day or plans for school for next year, or whatever and that she just anyway has to run her life that way because otherwise she doesn't think she can count on herself.  And it makes me think of my sister's wedding.  I wasn't there for the part of this that I'm describing but everybody else spoke of it with such feeling that it must have been pretty bad.  And I guess she just had a list and had a clipboard and it's all, the clipboard sort of the symbol of this.  And she just trotted around everywhere with this clipboard and kept her little list and her orders and her plans for the day and plans for all the different things that had to be done.  And she was terribly compulsive about it.  She never could vary from the list.  And it drove everybody in my family crazy, just everybody complained about it, even my father, who doesn't usually complain about this aspect of my mother.  And when my wedding came along she wasn't that bad because she knew she'd really annoyed people but she still had this need to plan ahead.  We weren't being married till August and in March she was already after me to plan things.  And I just didn't want to plan ahead, partly because I didn't want to get married, in a way, but partly, too, just because I knew I disliked planning ahead.</p>

<p>Or maybe it was just to resist her, I don't know.  I never could figure it out.  But I just knew that I wanted to see if I couldn't just plan the wedding simply and have it simple and of course it wasn't but that's what I had wanted.  And it just occurred to me well, maybe part of it was not wanting to make choices and therefore resisting planning ahead.  Although I think sometimes, like plans for the summer, it was a matter of not liking the choices available and not knowing, not having confidence in myself to figure out what other choice I might want.  Sort of the same thing I was talking about with this girl today that she was saying, "I think I just want to do something that I just like doing."  And I said, "Well, what would that be?"  And she said, "Well, I don't know."  And it, it would be true of me too if I found I didn't want teaching although I do like it, and had to think of something else I might like to do and I just wouldn't have any idea where to even begin.  Because that isn't the aspect of doing something that you dwell on, you don't do it because you like it.  You do it because it has a good purpose or you feel you can handle it or, I don't know, just liking it is nice.  It, it comes with it but that's not the reason for it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I felt sort of funny about the election yesterday, too, that — although I think this is not just me this time — but it's happened to me before so it is something and, that I do.  First of all I didn't want to make a choice because I didn't like either Humphrey or Nixon.  And I didn't even consider Wallace.  And second — and I tried to be more aware for this time.  I think in other elections I just haven't been aware because I didn't really want to make a choice and it helped not making a choice if I didn't pay much attention to the people.  But also, when I voted my thinking sort of was that I wouldn't mind if the other one won because then I wouldn't feel responsible for his being elected.  And that didn't seem to me a very good way to react either. (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose in a way that's — some reason I thought of the conferences again and, and in telling the mothers everything it's not only to protect myself but it's really just handing them the responsibility, in a way.  Not that I won't try to do something about it at school.  But it's almost like by telling them so they know, I'm no longer responsible.  I — (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking, too, about the fact that I hate, I still feel this way about responsibility only not as strongly.  But I didn't like taking responsibility for anything more than just me and my school—, my own personal schoolwork.  So I didn't really get involved in a lot of committees and clubs and things at high school.  But yet, occasionally I did.  And when I did I'd overdo it in a way.  But when something worked out well then I'd be really pleased.  And then later, maybe a few years later, if I thought about it — I'm thinking in particular about a drive we were making for money to help the hungarians and, during the revolution.  And it happened we had 2 hungarian students at school.  And I had to write and plead for aid over the loudspeaker.  And I used these students and whatever I wrote went over well.  And I coul— I almost couldn't believe I'd actually done something that went over well.  And maybe several years after, thinking about it, or even now, it's almost as if I've disassociated myself with whatever I thought of that I can't believe I really could have thought of something.  And I used to do this with papers that I wrote (clears throat) mostly in high school, not so much in college.  But sometimes if I read one over again I wouldn't bel—, I couldn't believe that I'd written something that was even that good, however bad it was, I'm not sure it was terribly good.  But I couldn't even believe that I'd done it that well.</p>

<p>So then I tried to recall the thought process I'd gone through to figure out what I was going to write and of course I wouldn't be able to.  And it would just seem like it wasn't me that had done it.  It must have been somebody else.  And I even got this feeling that, when I was at college, that I had done better work when I was in high school and that my participation in classes had been better.  And so then I decided well, it was because I found high school more stimulating.  But I know that isn't true.  And I found I can hardly throw away some of these old things.  And part of it is just the aspect of throwing away but part of it is this feeling that I did do it and I'll never be able to do it again so I'd better hang on to them.</p>

<p>And it's the same with some letters that MEIN, the french boy wrote to me.  I can't throw them away and I feel very unhappy about this, that I can't throw them away.  And sometimes I think well, I should just throw them away, just one day go in there and throw them away.  And then I always stop myself.  And I almo—, and I feel sort of guilty because somehow it seems to reflect on how I feel about MSCZ if I don't throw them away.  And it's not that I sit there and read them over or look at them, or anything.  But it's just somehow knowing that these letters were written by somebody who cared about me when he wrote them and said things that indicated he cared.  And I can't believe that anybody is going to care about me that way again, or write things that way and therefore how can I throw them out?  And it's funny, I almost believe — maybe it's because of these letters — that at the time, when he did care about me, he cared more about me than MSCZ does now. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I know one day I was trying to describe how I felt about him or what I — well, I can't remember exactly what it was but I can s—, thinking about him right now, I think part of it is this feeling that there was never anybody who seemed so completely devoted to me.  In a way now I probably would think too much so, that it meant something was wrong because it was too much at the time.  But — I suppose some of it, too, was that as much as other people cared about me they've all been critical to some extent.  And he never was.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You made the point about MSCZ, uhm, several times, you know, how strongly you've wished at times that he would accept, eh, I think you call it companionship or a, or platonic relationship.  It occurs to me when you're telling me about MEIN now to wonder if that was indeed a platonic relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) It's a completely new thought because on the surface it didn't seem so because I felt a very strong physical attraction to him and it seemed he did to me.  But when I was just thinking about it now, in a way, aside from that it was almost like we were brothers and sisters, a brother and a sister (pause) and that there was a sort of a emotional dependence on each other that I don't think you can really feel if you're really loving someone.  (Pause) And it's something I've never known what it means, too, is the fact that even now, when I think about him I do have a certain feeling of affection toward him.  Or it's just a feeling that doesn't ever seem to go away and I mean, sometimes it isn't very strong but it's, there's still some kind of a feeling for him there.  And the fact that I'll never think he was anything but a very fine person and that there was something between us for a while that was very important to both of us.  And maybe you're more apt to retain that if you have more of a platonic kind of relationship.  I, I just don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, of course what I was, eh, wondering was, you see you have said that, eh it would be very nice if MSCZ would accept that platonic relationship with you —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I, that, well, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And why can't he, you see.  And then —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But what I meant by that was not, I mean I, what that means to me now is more that we just don't have any kind of a physical relationship at all.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But that wasn't the way it was —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  With MEIN.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You did have.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  And I felt very, I was afraid of it because I felt very strongly about the fact that I had to watch myself because I wanted a very physical relationship with him.  And this is why I've felt since then that I must have loved him and only him because I never have felt that way bef—, ever since, not that strongly and so forth.  And I just can't figure out whether I felt that way with him because it was just the summer and in a way I knew the end was coming even if I didn't admit to myself that it was really the end and not just a separation for a while.  But somehow the relationship already had limits and maybe I then felt free to experience feeling within those boundaries.  Because I can remember even then, at I don't know exactly when I started thinking about the fact that I might want to marry him and not just enjoy his company for the summer but, anyway, at some point it did.  And then we never talked about it.  And one time we were hitchhiking and som— somebody asked if I was his fiancee.  And he answered.  And I don't know whether he thought I even I had understood.  But he had said something to the effect of, "Not yet."  Which was the closest he'd ever come to talking about thinking even that he might want to marry me.  And it made me feel very happy but it also, I don't know, it just, it was like that was the height and then after that things were never quite the same.</p>

<p>And I, I think it was after that that I might have begun to complain more and become more emotional about our relationship and just — I don't — it, just, right now when I think about it, seems to be a point that our relationship changed and that I, as much as I felt happy, I felt very disquieted by the fact that, even though we both might have been thinking about that privately, that it had come out in the open.  Because then we did talk about it afterwards.  And as much as I thought that I wanted to marry him and as much as I believed we could work any problems out that might come just from our being from 2 different countries and as much as I thought I couldn't stand the idea of not marrying him, it almost seems like underneath it all I didn't really want to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time is up.</p>

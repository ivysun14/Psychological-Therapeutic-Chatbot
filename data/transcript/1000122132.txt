<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I said, well come on, you know why did I even think about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like not knowing how those people are going to respond to that. Like you said what you planned to say that you thought would really go over great...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it backfired. (Inaudible at 0:00:21.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's... No actually if I think back on it now it was my main statement. It was groping for something to find rather than having something to find. Groping for something to say rather than having something to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying very hard to find something that would the match the wit of the other people. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The type of friends that I have now are generally people that I was just in close proximity with and eventually got to know and enjoy like neighbors for instance. And rather than someone that I was introduced to and therefore developed a relationship because that first really important part was the interaction. Anytime that I meet someone with the express purpose of interacting with them, like a dinner party, at a wedding, across a bridge table with a new partner, I'm just so self conscious. [0:01:25.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think of yourself and how you're looking to them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it probably boils down a lot to conceit. I don't know. It's hard to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To thinking... What do you mean by that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well thinking only about myself. Never really worried about the other person other than the fact of what's he thinking about me. I'm pretty sure I don't behave that way with my friends. People that I know well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't spend it on yourself with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. As a matter of fact I try to really get away from that. I've noticed some traits in some people and I'm making concerted effort not to handle myself. Well first I've noticed my mother will never admit she's wrong. I noticed that several years ago and I thought I never admit I'm wrong. I will pursue... When I haven't been proven wrong I will try and redefine the definitions of what is wrong just to show that I'm right. That's the type of thing I started to realize and so with my friends I admit that I'm wrong and I'm wrong and it's fine. That was hard to do but lately it has been much easier. [0:02:42.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you notice the fact that you get like that and other times I don't want those. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I only do that with people that I'm comfortable with. The characteristics that I have when I'm with real people are constructed on the spot. For instance, when I was with these older people, wow did I really shine inwards at times back in the corner and other times I'll be real loquacious and out and out just really dominating. [0:03:20.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you change a lot when you are with them. But you can't count on yourself to be the way you usually are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I wish I could you know. The more I talk about it the more I think well gee what a trivial little problem. It doesn't seem to be anything at all that I should bother you with or even bother myself with; but it really does disturb me when it happens. I mean subsequent to interactions. And I really don't like what I end up being. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it seems minute. [0:04:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the more I think the problems that you might have to encounter with other people; you get someone coming in here with this crap. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like eeh, like why did you turn fat little piggy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But to me it really bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's like you want me to know that it might sound trivial but it really isn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not to me, no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that certainly other people have really much worse problems. It might be easier to resolve. It might be harder to resolve and it might disturb you more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this one does disturb you even though it might not sound like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The point is what's disturbing me now mostly. It really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really does. [0:05:02.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I mention that after I took the test, I was told, all I remember was her first name was Marcy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my God a girl. What am I going to do here? Since then I thought how am I going to interact in this social encounter? How will I talk about a sexual problem with a girl? How will I interact now? Why should I have done that? Why shouldn't I have just come in here and be honest? I hope I'm being honest. But just the thought that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thought that you had to be bothered with that. Here you had to go through that again another situation. Is it also somehow harder to talk to me about say sexual problems than say if I were a man? [0:06:07.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't think so because I haven't really talked to anyone about my sexual problems so it is hard for me to talk to anyone at all. No I take that back. There might be some people with whom I'm really close that I would rather not talk to them about it. Talk to them about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's easier to talk to somebody who doesn't know you quite so well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A person you know that has handled these types of problems before, understands these types of things much better than I, and wouldn't just say, "Well I know you, now let's bring the sex into it." I guess the familiarity is the most important thing, yeah. I can treat it objectively with you I think. I hope. [0:07:02.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a familiarity and also like a feeling of here's somebody who has some experience hearing that particular kind of things or those kinds of things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The first couple of times the sexual problem occurred I...Well you know how recently the gay liberation front and everything was publicized. Well that's really the healthy me. That's the way I am now and I thought...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way you're healthy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well with that type of experience. I mean if that's sexually the way I behave best. I didn't occur to me that it was only happening when I was stoned. We might as well talk about the sexual thing. It's really tied in with this tight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see. When I was at college, there were several girls that I was really in love with and having affairs with and whatever you called it back then. Well we were screwing, ok. And then I came here and I never really met anyone and in the summer of 69, it was two summers ago already, I met a girl and we had a great time. We enjoyed each other and loved each other. Towards the end of the summer and all of the fall she lived in New York. I really enjoyed that relationship. Then she went back to school and called it off (inaudible at 0:08:45.4). Since that time I hadn't really had a reasonable intimate relationship. I'm not talking about sexual now, but I've never really been in love with a girl since then or even had any interaction at all that would imply affection. It bothered me for a while and then I was talking about this older group of people, well when I say older the focal point of the group is a person in his forties, but he has friends younger than he including this one girl who is about thirty-two. This girl, because of my close proximity with this group of people, this circle of people, I kept seeing her like every day. Frankly she really loves me and so after I realized this I took advantage of it and I tried to see if anything wouldn't happen and it didn't. [0:09:45.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By that you mean if anything would happen what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Intimately. If I would end up being attached to her and its better that I won't. Brilliant girl and going somewhere too but there's just nothing there. But unfortunately, I do mean unfortunately, we subsequently had sexual relations and I decided that this was really being shitty. I wasn't being nice about it at all. [0:10:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were really taking advantage of her and being unfair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because I was having a craving for a long time. When I say craving I don't mean sexually craving but just like really having affection with anyone in a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even craving affection. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably as long as this other problem has been bothering me. They're probably the same problem. I don't know. But at any rate, I decided there are two ways to handle the problem and one is to just tell her frankly that it's never going to go anywhere. I didn't. Couldn't. I don't why but I haven't done that. Instead I just decided that I will make it perfectly clear here to her that there would be no returning of affection. She still invites me over for dinner. I spend the night and she just doing unbelievably nice things to me and yet I... [0:11:20.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel any response to her really affectionately. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Plus I guess you're saying you feel guilty about the kind of situation you're in now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. I would feel guilty if I were leading her on but I've never once in any way said that it would go very far. Never once told her I loved her. Never once in any relation other than in bed behaved affectionately. I was with my nephew who's not a nephew. He's considerate in age. He's my age. He came to New York and we went out. I decided we'd have a good time so I looked up a couple of chicks and one of course was this girl and the other one was a neighbor who is engaged to someone else who lives in New Mexico but I thought it would be kind of nice. It was a nice evening. We went out and after it was over Michael and I came home. We took her out to a show and that was it. We had a few drinks and when we came home he said, "My gosh, she really loves you doesn't she?" So it must be apparent to everyone else too. It's not just something that I see. My ego saying alright, she loves me. She does. She hangs out. [0:12:41.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She really does love you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not in any way encouraging it. Well I guess I encourage it when I go over there and we end up in bed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you don't know what really to do about it. You feel uncomfortable. [0:13:02.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know what to do about it. The honest thing to do is just to tell her frankly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you know what the honest way is but you don't really want to do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I guess I don't. When I'm talking to you I say I do but I never end up doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like looking at it from a distance it sounds like the thing to do but when you're close in with her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's probably the same thing. It's so simple to say well just behave naturally. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's so hard to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's the opposite here because I'm being completely honest with her in that I'm not returning affection in any way. I'm now at the point where the standard thing for me to do is... Well she talks quite a bit and I point this out all the time. For instance, I'll yawn in the middle of one of her little... [0:14:09.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you point out that she talks all of the time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or when she calls me up or I will be doing some paperwork while she's talking. It doesn't bother me at all anymore. She knows that. No. My have of the relationship is as though we have been married forty years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you're not exactly indifferent to her but not ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not nice to her. If anyone behaved that way to me I don't think I'd put up with it very long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't stay around. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't understand why she does it. She goes away on a trip and she's got a brand new car. She went to Maryland and said, "I'm going to be away for a few weeks, if you want the car, use it." I didn't want her car. Or she'll invite me over for dinner all the time and it's just amazing. [0:15:11.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it takes you by surprise that she'll keep doing these things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like here she's being so nice to you and you just don't feel anything and you're not really encouraging her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it could be that. For instance, every now and then we'll be kidding around or something and I'll say something cutting her down probably what it amounts to. And in retaliation she'll try to tickle me or grab me or push me or something like that. I will cringe away from her. That isn't me. Because when I really look back in my past the times that I've been in love, I'm really quite affectionate and don't behave that way at all. As a matter of fact I probably make an ass out of myself behaving the other way. But that's how I am. This is completely unlike me. But I think it just shows that I don't really love her. [0:16:32.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like it's kind of an easy situation to continue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's too easy. Well she's quite a bit older than I and I don't know if that turns me off or not. I don't know. It's sort of an interesting thing too. It's sort of become a joke. It certainly has become a joke and probably by my encouragement with my roommates and this other group of people that I mentioned. Three groups of three apartments that we go out together. The first thing was everyone I know wanted to sit down and talk about it. She was going for bridge. People would say, "My God she'll just rant on and on and on." That was a standard joke and then the other joke after that was everyone started noticing the way she was pawing and handling me. So it became the standard thing was well I'll do that again or something like that. I'll have to say I didn't discourage it. [0:17:36.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kind of fun to be part of that joke. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't know if that's right. I think it more of the fact that I wanted it clear that I wasn't becoming involved with her. I think that was more of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted them to realize that if anybody was involved it was her. Yeah. Yeah. Well it must be sort of gratifying too in a way to sort of have... [0:18:13.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well how do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it kind of helps your ego or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well my ego doesn't need any help though. That's the problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Needs none what so ever. That's the last thing I need. If I eventually had to live like if I was thrown on a dessert island tomorrow and had to live there the rest of my life, I don't think that anything that I've done with my life or how I've acted to other people would be something that I would just hate the rest of my life alone. I'm happy with what I've done. I don't think I've ever really compromised my standards too much. And yet this ego thing it just seems to be... [0:19:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're really concerned that you've got too much ego. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if what I should do is pursue what we've discussed or if I should confound your mind with multiple things that I've noticed about myself. Which would you prefer?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it probably doesn't matter to me. I'd prefer you do whichever feels more useful to you. Really. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not my mind that I want you to be worried about it's your mind. You know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I see. Ok. I may become contradictory here mainly because of the fact that I probably haven't examined myself as deeply as I'm doing now. I hope you noticed that. Go back over the tapes and find out. [0:20:10.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You hope I notice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah certainly. But here's something else I'd think I'd notice. If it's kind of think anything else it may very well be that's why I'm confused. However, my father has a bad temper. I had a bad temper when I was young too. I really despise this trait in my father and therefore, I've now gone to the opposite extreme. There are times when I should just be really furious and I will not react at all. I have two rather inconsiderate roommates and when they do something that is inconsiderate I just absorb it completely. I think I would probably be better off if I would get mad or say something but I don't. This is something that I've noticed in myself that's new. Relatively new. [0:21:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't get mad even when it seems like you should.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and when I do get mad... Gee I haven't been mad in a long time. The way I used to get mad. You know ranting and raving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you've gone completely in the other direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another thing that probably ties into this, it certainly does because it's me. When I was about 12 I had an ulcer. The reason I had that ulcer was my sister. I went through school not as myself but as my sister's little brother and my sister had just tremendous achievements to her name. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had to follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had to follow and I was forced to do this. When I went away to college and no longer followed her through school, I got rid of the stomach problems because the tension wasn't there. Although the tension wasn't there to follow my sister but yet it was still there because I had been brought up with doing well all along, but I still was required to do well just in my own self. [0:22:18.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was so built in by that time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say that one of my strong characteristic traits is the fact that I'm very very achievement oriented. It's got nothing to do with personal payment or anything like that. Let's define and achieve. Well defined. Like right now it's important to me to get my doctorate in physics. That's a big deal for me. That's a piece of paper. My goal is not to understand physics and my goal is not to be a good physicist. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But your goal is to get that PhD. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My whole life revolves around finding a new really well defined goal. [0:23:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you look for those. Searching goals. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like this one here has been as consuming for quite a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it absorbs your whole life or much of it anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have kind of an interesting... Actually I should see you probably right after about the first of June because I have a big exam coming up in June. If I make the exam, it's clear I'll get my degree here. If I don't, I'll have to leave. It's probably the most pivotal point in my life so far. Most certainly the most pivotal point in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The most critical thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's going to be interesting to see how I react one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if I don't make it, it will really be the first time I've confronted failure. If I do make it, it will be, in my mind, certainly really one of the most important achievements in my life. [0:24:07.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So something will really happen to you either way but you're not at all sure how you'll react.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've thought about how I'm going to react but I don't know whether or not I will react that way. Really way back, deep in my mind, if I do fail, I really hope I crack. Just blow everything. Maybe drop out for a while and just get lost. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. If you fail you want it really to affect you somehow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I don't know if I do or not. I have that thought back there. I mean not just to affect me and I behave way differently but to just have a complete breakdown. A physical breakdown. I don't mean to say that I'll be bed ridden. I guess a mental breakdown is probably better. [0:25:27.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you'd want that to happen if you fail. You want to have a mental breakdown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think so. Which is really sad when you think about it. That just shows that I'm really such a... It's not an understanding of physics; it's whether I get a passing grade on this test. Such an arbitrary goal to have motivate one's life so strongly. [0:26:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm not quite clear. You'd want to have a mental breakdown because you'd want it to matter that much to you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why. I don't know why. Maybe to show people, well I don't know. It would really be the first profiled failure in my life. I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you want it to affect you profoundly. To do something profoundly to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I would think so. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's somehow connected with showing people something about that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe to show them that it's all consuming with me. Because indeed it is. There's no question. I mean like the last two quarters, I've done nothing but study for this exam. So I don't know. Maybe it's because if I were to fail and just to go on. Move onto another university and get my degree elsewhere. Which if I pass I will get my degree here. If I don't, what I'll end up doing is going to a lesser institution and get my degree there which is no great crime. It happens to people all of the time. Eventually I'll get my physics degree here or there. I guess I haven't really got it sorted out why. That's something that's way back in my head. [0:28:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Way back in a corner somewhere. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just crossed my mind a couple of times and I just wondered how that tied in. I don't know what to say. I just spoke. I could go on and on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me just stop you for a minute. It's ten till and we have to stop in a couple of minutes and a couple of things. Usually when people come in for the first time I try to say something about me being blind because I never know sometimes that affects people, sometimes that doesn't. So does that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No other than the fact that I recognize you when you came in because I used to eat at International House.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd see you walking along 59th Street. No that doesn't affect me at all. I used to live with a guy that was blind. Maybe you know him. Blacksmith called John-John. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: John-John. You used to live with him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just down the hall. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it doesn't bother me at all. However I'm amazed that you know exactly what time it is. How did you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I have a watch. [0:29:05.4] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other thing is how often would you like to come in? Like once a week or twice a week? We have twenty times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. Well the thing is I could go twenty straight hours a day which is ridiculous. I want to probably take the best advantage as I can of what's going on. I would like to have the time gauged on that more than anything else. Like will it really take a week for me to settle down and think well let's go at it again or longer or shorter or whatever. The only thing is that this test is coming up at the end of May and probably getting closer to that it'll really be an all consuming thing with me. It will be hard pressed for me to... [0:30:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like maybe you'd want to not come in for just right before the test for a while. Let me just say another thing. Did you know the counseling center is closing at 2:30? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It'd be best because I don't know if we'd be able to finish after that time or not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we'd better try to get something in before then. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And how many weeks do we have of doing that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we have April, May, June. Three months. About twelve or thirteen weeks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. So we have to meet a couple of times a week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Looks that way doesn't it. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Do you want to do it regularly then or irregular?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I would like to do it regularly accept if then you want to take out the exam then that would be fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Actually my schedule is much more free than yours I'm sure because all I'm doing is spending my time at home studying. [0:31:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. How do you like mornings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. I love them. Well let's see. Let me think here. Is 9:00 too early?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would like one of these two ways, either Monday and Wednesday at 9:00 or else Monday at 9:00 and Wednesday at 10:00 be for you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh how about the 9:00/10:00. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 9:00/10:00 ok. 9:00 on Monday at 10:00 on Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If you ever, Monday at 9:00 at up here of course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes but come to receptionist. If she isn't here at 9:00, come on up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If there's ever a case where you have an hour to fill like it's an odd time or you can't make one of these appointments, your secretary has the number I guess, so don't worry about my schedule. [0:32:05.5]</p>

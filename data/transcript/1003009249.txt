<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, we're going to like, anywhere from 12 to 15.  But it's not even hurting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the thing.  I mean, I'm like blowing it away, but I'm trying to be slow, and make sure everything's, but it's just, and I'm fine, and then you know, a couple hours later I'm fine, and then I start feeling a little bit of soreness, and by that nighttime, I don't want to sleep that night after, you know, working out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do, what time of day do you work our?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three-thirty.  Monday through Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So on the, at nights, other than -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't work out to rest.  I would normally go walking or something like that, but I mean, even before the surgery when I worked out, I could do more weight, more reps, and not be as sore.  So that's what freaks me out, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  So do you sleep better on the non-workout days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, that's another thing, my sleeping has gotten just horrible again, I mean, nightmares.  I slept really good the other night when we were in [DEIDENTIFIED] though, for a wedding fashion show.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just wish I [INAUDIBLE].  It's not my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not your thing, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I did good, I did really good.  I was there for [NAME OTHER]'s mom, and [INAUDIBLE] whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I don't know, it's, everything is kind of, all at once like, now I'm really healthy enough where I could at least do a part time job, if not more, and so I guess I do have that lonely [INAUDIBLE], I don't really have anybody to hang out with, and do stuff with.  But, I just found out that they're getting a peds patient in up, I got this stuff for hospice at the hospital, hospice down the street -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From me, and to just do, at the hospital, but we'll get into that later, so I guess -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, the [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] did a pediatric case, and most people can't handle that, it's sad, it's really hard -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's sadder that nobody would be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In my opinion.  And it's about pain management, and you know, they were like "We cant find anybody to help this kid", I'm like "Dude, I'm there" you know, he's in [DEIDENTIFIED], I mean, so, I'm really looking forward to that, even though I'm not getting paid money, and money is a big thing right now, to do something I think will really be a big deal, even if I just have him as one of my families, and don't have any other families right now, that's fine, I'm kind of trying to feel my way through what to do, but I've done the responsible thing, and so when I do go back to school in August, because what if I get sick again in October and you know, go, because they say if it doesn't work, I go straight back to the way I was before.  And that's just another school mess up for me, and that's just not responsible, that's not whatever, and you know, I'm having a hard time being [INAUDIBLE] for if you are, it's 15 years from now, you know, type of a thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, that's, that's hard and when I was in the hospital in [DEIDENTIFIED] the doctor was awful to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been in the hospital since I saw you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Back in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you mentioned that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he gave me the IV -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was screaming about, I went to see a cardiologist and he told me, so I thought about just going to tell him, and well he's already cussed me out and everything else, so now I'm really looking at, I just going to have to malpractice sue him, and it's just like, it, it's internally a war because I hate that people do that but, he's killing people my grandmother's age, most of his patients are 70-something, you know, if I hadn't, I mean, but I can tell even working out now that something is different with my heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Completely.  Aerobics is not my thing, like my heart aches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does your cardiologist say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said, just, he said the only way to prove that anything is wrong is to do open heart surgery and until I just get that bad, it's not work the risk, but he said absolutely, damage extent unknown, but yes, [INAUDIBLE] damage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's damage?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anywhere, in your heart, it just scars.  It can cause scars on your valves -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What causes it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The potassium-something he put in my PIC line -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's supposed to go in your superior -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And inferior vena cava, and it was burning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All the time.  He burnt out this blood vessel and when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED], just for the heck of it they were drawing blood, and I'm like, why don't we see if they really blew this huge blood vessel out in my arm, clots like this came out, I mean it is just a clotted mess in that arm.  And so, I mean, there goes my good arm, to draw blood out of, which is not a big deal, but the fact of, he's downstairs in the ER, cussing the nurses out, you know, [INAUDIBLE] them, and then just, I don't want to sue him but, but I don't see any other way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's through for me, I got all my records now, I just got to go and get a lawyer, and get it done, but I was really having a hard time in the beginning of this year, I felt myself getting nervous [INAUDIBLE] but it was because I knew I needed to do something about it.  And I just didn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know me, I can't sit there and let, and if that's all I can do then I have to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well yeah, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whether I win or lose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Injustice you don't do well with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.  That, that's exactly it.  And even if there's no justice for me, as long as, he's going to at least figure out oops, maybe I shouldn't do this to the next patient, that's good for me, that works for me.  But um, and I've still got that, and then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I want to work, and now I'm trying to decide what to do, and I have 2 complete different things that are on my plate of ideas.  And, one is in [DEIDENTIFIED], going to join the bridge program and getting our BS in nursing.  And possibly, you know, going from there doing whatever nursing that I enjoy for a couple of years, getting whatever paid off, possibly doing nurse-practitioning, or either after that going in to get my PhD in psychology and work with pain management, which is what, if the economy was what it was, I'd go straight for PhD.  In pain management.  Four years from now, I'm not hirable, probably.  An that's kind of what I'm looking at, I want to move full speed, able to come out of my parents spending that money or me taking out all those loans, and be hirable, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Course I'm worried about health care, retirement, and so nursing is good, and if I get the BS.  Instead of the Associate's I can teach, and I do want to teach some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really want to teach some.  Even if, if I went all the way to the nurse-practitioner, I would probably be more likely to just be the teacher nurse-practitioner than the listening to the doctor tell me what to do nurse-practitioner.  Of course you know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well they're independent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're much more that a PA.  The more research -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they're dependent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's, and I can't, I can't do it.  You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nurse practitioners are, are not dependent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what I like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's really, really what I like, and so, so uh, it feels good to at least know that, and they start in, they can start January -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I'm not waiting forever to, another August of nothing to do, to go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] and do it.  I like [DEIDENTIFIED] if I end up changing my mind, you know like I absolutely have to do medical school and just take years off my life, and then endometriosis worked which is just a stupid decision, which I remind myself of, but I think what kills me is, I would have been so good at it, and it was what I really wanted to do, and I really enjoyed it, and all the scars are still there, but it still would have been great, you know.  And then, but, at the same time the nurses were great to me, I still think I could do a great job, but I just, I just need to change things, be different than everybody else but do the same thing at the same time, to really touch people's lives at the same time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but nursing seems okay, I know, you know, I'll get yelled at by doctors, and people think I'm dumber than they are, but I've dealt with that my entire life, I  mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doctors get yelled at.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank God.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean everybody, everybody, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, gets grief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, my great worry though, is if I'm working and a foreign doctor starts cussing at me or something like that, that I'm going to flash back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, where are you having these experiences?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where nurses are getting cussed at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that's what happened when I was in, at, when I was at, in [DEIDENTIFIED], that's what happened.  My nurses, the nurses in [DEIDENTIFIED] weren't, but my nurses were crying every time they came in from my doctor, so that, I think it was just my one doctor -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's bizarre, I've never seen that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, when he cussed them out, cussed me out, he cussed like 3 different people out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That stuff isn't tolerated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So, so all right, I can at least complain and be not looked at as a tattletale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's totally out of line.  But, I've never seen that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I just, you know, I just want a little bit of respect.  I don't care if people know how smart I am, no big deal if they know how smart I am, you know, I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everybody deserves respect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's exactly, you know, what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing to do with the fact that you're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What you are, who you are, what job you have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, that's irrelevant, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But no, I find nursing exciting, and I'm excited to be able to go up and do that, and it's exciting if my health doesn't go 120% back to, you know, in terms of [DEIDENTIFIED] which my mind is still, is definitely there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nursing is great, good retirement, good health care, I really like the job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really, you know, it's much better you know, than anything else, I could still have the ability to teach if I wanted you know, to add on, I could always go back to school because I'm a huge dork and love doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I have all those opportunities to really do that, and I can move anywhere, I can be hired anywhere, I don't ever have to worry about a job, as far as finding one.  That's really a huge comfort, especially with the economy right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  I agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All my friends are losing jobs, I'm just watching, and my dad is having a hard time right now getting jobs, and it's really hard for me to sit back and watch, my parents started adding on to, ugh, adding on, that's a joke, my parents have built a few extra houses onto their house-</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it started before the economy just, and they just finished, and they didn't do some of what they planned to do because of it, but their plan [INAUDIBLE] there was a wedding for next June, and this wedding, like, I'm really trying to tone out how much money there is, I'm just being happy and I'm just telling them, you know, the tidbits I know, and that's it, but I know that there's already $50,000 spent.  No dresses, no flowers, that's food and alcohol I think.  Not getting to be that nosy, that's no wedding cake, which I get to be in charge of cakes, thank God, because [NAME OTHER] wants the most nasty tasting cake, I was like, they, can I just, I was like, you can look whatever it wants to look like, I just want decent cake, because I'm a cake lover, so I got that, I was really impressed, that's my only good job, so I was excited, so um, and I am officially the maid of honor, we went up there and went out with [NAME OTHER] and everything, and had a good time this weekend, she's actually asked me to come back down to [DEIDENTIFIED].  She's coming up, she's going to be there for an [DEIDENTIFIED] wedding, and her and [NAME OTHER] are coming early for the Mother's Day weekend thing, and hanging out at the lake with me and my date, and her and [NAME OTHER], so, and I think mom and dad might end up coming -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When did she ask you to be the maid of honor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She didn't, I totally just asked her this weekend, I'm like, "Am I your maid of honor?"  She's like "Yes, I thought you already knew that"  and [NAME OTHER] is sitting there, and he's like "Yeah, my dad asked me the same thing yesterday", evidently neither of them formally asked their man of honor and their maid of honor, so it's just, obviously, [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE], it's really funny, all that she has is what I've given her, like at the bridal shower thing, it was hilarious, and I'm like" [NAME OTHER] I told you,  you got to get something going."  But I'm not planning it, and I'm not doing it, I was like, I already found the bakeries for her, for the cakes, so I did my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When is the wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].  She's got plenty of time, but she wants a band, a wonderful photographer, a really nice dress, and I'm begging about the dresses, I'm like, I'm going to have to duct tape the stupid dress to me, and she has this, the bachelorette idea, and I'm trying to dig into her mind that I will have no money.  That I have no money.  I cannot afford to you know, do all these things.  I'm almost at the point now where I'm going to be like, " Do you really want to ask somebody else to do your bachelorette party" because I financially can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do it.  But, I've tried to preface it to her that way, but she just refuses to have it in [DEIDENTIFIED], and I understand, she goes to him like, every weekend, in [DEIDENTIFIED] but it's just a stupid bachelorette party, I mean, if you still want to be a bachelorette, then don't get married [LAUGHING].  You know, I mean, I understand wanting to have fun with your friends and everything, but most people are in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Why go away?  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where does she want to have it at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, like you wouldn't believe, like [DEIDENTIFIED], um, [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean, I'm not talking about like, oh, okay [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], I even tried, I'm like okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you don't pay for that.  People have to pay for their own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody, but I have to pay for her.  And, one hotel is a whole lot of money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's sleeping in bed with me whether she wants to or not.  I mean not on the floor, because you could get sick, because I'm not paying for 2 rooms, but it's just a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This will just have to be something your parents have to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have to pay for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  Exactly.  And mom and dad, they're kind of freaking out a little bit about it, but it's, it's good, and I'm just being really laid back about it.  I know everybody is still shocked and when, what am I supposed to do, I'm like the only thing is, I got really mad, she wanted to put orchids in her hair, I was like, I have wanted to put orchids in my hair for so long, I was like no, and she said that it's so in fashion now, I was like that is not what I want, because my grandfather raised them in the garden, and I've always loved them, and I've had like 15 orchids, I've raised them, I'm like, "You can have orchids anywhere you want, please just do not put them in your hair."  But she wants them on a headband, she's like "fine", I was like "You can have fake ones, and do whatever, I was like please do not steal my one, my one thing", because we have very similar taste and stuff, I can see us having almost, like her wedding will have 500 people, and mine will have like 100, but it going to like, look exactly the same, but that's okay, but that's assuming I'll ever get married, but I'm just stressed with nothing to do, and money is tight for me, but yet I see all this money on [NAME OTHER]'s wedding, my parents, and right now my bills are not matching up, because things are going up so much in price, and I'm trying to maneuver money around that doesn't exist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mentioned uh, you can do a part time job now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Can't find one.  I've been looking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a, that's a good thing.  You feel like you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Definitely, definitely.  I might go really tired to it in the morning, seeing that my sleep is so bad, but um, my brain is finally catching up to it, like when I started feeling better -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was [INAUDIBLE] I put 3 words in one.  I was really going back to the extreme ADD again, which obviously I am, like I would, and I still do that I'll pick a word that's very close to another word, like I could understand where it's coming out of my brain fast -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's almost like not fast enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like da-da-da-da-da.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about depression?  You seem uh, depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little bit.  It's kind of getting to me, I'm, I'm just real nervous about the future, I'm really doing the best not to be lonely, and talking on the phone with friends, you know, friends are lonely, people are getting married, but you know, I can't find a job, I can't help my parents out with money, you know, I've lost all this weight, it would be really nice to have some cute clothes.  I don't have a dime to put towards it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has your weight leveled off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One thirty eight.  I'd rather be 135 but 138 is fine by me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how are you doing on eating?  How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm taking this, still do a little bit of a smaller meal, I'm down to like 4 or 5 meals a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, there's snacks in there, but I'm still, I try to eat very healthy, I'm still not good on out to eat food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know, and that, I learned this the hard way, I do not, if I get some type of a food poisoning type thing, like normal people just urp it up or send it on out, my body doesn't send it on out anymore, because of the surgery.  But the first time, acts like, you know, my gut was like hurting bad, and I was like, you know, I eat just, not all bad reactions to yogurt -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, acidophilus and all this, and it took me forever, and then I realized that nerve of automatic dumping was cut, so I just now I know to take Phillips, because like 2 days later, the same thing happened, and I was like, but that just puts me near a bathroom, which I'm working, just to make sure I'm near a bathroom, where my, you know, whatever, but you know, I'm looking at trying to do just something at a doctor's office, you know, I've got so much experience, I mean it's ridiculous, for somebody who's never really worked, except for 6 months, I have a bunch of experience, as far as office management, patient management -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  You could do a lot of things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you learn fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  And so I'm just real excited and there's just, of course [DEIDENTIFIED] is just is in itself a really hard place, I mean, my aunt is looking for a job, and unfortunately there's a really good job opening coming up, and we're like after the same job, and I would be like 15 times better at it because I have experience and she doesn't, it's kind of like under the office management, it's billing, and stuff like that, and doctor stuff, but I'm getting ready to the point where I'm just going to go around and be like "I'll take minimum wage, can you just let me do something."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I feel like, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much time would the hospice uh, job take for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure yet.  They haven't told me yet.  But you know, it's usually my other experience when I just have one family, it's up to the family, normally, how much they want me around, but I would at least be there once or twice a week -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.  I'd probably do three to four hours at least, a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I'm doing it then I still might be there a little bit more to help them out  especially, it's worth it, and it's one uh, it's there, but that would give me experience with pain management too.  And they said that I would be able to assist nurses and things like that, which is good, and good experience -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To have on my side, definitely, no matter what end I end up going in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what, when are you looking to move to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably, I'm guessing, if I get into school, it would be January, if I have to wait until next August, I'll just wait, oh, before January, it would be like November, before the holidays, and get all that junk done.  If I don't get into that program in January, then I'll wail until August and I'll just move like May, or something like that, and enjoy my summer down there.  Because there are nanny jobs, babysitting jobs -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Junk like that, that I can actually do down there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you apply, I guess, in the fall for the next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which, having to explain the medical school grades, I finally came to the realization in order for people to look at me seriously, I just have to tell the truth, truth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's this bridge program you're talking about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just a, it's bridge for BS, instead of getting my Associates, they just see that I have all my pre-recs to get my BS.  It's the same amount of time period, but it's instead of getting your Associates you get your BS.  Which would allow me to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Initially just go higher if I wanted to, you know, if you get your Associate's there's a lot more hoops to doing you know, you don't get as many promotions, you don't really, you don't get to teach period, you know, you don't do nurse practitioning, you can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know me, I can't, an Associate's degree?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But what about going to school down there in uh, in uh, the fall, to show them you can do the work?  Because it's one thing that you're, you're, you're talking about you've got to explain you past academic record, but, um, what if you showed them an up-to-date record, like this fall, and took some classes, and, and did well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I thought about doing some classes, actually they have one that's some nursing stuff, that's just on line, all that stuff -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought about just, if I could start off to take some of the earlier classes-</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On that, and um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, not even nursing classes, just anything, you know, micro or whatever, you know, just to show them you can do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they might have doubts, you know, and go "this is the past, this isn't today" and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, definitely.  Yeah I could even do that [DEIDENTIFIED] but my parents are going to freak out every time money comes up, they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But uh, you might want to take them at [DEIDENTIFIED] so they can get recommendations from their people that they know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I was thinking, too, it would get you out of town.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, go in Jan, go in June, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, that would be really, really nice to uh, get out of there.  But then the sad thing is my friends there, actually down there, are all leaving in May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, they're all, but they all agree that it's a good place to go to school and stuff, but you know, it's exciting to think we'll all get to be able to meet a few people in school and in classes at least.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My sister will be there, which won't mean much but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My soon-to-be brother-in law will, and that's, means more, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened to you deal with [DEIDENTIFIED]?  I thought that was um, you were going to move there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, medical insurance won't let me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, the type that I have will only let me stay in state.  If I, because it's um, what is it, it's state pool?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can only live 6 months out of the year outside of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> South Carolina.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even as a student?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even as a student, that's what is the worst part about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We have tried to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they have the same thing in Georgia?  I can't imagine that we have better insurance plans in this state.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have looked into Georgia but their waiting list is longer.  It wouldn't be like, I could try as soon as I move, I have, I would almost be in -</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, how are you?  You doin' okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sniffling?  You got a cold?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, getting over one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  How long did you, was it a bad one or not so bad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not so bad.  I was out for half a day [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You had to leave in the middle of the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually kind of at the end.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, all right.  Um, I guess I saw you in the middle of December and you were actually doing pretty, um, you were doing well.  Um, um, let's see, now we talked about the kind of surprise you had on, um, I don't know if you remember, on a test, I think it was a social studies test, where it was all writing and no multiple choice, which you thought it was going to be.  And you still were able to manage to get through it and do it, which is pretty amazing.  That was great.  Do you remember that?  We talked about that a little bit?  Yeah.  Um, all right.  Anyway, um, so and I guess, I don't know, we talked about how it was, you know, you have a lot of incredibly creative thoughts and what not, like amazing, and putting, turning them from in your head through your hand onto paper, it seems to be what's kind of hardest for you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So, which, which basically, um, is very familiar to me since all three, not my kids all have some processing kinds of issues.  They all have ADHD, but they also have this thing, you know, where, especially my little one, it's like, like you.  Kind of these amazing, can tell you, make things up and writing them, you know, the boy had fun.  It's like, I mean, it was just so hard and as he got older and was keyboarding more, I mean that just basically was so helpful.  When you can write it, it's different than writing it with your hand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't type.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but eventually you'll be able to type, yeah.  He was not, he was older, um, but at some point, you know, you'll get good at, um, you'll get good at that and then that'll make it a lot easier.  Um, all right.  So, um, uh, I guess we talked about some of the testing you've had earlier, first grade or whatever.  Your visit was fine and it just was this, the whole processing of, visualizing words and actually the mechanics, so, how's the weather?  Um, it's not raining out or snowing or anything is it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not at the moment, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Did you get the fax I sent with her tests, her testing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wait a second.  Something, I'm sure.  Not, not recently, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it was after—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah, this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Her last appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right after, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, the testing from—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	From—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That we had talked about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That they had done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  'Cause I think she was still complaining about things being jumbled up on the page, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, I got it.  I read it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So I was wondering, I did talk to the school about additional testing for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I highlighted.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See?  Do you see?  I highlighted it.  Isn't that good?  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the said they don't do specific testing for things dyslexia.  That's more of a diagnosis.  They do identify learning disabilities as far as that goes, where there are discrepancies—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they try so hard not to diagnose them.  Whether you have one or not, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where did you see that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] him, takin' my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I've seen, like those little joke things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So the problem in trying to figure out what's going on is she's just far too smart and knows about things like dyslexia and it's hard to tell whether there's something really goin' on or she's pulling a scam.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you still having problems with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I don't think it's so much it's mixed  up on the page.  It's mixed up in my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I look at words on the page, I take them in and they get jumbled up in my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, wait, so you, does what they mean get jumbled up in your mind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  What they look like, what they sound like, what they are.  How they're spelled.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, but can you still understand what they mean?  Like by reading it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can understand what it means.  But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes.  But would you have trouble saying what the word, repeating the word or reading it out loud.  You might have trouble with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is, um, this is remarkable how well you're describing this.  It is.  I mean it's not, it's very unusual.  So, that's a compliment by the way.  You probably figured that, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was wondering if there anything else you might suggest for follow up at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] motor integration.  All right, um, I'm just, eh, lookin'.  The rest of it's, um, I don't know.  Um, there might be some, tell me, there might be some use, um, in having like seeing a, um, you know, someone who could do somewhat of a psycho educational evaluation, um, which I think would be a little, a little more, but than just, you know, psych testing, regular psych testing, but, um, now, um, your stuff goes through, your mental health goes through Magellan?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Aetna and Magellan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But Aetna does, Aetna's the, contracts the mental health out to Magellan.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  You've been through this how many times?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  What I'll, why don't I do this.  I mean, basically I'll ask, um, she's smart.  Um, I'll, I'll ask, um, I mean, I guess we want to look at the, specifically like, um, visual motor, you know, um, I guess we want to tease out dyslexia.  All right, I'll see if he has any suggestions.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and, I'll, you know, and it's basically, I'll tell him about the jumbled words in head.  Can understand but saying writing, I mean, does she ever read out loud?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  It always seems like she's guessing at what the word is, based on the first few letters, but it was really that she's, you know, I can't tell whether she's seeing the right word and saying the wrong one, or she's not seeing the right word?  You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean, this is, that's what you would expect if it's all jumbled up.  You can't, your brain can glance at it and know what it means, but not, you'd have trouble saying the whole word—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And writing it is like, I mean, oh, my God, it's got to be really hard.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I always just thought she was going too fast.  But, you know, I mean, her brain goes a lot faster than everything else.  But with the, where we've gotten to with the medication, I feel like that should be better and it's just one area that hasn't improved as dramatically as the rest, so, now that's makin' me wonder if there's somethin' else goin' on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, all right.  All right, so how, how are we doing otherwise?  In class?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, overall pretty good.  We had, um, one major problem at the YMCA where she got into a disagreement with one of the new counselors and the new counselor told her, well, [PATIENT NAME] started to threaten and run out the door of the building and the counselor looked at her and said don't you dare run out that door.  Well, that's what happened.  She ran out the door and, um, so, we talked a little bit about [PATIENT NAME] needs to become more of an advocate for herself and that when there are new people, she can't just count on them understanding and knowing what she needs and that she needed basically a timeout for herself.  Like she has a quiet place in the classroom and she has flash passes and different systems that work at the classroom, but then she has other systems at the YMCA and when you get a new counselor, they might not know what they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they won't know them, right, right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, um, I think that's kind of what happened and, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, that's I mean, it's remarkable what's in that head.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right?  Amazing.  Um, how about mood wise?  Irritability?  Mood shifts?  Depression?  Uh, anger, I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, hard, hard to sort out, she's definitely gotten more, um, less cooperative.  We're getting a whole lot more no's, I don't want to, you can't make me do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks!</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Some of it is definitely probably the pre teen years settling in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, but there's been, especially a lot of problems right when she gets home and we have to deal with homework.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That time of day.  She doesn't want to do it.  Um, we've got the Focalin tablets for after school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But even those, if she takes one some days, it just isn't doing it, I can't focus, I can't get it done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It seems kind of a tough time of day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What time does she come home?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We usually get home by five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're giving it to her, or they are?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  So, she gets home, she takes it, and then usually she has, you know, half an hour or so to have a snack or whatever, and then sit down and do her homework.  But that whole process isn't running as smoothly as it used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it works?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes, yeah.  But a lot of times not.  No, no, no.  Hey, hey, come one.  [INAUDIBLE] move that shelf remember?  Special area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and it's not affecting sleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, she has been having more trouble sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And these days when you give her this?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, in general I guess.  I'm trying to think if it's more on those days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I haven't noticed a strong connection but I really didn't think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Falling asleep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes coming down stairs and I'm not tired, I can't sleep.  And harder to wake up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, so you pick her up?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you usually get home by five.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What time do you pick her up?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right around four thirty or so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four thirty.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I guess, I don't think it's a major problem.  It's probably just something to know, and keep an eye on until her next visit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The sleep.  The sleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The sleep, the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but that's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Homework stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I mean the sleep would, um, I don't know, would make me reluctant to tell you to take one and a half of these, but I mean, you can't tell from what she's like when you pick her up how her homework's going to be can you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, not really.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I mean, if you could, if you thought you could tell the difference, you could give it to her when you pick her up, instead of at five, and you might actually be able to get away with giving her a little more and things might be a little easier without affecting sleep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think as the weather gets better too, then during that half hour, I can let her, you know, go outside and run around in the yard and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, that's a little bit easier, too than stay inside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.  Um, so [INAUDIBLE] four [INAUDIBLE] so we'll leave things, um, the way they are for now, you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think so.  I don't think there's anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's so drastic it needs to change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I could try this, you know, like you said, giving her, even giving her her afternoon medicine in the car, on the way home, before she gets there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, do you have like millions of those left?  Regular Focalin?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need another, you might need another script, I don't know.  Do you want me to give it to you just in case?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, I'll just, if I write for one a day, that's enough, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, 'cause we normally don't take it on the weekends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Risperdal, she's still doin' three, three and two?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it generic [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it's the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Soon, I think.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is it, oh, yay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Risperdal is going to come out like a generic, which means the patent ran out so the company that developed it can't be the only one, they have to let other companies make it too, so it's going to be a lot cheaper.  All right, um, all right.  [DATE], 5 mg.  Um, all right.  Um, [PATIENT NAME], do you have any questions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  Okay.  You want to give these to your mom?  There ya go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I do have one question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where did ya get this duck?  [INAUDIBLE] so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um,  I'm not sure.  I may have gotten it like in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Like, when I was visiting my sister once and someone was having a big yard sale.  All right.  Thanks.</p>

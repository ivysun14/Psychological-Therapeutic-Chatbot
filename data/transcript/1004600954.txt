<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, graduation was nice. My dad did come, so that was just really weird. I don't know if I told you this, but my friend from Chicago, I invited her. And so beforehand, I was sort of nervous about being able to spend time with everyone, and she was like "Okay, I won't see you until Sunday" and I was like "Okay." So it was a little bit awkward to have a friend there, literally all day with my family. Because usually, even growing up, my mom wouldn't even be in the same room with my friends. That was unusual for me.</p>

<p>[00:58.1]</p>

<p>Anyway, two of my friends were there for like my dad's five seconds at my graduation. And my friend Shauna, who is also a friend from college, she made this face like "That was really awkward." It was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His five seconds?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he showed up. So the first night he flew in, he came to the Square. We were having dinner, and he came to the Square. My brother was like "Well, we'll come to dinner too even though we're" — him and his wife — "aren't hungry." They were like "We're halfway through dinner. What do you want us to do?"</p>

<p>And so my brother got upset at me because he said "Oh you know, I told you we were going to pick up dad" and I was like "No, no you didn't." Like how was I supposed to know? But anyway, they showed up. It was really awkward because — so they had been touring the city all day, and I sort of took some time off to pick up my mom's (inaudible at 01:58.7). I'm sorry, this is getting very convoluted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>[02:02.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And apparently while me and my dad — like, we met after we had had dinner, so it was really awkward like "What do we do?" So we went to the Starbucks over here. But before we did that, he was just on the phone for like 40 minutes while we were all waiting for him to get off the phone. They — my brother and sister-in-law — mentioned that while they had been out touring the whole city, he hadn't been on the phone before. So now he's on the phone for 40 minutes. It was clearly really awkward, and I started to get really irritated because we're waiting for him and all he's doing is making calls. Like I haven't seen him — not that I wanted to see him much, but like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it didn't feel like you were being a priority. It's your own graduation weekend, and you didn't feel like he was giving it any attention.</p>

<p>[02:54.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, I also sort of felt sorry for him because I know how awkward that must have been for him. But still, it was even more awkward. It could have been less awkward if — and then we went into Starbucks. We all sat at a table and my dad sat in a corner with my younger brother. He kept looking at me like he was sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was there not room for him at the table?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, there was. And so we even moved to a larger table to make sure that it was closer to him and to make sure there was room for him. But he just — and I was like "What am I supposed to do?" My mom was like "Well, you should go talk to him." I was like "I'm being open and trying to be receptive to dad." So it was really awkward and clearly like a manipulation tactic, or at least that's what it felt like to me. I don't know. It was just really irritating. I mean, I wasn't furious. I was just like "Oh, here we go again."</p>

<p>[04:01.4]</p>

<p>And the same sort of thing happened at graduation the next day. He was waiting for me — he's really impatient. I honestly think if anyone has ADHD in the whole world, my dad definitely does. He can't sit for more than five minutes. So he was standing outside of a church waiting for us to come from morning exercises (inaudible at 04:30.9). Sorry. (chuckles) And so I stop in on the way in and was like "Hey, what's up?" (chuckles) We said hi for five minutes because I thought it would be rude to just ignore him. So I was sort of trying —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trying to acknowledge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I know that it wasn't really fair for him to be put in an awkward situation, you know what I mean? Well, he put himself in an awkward situation, but still. So I didn't want to be completely rude.</p>

<p>[05:01.5]</p>

<p>So I tried to say hi and then I was like "Okay, well, I'm going to say hi to them" because I had all this stuff in my sleeves that I use for storage. (chuckles) And so I did, and so then the whole ceremony happened. On the way out, he was standing very far away from us. I was trying to say hello to my adviser because she means so much to me and was such a big part of my experience here and — well, I'll tell you about that in a second.</p>

<p>I was trying to say goodbye to my friends that I wasn't going to be able to take pictures with later. I think everyone got really offended with that, but I was like "I'll have you guys for the rest of the day. We can take pictures in a prettier area at school." So my dad comes up to me and was like "Congratulations. I'm gonna go. Goodbye." My brother was like "Wait. Take a picture with her." And so he took this really awkward picture with me and he left. It wasn't as bad because he really wasn't there very much. But it was almost like he was trying to make it more awkward.</p>

<p>[06:15.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His choices exacerbated the tension that was already there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But it was almost on purpose, almost like "Pay attention to me." And I talked to my mom about it later and she was like "Well, he's used to being the center of attention so when he's not, it's difficult for him. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what his role is." And that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like how to not be the center of attention.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it was interesting because out of all of that super-extreme awkwardness, the most interesting part was when I talked to my mom about it that night. We were talking about my dad and how awkward it was, and she was like "Doesn't it make you sad? Don't you feel sorry for him?" I was like "Yeah, I definitely feel sorry for him, but not in the sense that I'm responsible for it." You know what I mean?</p>

<p>[07:10.1]</p>

<p>And I said something like "I'm his daughter, not his mom, so it's not my responsibility to be upset about it." She was like "You're right." (chuckles) And I said something along the lines of "It's so stressful for me to be worrying all the time about making other people happy. It's really draining. Not in a selfish way, but I need to also make sure that I'm doing well. Thinking about him and psychoanalyzing him every time I meet him is so stressful. I can't handle that." And my mom was like "Well, it took me 35 years to figure that out." (chuckles) So I felt really validated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's a sign of respect for your perspective and what you've come to from her that you haven't always known that she felt.</p>

<p>[08:05.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Especially — yeah, I know. It was good because I meant it. I wasn't just saying it. Whereas before, I could say "Oh, I don't really care."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I do care. But before, that's what I would do. I would be like "I don't care. You can do whatever you want" and I would be secretly seething or something. But I sort of meant it, in a dismissive like "I can't worry about this right now. It's not my place. I shouldn't have to worry about this." I went to the movies later and totally had a great time, even though I was exhausted, and wasn't really worried about it. And we didn't talk about it after that. So that was unusual. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was different than what you were worried about if he came. You were worried about it being really awkward, but you were also worrying about it having a very pervasive effect on the whole graduation weekend. It sounds like it was awkward in the moments, but it didn't taint the whole experience.</p>

<p>[09:10.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it was almost like a good thing because I got to talk to my mom about it. The reason I didn't want to talk to my mom about it was because I feel like every time I talk to her, she feels responsible for — I don't know "responsible" but she feels like she had such a great relationship with her dad that she always wanted that for me. So every time —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She feels badly that you missed out on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So every time I talk to her about it, she starts crying or something. I'm like "I can't talk to you about it if you're going to cry every time." But I feel like this time, I don't know, it was almost like she could tell that I meant it, and she was like "Good for you." It wasn't "I'm so sad that you do not have this relationship." It was more like "That's a good perspective on it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it wasn't about her. She was able to let it be about your experience.</p>

<p>[10:04.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it sounds like, in talking with her in the past, it becomes about her sadness and not being able to provide for you this relationship that she had with her dad. It's not about you anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I never thought about it that way, but yeah. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. So it was definitely — I don't know — new also. There's all this new stuff. (chuckles) We didn't fight as much as we normally do too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's good. Graduation is often a time for new beginnings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. Commencement, right. So yeah, that was nice. I guess the only awkward part is that my friend was with us the whole time. It was difficult because she doesn't know Spanish. I was trying to spend time with my family but also had to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your family is speaking Spanish?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So that was a little bit difficult, but I talked to her about it. I was like "Hey, sorry that I can't speak English to them. I just can't do it. But I promise we're not saying anything rude." She's like "I totally understand" so that was helpful too.</p>

<p>[11:13.0]</p>

<p>I guess the only other conflict we had was about the tickets because we only get two tickets, and my older brother wanted it to be my dad. He was like "It's my dad's place" or whatever. But, I mean, it was almost like this huge conflict for hours and hours. This was after he left from Starbucks or whatever. At one point, I was just so frustrated with it I was like "Look, my plan has been for months that it was you and mom. If you don't want it, then that's fine." So it was almost like this mini-explosion. But that's what ended up happening, I guess. I think they were just confused because I wasn't — I mean, in my head it was very clear what I wanted. Like abundantly clear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you hadn't told — if you would've shared that with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's what ended up happening, even though they had to leave because they didn't get very good seats. But still, even just — I don't know. That was kind of — better that — I don't know. It was just a different interaction, I think, than usual.</p>

<p>[12:25.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like — and I think you shared some of these experiences last time — it sounds like you're feeling more hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely true. But I also feel — maybe it's the way I'm saying things or something, but I also feel like that thing with my mom not being sad about it. I mean, I feel I can tell her. Maybe not everything in my life, but I feel I can tell her more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know that was a goal to be able to be a little bit more honest. Not honest, because it's not like you were being dishonest, but a little bit more open in sharing more of your life or more of your thoughts and feelings with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that was a really big part of it too. Because having a friend there for the whole weekend I was like "Oh my God, what if she's going to say something about my real life?" (laughter) It was really stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or even just exposing your friend, right? Because you said, in prior life, they would have been in totally separate rooms. But here they were in the same room, and here's your friend, an English-speaking friend hearing you speak Spanish, and you'd always kept your languages very separate.</p>

<p>[13:38.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that was still really awkward. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it appears that you survived.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I survived. But even, what I was going to say is, one of the things I really don't like to talk about with my family is gay marriage. For some reason, that just seems like a topic I just don't want to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can be a really sensitive issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well especially — so when I was younger, this was my freshman year — I'm not sure if I told you this before, so stop me if I have. But one of my friends from freshman year in college wrote me a birthday — because my birthday is right after graduations, so it's usually at home. So she sent me a birthday card and it said something like "Hey wifey" or something. Because we were best friends in college or whatever. And my mom automatically assumed that I was a lesbian and flipped out and told my dad and photocopied this card. It was just like this huge deal. I was like "It's just a birthday card."</p>

<p>[14:42.8]</p>

<p>And so ever since that I think, especially since I haven't had a lot of boyfriends, I think my dad thinks I'm secretly a lesbian or something. Which, I mean, I think that's fine but obviously that's not fine in my culture, my whole background or whatever. And so I think because — there was this full day of taking me secretly to this far-away psychiatrist in Mexico so that no one would know. Then that day I left for college, even though I was a week early.</p>

<p>It was just like I had to get out because they just dragged me around and yelled at me in the car or something. So it was this really dramatic experience, and I think because of that it has sort of become this thing I care about a lot. My dad didn't speak to me until he believed that I was not a lesbian. So I definitely sort of —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For someone who doesn't have — for someone who is a lesbian and their parents won't speak to them until they convince them otherwise, it's a pretty —</p>

<p>[15:39.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And especially because it seems like, at least on my dad's side, it wasn't unconditional love. It was very much conditional. So I guess all that stuff sort of becomes something that I care about a lot. I think I made a comment, I don't know what it was, in the car. My friend Susan said something about gay marriage and how it should be legal or something, and I had thought about it and I was comfortable saying that, and I was like "Wait, my mom is in the car. That's so weird that I just did that. I can't believe I just did that. But that's interesting. I still don't feel uncomfortable."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of noticing this comfort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like that was a big step in terms of what I felt I could share.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did your mom respond?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't say anything. (chuckles) But still, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She also didn't say anything against.</p>

<p>[16:35.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So that was definitely one of the bigger "Oh my gosh, did I just really say that?" sort of things. (chuckles) So, yeah, I don't know. It was just a strange weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you feel sitting in the ceremony?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) In the ceremony? Well, the morning exercises — since there's no one behind me or whatever, I was just me, I mean no family — I had goose bumps the whole time. I do religion and one of the things I studied in religion, like personally, the things that I'm interested in, is ritual and ritual efficacy and how you don't even have to walk in to a ceremony caring about it, but you will feel different afterwards. So when they were like "Stand up to receive your whatever" (laughter), it's so nerdy and really weird, but I had goose bumps and I was like "What ritual efficacy." (laughter) It was really crazy.</p>

<p>[17:43.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's beautiful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad it was meaningful for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I definitely love rituals. (chuckles) And it was weird to have my family there for the second ceremony, because this school is just so different from the rest of the University. We're just like "Let's talk about our feelings." (laughter) "Let's dance." And so we danced on the way in or something to this music. (laughter) It was just really awkward because I don't dance in front of my family. So it was like, "Hmmmm" and moving really awkwardly. (laughter) But even that felt like it was okay, sort of.</p>

<p>[18:29.0]</p>

<p>And the first thing we did was to stand up and thank our families behind us, and that was really nice as well. So it was a really nice ceremony. It was exhausting. I should not have worn heels. (chuckles) But it was good, I think. I mean, I didn't even see my dad the whole time. I was really worried about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You separated him from the experience, which is what you really wanted in the first place. You had your wish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I even sort of bought him a meal ticket for a luncheon that happened afterwards. It almost felt rude. (chuckles) It's like "Where are you going?" So I don't really know quite what to make of it, but I don't know. I also just don't want to invest the energy to figure it out. Is that bad? (laughter) I don't know. I guess not.</p>

<p>[19:40.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to judge your feelings or allow anyone else to judge whether they're bad or good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I felt that a little bit when my mom was like "You should go talk to him" and I was like "No, I shouldn't." (chuckles) I didn't hesitate and I didn't just sort of go talk to him and feel really awkward. Like that fight that we had in September, I think it was because my mom — I was on the phone with my dad and my mom was yelling at me on the other side like "Go out with him. Do it." I was like "Okay, okay, I'll meet you." And so it wasn't really my choice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's horrible.</p>

<p>[20:22.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so then that happened. And so, I don't know. It's definitely — I don't know. I feel like I can more and more say things without feeling terrible. Like even just today, I went to the dentist again. I left my lights on and my car died. (chuckles) And so I pushed it out, like I was driving, and I sort of stood there awkwardly waiting for someone to come and was like "Hey, can I have a jump?" I think usually that would have stressed me out a lot. I would've been like "Oh my gosh, this is a huge inconvenience. What am I doing?" Even just something small like that, I was like "Well, they don't have to say yes. They don't have to help me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can ask, yeah. And I even phrased it that way. I was like "Hey, I know you just paid your exit thing but I would like a jump if you are willing to give me one." So even just little things like that that would have usually really stressed me out, I think I'm feeling better about, which is weird.</p>

<p>[21:43.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not weird. It's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's weird to notice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 21:47.1) your feelings. It's weird. It's different and new which might be why it feels weird, because you're doing things and stretching yourself in a way that you weren't able to before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes it's having really good results.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, yeah. And even — Phil moved out this morning, and so I'm in the house alone. I've never slept alone before, so we'll see how that goes. But we've just been having a really great time together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's wonderful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So — I don't know. I guess therapy is working. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you are certainly working hard.</p>

<p>[22:38.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, the reason I say that is you've attempted a lot of conversations that you may not have attempted in the past. I would like to think that the therapy process is part of that, but it doesn't work by itself. I mean, you can come in here and talk a lot, but the fact that you're going out there in the real world and using some of what we talk about in here to spark different conversations is, I think, what is giving you the results that you're experiencing.</p>

<p>You're taking chances with your mom. The first time didn't work out so great when you went home for that vacation, that first time, and tried to talk to her about some new things and it was not a good experience for either one of you. But you tried again and the same thing was said. You tried to tell her what you were feeling, you tried to approach it, and it didn't work so great the first couple of times. But then somehow, with repeated efforts, you guys were able to reach an understanding, it sounds like, to kind of repair a relationship that got damaged.</p>

<p>[23:44.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I didn't know was possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are working really hard. Yeah, just that, just what you said. You didn't know it was possible, but you tried it anyway. That's a different kind of hard work than writing papers or running a mile. But it is hard work to take chances and express yourself and open yourself up in ways you were not able to do in the past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I did have one question. I know that — you asked me this maybe the first or second session that we met. You said something along the lines of like — I mean, I don't remember exactly what you said, but I remember it was in religion terms, so like subjective and objective realities. Like is there an objective truth or a way that things should be that's outside of an individual.</p>

<p>[24:48.0]</p>

<p>You asked me that with regards to my mom, and I feel like that gave me a lot like "Oh, that's interesting." I think it has definitely made it easier for me to understand where she's coming from. And of course, understanding that I'm not going to, nor do I want to, change the way that she thinks. Do you think there's a way to like — because I'm definitely way the opposite, like very much subjective. Do you think there's ways in which those two types of, I guess, views clash?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A view that there is an objective truth and the view that there's maybe not one?</p>

<p>[25:36.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One of the minor arguments we got into was this kid walked across us while we waiting in line for (inaudible at 25:44.2) or something. He was wearing really baggy shorts and his boxers were showing. She was like "That's ridiculous" and I was like "Well, whatever. If he wants to wear his clothes like that, then whatever." And she was basically eventually like "It is objectively wrong to wear your shorts like that. It's not a fashion thing. It's just never right to do that." And it turned into this right or wrong sort of thing. I was like "It's a fashion thing and I don't really care that much." But I definitely see that as being the root of a lot of our arguments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she has a view of the world where there are very strict rules.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I usually — well, not usually — but sometimes I don't follow those because I don't think those are the rules for me. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[26:35.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the fact that you think there are rules for you and a different set of rules maybe for someone else, is different than what she would think because she's got a very strict set that she goes by.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. I mean, obviously I think that part of being a subjectivist, whatever you would call that, is that I think that's a totally valid way of viewing things. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's hard when you come up against that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Do you think that causes more clashes than any other sort of difference? Because I sort of feel like it might.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's such a basic way of viewing the world, so it's not that you're having a disagreement about one particular thing. You guys disagree about the way in which you relate to the world, and that leaves a million and one opportunities to disagree about things.</p>

<p>[27:39.7]</p>

<p>So that's tricky. I think from your perspective, you want to be able to have enjoyable times with your mom. So you're not going to convince her of your view, and she's not going to convince you of hers. And so I think for the health of the relationship, finding a way to sort of stay away from that discussion actually behooves the relationship. Because the point of the relationship is not for you guys to agree on whether there's one sort of objective reality or a more constructed reality. The point is for you guys to love one another and be able to enjoy time together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess I'm thinking about it like — obviously who cares if some dude is wearing shorts and exposing his boxers to the world or whatever. But I guess when it turns into something that's important — like for example, one of the other things that I was sharing with my mom that I would've never said before was when she asked me where so-and-so was and I was like "Well, he's staying over at his girlfriend's."</p>

<p>[28:46.5]</p>

<p>It was like pause before the explosion. (laughter) But I feel like big life events like that might stir some of that up. Like if I ever wanted to — I know I'm thinking ahead, but I'm also thinking behind. So if I want to do something that's maybe not traditional or within her norms, I guess I was just sort of thinking how to negotiate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that's where it becomes important to the relationship. So something like if you want to live with a partner before you get married. This is not going to fit in with mom's set of rules about what is right to do. And so rather than fight about whether it's right or wrong to live with someone before you get married, it's "This is something I'm doing" — because you get to make a choice for yourself — "and I ask you to respect my choice."</p>

<p>She doesn't have to agree with your choice. She might not. She might come to have some changes based on — because that's one thing that pushes people to change their views, when someone they really love does something different than they expect, that can sometimes push someone to re-examine their views.</p>

<p>[30:01.3]</p>

<p>But I think if there are choices you are going to make that you anticipate are going to be difficult for mom to accept, the language around that that's often helpful is "can you respect?" She doesn't have to agree. You may not get her to agree with your choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like the graduation thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. She respected that you didn't want your dad there, but she disagreed with it. I think that's a place — I think that's where the language "tolerance" comes out. We should all tolerate people who do things differently than someone else might do. In some ways, I react against the word "tolerance" because to tolerate something, like you tolerate the nails on the chalkboard, right? But it is a step above judging, at least. So I think being respectful of someone who makes a different choice might be a place you can get to with your mom.</p>

<p>[30:59.2]</p>

<p>She might not agree that it's an okay thing to have your underwear showing above your pants. There are apparently a lot of people of her generation who agree with her. But she can still respect the person, even though they might make a different choice than she would make. And the same thing for you. If you make a choice that she disagrees with, you can ask her to be respectful of your choice, while you respect that she doesn't think it's the right one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. That's interesting, yeah. I think it's usually when I was little, growing up, every argument would end with "You should be a lawyer." (laughter) Because, I mean, I think I would always focus on the — because if I could convince her of that basic sort of belief —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you would shift her view of a lot of things.</p>

<p>[31:54.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. But obviously, I'm not 13 and I'm not really interested in doing that. But I think that's sort of where it's almost like natural where I've always sort of focused my attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's one strategy. I think the debating lawyers do is one strategy to get someone to see something in a different way. But I think as you get older, your goal with your mom is not getting her to see something the way you see it. I think your goal has changed to be able to be close to your mom. That's where the lawyer's perspective doesn't really work, because the opposing side doesn't get people to be closer to them. They get them to agree, and that's not necessarily the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They win, they don't come together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And the other side feels badly because they lost. They make it a win/lose thing.</p>

<p>[32:56.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't want — that doesn't foster the relationship you're looking for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Okay. That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a quick check of time to make sure we have — I dislike not being able to do it unobtrusively.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No, that's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's 4:06, just so you are also aware that we have about 15 minutes left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I guess the other thing that's totally unrelated and has been weighing on my mind, probably because of commencement, sort of career/future stuff. (chuckles) And, I don't know, I was hoping we could talk about it a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know, I guess update —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, update me on where you are now, and we can talk about where you want to go.</p>

<p>[33:51.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Medicine, pre-med, starting this fall to sort of pursue medicine, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like what you'd be doing if you embark on that plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. But I've sort of been like, I've been reading a lot of stuff about — but no matter what, I want to make an informed decision. I've sort of thought back on my past work experiences and have reached some pretty cool conclusions. Like I was a waitress in two different places, and I was like "Why did I quit after three months?" (chuckles) And I reasoned it was after I stopped learning everything. Once I knew everything, like where everything was, what I had to do, where things were, I quit. And so I sort of learned that it's important to keep learning, which is why I've had this job since November. I work in an rehab center.</p>

<p>[34:55.7]</p>

<p>Because every day, there's something new I learn. So that seems to be important to me. I'm also worried that — I mean, I knew I wanted to do religion like forever. My third week into religion classes — not that I'm whimsical or anything. I don't think that. But I'm just worried that I'm not doing religion because I don't feel like I'm capable of it or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the pull towards medicine?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the reason why I felt I was interested in religion is because I'm interested in people and I like to — I was interested in religion because people do the craziest things for religion. Like people even die for it. How much closer could you get to a person than understanding that motivation, right?</p>

<p>[36:00.9]</p>

<p>The thing is, that happens in the library alone. (laughter) So the idea of it is really cool, but the practical day-to-day life of it is in isolation. That's not exactly —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't feel really good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think that understanding the body is also really important to understanding a person and knowing their spirituality. Just because, I don't know, I see healing and spirituality to be really related. I mean, they used to be the same thing just a couple of centuries back, right? So for me, they sort of fit in this weird awkward way. They fit naturally but not in the real world. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. In our current day, they are often separated but if you look at the history of medicine and healing and shamanism, it's always been very interrelated.</p>

<p>[36:54.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And not that I want to be a shaman or anything (laughter), but I do — I don't know. I took a course at the medical school. I mean, even just growing up, like when I go home even in college and I was at the height of my "I love religion," my mom and I flipped through anatomy textbooks and I'm like "Oh, that's cool" or "Oh, that's nice." And that's always just what our conversations are about.</p>

<p>I had this incident where I blew my nose and a bubble came out of my eye and I freaked out, because I had a cold. I freaked out and called my mom — this was in college — and I'm like "Mom, this just happened. What do I do? Do I have to go to the hospital?" I was freaking out. And my mom started laughing like hardcore. She was like "I can't believe you're like" — what was it — "21 or 22 and still learning about your body. Like those things are connected, everything in there." So that's sort of the way that we've had conversations. So it seems sort of really natural because — I don't know. That's just sort of how I am interested in it. I'd like to learn more about things like that.</p>

<p>[37:59.8]</p>

<p>But I guess I'm worried about leaving this really important part of myself behind as well. I don't want to leave it behind. I think they do go together, maybe just not practically. It might just have to be a little more forced or something. And my advisor at divinity school, who I spoke to about this, I said "I don't want to stop doing religion as a doctor, but I also don't want to epically fail as a doctor because I'm trying to fit all this other stuff in." She was like "No, I think you would have to stop." I'm sort of trying to figure out how they fit. I'm also stressed out because it's such an important part of who I have come to understand myself to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what way — how could you keep it alive? In what way do you need the religious piece to be a part of your life?</p>

<p>[38:52.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for me I think the study of religion is a religious endeavor. I don't know if that makes any sense. Like constantly learning new things — I'm a comparativist, so I did comparative studies like learning new things about different traditions. I don't mean just fun facts, I mean really learning and reading serious texts and stuff. That's really important to me if it's applicable to real life. Like I don't care about — like in Hinduism, I don't really care about the Rig Veda that was written 8,000 years ago because no one really does that anymore. (chuckles) I don't know if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I could see sort of, maybe not during the med school part very much, but if I envision into the future, it sounds like one way to intertwine these two things would be to go and practice in an area of the world where you would be exposed to a new culture and a new religion and be immersed in that. That would be a wonderful way to kind of bring the skills of medicine to a group of people, and then you could be learning about a new culture and a new religion at the same time.</p>

<p>[40:10.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think that sounds crazy, though, to like have these two interests? Because I ask people, even my friends from college, I asked them when I was still sort of testing the waters, like "What if I became a doctor? Like ha ha, what do you think?" (chuckles) And they were like "Oh my God, that's the worst idea of all time. Do not become a doctor." I was like "What?" (laughter) But maybe it sounds —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds ambitious, because I think that both things — I think medical school is rigorous and the life of a doctor is busy. But people are passionate about lots of things, and that's how you keep your life rich and fulfilling. I don't think you should not pursue something that you're interested in just because it might be difficult. So I don't think it's going to be easy, but I think — one of the things that I love about my job is that I get exposed to people and get to learn about other lives, and people do so many different cool and interesting things.</p>

<p>[41:15.1]</p>

<p>So just in thinking about some of the people whom I've had contact with, you know, as you're talking about this, a woman who worked for Doctors Without Borders comes to mind. Because that seems like that was a way for her to incorporate a love she had for helping people and traveling with her medical skills. And it was a way for her to travel and be a doctor and be able to help people in a very hands-on visible way that she wasn't able to do in either setting in which she practiced.</p>

<p>Would the same exact thing work for you? Maybe not, but something similar might allow you to be exposed to something that you're really interested in and passionate about and use skills that you'll be learning along the way. And people combine their interests. It takes some creativity. It probably takes work. But that doesn't mean it's crazy or not doable.</p>

<p>[42:15.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I feel so much better just even saying that out loud. It's been going around in my head for months and months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the power of saying stuff out loud.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, thank you for sharing it with me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you for listening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very welcome. We should probably take a moment to schedule if we haven't done that already. I have no idea what's going on in June.</p>

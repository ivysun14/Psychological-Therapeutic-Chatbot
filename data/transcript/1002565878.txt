<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, when did you find that, uh, you had problems concentrating?  It was in say, 7th grade, or 6th grade, or 8th grade, or you don't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably more in high school, like, I don't know, more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, when, when your grades started kind of slipping down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, definitely 7th grade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seventh grade?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not any better in high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not at all.  I would do fine like the first semester, but after that, it didn't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some classes were fine, like physical education ones, I did great in those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't know.  Like, English, you know, math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Compared to your, uh, brother and sister, who does well in the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about your brother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He does good now.  He's doing great now, actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He had problems before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He graduated.  Yeah, he had problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.  What kind of problems he has?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The same, pretty much.  He got put on medication, I think, in maybe 8th grade or 7th.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  What medicine he took, you know, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Adderall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ritalin and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He had Adderall</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ritalin, Adderall</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  What about you, did you ever try those medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did I or he?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have.  Yeah, I took his medications before and it helped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It did help, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I would take it to study or for a class, you know, exams, I would just zip right through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So just, uh, before the exams, you used to take.  It is able to improve your concentration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  It did a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  What'd you take, Adderall or Ritalin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it was Adderall.  He, he was on Ritalin when he first started off, and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one you like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't, I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just worked, like I could concentrate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just took those medicines one time, not regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So when you take them, it did help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  So you still have problems with focusing, attention span and not able to, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] over time.  You know.  Is it because, not because you have not been tested, because you cannot concentrate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.  Any other problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is, uh, reading is a problem for you, or, uh, you have trouble with spellings or maths or when you're [INAUDIBLE], which one is better for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I was a great speller, I was horrible in math.  Horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't even get in, I didn't even get to algebra.  I had to quit algebra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Algebra is tough on anybody, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was horrible at it.  Like I'm dreading taking college, college classes for math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do you have to take math class in college, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  For my major, I need to get into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what do you think about major?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Physical therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Physical therapy, huh?  Hey, that's a good bunch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only you need to know more maths, then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know. [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING]   Or go into some other things like aesthetic [INAUDIBLE] or something you don't need to know math.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, physical therapy, you need to know math and the [INAUDIBLE] of things, muscles and movements and things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Math and biology are big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anatomy.  You need to know all the anatomy, all the parts of the body, muscles in your body and what they do and other stuff and how to stand and bend.  That is physical therapy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of demand, though, for physical therapy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I plan on getting into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Jobs are in demand for physical therapy and [INAUDIBLE] and interconnected with science, there is a lot of demand.  Of course, RNs or [INAUDIBLE] and LPNs there is demand, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what is happening with [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.  I was told they would be buying the new company or the new company is supposed to be buying the facility and keep pushing back the date.  Nothing really major.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then, they push back the date and not tell you when they purchase, and when finally they come, they are going to make some changes, or you don't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's coming eventually.  Just got to kind of wait it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Eventually it's happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nobody knows when.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.  You have any physical problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.  I've been working out, I'm in great shape.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Look nice.  Can go into modeling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Make more money [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, who knows, maybe to Hollywood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wish.  [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they're not any greater than you are, most of the people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're working full time and going to college, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's kind of hard, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Harder than I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.  So you live by yourself now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I moved out.  I have a roommate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In an apartment, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You [INAUDIBLE]   How to clean and cook, and, huh, huh?  You don't have time to enjoy then.  Either working or going to school or cleaning the dishes or what else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's more of people with more independence of time to do this and that, but you don't have time now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're better off staying home, getting done for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be great down the road.  I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get paid more money and you don't need to do anything, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But things are different, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a lot different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does your roommate do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she's a server/bartender at Red Lobster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  Lobster's a good place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's getting more money than you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they get a hundred bucks, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She makes good money, definitely, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, ninety, a hundred bucks a day, tax free.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or even more, $200 sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  She makes good tips bartending, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Lobster is a busy place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you work there before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did not work in restaurants or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How come?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I had my job at [DEIDENTIFIED], [INAUDIBLE] there, and then after that, I got on at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think you got, mama got you a job right away, so that's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 2 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, um, there are, um, you know, what you call, attention deficit, sometimes it runs in the families and you said your brother has it, and I don't know, you may have it, too.  That, if the medicine helped you to concentrate, that means you have it for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I really think it did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, some of the medicines they used to take like Ritalin and, uh, Adderall, and Focalin, they're, uh, they're all the kind of different companies made them, you know, longer and shorter acting and all that.  They all have the same problems, though, they sometimes make you hyper and sometimes make your appetite poor, and, uh, if you take long time, they have a problem with habit forming.  You have problems with drugs or drinking before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Used to?  You used to drink?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I drink a little, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A couple of time, you did—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I drink occasionally, but I've never been into drugs and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened, when you have a car accident?  You were drinking that time or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What one other time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Car accident?  No.  There was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, your brother is the one, in a car was drinking and driving or something?  Something, I don't know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mother told me something about, now and then she talks about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little accident when, um, I was 16, just got my license and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, with your driving, you cannot wait when the red light is, you get upset or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or you driving fast like any other teenagers?  Yeah, we all do the same thing, though, like teenagers want to drive fast, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, so okay, then at least, you're doing okay now, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm getting along.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well there are two things that we can tell you.  That is a new medicine came and it is called Strattera.  It is, they use it for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what he takes right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Strattera.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's a good medicine, but it is not, it doesn't work as fast as Ritalin or Adderall, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why mom said he had to take it for a while and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but it has, uh, less side effects in the long run.  Want to try that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.  Yeah.  Less side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does make you a little tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just want to tell what it does.  Little make you more energy.  This one you take at night, but in the beginning, it will make you a little tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that'll go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'll go away after a couple—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I am just telling some people when they used to take Ritalin, they were not like this when it started.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you like going to a nice dressy restaurant or go to some other restaurant, you may not feel good when you go inside. [LAUGHING]  All right, you will find the lobster, the Red Lobster, you go there, there a lot of people tramping in there, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You go to some, you know, restaurant nice, you have a nice place to sit and relax, or to, some people like that way, and some people don't like too many people, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this medicine work a little slowly.  It does, in the beginning, you feel you're, uh, you're a little tired, you know, and then, well, it is supposed to help you, you know, to concentrate better in the long run, and also it has less side effects.  And you don't gain weight or anything, and it doesn't have problems with you know, habits [INAUDIBLE], you know.  Sometimes when people take Ritalin, they want more and more—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because it does give a buzz—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And feel good about. [LAUGHING]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why don't you try the, um, the Strattera, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How long will it take before it starts to kick in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At least a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We will start, it comes in 2 doses, 40 and 60.  We'll try 40 and see how we do a couple of weeks, and if you don't have any problems [INAUDIBLE] or you do not get better, we can increase the dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's all.  I guess—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go on, making money, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you're, uh, what [INAUDIBLE] does pay your prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It takes time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It takes a little more wisdom.  Hm?  All right?</p>

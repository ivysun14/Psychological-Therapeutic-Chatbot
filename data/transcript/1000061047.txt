<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115, Interview number 18.</p>

<p>So, what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Lot of energy. Just I've never seen anyone so busy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As me? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's been a long time. Let me put it that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been a long time since you've seen anyone as busy as I am?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Do you feel that's true usually or just today I seem very hassled? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just today. I mean, today you remind me of what my work situation has been all day long. It just kinda surprised me that somebody else could be in that harried a state. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. I get that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh God. I came home from work today. And they've been putting more and more work on me daily. And they took away the guy that worked with me. And he and I had enough to do to start with. So they took him away and then tripled the workload. </p>

<p>And I'm just going nuts in there. They've got 16 inspections coming up and all this bullshit and I came home today just kinda beefed off at the whole damn situation. It's just been kinda a rotten trip the last month. Josh just started his today, his job today. His first day on the job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he got hired as a stocker same as I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He works down in the loop. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah? </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you know he doesn't, he's got three miles to go instead of 24. And he can do it on public transportation so he doesn't have to depend on somebody else. So he comes home and I ask him what he did at his day of work. And he says there's about 20 other freaks there so he played softball and blew dope all day long. That's all he did all day long. Oh God Almighty. 0:02:06.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you got stuck with the (inaudible at 0:02:08.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I brought him up here so he could get a job and got shoved right out of it myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just saw you tear that open and just the way you had it in your hand there it looked like a piece of bubble gum. And I was going, "What in the hell is she doing with bubble gum?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Well, I have had it in here. It seems like I must be acting sort of whacky today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How's that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How's that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seems to me I've done about three things that startled you or seemed funny since you came in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not making excuses, I'm just [making up stuff.] (ph) You look down. Are you feeling down? 0:04:44.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm? No, no it's just... I'll be leaving for Boise this Thursday and I'm just trying to figure out what all's going to be going on. It's the kinda the conclusion I was coming to is I really don't know. It's one of the first times I've gone down there with nothing really planned in a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Oh you mean what's going on in terms of who you'll see and..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What I'm supposed to be doing when. I'll be leaving Thursday night and I don't know where I'll stay when I get there. I don't know what I'll do when I get there. All I know is that Friday afternoon for about an hour and a half I have to go talk to some attorneys and then I have the rest of the time to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Does that what, does that worry you or? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it worry you or make you like feel sad because you don't know where you're going? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. It's just, it's just I don't know what to expect of it. There's probably only about four people left in Wichita that I really bother to look up because I want to see them a lot. I run into a lot of other people frequently but whether I see them or not is just kinda the odds of how things happen.</p>

<p>Carmen is one of them. She's in Florida now. Another one would be Stevie and his girlfriend Julie. And Stevie will be here. He's coming up to go to a concert with Josh this weekend. And his chick, I don't know her, Maria. So Jes will be about the only person there. And it just seems that we're almost guaranteed to be able to just sit and talk for a change. Because there's practically no way we'll get interrupted. But I don't even know how we will manage that unless we just walk off somewhere. 0:06:31.9</p>

<p>God damn! When I start chewing on my mustache I know it's getting too long. It drives me crazy. </p>

<p>Hmm. My mind keeps going a million miles a second but all that seems to come to mind are just that I've got to do. 0:12:55.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any pressure in there? Is it that kind of thing? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's just that it seems like there are many things to do and they're all laid out there. And I'm just kinda clicking off how they'll happen. Which is how I happened to mention it. It didn't strike me as having any emotion connected with it. Pressured or whether I liked what was happening or anything else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just, just kinda reviewing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. The last few days I've had a little foreboding about going back into court again. But for the main part I'm just disgusted with the whole thing. That I just really don't even much give a damn about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if you're required for you to go, are you going this time simply for a conference with the attorneys or does it require going into court?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, not into court. It's for a deposition. I have to go and give a deposition to the opposing attorneys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is the thing that just pissed me off royally about the whole thing. Because the court has decided that I should use my money to go back to Boise to give the opposing attorneys a deposition. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just can't afford it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Can't. (chuckles) I guess I will but I can't and be reasonable about my budget for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's another, it's another insult to injury type thing. This whole God damn thing is not your idea and they have to make you pay to go to do something that is not only inconvenient but..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Detrimental.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Detrimental.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's galling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that and not having a place to stay. I'll probably end up in a motel and it's going to be that much more expensive. It's strange. I know there's several places I could stay. Would I go over there knowing that I don't have a place. But I don't like to. I don't like to go to people's house for a meal. Or to spend the night there or something like that. It puts me uptight. I always feel like I'm out of place. 0:15:27.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if they welcome you or invite you or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Unless it's either someone my age or someone that I'm very close to and around an awful lot. I get really uptight about it. It's usually not a matter of politeness or anything like that. I can pull off that kind of a bluff as well as anybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just don't like the feeling of it usually. The only two places that I can think of where one I always felt it was ok to go eat is with Kelly's parents. And one time when she and I were having a lot of trouble her father took (inaudible at 0:16:51.0) and I don't know why, what if she told him or what but it was all my fault. And I became very unwelcome around there for a while and I never, even though they again accepted me as a good friend later on I never felt really at ease around there. </p>

<p>And I used to go back to Boise and just go over to Stevie's and crash. Since my first summer out of high school I've spent almost as many nights there as I have home. Even while I was living at home, three times out of the week I wouldn't make it home. I would end up wiped out over there. 0:17:28.5</p>

<p>But one time I came in from New York and just went over there and threw my suitcase down and said hi to everybody and said, "I've got to run. I'll see y'all later." Later that night I happened to see Steve and he made comment to the effect of, "We dig you coming and all but you ought to give us a few days notice." </p>

<p>And I had once before been told that it was ok to stay there. I was going to stay there for a week before I went into the army because I didn't want to pay another month's rent on the apartment I was staying in. And Anne said it was ok. So I tripped on over there. And the day after I hauled all my stuff over there an old boyfriend of hers showed up. She's divorced. And started living there with her. So she didn't mind. The scene like that had been going on for ten or twelve years and she didn't mind that Stevie was there, her son. But it embarrassed her that I was there. So she asked Stevie to ask me to leave. </p>

<p>That was about a year and a half ago. No, a year and a couple of months ago. But even that had been pretty well patched up until this thing came up about last spring where they kinda dropped a subtle hint. And I haven't stayed there. I've been asked to stay there a couple of time and I didn't. I usually don't even go over. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure Norman, Are you connecting up this business with that girl's family and Stevie ..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's kinda </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why you feel uptight? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's the few situations where I have eventually felt at ease have ended up on kinda a bad note.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both times at one point or another and I always just feel whole lot more secure in my own hospitality than someone else's. I love to have people over. 0:19:24.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I have an apartment why then there's always people there doing something or another. But...</p>

<p>I went out to the airport Sunday. A friend of mine's brother and sister in law were in town and we took them out to the airport. And I noticed then that just being out there kinda gave me the, getting on down the road itch. All week long I've been trying to convince myself to take Thursday and Friday off instead of just taking Friday off. But, then though it bums me out so much to have to take this trip now. As much as I know I'd like to go to Boise I had not planned on going for another month and a half or so. And then I'd hoped to take about four days off and go down. Down the road. This will probably shoot that off until somewhere in late July or so. 0:22:28.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the whole thing just sounds like a giant interruption and something that you just have not choice about doing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Well, it's kinda paradoxical for a change also that I'm not wanting to go to Boise and I'm wanting to stay at work and stay at it for a while longer. I can seldom I manage that much willpower, it's kinda shame to see it shot down. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>I need to check back on something. Why does that feel like a, feel so disruptive to miss a day at work? 0:25:00.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so expensive. I'm not worried about my work record or that kind of b.s.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because on a Patronage job it's, everybody knows why you've got the job anyway. So that's no bother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But 40 dollars a day is a bunch of money to lose. There is a chance, I don't know whether I've said that already, that the insurance company will pay for part of my trip down. That's, that's a soothing of my wallet but not of my ego. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's still the court's decision and it happens to be my luck to have someone to take care of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I'm wondering if it in some way brings back that feeling, I don't know whether you've said it this way, but that sort of feeling of being at someone else's mercy just kinda totally..</p>

<p>PATIENT: In ways but I don't feel nearly as hopeless. Or it doesn't, or maybe that isn't it. It's just that I don't feel like there's nearly so much danger. This whole thing has just turned into a really phony farce to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They, they're, they were ready to settle out of court for 15 so I know damn good and well the insurance company isn't going to let them get more than that at the very most in court. And the only thing I'm there for is to be pointed at and grilled and.. 0:27:07.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's more like a psychological function or some sort of scapegoating thing going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's, it's just my part is a role and I'll just play it and think how stupid it is and leave. It just isn't even really real to me any more. It's their game and I just don't have anything to do with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No way it's like better to keep at that kind of, or have that kind of perspective on it, see it sort of as an awful absurdity rather than letting it take you over and really mess you up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm, yeah. Well I don't know. It's not a feeling that I've, that I've nurtured or that I've tried to create for a defense like that. It's just that after having the first one upset me so much and then finding out what a farce it was when it was all over that I realized then the danger wasn't nearly what I thought it was and the danger that I was realizing then I didn't have any reason to fear that much. So I know that this really means even that much less to me. This one's almost entirely meaningless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I didn't mean that it's necessarily defensive but I, you know..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes, like if I was involved in something like that it might, it would be very hard for me to get it at a distance I think. You know even the part of it that was realistically sort of absurd. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I meant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, actually it's kinda like I know that in this one it's the insurance company's fight and it's not my hide that's getting attacked. 0:28:58.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's pretty much a certainty? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like they're suing for 36,000 and that's simply because, well it's 35,600. And 35 is the legal limit of the law. So it's just standard matter of procedure that that's what you sue for in that kind of a situation.</p>

<p>God that's terrible man. To tack a price tag on a kid like that. Jesus. Ooh. That's the other absurdity of this whole thing that I just cannot fathom. I've looked at it and run into it and gotten hit over the head with it and it just doesn't make any sense at all. So I've just given up on it. </p>

<p>I remember when that accident happened. I was wondering just how it would affect me. Not, not everything else. Just the accident itself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was very surprised that it was about the middle of January. In fact it was almost right around a year, within a few weeks I think, after the accident was the first time I ever had any kind of a nightmare or whatever about it. And I remember looking when I woke up the next morning and remembered the dream it kinda surprised me. 0:30:57.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was this, just this past January?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that really wasn't a nightmare per se. I just remember the accident happened. And I remembered getting up and running out of the car and like I was, you know everything was just crystal clear and things happening in precision order. That's kinda the way it happened at the time. It was a long time later before I got scared or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you expected to have been much more affected by it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I expected it to have a much more maybe obvious effect would be what it would be. No doubt it's had its effects that I'm not as aware of or that aren't as plain to see the course of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What that makes me wonder about is are you, are you wondering if somewhere deep down inside there's this kinda seed of a reaction buried that's going to cause you trouble some day. Are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No I don't expect it. No what it is, is I, the effects that I expected it to have would be much like I wouldn't drive or I would drive considerably different. 0:33:13.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or things like that. And like I've changed driving habits a little. But it's hard to correlate those to the accident itself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's many things that could have caused them. But like I don't have nightmares about it and it doesn't upset me constantly. I remember right after the accident I was almost upset with myself that I didn't feel extremely remorseful. Like I felt, it was a feeling that I was very, very sad that it happened only I didn't feel, I didn't feel sorry for my part in it. You know that's the best way to say it. And I don't know I've just been that way kinda ever since. I never have really felt like the damn thing was my fault. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it bothered me at first. And I was awfully happy about it later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it almost at first like there should be some sort of obligatory type reaction like mourning or guilt or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't, I wasn't really realizing quite what it was that was missing in me. I knew I was feeling wrong from what I was supposed to. And then I realized that there were other things that were more on my mind than that accident at the time. </p>

<p>It was the night of the accident that a girlfriend I had broken up with quite a few months before. It was Kelly, after I had gone with her for four or five years, had on the way home from the police station informed me that she was pregnant by her new boyfriend and that she wanted me to help her out. And like for days that was, that was more on my mind than was the accident. Until we got the whole thing cleared up. </p>

<p>I guess it fits. It was something I could do something about it. I hate to just sit and do nothing but think about something which is all I could have done with the accident I'm sure. 0:35:32.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. So in a way you're saying, "Well that was really sort of a constructive thing for me to do even though I didn't know I was doing it that way."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I've got, I got very concerned about something that had a, had a future to it and something I could obtain."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was real surprised that I, that I did try to help her out. In the manner that we broke up I've always been surprised that there weren't some very harsh feelings for her, but you know I've always just been either mildly curious or been in love with her every since. </p>

<p>My stomach growling so hard it's jiggling my (inaudible at 0:37:38.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like a chocolate Easter egg? (chuckles) That's all I can offer in the nourishment department. 0:37:47.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no I've got a, I'll be at home, I get home just in time for dinner. Perfect timing. I don't know I've lost, I was real happy about well, once I got over New Year's I lost an awful lot of weight there for a while. I was too stoned to eat for a week after New Years. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I've managed since about last November to keep my weight up to about 140. I've all my life been about 15 pounds under weight it seems like. And I got up to around 140, maintained it for a while and then the week that Carmen got up here and since I dropped back down to about 118. I've been weighing about 120, 122 pounds since then.</p>

<p>I didn't, I haven't been starving. It's just that I'll eat one meal a day and be full. Or not be hungry until shortly before the next one. Actually I feel better at this weight except that I know I should, I don't know why I should weigh more. It's just that it's, I've always been of the mind that I should weigh more. So even though I feel better at 120, I'll always try to weigh 140. </p>

<p>What a rap.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What a rap. How did I get into that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure. 0:39:28.3</p>

<p>Were you about to say something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You looked quizzically.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I was just looking at you. It's so seldom that you see me looking at you that you thought I must be ready to say something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Are you aware that you usually don't? Or do you think you usually don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't usually what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't usually look at me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah I'm sure I don't usually look at you. I mean our gaze seldom meets like that. Strange. It reminds me of the game that I often play.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just walking down the street and look at someone and it really unnerves them. There seems to be an unwritten taboo of two people looking directly into each other's eyes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's one of the things you know that they, that people do in encounter groups and sensitivity training and I always have trouble with it. I have no idea why. It seems to me you could train yourself to do it even if you, even if it made you uncomfortable or you weren't.. 0:41:31.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: To look at someone? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just look them straight in the eye. And I cannot do it. I just cannot do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I used to do that. I never understood why I couldn't. I mean I don't remember ever learning that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But looking someone, looking directly at them used to very much unnerve me. And I practice it in school. Because I found that if I could stare someone down, if I could do it consistently it put a different situation where it was almost it was their humblence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And being small I found that the best advantage I have was either bluff or fake somebody out. And I'd make a point of just staring down everybody that I could constantly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a real dominance thing a man will [grow apparently] (ph) Staring at, staring is a very aggressive kind of thing. If you, there's some psychologist that's going, or ethologist who like goes into the zoos and stares at the baboons and gets them just enraged because apparently it's a very, very aggressive thing to do. And I've noticed, I've tried it with my dog and he because he's submissive he can't do it. He'll turn his head away and make some sort of little wiggly move like, "I'm little your little doggy."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just about to say I've never known an animal except a cat that will consistently stare you down. And a cat, it they'll look away maybe sometimes because they aren't interested. But if they ever seem to really get into it, you just cannot stare them down. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's not always a flashy kind of dominance thing. Sometimes it just seems like such as, like such a straight connection between your heads that, like I can remember times when all I had to do if someone and mine's eyes met we would break out in laughter.</p>

<p>I remember one night looking at Josh. He's such a strange looking creature anyway. And he and I were both pretty stoned I guess. And he was just looking back and forth around the room. And I was watching his neck muscles move and his face muscles. I was just watching him. Completely objective even that he was alive you know. </p>

<p>And he turned around and right up until, no doubt he could see my face but our eyes hadn't met. Up until that point it was completely objective but the second that our eyes met it just flashed on me so hard that there he was and that he was alive and I realized who he was and everything else but it really blew me apart. I just kinda fell back and looked around for a minute trying to figure out what had... but I don't know why it is the eyes that get that feeling. </p>

<p>I found our recently that the ears actually have a dominance over the eyes. If you should see something and hear it a phase off, your mind will change what you see to fit what you hear instead of vice versa. 0:44:31.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be true for everybody, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: According to the test that three of my friends were working on, that's what came out to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a habit I just, I haven't even tried to break for years. I noticed I've developed more of them lately. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Habits. Word habits is something that I've always fought to avoid. But I got into cracking my knuckles many years ago and just it never seemed like a habit for a long time. Because when I was younger I used to stretch them out and just really gross everybody out by popping my knuckles. But it is a habit any more.</p>

<p>But I noticed about a year ago that I picked up a little thing of rubbing my fingers around my fingernails. And I also have a strange way of flipping my tongue around behind my teeth. When I get nervous or very active or when I'm really stoned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does developing habits have some meaning for you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was always a sign of my neurotic impulses or something to just do this subconsciously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mean deviant. It's just, it's tension. It always strikes me as a way of relieving a tension. </p>

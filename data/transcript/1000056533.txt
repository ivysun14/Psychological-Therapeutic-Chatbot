<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 1927-1112, Client 1927-1112, Side 1, Track 2, Interview Number 7, Interview Number 7.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like I don't know where to begin. Why don't I go back to where we left off? After I talked with you that night and I said that I wasn't sure, you know, about where to go or I really felt I needed to go any further, but then on the way home my wife and I talked about kind of like where we thought we were at, and I told her that and she really kind of tore into me and she said... You know, it's been a long time now so it's hard for me to remember what she said, but it was kind of like who are you trying to kid? You need it worse than I do. You better stay there.</p>

<p>And I don't know, we talked for some time about it, and the next day when I went to work I was really - well, that night and the next day I was really shook up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why were you shook up? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's you know - very scared. Kind of like, God. It was kind of like, gee, I'm really not what I want to be, not what I was trying to make her think I am, and kind of like she's seeing through me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. She's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she really knows what I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She sees the person you really are rather than the person you'd really like her to see. 0:02:17.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I was really so bothered by it that I spent half the day talking about it with the psychologist I work with and about how I felt about it, because it really was bothering me.</p>

<p>And then on the way in tonight she said, "Well, you're not going to try to get out of this now, you're going to stay there." But, well, that's where I am now, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're unsure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I guess when she and I first talked about it I guess that she made me finally realize that at least she saw things in me that I was denying and made me realize that I was denying them, and that really bothered me. Not that she saw so much that I didn't see, and that I was willing to walk away from them rather than face them, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that may have really hurt for you to just walk away because of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because I felt that if I walked away she'd walked away, she would walk away. I really felt that, that really threatened; that if you don't do this and if you don't change, you're in trouble, you know. 0:04:01.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the trouble? She'd leave?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, without... And she didn't say that, it was just my feeling, you know. And I guess it really made me feel - you know, when you talked about the feeling of inadequacy, and I think that's when I really felt inadequate. I just really felt very bad, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were seen for what you are or what - what you are inside and it really just doesn't come close. It's just not the person you're very happy to see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Yes and no, though, because when we talked she didn't really specify or pinpoint or say this is your problem, that's your problem, and she just kind of left it open for me to figure it out, which I really don't think I have. Even when I was thinking about it since that time, which I guess made the feeling even worse, because it was like I had done something that was wrong, but it's unspecified, and I'm just supposed to know what it is and accept punishment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you feel? I mean maybe you'd like to talk about what that person is like who feels really inadequate and isn't a person you like to think of yourself as.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you rephrase that? 0:06:14.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm asking is maybe you'd like to talk about how you're inadequate, what you're like that kind of isn't the person that you'd like to think of yourself as? What is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think a lot of it is... I think we've talked about the things. Maybe we really haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like we've touched them at times, kind of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Things like, for example, I feel an inability to have this close relationship that I would like. I'm not sure why the relationship is or has not been at least as I would have liked, as meaningful. I'm not sure if it's because I have an inability to have that relationship or if it's something that I can't have that kind of relationship with my wife.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not sure if you're wrong, whether the relationship is at fault or [if you are] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, whether it's a permanent thing or a... It's a relative matter just between she and I, or you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens that keeps you away? Like you say you want to be close, but you don't feel like you act (inaudible at 7:52).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, we haven't been in the past. I think we're getting - feeling closer now, I think we are. I feel like we're sharing more, and yet there are times, even like during the holidays, when I guess I felt distant, you know. 0:08:20.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel? What did this feel like when you felt this? I mean what made you feel distant?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not really sure. It was on Christmas Eve and we had like a traditional family thing at our house and everybody came except my brother and he was home passed out; he had been drunk early in the day and he just passed out and went to bed. And he called about 10:30 and he said, "Will you come and get me?" So I went and got him, and my wife was really angry that I left to go get him because we were opening gifts and that. But I really wanted him to be there and his absence throughout the evening had really bothered me, and so I went and got him.</p>

<p>And when I came back she was really mad, really upset, and my brother had been very depressed for several days over his fiancï¿½e, who had married somebody else. And so when my parents and her parents left, my wife and I were supposed to go to a party and I invited my brother along, and then my wife said, "Well, I don't want to go. I just don't want to go out at all, I want to stay home," and I said, "Well, I'm going," and I put on my coat and walked out. And I don't know why for sure I did it. I was angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you were angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, especially to do that on Christmas Eve when I especially wanted to be close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, because it's a holiday. 0:10:07.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've never walked out and gone to anything without her before, and here I put on my coat and walked out. Well, I turned around and walked back in right away, but I really think I would have gone. And I don't know why I really felt that angry at her. I think I felt - in some ways I think I felt angry because I felt that she was being selfish, that she - when my brother had gone - you know, he had gone out early afternoon with a friend, gotten drunk, gone home and passed out, so she felt, well, he deserves to stay home alone, like that would be his punishment, and I didn't feel that way, and I think I got angry at her and maybe by taking my brother then and saying, "Well, I'll go with my brother," it was kind of like saying that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it really sounds like you both kind of do battle and throw strokes at each other in very non-direct way, in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you understand what I mean? It's like, well, she really felt this and that's probably why maybe she didn't even want to go out. And you'd show her. But it was like all done with other acts in a way, rather than what - saying it like it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not sure. I think it was simply because we - I just acted upon the feelings at the moment without thinking about them. You know, I just had the feeling and so, you know, disaster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like - I mean you say that your relationship doesn't feel close. It sounds like one of the things that prevents you from being close is that pressure (ph) is acting on your feelings in a way not saying what your feelings are. It's taking steps to show them and to get even, in a way, throw a punch back. It's not sharing those angry feelings or negative feelings too. 0:12:29.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in a constructive way, I would think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the [Sheraton test] (ph) is the thrust of each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look disturbed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was just thinking about how we do things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it sounds like the lack in closeness, it's like you really don't want it that way but it is that way, and it's hard for me really to - I guess maybe it's hard for you, but I'd really like you to try to see more of that because I'm trying... Why or what prevents you from wanting - from acting in a close way? Is it that you don't feel it? Is it that you don't know how to share the things that you feel close to share? That you're afraid to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think it could be a combination of those things. I think I - I know I have always been really reticent. Like during our - when we were dating, during the first year we were married or so, I was really extremely jealous without really showing it, but it was jealousy in kind of a paranoid way, because I was so afraid that she would do something behind my back without me knowing that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean see someone else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when she would date other people or something, and that it would hurt me. And so I think that... And you know, I felt at least in the past that a lot of times I might not really be investing my feelings just so I could avoid being hurt, in a sense, you know, kind of like a separation process all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you mean. It's like you kept yourself away, because to put yourself in could make yourself very vulnerable to being hurt. It would hurt more if something happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That happened once before (inaudible at 15:53).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think, too, that the medium for sharing and kind of like the context in which I could share and pass meaningful feelings is often lost because she doesn't care about the things I care about. You know, the kind of things like... Well, say you listen to music that excites you, and it can really invoke a feeling in you that you want to share, and the music that excites me just turns my wife off, say she thinks I'm nuts, and the things I like to do, for the most part, she doesn't like to do. And I guess the things that I like to do that she doesn't care for are mediums. Like I like to go camp and just be away and be alone, you know, but she won't go. She doesn't want to do that. 0:16:56.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of things that are meaningful for you to do and that you really enjoy but you can't - don't feel like you can do them with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she doesn't want to do them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're all alone in those choices and you can't even share them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think that makes me feel very lonely, you know, it really does, because it's - I don't know, it's kind of like - I guess like you read something or you see something or you feel something that's really beautiful to you and you want to share the feeling with somebody who's important to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they turn you off and say, you know, "Don't bother me with that" or "I don't like that" or "That bores me." That's bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's more than bad to kind of think of how it would be for me. I think I'd really feel like I was being turned away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not just bad, but it's like something that feels important and it's an important part of myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, part of myself, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is being just shut out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is being rejected, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and being rejected, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:18:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it makes you kind of feel like you have - it's like you're all alone with those parts of yourself then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I am. Before we were married I used to walk constantly, and I'd go for walks, you know, like for hours at a time, and after we were married my wife didn't want to, so I used to go for the walks myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you went together before you were married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No - well, see, before we were married we dated like three months and then I went in the Army, and we corresponded and she came and visited me a few times and I came down. But for the most part during our whole engagement we were separated; we saw each other once, I think. So as a result it wasn't a matter of really being able to share with her at that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But kind of once you were married...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just kind of assumed we would, and we didn't, and that really bothered me, and it still bothers me because like we don't even take a vacation because we can't agree on what to do or where to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: She wants to go to like, let's say, Florida and stay in a motel. And maybe - well, it's hard to say because it's seasonal now, but like during the summer I like to go camp or go west or something and she'd like to go and stay in a hotel, and I just don't enjoy that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of like the doing the fun things in life in a way, the things that feel good, taking vacations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you, like taking walks. It's like they can't be done together and shared and be a source for good feelings and shared feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact, they'd be kind of a source for your other [ph] feelings, through arguments, where to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they become a source for a longing. 0:20:40.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think... And then the longing is what starts to really disturb me, because I start to get - I start longing and I say, "Well..." You know, that's when I start to really feel cheated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say more about the longing feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess it's just the longing for times and people with whom I've shared those things and a desire to recreate that feeling, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You remember the things past where you had that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really long for it, you really miss it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. But it's more than miss. It's like I need it, you know, and so that's when I get really angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's feeling cheated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's when I push her away, because I - I don't know. I'm angry and I feel that you want me on your terms but you won't accept my terms. And I know in reality that's not true, but on a feeling level I think I feel that way. 0:22:04.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like on a feeling level you really feel like your feelings - and a source for your feelings have to be locked inside of you. I mean locked inside that you can't share your feelings about things like music or can't do the things that can reduce those feelings with her. And you longed, and you missed, and it makes you angry that she doesn't let you have those things together. I'm confused about what you said about thinking level, when you said that she wants - what you said was that she wants it kind of on her terms.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, yeah, on a feeling level I feel that way, although in reality I know that's not true, because I know that I have demanded a lot of modification in her lifestyle which she's made to accommodate what I wanted, and at the same time I feel maybe even though I have given up less, it's of greater importance, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess you feel - I mean it's - you mean you feel what you've given up is of greater importance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I think that maybe I've... Like earlier in our marriage I asked her - not that I ask but we like - my wife used to love to spend money like mad and we didn't have it, and she had to learn to live on a budget and learn to suppress this desire to buy, and she did it well. So I feel like she did that for me, or for us, but I feel like what I've given up in return is greater than that. 0:24:08.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've given up... I mean I guess in a way your feeling about taking walks and listening to music and being outdoors feels of a different order or type of thing than her desires, than money.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think so for one reason; because she spent money, for the most part, on clothing, you know, to enhance her beauty and to project an image, and I don't know. I guess I feel that our marriage itself has created a different image that she no longer needs to maintain with money and I feel that she should be happy with that, because she knew what it was going to be before she married me, or at least I assumed she did, because we talked about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like, well, she's married to you and that there shouldn't kind of have to be a need to enhance her beauty. I mean there shouldn't be that kind of drive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not to enhance it in the way she did before, you know. I think there are other ways that she could do that, and I think that she's aware of many of those other ways, and I think she's happy with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you think she's happy, does she say she's happy or... See, what I'm getting at is, very often, when you talk about how you feel or especially how she feels, it sounds like it's all inferred.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, which I guess is up the closeness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean do you see it's kind of like coming back on it again and it's like - I mean there it is in a way. It's like these things aren't said, and there's a hell of a lot that's not said. 0:26:32.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. When we were on vacation a week ago we had been visiting friends (inaudible at 26:48) on our way home, it was very late, about 2, and she said she didn't want to go home, she'd like to just drive around and talk. And she talked about how she was beginning to feel very depressed again, which it was good that she talked about it, but that was really only about maybe the second or third time that she talked about her feelings. I know if... You know, with the exceptions of the times that had followed with an argument, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this time it started with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a desire to show it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I guess I felt two things. I felt scared at first, you know, I really did. What is she going to tell me? Is it going to hurt me? But after it was over and I found out it didn't really hurt so bad I felt closer, because we had shared something. 0:27:59.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like it does feel good to share and say those feelings. I mean, and it does feel like it brings you together. But the other side of that is I guess the first part. It's like it might hurt, and it might hurt so I keep my feelings inside and her feelings might hurt me, and sound like kind of the fear of hurting and the fear of rejection really kind of puts bars over those feelings and keeps them sealed in and far from each other, and that in effect you [are not close] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I was thinking that when my wife and I first got married I think that both of us kind of perceived the other as somebody that was kind of strong and protective and would take care of the other, and I kind of feel that maybe after we got married we began to feel that that wasn't so and that the other wasn't as strong as...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wasn't the person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know, they had hoped and as protective, or protected, and I don't know, maybe that has been a problem too. 0:30:19.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A disappointment in each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that I really did feel before I married my wife that she was a very protective, motherly kind of figure, you know, and then I guess that after we got married I found that she was just as confused about a lot of things as I was and I'm certain and as vulnerable, and maybe I resented that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted that kind of protection and security.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look embarrassed that you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I like to think of myself as being independent and self-reliant and I suppose it is embarrassing to at the same time like the feeling, you know, to actually like the feeling of having someone come along and protect you and take care of you and to give yourself up to that, willingly surrender to that and accept it. </p>

<p>But at the same time I felt that that was the way my wife was and I - you know, I was aware of it and I was aware of how I felt about it, and I liked it. But at the same time I think that I fight that tendency to give myself up too, because I'm afraid of what will happen and what could happen. I guess it's like I just don't trust anybody that much to give up that much power. 0:32:08.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to kind of go back to the thing you were saying because it's like I really sense a compliment. It's like the wanting to be really self-sufficient, independent, but it's like you just feel like you can't - that's not really the way you are inside, it's like the way you'd like to be, and it's kind of hard to accept it; that's really not the way you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of reminds me of I remember you were saying that somehow it seems similar to when you were talking about in times past how you really feel it would be such a devastating blow to your self-confidence if you couldn't handle, like, your wife's depression, and it sounds like it's of the same kind of thing. It's like wanting to really be another way than what you really are inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know why it popped into my head when it did just now, but I know there was a relationship there, but what you were saying kind of had... Well, when we first got here tonight Kerri came up prior to my coming up, and then all of a sudden she came back downstairs and she was very excited and nervous and she said that "Tara can't see me because she has an emergency," and I said, "Gee, you're all excited as if you're the one going out on the emergency," and she said, "I feel like I'm a real part of it, see, I feel really excited," and she just kept going on and on. </p>

<p>And I really felt kind of jealous and angry, because the last time - when we cancelled our appointment we cancelled because I had had an emergency with a girl who was suicidal and I couldn't come because I had hunted for her for three days and I just found her and so I didn't want to leave, and I felt that my wife didn't get half so excited, that I handled these things too and did these things, and I was really kind of angry that she didn't recognize that. 0:34:45.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you weren't seen that you can do that too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that made me kind of feel jealous and angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really hurts you and disturbs these attitudes inside you. Your wife doesn't see kind of things that you appreciate about yourself or things you'd like her to see about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or the things that I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And kind of like she doesn't give me credit, you know. See, and then again that's just - that's my feeling. In reality that may not be that true, but it's the feeling that - it disturbs me. I find, to kind of go along like that, like when I really drink I get very paranoid, and it's been bad several times because I made scenes, and fortunately it was with friends who calmed me down. Or I'd get very angry at my wife and she'd push me along and she'd get really kind of bitchy, which would make me angrier, and then I'd get violent and start hitting things or throwing things or something. 0:36:17.4 </p>

<p>And finally we talked about it one night. You know, I told you about the night that she kept egging me on about drinking at this house, and I said, "Well, I drink because you bother me. When I drink you keep saying 'Now don't get drunk' so I just keep getting more and more drunk," and since that time we haven't really had any problems, because when I drink she leaves me alone and then I don't get drunk and everything's fine. </p>

<p>But that created a real paranoid kind of thing too, because I started thinking, gee, I've really got a drinking problem and I don't drink that often, and I felt like, "God, when is this, see?" And it really disturbed me because my mother's an alcoholic, so this is something that I've always abhorred and... Well, where do we want to go from there? </p>

<p>The thing that really disturbs me is not the drinking but it's the paranoid kind of feelings that I get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are they like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, generally, they for the most part just center around my wife, and I'll start thinking that, gee, she's having an affair, or like several times at parties if I didn't see her for a while I'd really get...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really get... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's she up to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...nervous, and start to get really scared, and then all of a sudden I'd see her and I'd think, "Oh, okay, everything's okay." But this has happened several times over the past couple years. I'd just really get shook, and a lot of times I think I'm really projecting, because maybe during the course of the evening I'd been kind of focusing on some girl over in the room and... But it really disturbs me so much that - well, even the projection kind of thing. 0:38:40.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm not sure on the projection kind of thing, but something that really hits me (inaudible at 38:47) before when you're talking about something else is how really scared and shook you would be if your wife really did leave you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you asking me, or are you implying it all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm saying that's how it really sounds that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There have been a couple times when I thought something like that had happened and it really scared the hell out of me. One night I came home - I don't know where I'd been, but I came home real late and my wife wasn't home, which was very much unlike my wife. And it was really late; it was almost 11 o'clock on a weeknight and she wasn't at home and I really got scared. And I had called the police and all the hospitals and everything. And she had been just about a mile away at a friend's home, and she had been there ever since she had closed her beauty shop and they had just gone over there, and she didn't expect me home as early as I had come home. 0:40:01.2 </p>

<p>So that really scared me. I just couldn't conceive of what had happened. And then when we'd had bad arguments, and generally it's been me who's said, "Well, leave, go on, I don't care," but then I generally don't let that kind of mood last too long, because I really kind of get scared that she will.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like (inaudible at 40:36)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:40:36.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would it mean to you if she left?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I said before, I think I'd really feel like the failing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just couldn't, then? Couldn't have a relationship that really fell down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the best way I can describe it... Well, one of the problems that we initially came in for was the fact that we were having sexual relations very infrequently, and because my name is George, it's very common for children when they meet me to go into the rhyme "Georgie Porgie." And it got so like if my wife was with me, especially, I'd really feel a kind of - like it had such significance for both she and I. And it was kind of like I'd almost want to go over and smack the kid and say, "You know, you don't have to point it out." And not in a paranoid way but you know, just like... 0:42:11.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it (inaudible at 42:11).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It made you just terribly anxious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How could you keep a grip.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, any kind of reference that like... Today like we watched Dr. Welby and last night there was a thing on there. And the guy as a result of a medical problem became impotent, and it became very embarrassing, I think. There was kind of a tension...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Static in the air.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know, between my wife and I as we watched this. And it's kind of an embarrassing thing about our unspoken but recognized problem, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this an unspoken one, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not now, no, but it was for so long, and it really became...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, you know, I really get just a general feeling of like there's so many doubts and things that you feel - doubts isn't the right word. Just things that make you very anxious and you're very unsure of can you keep your wife. It's like you're so sensitive to what is really - could, you know, really a seemingly irrelevant thing, like a kid saying a nursery rhyme just becomes a source for how unsure you feel inside. 0:43:41.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I just happened to think of two other things that we had been talking about that my wife felt were really, I guess, kind of indicative of how I feel. One of them, I don't know when it happened, right before Christmas. Most of the time when my wife and I go out we go out with these two fellows who are gay, and one of them I've known I guess since about fifth grade, sixth grade, and he and I used to be roommates. </p>

<p>When we first got out of high school we lived together in Provincetown and that was the summer he turned gay, and then for many years I was the only friend of his who knew he was gay, aside from his gay friends. </p>

<p>And so he and the fellow that he lives with, my wife and I, have become very close since we came back from California, and we go into a lot of gay parties and we know all the people who are at them fairly well. </p>

<p>And we were at this party right before Christmas, and on the way home my wife is driving and I said "Stop the car, I'm sick," and I got out and threw up. And she said, "Why did you get sick?" And I didn't remember saying it the next day because I was drunk at the time, but she said that I told her I got sick because gay people or gay life makes me sick to my stomach, and yet we're constantly with gay people, you know, at least once a week. In fact, I think we're having dinner with them when we leave tonight. And she said, you know, that it's like I force myself to do things that I really don't want to do or like to do, but I do because I feel that I should, to be consistent with my own self concept.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Kind of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, and then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should appear like you should be very tolerant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then the next...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People are tolerating all sorts of things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then another thing that she said at a different time... I don't know how we started talking about it. I guess we were talking - yeah, we were talking about my withdrawing from therapy. And she said, "You know that when I really wanted to talk to you you would always withdraw from me, you just wouldn't let me talk and you always said, 'Well, I want to be your husband, not your therapist so just, you know, if you want to talk to somebody about it, go to a therapist.'" And she said but... </p>

<p>Because see, one of the thing things that's been a hang-up for my wife is sexual fantasy, and her fantasies are very disturbing to her. And I would never let her talk about them with me because I was really afraid of their content, but I was afraid of them because it was my wife and I guess I was afraid of them because of my own paranoid feelings about what my wife might do if she got angry at me or what my wife might do related to the fact that we weren't really sleeping together, then would she go out with someone else. So I didn't really want to deal with her fantasies.</p>

<p>And so that night she said, "The problem is that you're really a prude, you know, that you're really a sexual prude, and that that's why you don't want to talk about them." And then it just kind of tied together with the thing about gay life making me sick to my stomach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is kind of all in there is like really there's a real lingering doubt and unsureness inside of yourself in that those kind of things are really upsetting to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean gay life and what might be perverse fantasies or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. The way you tied it together a minute ago was the way my wife really tied it together too. I mean it's kind of like I feel that I should kind of repress my own feelings about everything, just to make me more functional and more objective.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And be more strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know - yeah. You know, I never thought about it that way, about more strong, although maybe that's the really truest, most subjective feeling that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the most subjective feeling that you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About the thing about being more strong. Because I guess I've always kind of - when I looked at it and said, "Well, why do you feel that way," I guess I've always felt that - well, I guess, first of all, I never really consciously felt that these things disturb me, but second I think that when I say, "Well, okay, maybe I am repressing feelings, then why am I doing it," and I think it's because I feel again it's more consistent with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you'd like to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's like - yeah. But I think maybe it's really more consistent with the idea about being strong and that I'm not threatened by it, you know. See, I don't know. The thing about the gay life, I think when I said that I just have a feeling I was responding to one kind of thing, and that was kind of like the pathetic loneliness everybody at the party had, because kind of as unsure as I am about my relationship with my wife, you know, I can really feel the uncertainty they have, and you know, it's kind of like the threat imposed by any new person walking into the room. And I've lived with gay life for ten years now and it really never bothers me, and gay fantasies have never bothered me, but you know, the loneliness really disturbs me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the loneliness was like set off and unsure, you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe it does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of in their loneliness you saw your own loneliness or your own possible loneliness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your own failure, and your marriage could lead to that loneliness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I've talked before about how these things between my wife would be - can run so superficially fine, you know. On the superficial level everything's so good and we're compatible, and I think maybe we keep it superficial to avoid acknowledging or finding the lack of depth, because then we discover the loneliness that we're trying to hide with activity and this kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're afraid to discover that loneliness or lack of depth (inaudible at 53:30).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so, because then we have to do something about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you have to face it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you have it. It's like if you have all the external superficial signs it doesn't seem that way; that you're really not living together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it looks like it makes you feel sad. 0:54:01.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it makes me feel very scared, because several times when we've talked and we've kind of gotten to that kind of idea, I've had the feeling that what I should do is just get a divorce, which really becomes very frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Petrified.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel frightening. And then, excuse me, I'm not really sure if - because you know, okay, I always have the alternative thought, get a divorce or really dig into yourself to make changes and to confront yourself, and I'm not really sure which of the two is the more frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 55:06) as you say, but it's like you really feel maybe you left (ph) because it's so scary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really let yourself feel that scariness and it's like to really dig into myself and let myself be honest and open and vulnerable to where I could be hurt, it's very scary, and to think of living - seeing what I've found and being alone. Scary. They kind of both mean a kind of similar thing, and it's like kind of just seeing your own failing, you know, as a person, and kind of letting yourself open to an immense amount of hurt inside. 0:55:56.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 56:02). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that I - well, while I was listening to what you said it just kind of - my mind flashed back to that gay party where I got sick, and I got very upset at that party because there was one guy there who was a teacher who - oh, he's in his late 40s or his early 50s. And he's getting pretty old so he doesn't really have a lover anymore, and that night he got really bombed and then all night kind of just poured out and spilled over.</p>

<p>And he was talking about this high school boy that he was very upset about, because the boy's mother had died and the boy's father was already dead, so this teacher went out and bought the boy a suit to wear and made the funeral arrangements and everything, and then like two or three days later the boy made a suicide gesture right in this teacher's class, he cut his wrists and everything. </p>

<p>And the teacher was really - he was crying while he talked about it, and I guess the thing that really disturbed me was because his whole life is his students and his work, and when he was talking about the boy's loneliness you could really feel that he was talking about his own and how lonely he was, and I think that that more than anything else is what made me - I guess kind of like made me sick, because I can really see myself in his position.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could see that you could be in 40s and 50s and just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could easily end up like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that you could just have nothing except your work, and I imagine your work would be pretty meaningless. 0:57:56.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably feeling meaningless, like if you really didn't have your wife, if you could do it. But it's like you could just see - and you could have been seeing emptiness, just and all there being in there was the feeling of loneliness and sorrow. 0:58:26.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was very poignant to you, and poignant is not that - maybe poignant is not the right word but it really hit home I sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did. It was frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Upsetting. Our time's up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. What time are we going to set up a meeting? 0:59:00.6</p>

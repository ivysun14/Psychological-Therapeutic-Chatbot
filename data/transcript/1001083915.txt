<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Now. I saw you [DATE]. Your a, back then, your mood was better but you were very irritable, your appetite was good, your sleep was good, self esteem was okay. No suicidal thinking, you were somewhat helpless, concentration was okay, enjoying music and TV and kind of obsessed with your helplessness. Almost to a, you know, have you heard of obsessive compulsive disorder?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Actually<B> </B> I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I<B> </B> can’t take anymore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] has this been starting again? The whoa is me stuff?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s been a hell of a time.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Underneath [INAUDIBLE] lower and lower. I have no control over it, I didn’t want it to happen. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Well, it’s not your fault. It’s your brain. So, you’re unraveling a little bit? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When did that start? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I guess two or three weeks ago, I’d imagine.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, it…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Two or three weeks?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That’s the last, yeah…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Throughout his history.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He gets very nervous about a week before the visit here. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I’m not shaking today. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe you shouldn’t come here anymore.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [INAUDIBLE] behavior becomes</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What, are you afraid of the questions I’m going to ask you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll answer them truthfully.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But, are you concerned with the questions I’m asking?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because I’m going to ask about your mood and your interests and your </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Self esteem</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE], self esteem.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He said last night he’s afraid of everything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah? He’s enfeeble, you know term, you ever hear that term? Enfeeble.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, it’s an old man with [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I’m aware of everything I can see, I talk well with, in the house and the TV.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s what happens but especially it happens when you have uh, Parkinson’s syndrome. It enfeebles people.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it makes them almost like infants. Infantile. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, so, there’s a little bit more stress right now because we’re thinking of making a move. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of move?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, that’s a good question. What kind of move? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay, can I backtrack a little bit? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] , actually [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] got the report from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] from his brain MRI she saw nothing unusual there, she was supposed to call him and consult with him and she never…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She did see something that prevents me from walking straight. I don’t k now if it means anything </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, but the MRI, the neurologic exam was all normal?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay. Good. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right. Two things, so, he has been falling more and because of that, his anxiety level has risen to such a high level, he’s afraid to go outside at all. Except for appointments. I’m wondering if some of that is not a side effect of the Marplan and then…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The unsteadiness?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And then the second piece of that is at this point because the stress has now started to effect her functioning, we’re looking into assisted living. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Because I do feel that the two of them being in the house basically feeding off each others misery is not doing either one of them any good, they have no social contact, they have no outlets, they have no peers…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you’re dealing with [NAME OTHER] with this? You talk about it with [NAME OTHER] and she is helping guide this. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, [NAME OTHER] is helping guide this </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Well, listen, I… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She’s just looking for</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well she agrees that this may be a good thing and she talks to her about her fears that she has, but basically I’ve become the case manager, so, we already went and visited one assisted living facility and Thursday we’re going to go see another one and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s fine. It sounds like a good idea to me. It would take a lot of the stress off, it won’t intro</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Of everybody.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, of everybody. Really well, this is, you know, for years you’ve been in an overwhelming situation, overwhelming. I don’t know how you’ve managed.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And then of course I do the food shopping because he does nothing. He…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He doesn’t go out at all himself. So, you know, I…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And this is the best he’s done for years, right? I mean there were times…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When he was moaning all day.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He [INAUDIBLE] the moaning</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> For the two years prior to them coming to [DEIDENTIFIED] this is much better. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. But this ain’t good.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Correct.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Let’s, let’s talk, I’m more, I’m in favor of all of that. Now let’s talk about how he’s doing because it looks like he’s taken a turn for the worse. Correct? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep, how do I get in a </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re mood started to drop two weeks ago? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> More than that.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I’d say yeah within the last month. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He was supposed to see me about a month ago. So, maybe that’s why. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Maybe. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I, I don’t think so, but just thought I’d tell you.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, actually it has been too long and this is all…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Been three months, yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The problem, because he said he wanted to make the call, she said go ahead he didn’t do it, I told her if he can’t do it, you need to do it, she couldn’t do it, and finally I couldn’t wait anymore I and made the call.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. We can just set up appointments on the way out.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right. Well, what happened?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To make sure.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Was, he wanted to wait ‘til he got the results of the MRI of the head.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> So.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I’ll talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] also about it, but, sounds like the news is as good as can be that there’s…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right. Yeah everything...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There’s no tumor or anything…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or hydrocephalus or anything.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, there’s no like, you know, the worse that was there she didn’t even call it a TIA, would be a teeny, tiny maybe, but nothing that would…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did she agree he is Parkinsonised still? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I think so.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. How’s his sleep? How are you sleeping? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know, I took a few pills till I woke up in the morning and I started, agitating. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That was only, that was only today, and yesterday?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, in general he sleeps okay? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> In general.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is your appetite okay?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yes</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your self esteem? Low?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Very low.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You feel guilty?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s not my fault, how can I feel guilty?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It sounds like you keep repeating, it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That means you probably feel guilty. What’s not your fault? Being so depressed? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Being so, in this state of being, being so [INAUDIBLE] not being able to comfort her in a reasonable fashion. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you sometimes feel that life’s not worth living?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No it’s not,..</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any plan to hurt yourself?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you able to get any pleasure out of anything?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The music, you know. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Has he been playing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you able to concentrate on anything? Are you easily distracted?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I see things and I, I can make myself [INAUDIBLE] nothing that’s too encouraging. I can’t believe that I’m like this. I mean I see the TV and I see the room, and I see the doors [INAUDIBLE] and painting I used to keep, I used to be a record antique collector on my walls in the house.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you just can’t, can’t enjoy things?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Can’t enjoy then. How many times have you fallen?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> In the last two or three weeks he’s has to have fallen at least three times each week, at least. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m getting sort of a [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> My memory [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I know about your memory.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Has uh, has [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] been checking his blood pressures sitting and standing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think he did</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you dizzy when you stand up?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It’s not always going from sitting to standing, he could be already up and walking and just…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just gives out? Almost like his muscles give out?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] muscles.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Or he’ll start to tilt backwards, and then he’ll be so unsure of how to readjust his body that he’ll just go down. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been, I’ve been using the walker to get up and down so, no problem. [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When did, now he’s had cycling moods his whole life? Right? Did, do you recall was he worse in the winter time? Is he seasonal?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It’s hard, you know, it’s hard to know because I don’t know whether you know, it’s seasonal or whether…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, no it.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not a vague question, it’s very specific. Most, most winters, you know, in the winter time the days get shorter. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> People who are seasonal, that sets off depression. Did you find that he was always depressed at Christmas time?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the, manias, or the revving up, also there was no season to it?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No seasons.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was reading the new ingredients [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> There once was a major stressor that may have proceeded, you know, and they had been a month or two prior to setting off this change in his body chemistry but it, it wasn’t seasonal. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Any big stressor now? That set off this worsening</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] main thing and now I am concerned</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Stress.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, is there anything that seemed to set this off?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> You don’t think it was</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just thinking about it.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The discussing about moving. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know. I already [INAUDIBLE] about that. I’ll have to get used to the idea</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yes. It’s not going to happen right away. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What do you think about it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it would be good, serving, having meals served to you, but will I able to be cope with it </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So it’s nice to take some of the pressure off your wife, isn’t it? I mean, do you, don’t you want her life to be a little fuller than being wrapped up with taking care of you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yes. Oh yes.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The last, the last two days knowing he was coming here as soon as I walked out a room, he was calling me, where [INAUDIBLE]. I says how far could I be? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> But, where are you? Where are you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> On cloud nine</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> But the thing, the both of them, generally rise to a higher level of functioning when they’re around strangers um, we went to visit a place, there was a sitting room, there was a piano there…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> So that if he were encouraged to sit down and play piano and people came and paid attention to them</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And I think their level of functioning…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I agree. I agree, and the more social environment. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It would push him at least to the best, you know everyone has a range within which they can function. And our goal for him is to get him functioning at the top of his range. And I agree…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right, and the better he functions and the less pressures on her, the better she will function.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Then the less pressure on him</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I knew that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but you’re not my patient, he is. I want him functioning well, I’d be delighted if you guys function well too, that’s fine, but I want him functioning to the best of his capacity. Given that he’s got these serious limitations, right? He’s got rip roaring medication resistant depression, he’s got some neuropsychiatric syndrome, parkinsonian, I mean at least he’s got his memory. You know, at least it’s not affecting his memory. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He was, he’s working in physical therapist.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. Good. Good. And you know, he’s enfeebled in the way that people with these neuropsychiatric syndromes get, they, they get very low energy, no motivation, and feeble, they get needy and dependant and you know, unsure of themselves and, and obsessed on helplessness. They get quite helpless. No drug for that?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, maybe it does, when normally he used his you know, try to help in the house to something, he doesn’t do anything at all. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, part of that is fear. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. The most he does is he takes the garbage to the incinerator.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, here’s our challenge. We’re, we can all kind of agree that the Marplan is probably making him fall. We can also agree that without the Marplan, his life would be…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Harsh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Almost, almost unlivable. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do you have any other medication I could be taking?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that’s the obvious question. We’ve tried them all. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And you don’t think raising the Lithium?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> His, his level is 0.5, which is not a bad Lithium level for someone like him. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, that’s a good anti-depressant Lithium level, we, we go to 1 for Bipolars. I mean for real, he burnt out of any, any cycling, he, he used to have. We could go up but then you run the risk of you know, tremor, unsteadiness, you know, looking to do that also. I think we’re safer at this Lithium dose and we’re not going to get much antidepressant juice out of Lithium. We could, and he’s on 30 Nortriptyline. Let’s see the last time we checked a level. Did we check the level recently? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I don’t think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, we can check a nortriptyline level to maximize the nortriptyline dose.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I take it at night. It helps me to go to sleep.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He says it helps you go to sleep?</P>
<P><B>CG: </B> I think he’s</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Is that possible, [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah. Sedating, sure. sure. I think we should trade tentatively, we should trade Marplan for something else. That wouldn’t make him unsteady. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would hope.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know we could try there, there are two that comes to mind, I think he should be on a MAO inhibitor.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It should be rocket fuel level anti-depressant. Um, the two that comes to mind are Selegiline, which is a medicine that’s used for Parkinson’s also but its, you know, it’s a well known MAO inhibitor there actually is recently come out as a uh, patch, you can put it on as a patch, might be easier that way. I don’t know. Or, we can use Nardil, has Nardil ever helped him? Has he ever been on Nardil?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He’s been on every MAO and they have helped him when he was younger, it’s only this last five years sort of that the Nardil, Parnate, Marplan kind of I don’t know, you would have, you might have…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean it’s a shame that ECT didn’t help him last time, because he’s really a perfect maintenance ECT patient, that’s really what he should be on.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And we really, then, believe me, there was somebody hoping more than we because every time before it was a miracle answer.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean we could try again at some point. See if, you know, I don’t know if we’re ready for that I know it’s… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hassle. I don’t know why it didn’t work last time, and I gave a good strong dose of it and it just didn’t move him. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was two weeks and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said I was back to normal. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] you are going back, way back baby.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Way way back</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> You are going back twenty</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We’d rather you to see, you know, this past try…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thanks for the encouragement</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What are you at, twenty, twenty something treatments</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Twenty four treatments he had nothing from it.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, there was a little period after about maybe fifteen, eighteen he, we thought now you know, he’s coming out of it, and he started to slip back and then we decided okay this was enough inpatient they started to do it outpatient but that became too stressful to continue doing that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Well, at some point we might want to re-visit that, it would be a shame to walk away from ECT entirely. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Given that the meds are not perfect and this, you know, in a situation like this. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That used to be the miracle, miracle drug they think it was, not a waste of time</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, I… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The thing with the MAO’s which seems have been a pattern to me is with all of them, when he is gotten to around thirty milligrams he has had the same falling kind of, it didn’t matter which one…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think, you know, he’s at so much risk now for breaking a hip or doing some damage.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And it’s amazing to me I mean, because sometimes when he goes straight back, how he doesn’t crack his head open.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think we, we’re due to back off on the Marplan. Even though we know he’s going to get a little worse. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm, well that’s why we were thinking maybe he couldn’t balance it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well that’s why we should check the nortriptyline level at the same time maybe we can maximize that. Get a good dose there and then…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You don’t [INAUDIBLE] the pills the right way many times [INAUDIBLE]. You don’t totally handle it the right way.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That’s a whole separate issue.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right, in what way?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What way? Could there be more then explanation. They are not right, they are not right, they are not in there </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They are always in their containers</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I work with the [DEIDENTIFIED] they are always in there containers</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well we ran out of it many times</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Little did I know she</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, she won’t let the Marplan run out because she has to deal with you when, when uh, when it runs out. I think for her own survival she wants you on the Marplan.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> My, mine run out, but I never let his run out. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Never. I let mine run out, but never let his run out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that’s not good either. But, he’s my patient, so I prefer that… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, no stay, I mean it’s a, you know… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It’s a mute point. But I do agree I mean that it, it seems to me that his body is a certain level of the MAO and even though it may help his depression, obviously he’s still so depressed that you know…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There was a point when he wasn’t this depressed.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That it was almost worth it.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now, it’s really not.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And what did you say to me in the apartment? You’re in the black hole? It’s been a while since you used that.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, well maybe, maybe it’s because he’s there isn’t a social life, he sees nobody else. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, I understand that and that’s why now I’m trying very hard to rectify the situation which hopefully…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What to do?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Within the next six months but still we must address what’s going on now and his falling now and how bad…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. This, this is not going to be solved. We’re taking him off the Marplan, he’s got… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> All together?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, if we are going to switch to a Selegiline or something else.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or we can do this slowly just see how he does it twenty Marplan and then see if we can maximise something else and turn him around. You’d prefer that? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That would be my personal preference…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because it’s going to be ugly, the switch is going to be ugly…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, you know, we’ve been</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mean physically?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mentally </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because we have to take you off the Marplan keep you off it for at least a week and then start something new. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I would rather see how he would do to reduce the Marplan to twenty and then raise the, if you got a level on… </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We’ll get a level, uh, so when can you get blood drawn? When are you seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] next?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They don’t have an appointment</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> We don’t have an appointment. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She said if I could draw blood I could do everything. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Thyroid has never helped us has it?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, I’m sure she did that in…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He’s on thyroid, he’s on 25 of Cytomel. You can push that up to fifty. Wouldn’t hurt. And sometimes it can maintain blood pressure a little better at a higher dose. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah because my feeling would be if you’re going to drop the Marplan to twenty then we should try… </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We’ve got to make it up with something.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you know…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> We would have to do it in two if we do it in the Cytomel and whatever.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nortriptyline has this therapeutic window.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So it is not like increasing nortriptyline will necessarily be good. It, it works between when the blood levels are between fifty and one fifty. And so, we don’t know where it is right now.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Surprised we never checked. Yeah we never thought nortriptyline was you know… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> You know, but we always look at things to balance out the MAO because we knew we couldn’t above a certain level on a…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, right. Exactly. I mean we could, let me see if I have nortriptyline. No, I just have norphine. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> All right, so we’ll get a level on that and then. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why don’t we do it at the same time, you definitely could tolerate another nortriptyline, he can make it to forty…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> With no problem. Someone his age and size, a good nortriptyline dose is usually somewhere between fifty, you know, forty and eighty. Something like that.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And what is he on now?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He’s on thirty. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Thirty.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So let’s go with forty, let me write this down for you. First thing we do is reduce, arrow going down is reduce, right? Reduce Marplan to twenty, okay?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Number two is increase nortrip, NT’s nortriptyline, to forty.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Can you increase the Cytomel? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And three, increase T3 is Cytomel, I’m using all my short hand, you’ll figure it out, T3 to fifty. Okay?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is he using, and keep the Florinef where it is and the Lithium where it is for now. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For continue. Now, after he’s on the nortriptyline at this new dose for at least five days…</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Then you can get a morning blood level. The blood level should be eight to twelve hours after his night time dose. Doesn’t have to be exact.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Does he have to have on an empty stomach?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, no.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It should just be in the morning.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Most people take it at night, get a morning blood level but it should, should be five days at least after this dosage.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That’s fine, they’re never in a hurry to go to a doctor.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so, here will be check nortrip level and you know, I’ll just write it down here. Are you going to go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so you can just tell her. You know, you can show her this, this piece of paper.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And she can, I don’t have to write you a prescription for it. Tell me if that short hand is clear to you.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yes</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I’m going to write his name on it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] in the army</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Nortriptyline up to 40…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I won a gold watch, the best interpreter of morse code</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What year was that? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That was 1942.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Morse code, that’s…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It was the beginning of the war of</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> 1942?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What were you doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I had to climb a pole, thirty feet high and walk around it… </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah but…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Without hands. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> But then they were just [INAUDIBLE] doing Morse code, he got a , the school that the [DEIDENTIFIED] sent him, he got some kind of an award because he was very fast.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Than everybody else. Mm-hmm. He’s got a good ear.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Hang in there, all right? Give me a call.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He’s a good musician.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He’s a good man. He’s just is struggling with a bad brain disease. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Unfortunately. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I said, there was one girl and three boys and he’s the only one that had a problem</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, bad luck.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Nah we all have something.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> But his father, one time talking to his family, his father had depression.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, and he was young, but he [INAUDIBLE] .</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, so that’s where the gene came from. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well that, cause I was questioning this. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Take care.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> All right, if she needs refills we’ll give you a call. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just call us, take care. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Thank you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, call me if there’s a problem. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And maybe you want to make an appointment in a month or so. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Can you walk?</P>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's supposed to be nice again tomorrow, warm and all right. I walked into my office at like 9:30 and was the first and only person there. And then like two other people showed up. But I'm gonna just go home after this, like I'm not going back to the office, it's just like so stupid. And yesterday our Executive Director, was like walking around being like, "So who's here?" She's checking like on open doors, like what doors are going to be open. And so I just left my door open. It's like nobody's going to—like Glenda's not there, nobody is there. I mean, I think our graduate popped in, but she's not going to report back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [1:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was stupid though, because I think Glenda should have just like assessed the situation and been like, "Oh, two people just said yes? Why don't I close the office?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway, it's fine with me, I'll just go home and clean. So my brother got fired. And I'm told not to freak out, because apparently the situation—like he hates this woman that owns the company that he works for, she's like a bitch, everybody hates her, she's like insane, like she's a problem. And she's been a problem and he knew she was a problem. But I guess there's a new owner that's gonna start in September, like he took over, he bought the company, or whatever. And I don't know, something happened, like my brother brought—oh no, she changed the schedules so that people are getting paid per dog instead of per hour, and so he was asking about overtime and whatever, and so she just fired him. That's what happened. But I guess the guy e-mailed my brother and said, you know—and he saw the whole thing happen or was there or whatever—e-mailed my brother, and he's like, "Oh, I couldn't even sleep last night, I feel so bad, I really hope that come September you can come back onboard," and whatever, whatever. So hopefully he'll have his job back in September. But I guess like my concern is, (a) what's going to happen this month and a half, 45 days or whatever it is. Like you need to find some other part-time work, or are you gonna just rely on the fact that you have another job soon and treat this as like a vacation. So I'm a little worried about that. [2:30]</p>

<p>Now, my father and I finally spoke. So him and Tracy closed on the condo they bought, you know, because they bought the condo above them in their two-family. So they closed on the condo and I guess he was feeling more like sane or something, I don't know. So we talked. And he is giving me the money that he gave me for the deposit, like no strings attached. He gave me a check for $3000, also no strings attached, assuming it's the grandma's money, and said like, "Let's start there and then we'll see what else we do." And Stephanie's take on it was like, "Good, I'm glad he's finally doing the right thing." Which I agree with. And my mother's like the same thing, you know. But I do still feel that it's very generous, just because I know that being from our history and like whatever that this is not ideal for him? </p>

<p>But anyway, be that as it may, he doesn't want me to pay off. So I have one card right now that I racked up a bunch in the last couple months because I don't have really a cash flow that he said that that's zero percent on all—I have no balance and that has zero interest until February. And then I have my mattress which I'm still paying for another year at a hundred and—even as I keep paying what I'm paying then it's also zero interest. He said don't pay anything on those yet like with the $3000. So what I did is I'm paying off three cards, I've got one with like $300—no, like $200 on it, not very much, and then another two that I had like about $2000 on them. So I'm paying those off, so that's great. And then I'm putting the other thousand dollars or so that's going to be left in my savings account for now, and then we'll decide what to do later. I mean, I hope that if he's telling me not to touch the one with the zero interest that, you know, I can pay it off before February, because I don't want to hold onto another payment because I still have that huge balance. But this is great because really I'll only have the [Fatress? 5:07], which is zero percent interest, and the big balance, which is a lot more manageable. I'm also getting a raised, union-based increase, on August 15th, which is like going to be something like $1500 a year. I mean, not very relevant week by week or month by month or paycheck by paycheck but still something. And I don't really know—well, whatever. So I'm feeling a little bit better about stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know if I mentioned to you that I applied for a position that I saw open at the business school here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did. [6:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was July 3rd. July 23rd, so a couple days ago, or last week or whatever, they posted another position with the same title. And then I e-mailed—I applied for that one too. I mean, I basically just copy and pasted everything, because it's literally the exact same position but a different job requisition number. So I confirmed with the HR department that in fact there are two open positions, so I have my application in for both of them. In the employment website you can see like progress, and so the first one, the July 3rd one, is marked as under review. And then the second one, I don't know, I haven't checked any, but maybe is already under review as well. So we'll see what happens with that. Now, in the meantime, I think I might have mentioned to you that I applied for the job at the University of Houston, that the woman that I'd met with there and then like before I came in—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the one that might have a higher salary?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this happened like last week before I came and saw you. So I applied for that of course as I mentioned. And then this morning I got an e-mail from [Alba? 7:00] asking if we could talk on the phone about the position on Monday, so I assume like first interview stuff. I mean, it's an interesting scenario, because this is somebody who I've been in contact with very frequently in the last seven, eight months. I mean, not as much in the last few months, but I was really looking to her for support, and she was really supportive, and of course I already met her in person and had an informational interview. So I'm interested to see how this scenario will play out. Of course Stephanie's like, "I really recommend that you no matter what during the interview act like you want this more than you want any other position in the world and then we'll go from there." You know, like, "You'll see what they want to offer, if they make an offer you'll see if they want to see you in person again, or if it's sufficient, you don't have fly down there." I mean, tickets are cheap right now so I would do it if I had the opportunity because I think it's worth it. And then she said, "Well, it sounds like what the salary is that they might offer." And then of course she said, being a lawyer that she is, she's like, "And don't worry, I'll help you get out of the lease, it's not a problem." So okay. But I mean it is nice to know that I don't have to really worry about that because she will handle it for me. But I'm interested to find out what's going to happen because, you know—I mean, she obviously—she's the Director, right, the Manager would be working directly under her. [8:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know their department already because I went there and met people. So I know that it's like Director, Manager, Planner, and then admin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Designated the hierarchy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even think there's Assistant Director. Maybe there is. But either way. She called me, you know, and said, "I'm about to post this position, please apply." So I wonder who the competition is, like what—I don't know it's—I mean, I have no idea what they might offer. They might offer me something ridiculous, or like to match what I make now, in which case it doesn't make it worth it to move anymore if I'm not going to be getting paid I think at least $5,000 more than I am now. Which is probably what I would get offered if I got an Assistant Director job at the business school, probably around $58,000.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [unclear 9:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, what if they do make me that kind of offer and I want to accept and I still haven't heard from anybody at the Business School, and then what if I do and then I'm like, "Fuck, I could have stayed," like if I decide to whatever, accept. It's frustrating that I lived like a year ago—you know, that this whole thing with Franklin and I found the messages with the girls, like about a year ago now that I was deciding what I was going to do, and he should move out, and I want to break up. But like I just have been feeling this week, okay, it's been a year and like I don't really feel like I've made all that much progress. And I mean, like okay, like what—then it like begs the question to myself. Like what do you mean by progress? What are you classifying as progress that you have or haven't made? I mean, I don't know, I don't really know. I just feel kind of like not that much better about everything. [pause] [11:30]</p>

<p>And I feel really frustrated because—I don't know. I feel like I don't trust men because of Franklin. Like because I feel like if I put any trust—if I like trust anything or believe anything then I'm gonna like fuck up again, so I don't believe anything. Like I have no reason to not—I don't know. [long pause] I mean, like I obviously don't know how he's feeling, but like presumably he's at a new job, because he got fired from his old one and then I saw some picture on his Instagram in which he was in like the morning with the coffee and work here, like going to work. So like clearly he got a new job, or I assume. I don't know. I don't know why it matters, like I shouldn't—I don't know why I care to compare myself to him in terms of like progress after this breakup, but it's hard not to. [13:15]</p>

<p>And like I'm getting anxious about packing and moving and moving the cats, and I'm getting anxious about the school year starting, and the fact that I'm really, really bored and really don't like my job. And then I'm like worried about if I do start interviewing for jobs at MIT if nothing happens in Houston how is that gonna work? I don't know. Like are they gonna be like, "Well, why—" I don't know, should I tell them? I'm like constantly anxious all the time and I really am over it. Maybe that's what it is, I just feel like I'm—this whole year it's just been one fucking thing after another, and like I don't feel any more settled than when I was struggling with Franklin or with the breakup or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I don't feel any more like equipped to like date anybody or like—I don't know. [pause] You know, now they want me to help Michael find a fucking car, because like I'm so good at it. But it kind of annoys me. Because it's like, "So, who cares? Just find it yourself." But everybody like, "Well, you know, it would be really helpful for him because he really has a hard time with that stuff." Boo fucking hoo. Like I found the apartment. He could barely even fill out the application. He got stressed out filling out the application. But it's my problem though? I don't know, it just feels like, okay, I'll add it to my list of everything that I do and that I'm doing. Like, as if I'm not preparing to move like an entire huge apartment and two cats. [pause] [16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um… [long pause, one minute] I wonder if you're like really actually awfully pissed off most of the time. And that's part of what makes a lot of things so difficult. Like I could be wrong, but I suspect that like with helping Michael find a car that—and there's some issue of time and sort of getting organized to help him and the effort it would take. But I think the thing that probably makes it much harder is this is fucking serious and resentful as hell that they would ask you to do it, that he would need it and not be able to do it on his own. You know, that everybody's sort of trying to pressure you or hype his expectation that you'll do it. I think that's the hard thing to deal with in helping him find a car, it's probably much more that, being furious and resentful than—I know you're already busy, but my hunch is that it's much more so those things than the time that make it hard to contemplate. [18:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can carve out time for anything, that's not the point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think so. And probably also partly what makes applying for these jobs so difficult is like—and trusting men—you're going to do all the work, you're going to put yourself out there, and maybe you'll hear back from the job and maybe you won't. Maybe they'll want you, maybe they won't. Maybe you'll feel like they're stringing you along. You know, they certainly aren't going to do it in a timetable and in a way that's convenient for you. Maybe they'll want you but they don't want to pay you. You know, I mean, I think you're probably so, so angry, like at every single step. And I think with your father helping you out—my impression is that it's a relief in two ways. I mean one, obviously the money helps, it really makes a difference, like that you don't have to worry about you're going to have to pay him back with the $2000. [20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that the $3000 will help a lot on the credit card that you used before. And then it sounds like he may help you more with the kind of low interest stuff, the zero interest stuff, it'd be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also sounds to me as though you're still really obviously incredibly furious at him, again for the ways he's not been there for you. And this kind of soothes that a bit, you know, like assuages it some. It doesn't fix it, it doesn't like actually change your view of him. It's kind of like, you know, you have a horrible rash, you put something on it that makes it itch less or makes it feel a little less awful for now. It feels like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's good, but it also I think points towards again like the—I don't want to say the intensity, but the like pervasive quality of your like anger and like fury at him for not being there for you in the ways you felt he really should be. And I know that makes you think about you and Franklin as well. I think one of the things that Franklin did for you was there were ways I think he made you feel safe and cared for. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And cared about too, but like he would like do stuff for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it wasn't like, you know, he would clean the entire apartment and do all the [unclear 22:18] stuff, it wasn't like that so much. It was like kind of things that were comforting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And things that were like calm and supportive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And again I think it also made you kind of like angry, because you felt like you're getting more of something that like you really didn't deserve [alone?], but like pissed off for happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's part of what made it so hard to see what he was doing and know he's going to screw you over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that was so hard to give up, the good things that you had. [23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And part of what's making it [unclear] to be without him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was driving home on Monday, and this I think was the first week—no, it was the first weekday evening the bridge was closed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's fucking up everything. Because imagine how many people use the bridge to come in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And all of those cars are now spread out into every other artery to get in and out. So Monday people really have not figured it out yet and so it was just everywhere it was like horrible. And I had gone to Aiden and Lucas's to pick something up and to hang out for a little while, because I knew—so I always want to let traffic go down a little bit, but I knew even more. I left there at 6:30, and when I tell you an hour later I had to like turn back around and go back and hang out at Jillian's until 10:00 p.m., and then still there was construction and bullshit and traffic past the Museum, because that's the way I had to go. I mean, it was like absolute torture, I was really pissed, I was really upset. I was annoyed because I would have just stayed at Aiden and Lucas's and like order food or something, but then they decided to go out somewhere. It was just really fucking annoying. And it's 10:30, and I was tired, and all I could think was what the fuck, like I hate Franklin for fucking everything up because now I don't have somebody to call and be like, "Can you make me some macaroni and cheese and like roll me a joint so that I can have that when I get home," and maybe even [like warm it up?]. Like I was so mad about that. [25:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because really it was like every night I don't feel that way, I don't feel like oh, it would be so nice to have somebody there. But that night it was like really poignant in terms of that feeling of like the absence of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think the… [pause] I think you feel really congested like that with being so pissed off. You know what I mean? Like I think that's a pretty apt metaphor actually for what the anger can be like for you, making you feel so stuck, like it's so hard to get anywhere. But you're trying to do all this construction in your life—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and are hitting congestion all over the place because of it. And you're like so sort of filled up with and kind of congested with feeling so angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yeah, right, exactly. Like the best thing for it is somebody being comforting, taking care of you a bit, all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. Right. And I mean, that being said—so the whole my father thing, like you said, it's like alleviating but it's not fixing. But like it did make me feel good because it was like, okay, good, I do feel like you want to help me now finally, and help me feel better and comfort me and whatever. [pause] I just feel like this year I've been trying to like put in all this work on like myself, and like doing stuff. Like I've tried like a million methods of like, "I'm going to do this to stay busy and not feel lonely." And like, "I'm gonna start this," and then I don't start it or finish it or even dedicate myself really to anything that I said was going to make me feel better. And then like the whole job search thing, and how that had so many ebbs and flows and dips and rollercoaster like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like it feels a little bit like running in place. Like I feel like a year later and I don't feel that much different. And like Stephanie got all upset when I told her that, because she's like, "What are you talking about? You have a new lease on an apartment and a car and on life." And I was like, "I don't know if I signed the lease on life yet. [laughter] I don't know what you're talking about. But like she was, you know, like, "What are talking about you haven't made any progress?" But I'm like I can't—like I'm skinnier, but like I don't—and yeah sure, like okay, I got a new car and whatever, but like I don't feel like I've made progress. Like I'm not—I don't know what a more appropriate relationship or man would look like still, and like don't know how to even like read people. Don't know what to trust, what not to trust. I'm still unsatisfied with my job, I'm still gonna be medium unsatisfied with my living situation because, like granted, it's gonna be my brother and I'm trying to like look forward to it. He's still a mess, and like I'm still gonna be living with a messy person who doesn't notice things the way that I do. You know. I still don't have any money. So if she can say like, "Oh no, what are you talking about?" But like I really don't agree. Like I just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [29:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she's like, "Well, but you know that breaking up with him wasn't a mistake, right?" I was like, "Yeah, that—I mean—"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm not questioning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not like you're second guessing yourself about that, it sounds like you wanted to be in a very different place than you were, and then you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think—I mean, I think there is—what you're saying is also somewhat pointed at me. That these are all things that you I imagine feel like I am definitively responsible for helping you with. Like, you know, not finding you a job, whatever, but things like feeling more confident about relationships. [30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's like, how can you even when like I have a thousand other things that I complain about every week. So I wouldn't expect you to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it sounds like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even have focus in my therapy, I can't expect you to, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [pause] I'm not actually—maybe I'm a little bit trying to be reassuring, but I'm also saying like you don't want to go about it like, okay, we need to work on this here, this problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe the part that I was responding to is a feeling that I see you're like—okay, like the therapy feels—you know, it's funny, I think this is—okay. I think part of what you're saying is that therapy feels a little like driving around. It feels like there is so much traffic, there is so much to talk about—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —so much to do, and it all has to be squeezed into a 45-minute commute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like how the fuck can that possibly happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it gets hard to stay on the same path, like each session or each week even.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I think that's—I think there are times—I mean, I've suggested meeting more often, and I think without realizing it I'm kind of probably partly responding to that feel that things have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, that sense of like everything packed in and congested and feeling stuck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. [32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the kind of—the pressure. I mean, you often talk in a kind of pressured way. Not like in a manic way, which is what pressure [unclear], not like that. But like there's a sense of wanting to get it all in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or get it all out. Or get it all somewhere. Yeah. [pause] And I guess there's also like a feeling of inadequacy that goes along with it. Or not necessarily—so it's more like not having enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] I don't know, I… [pause] I'm also—I thought that choosing to move would kind of alleviate my sense of like—choosing to move and just staying back in—choosing to stay boxed in—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —move apartments, get an apartment, figure it out. I was feeling like that would make me feel like a little bit—like I'm not waiting for—like just waiting for something to happen. Like I'm not waiting on a job, I'm not waiting on, you know, to hear about an interview, I'm not waiting on—I don't know, it just made me feel like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need a little space I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it's like, okay, I don't have to move, but it might be better. I could like move to another city, I can stay around here—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I don't need another job, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —feasible local move.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that you couldn't have done the other, but there's, you know, less—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Involved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Involved, yeah. And like, yeah, you're trying to give yourself a little bit of room I think. It's like, okay. And that'll help, that'll be okay. You know, in some ways it'll be enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Then I almost immediately started feeling like, I don't know, no, no, I'm still sick of my job, I still am like [during? 34:36] the school year and not need to do this again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel really bored. And so then I said, okay, I'll just look at MIT and see. But then that was—okay, there's some more. So I'm waiting, just added waiting back in. Then I applied to a job, oops, added more waiting. Then now with Houston, this other job, and now it's just two jobs at the business school. And so like here I am back like I don't know what's gonna happen in the next two months, maybe I won't even more. And I'm kind of back to like feeling like unsettled. [35:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, Michael not having work for the next two months. I'm just like, I tried to take these steps so that I— And actually I was feeling better for a little while and feeling, you know. But then honestly like I really think that now because of these—I'm waiting again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the [unclear] process is partly a setup for you, in that you're going to be anxious and possibly really frustrated with how it goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With not hearing, with hearing at different times, with like the ups and downs of the interview process, stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With, you know, the way that you're on the line to be wanted or not I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I imagine that that's part of what you got at work, but that's gonna be worked out. I mean, I guess I imagine like, okay, let's say you had three offers in hand tomorrow from those three jobs. Like I imagine you wouldn't feel that worked up. I mean like, you might feel anxious about deciding and figuring out what you wanted to do, but I guess it seems to me like some of that feeling unsettled is like a worry about how frustrated and angry you're gonna get about how the processes unfold.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess the sort of thought experiment I was doing is like, yeah, okay, let's imagine Sophie had these three options tomorrow, you know, I don't imagine you'd be that worked up. Like you might be a little anxious making decisions, that wouldn't be such a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be more like, "Okay, what am I gonna do?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's more like, are they gonna want me, aren't they, how long are they gonna [make a commitment to here? 36:57]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many times am in gonna sort of responsibly follow up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, am I gonna hear from Texas, there's gonna be a low offer and then I've got to think about what to do, and are they gonna then put me off. And like it's sort of like—you know, it's driving through an area where there's construction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, where you're trying to make something happen and build something new, and having to like navigate all of that, and I think getting really worked up about how that can affect you. Not just you, but for now you. And mostly along the lines of how pissed off you're gonna get if they are not there for you in the way that you hope they will be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either through the process or with an offer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends what the offer is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just tired of feeling so unsettled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's funny, like… [pause] Maybe the whole last year in some ways has felt, like not exactly like a first date, but kind of like that, in feeling like you're on the line, and you're trying to make all these different things happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, like in a way those are the obvious responses to the end of a long relationship that you were hoping would lead to marriage. But in other words like the worst thing in the world for that. I mean, you just said hindsight, I'm not trying to say like you shouldn't have done it this way, I'm just saying in terms of how it's been. It's like totally putting yourself on the line in all these very difficult ways after feeling crushed and really disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. [39:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [unclear]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And like, you know, when I'm talking with Stephanie about it her whole thing is like, "Just stop." Like, "Why are you even saying this anymore? I don't understand what are you talking about, why do you still feel like this," whatever. And, you know, "Why are you still talking about you, why do you still think about him so much and [say things?] so much? Like I haven't talked to [unclear] in months." And I'm like—didn't say this, but in my head I'm like, "Yeah, that's because your relationship was like a little bit over two years. Mine was almost four. So if we're going by this stupid math that people do of like how long it takes you to get over a relationship, you're almost at the year mark, you're good. Like I've got another six to nine months to go, if we're going with that theory." So like go fuck yourself kinda, you know. Plus you like have a boyfriend a year and a half and I do not and have not. So also go fuck yourself. I don't say that, I just say, "Oh, you're right." Because like it's just not worth it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she'll just say like I'm being too negative and like she can't talk to me, and it makes her more sad when she wasn't feeling sad and it's not fair and blah blah blah. Fair enough, fine. And like I get that men are different, but I just am still like—I just don't understand how I can still be struggling so much, or I feel like I'm struggling so much and running in place, and he's with the girlfriend and he's got a girlfriend. Like, he's probably moving in with her, because his lease is up in September. [pause] I wouldn't rather be with him, like that's not the point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm just… [pause] I'm just not okay about it still. [pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe in some ways he was more there for you than anyone else has been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. And also it's a similar feeling thinking about the move. And now I have to it alone very much. Like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. [42:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, like I'm sure—actually I'm not even sure I could invite a friend over to hang out with me on the day of the move and like help [unclear] the movers, because it's Labor Day. People are gonna be at barbeques and shit, I'm not gonna ask people to like whatever. I mean, Michael will help obviously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We're gonna stop in a couple minutes and we should talk some logistics.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like [unclear] the money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have to pay you, I want to pay you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if we could do like today and then like the bill also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that we're up to date.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want to do that first?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, why don't we.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. [00:00:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Just a couple things to talk about from last week. I'm not working anymore, so I don't want to cut out treatment completely, because I feel like I am making progress and that's helping, but from a financial standpoint, every week is going to be kind of expensive - if we could do every other week or find another time where I can do every other week that's convenient? Would that be able to work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, let's talk about it. I mean, that's certainly one option. The other thing is, I really sort of value and prioritize weekly treatment, and so -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you needed a slightly more reduced fee for a limited period of time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - before you found work, I'd be willing to that. [00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and that's what's frustrating too, it's because I'm very frustrated, because with my internship, I'm kind of only doing it three days a week. And I really can't find a job unless it's part time at nights or on the weekends and stuff like that, and a lot of people are looking for full-time help. So I am kind of in a pickle, but I mean that is something we can discuss. Like I said, I am - I don't want to not come every week, but from a financial standpoint I don't want to be drained for money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, where I don't have anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long are you doing the three days a week for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they just asked me because my supervisor's pregnant, and she's going out on maternity leave soon. So they asked me if I could be able to finish out the year. So we're talking like June. Which is fine but I've also got to figure out ways to make income in between there. I applied for a couple of substitute jobs. If that come through maybe we can go back to weekly or whatever. Or I have an interview next Thursday with a camp, but that's work not until the summertime. I have a couple of options, but I just think the weekly one might be a little too costly right now. If we could do every other week I think that would be more financially comfortable for me, where the fee that I give for the two weeks would be - or monthly, would be more comfortable for me. [00:02:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let me ask you, if a couple of months until you're able to get back on your feet, if you did $75 a session, is that something that you could do weekly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I could do $150 a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) One -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every two weeks. I think that would be okay. We could try that for a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd be - you know, not as an ongoing thing, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I agree, and I do appreciate you being flexible with me during my tough times. But I do feel like I'm making progress in here - and I'm totally with you where I don't think that every other week would be effective, but I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so, if that's okay, why don't we try that for a bit? You'll see if you can do that because it's still more than coming every other week -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I agree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For $100, since it's a little bit more money. But you see if you can do that financially -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, you know, like I said, I'm happy to do that for a couple of months until you get back on your feet. [00:03:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, thank you, I appreciate that. And then if I do get some part-time work there I'll definitely let you know, and we can work out the fee then. I appreciate that, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pauses, sighs) Moving on, Sunday was my last day at the bar. But it kind of has been difficult this whole week because I did it for my own personal reasons, I did it because there was just a lot of negativity in the past, there was just a lot of trust issues, there was just a lot of problems. Our personal relationship is definitely affected by our working relationship. (pause) [00:04:34]</p>

<p>But what's funny was when I told them I wasn't going to work there anymore, they kind of were (pause) you know, they kind of accepted it but they didn't, they were kind of a little angry. They thought it was something they did but I told them it was nothing they did. I told them it was me. I told them I had some issues personally that I needed to work out. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>And like I said last week, mine was mainly because of the work hours, I didn't want to get involved in that because this was the first time, really, that we actually saw eye-to-eye civilly. There was no screaming, there was no fighting. And I kind of think in my opinion, they didn't know how to react. Because my uncle talked to me and was just like, "I want you to work. I need you. We're here for you." And I said, I appreciate that, but you've got to understand, this is not a work thing. This is not a financial thing. This is a me thing. I don't want to put any blame on them and tell them about how they've hurt me and how I've hurt them. I'm past that. I want to move on, I want to try and build our relationship. And for me, the only way to do that is to just walk away from the business. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>Definitely our working relationship has had a toll. It's been - it's had its ups and downs, and its downs have been very down. And personally, like I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, where I was on non-speaking terms with them for six - seven months. And it's just to a point where I don't want to do that anymore. But it is to the point where I'm kind of feeling that guilt again. There is a job just waiting for me there, and I'm not jumping on it. [00:06:35]</p>

<p>When I'm there and I see my aunt, who needs knee surgery and is walking around doing all that stuff, and I'm like, "Why shouldn't I go there and help them out?" But then again, I'm getting it from my sisters, my brothers, my girlfriend, my parents that I did the right thing. "You don't need to be there. You don't need to put yourself through what you've been putting yourself through." And when I did it, I was fine with it, I was in agreement with it. But now I'm getting that guilt again. That guilt is coming back into me. "Well, maybe I can work a couple days here, a couple days there. Should I work a couple days here?" You know what I mean? And it's just really frustrating me because (pause) like I said, last week, I'm just setting myself up for failure because I know nothing's going to change. I know the business aspect's not going to change. The way I'm treated is not going to change. I know that in my head, but my heart keeps getting in the way. [00:07:49]</p>

<p>Because I do feel bad, I do want to help, I do want to support them. And I'm just being torn, because I feel like I am doing the right thing by not working there. But then watching them all last week running around because they don't have the help, it bothers me a little bit. But then the other part of me, it doesn't bother me because I'm like, "Well, when they have extra help, who are they going to have working? Not me." Even when they didn't have help, I still wasn't working. So that's coming back into my thoughts too, just what the treatment was, how I was being treated, how everything was going to play out. And it's frustrating to me because I am still torn. [00:08:47]</p>

<p>I am to the point where I'm like, "All right. I'll give you a couple hours here, a couple hours there," but I'm trying to stay firm to not do it. Because I do know that I'm going to get hurt again and I don't want that. But I was having a conversation with my girlfriend about - the emotional part of it is the hardest part. Because I can't take out the emotional part, but the family-oriented part - I can't get that out of my system. And she goes, "Here they go again with the guilt trip. 'You want to work? Can you work? I need you here. Can you help me out?'" And she goes, "That's what it is, they're sucking you in. They're doing this, they're doing that." [00:09:37]</p>

<p>I had a conversation with my uncle where he told me he didn't care what was going on. He didn't care, he'd pay my health insurance. He'd give me a salary, as long as I just showed up once a week. And that's what my sister and my girlfriend said, "They're trying to suck you back in." That's where the guilt comes in, where this is that, and that is... And to believe me, it was going through my head, just giving them once a week, just doing that. And my sister told me even once a week is too much. She goes, "You can't give them anything anymore." And my sister told me, "You should have never started." Because that way it would have been an easier transition. But like I said to her, I was like, "I thought it would change, I thought everything was behind us, I thought we had moved on. But apparently we haven't, and it's not." Every year I go in with the expectation that things are going to change. Things are going to actually get better and move on. And every year they've actually failed and gotten worse. [00:10:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that part of you that wants them to get better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For them to understand me. For them to treat me - they say that I'm like a brother to my cousins, I'm like a son to my uncle and to my aunt. Well, if I was really like that, why would you treat me the way you do? Why would you not have me working more than one of your better employees? Why is it when I make a suggestion I'm always wrong? Why is it that when I want to help you and I try to help you, you think I'm doing you wrong? That's the part that - it bothers me. Because that's what my uncle was telling me the whole time, was that he loved me like a son. And I bit my tongue, and I wanted to say, "Well, you haven't acted like it." Because no father would do that to their son, especially if it was his business or their business. Their son would not be coming in six days a week for four- and five-hour shifts. Their son would be getting precedence over former employees. And to me, that's what I wanted to say so bad. But I bit my tongue. [00:12:03]</p>

<p>You know, he mentioned to me, "My cousin gets mad, she doesn't know what to schedule you for, because you bitch when you're here, you bitch when you work all day." And I wanted to say, "Well, that's a different story. Now, when I was bitching I was young, I was 22, 23, 24 years old. I wanted to go out and have a social life. Now I'm older, I'm almost 30, I have other priorities that I have to deal with. But I don't care about working. I want to work. But I'm bitching and complaining about four-hour shifts because I do have needs that I need to meet. And by you scheduling me for a four-hour shift I can't go get another job. Because you schedule me right in the middle of the day. If you're going to schedule me four hours have me come in at eight o'clock and work until noon, so at least I have an opportunity to work another job. At least I have an opportunity to pick up another shift somewhere else." You know, the shifts that they were giving me, I can't do it. [00:13:06]</p>

<p>And to me, looking at the schedule of who was working and who was not, I was just a full-time filler. If someone needed a night off, that's when I'd get scheduled. (sneezes) Excuse me. If someone needed a day off, that's when I'd get scheduled. It was all the times other people didn't want to work was when I was working. But yet all those times I was around all day and just hanging around, they never scheduled me. And that's what irritated me, what pissed me off, was the fact that there's a 21-year-old kid who's working 60 hours a week and here's your family, your son, so-called, working 32, 33? Where's that make any sense? Where's that (pause) I have needs to meet. "Well, he's a college student." Yeah, well, so am I. They use that excuse that I'm a student. I go, "Well, he's a student too." "Well, he doesn't have to do as much work as you." How do you know how much work I can do? You asked me for a schedule, I gave you a schedule of when I could work. I go, "If I couldn't work, I would have put down that I couldn't work." But when I put down that I can work and I'm not working, of course the frustration's going to build and it's going to get involved. But I can't talk to you because you're going to get upset about it. I'm only there to work for when you need me. Well, now I'm not there to work for when you need me. Now they're scrambling around trying to find people. Trying to fill my position. [00:14:47]</p>

<p>You know, I always said because I knew everything about that business, it's what hurt me. Because I was that filler position. "Oh, we don't need help during the day. Well, you can work during the day but I have enough help at night." So then you get screwed. And that's what frustrated me was there was no consistency. I was being told one thing, and a whole other thing was happening. And it does scare me because I had this conversation with my siblings and my girlfriend again. I said, "How long is it before they start texting me asking when I can work again, and how do I react to that? How do I tell them no? I can't." [00:15:38]</p>

<p>Because the guilt side wants to go back to work. The guilt side wants to help them out. But the mind side is saying, "No, you can't do that anymore." It's saying, "You can't be treated like that. You're just setting yourself up for failure." But my heart, in my heart I want it to change. I want them to actually treat me like that son that they said that I was. But I know it's never going to happen, up here. In here, I know. And that's what's frustrating to me. That's what bothers me the most. And I think that's why we've had such big blowouts, because we are family and they feel that because I'm not their immediate family, they can take out a lot of shit on me. And that's what bothers me. It's because they're stressed out at other people. And I try to help diffuse the situation, but they don't want me to diffuse it. They think they can do it. And that's when the trouble starts. [00:16:43]</p>

<p>Because to me, I'm just a regular employee, I found that out the hard way. And I'm just like, okay, that's fine. Then you deal with it. But then they come and they start getting on me. "Well, why didn't you do this? Why didn't you correct them if that was happening? Why didn't you say something if that was happening?" And I told them, it's not my place. You already gave me a position of power. And when I used that power, you listened to your employees instead of me, and took that power away from me. So why would I let you use that power? Why would you give me that power? Why would I use my knowledge anymore? Why would I try to help people out? [00:17:30]</p>

<p>I mean, I always say everybody else can do their own thing but I'm under a microscope and I don't know why. It's probably because of my past there with the drugs, with the people with drugs. Because they've pretty much eliminated everybody that was involved in the drugs but me. And for me, I feel that that's a problem. Because I think they'll never get over that, and that's fine. I don't blame them for not getting over that. But you know what? In order to heal, to build our relationship, we need to move forward some time. And (pause) me staying there and being constantly in that environment, that repeated environment, of all the negativity and all the bad that happened there, just - it's not working for me. It's not working for me. But there's always this person in the heart saying, "Go back. Give it another chance. They need you." [00:18:41]</p>

<p>You know, it's kind of like going back to my parents. I needed something from them, I have some closure that I want them to show to me. And I don't know what it is. It's why I keep crawling back. It's why I crawl back to my parents. It's why I want to crawl back to them because I have some closure that I need from them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Crawl" is such an evocative term. Crawl - like babies crawl, crawling's a sort of groveling part. It's a really interesting choice of word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean it's... it's what it is. I kind of feel like I'm below them, and I depend on them. It's kind of like I am still a baby a little bit, where babies will cling to their parents, they need their parents (pause) or they need, you know, support, people that have been through it. And that's what I am. I'm just moving from place to place, looking for someone to love me as a baby. And I'm not getting it. [00:19:47]</p>

<p>I'm starting to get it more and more from my parents, who have been extremely supportive throughout this whole decision-making. Who have finally, like I mentioned last week, who have finally decided to take my side. And I'm finally seeing that a lot more with them, they're finally starting to see my side of the story, my situation, what I went through. And I'm starting to actually receive some of that closure from them. And not for nothing, I can feel it. I can feel it, my body feeling a little bit better when I interact with my parents. When they are a little bit more empathetic towards me. They are seeing things my way, they are trying to be more supportive but not in a different way. On the other hand, with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins, I don't know what I'm looking for from them. I don't know what it is I need from them. But I guess there is this pattern where I do keep putting myself back into situations where there is some unfinished business that I'm looking for. But I don't know what it is. I don't know why I keep going back, why I keep putting myself through all this hurt and all this stress, and all this negativity. For what? And then the end of the season will come, and they'll act like nothing happened again. Meanwhile, I've been walked all over again for another six months. It's just something that I don't want to do. But then again, my brain knows it, my heart doesn't. The emotional side of me is just, it bothers me that I have such a connection to this place and I don't know what it is. [00:21:43]</p>

<p>I don't know what it is that I want out of the bar. I don't know what it is that keeps pulling me back to the bar. I really don't. As much as I want to just walk away and leave it, I can't. And I don't know why. I don't, and that's why I'm kind of at a standstill, against the wall, where I don't even know where to start to climb it, to get over it and move on. I've been like this for a while. And it is frustrating because I know in my mind, I know nothing's going to change. But it keeps coming back to the emotional piece of it. I can't let it go, and I don't know where to start to let it go, I don't know how to just tell myself it's just a business, they'll manage. They'll figure out something, it's their business, it's not your business. You don't want to be involved in a place where it's just going to be hurt again. And for me, that is bothersome. [00:23:01]</p>

<p>Speaking of the bothersome part is the message that I let you listen to a little bit last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was going to ask about that because we sort of ended there and we didn't get a chance to discuss it. I guess my first thought is what did you want me to hear in that or understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted you to hear the tone that I was talked with, how it was basically blaming me for the situation, telling me how he talked to this person Peter, who is pretty much at my level there, he's an employee, not manager, and my uncle's talking with Peter, who's an employee, who pretty much said it was okay for me to come back, who pretty much dictates how that business is run. And to me, that's bothersome, is how I'm supposed to be the son and do all this stuff, but you have to consult Peter. Why didn't you consult my cousin or my aunt? Why did you consult Peter? And because it's okay with Peter that I come back and talk, why is that okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in a sense, like he's prioritizing a stranger over blood. [00:24:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we're not related by blood, it's through marriage, but it's still the fact where you tell me that I'm your son, and you treat me like a son, and this is what you're doing. Because you're treating this person more of like a son than myself. And for me - after he left me this message, like a year ago, I called him back and we did get in a blowup about this. And I did say to him, "Oh, it's okay if Peter says I can come back? Then let me come to the door. Well, if it's okay with Peter I don't want to come back." And that's when we got into the big fight, and that's when we weren't talking with each other for a little bit again. [00:25:11]</p>

<p>But the fact of the matter is that he discussed it with Peter, who (pause) yeah, granted, he's been there as long as I have, he's done, he knew all the stuff, but to me, he's manipulative, Peter. (pause) Every person that they've hired to work in the kitchen hasn't lasted because of him. My aunt, my uncle, my cousin, they feel that their business can't survive without him, and when I try to tell him that everybody's replaceable, they think I'm attacking them. And I think it's frustrating and to the point where this kid is the first one to rat out anybody else, but when he gets in trouble when he does stuff, he'll lie and say it wasn't him. Because he wants, he has this perfect image under them. And it pisses me off. Because he does stuff, and he'll go and tell my uncle that I did it when it was him. [00:26:13]</p>

<p>And it's to the point too where I think they think he's more trustworthy because he was there for the whole time during the drug thing, and never said a word. He never said a word to them. He knew who was selling drugs. He knew who was using drugs and alcohol at the work site, and never said anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think he should have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. He could have prevented it. He could have prevented a lot of things. And I guess that's kind of where I resent him a little bit, is because after it came out, after we did get caught, after I was overdosed there, and the secret was out, was then I think he was talking. And telling them how untrustworthy we were, and this, that, and the other thing. What our sting was. But in essence, he knew everything that was going on. And he never said anything. Why is it that he waited for something to happen to say something? And then, when my aunt called my cousin, you know, look at him, he's Mr. Honesty. And he's the one doing everything. He can't do any wrong. [00:27:25]</p>

<p>And to me, that pisses me off. That frustrates me. (coughs) It frustrates me to the point where everything this kid says they believe is true, when half of his stuff is false. I mean, when someone is dictating his schedule, and his brother's schedule, "Well, I want to work but I don't want to work the busiest hours." And then they go, "Well, why don't we put it on Jordan? Why doesn't Jordan work the hours they don't want to work." And that's where my beef comes in, it's because this person says he needs this time off, why do I have to fill his hours? I wanted to say this to my cousin, is why is it that every employee at the end of the month has to give my cousin a calendar with the month on it when they're available to work. There's only three people who don't have to do it, and it's Peter, his brother Jeremy, and his brother Jonathan. Why is it that they don't have to give her a schedule? Why is it that they get prioritized over everybody? Why is it that nobody wants to work in the kitchen with them, and they can't hire any help in the kitchen? [00:28:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they don't want them there. Because right now they dictate everything that goes on in the kitchen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I guess I was asking why do you think your aunt and uncle give them so much power?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why they gave him so much power. To be honest, I have no idea why they gave him so much power. But they're, you know, they abuse their power. They dictate their schedules, they're the only people that - and we've gotten in this argument many times is, where they keep telling me that Peter and his brothers, they've worked so long, they've done so much, we owe them some time off. No, you don't. Because here's a group of people that complain when they work too much, so when you cut their hours and hire new people to take the slack off them, they bitch they're not working enough. Because you are cutting their hours, you're giving them more time off. So with them it's a lose-lose battle. It's a battle of, "Well, I want to work this many hours a week but I want to work these days." Oh, no. That's not how it should work. You're going to work this many hours, and that's what it's going to be. [00:30:02]</p>

<p>To me, to be honest, the only way to straighten that out was to hire four more new people full-time for the kitchen only, and then you have a rotating schedule. Those four boys, three boys, would not allow it to happen. Because every time they hired full-time people for the kitchen, they were improperly trained. They were harassed at work. And they didn't last, they quit. And they wonder why they have such high turnover rate in the kitchen, why nobody wants to work with these boys. Those three family members. And I pointed straight out to them. And that bothers me, (pause) to the point where I've expressed these concerns that why is it that these people are dictating their schedule and I can't even dictate a six-hour shift? [00:31:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I was thinking that you started today by talking about need and feeling so vulnerable, and you then shifted to sort of feeling outraged at the injustice of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I mean, it also is kind of pissing me off too, because every rule change they've made has been towards me. The "no-facial-hair" rule was because of me. But yet I go into work the other day and those brothers have beards, and goatees, and mustaches, but I can't have that. And they're too scared to say anything to them. It's kind of where I am... I just want to see change and I want to see them succeed, but also in a way, I don't agree with how they're running things. Because I do feel they're running their business into the ground by allowing three people to run their business, and not to run their business anyway. I say this all the time, is everybody's replaceable, and someday if they ever let me rent out the bar, the first people I would go after was the three boys. And I would tell them, "Hey, look, I need a commitment out of you. You're going to work this many hours a week, and I need you Friday, Saturday, Sunday, my busiest times of the week. If you can't make this commitment, the door's right there." Because they keep telling me that they need these boys for business to run. They need these boys, they need them, they need them, they need them. [00:32:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that they need you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. And that's been told to me. And I guess that's kind of what it is that I need out of them, is I need them to need me. I need them to help me. Not for nothing, for what those three boys do, me and my two brothers, myself, my two brothers, we could run that kitchen better than them. But then, the three brothers ran us out of there. They ran - and that's what pisses me off, is they let three strangers take over three family members. That's what pisses me off. That's where I think kind of the rage comes in. And the problems that I have with how they do business, how our business relationship is. It's non-existent, because you keep telling me one thing, and you're doing the total opposite. There's not a doubt in my mind that if me and my two brothers went in there, we could run their kitchen and have no problems. The food would be just as good, the food would come out just as fast. The problem is getting rid of those three boys. And until someone else takes over, it's never going to happen, and they're going to be dictated the whole time, and they're going to constantly be struggling for kitchen help. [00:34:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel like they're replacing you, they're replacing family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they did. There's not a doubt in my head, they already did. I mean, it took them twelve years to run everybody out of there. Because my brothers, my sister, my aunt, my own - you know, my aunt, my mother's sister who owns it, and my mother's other sister, helped them, and they ran her out of the business too. Which kind of frustrates me, is that they keep saying they want all of us family to be there and working, but yet they ran all of the family out of the business. And I don't understand that. I'm still trying to conceptualize that that happened, that they could treat a family member the way they've treated a family member. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>That bothers me, and there's no talking to them, because they look at it from the business side. And mentally, I'm cool with it, go ahead, do what you gotta do. But emotionally, I'm not. Emotionally, I'm - and that's where the problem is, because I was very close with them when I was younger. I used to always stay over at their house, I used to always do everything with them. They were really, really close to me, and I think that's part of what the emotion is that keeps me there. Because when I was a little kid, I felt needed. They wanted to hang out with me, they wanted to be with me. Now, they can't wait to get rid of me. And to me, that's hurtful. Granted, I have done a lot of things in the past, but I never did anything to hurt them, business-wise. All I did was I hurt myself, and I hurt our relationship, as well as they hurt my relationship with them. [00:36:14]</p>

<p>And that's what's bothersome to me, is the fact that throughout all my - perfect example is the drug overdose. My uncle blames my mother for me doing drugs, and my mother blames my uncle for me doing drugs at his place, when I was doing drugs everywhere. Nobody knew what was going on with me. Everybody's taking the blame, but nobody's blaming me. I was the one who chose to do the drugs. I was the one who was hanging out with your employees doing drugs at your establishment. I was the one selling drugs out of your establishment. I was the one selling drugs out of my parents' house. Not my uncle, not my mother, me. And everybody blamed everybody else but me. Nobody put the blame on me. And that's kind of where I was lost. It took me to overdose to finally get some help, that I had a problem. But me overdosing never really helped the problem. Because nobody really understood what the problem was. [00:37:29]</p>

<p>The problem was me. It wasn't them, it wasn't my mother, nobody was to blame for the drugs but me. I chose that. I knowingly chose that. I was the one who continued to do that. Not my uncle, not my mom, not my aunt or my cousin or my dad, my siblings. Me. And still to this day, there's been no accountability on me. I take full accountability, and I'm struggling to remind people of that. I told my uncle that when we had our conversation on Thursday or whenever it was, the last I worked, because he wanted to talk to me so bad, there was something he wanted to do so bad but I told him it was nothing that they did. It was nothing that they did. It wasn't about the money, it wasn't about the work. It was about me. And that's kind of what I want people to realize.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that because they don't hold you accountable that they don't take you seriously? [00:38:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's part of it. There's no way. Like I said to them, I know who's stealing from them. I expressed my concern on Saturday night when we went out for dinner. And they kind of looked at me like, "Yeah, okay." But they also kind of looked at me like, "Maybe he's right." You know what I mean? Maybe he's right, because they always seem to be losing money whenever she's working. I do see everything. I do know what's going on. I'm not a sneak. I used to be one of those guys who was a scumbag, who was looking for every advantage I could. It's like we talked about earlier, I do prey on weak people. I know the weak people. I know the people that have problems, that need something. Because I was one of those people. [00:39:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I was going to say, you feel that way so much of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel that way so much. And I'm the one who can relate to those people. I mean, I try to talk to them, because they're oblivious to what street life is like. Even though I'm no inner city kid, I'm a suburban rogue kid. But I've been through some hard times. I've been beat up over drugs. I have had people chase me over drugs. I've had people break into my dorm room looking for drugs. I have been held up looking for money because I was a drug dealer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At gunpoint?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at gunpoint. Knife.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Knifepoint? Did you ever feel in fear of your life? [00:40:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I did and I didn't. There was a point where I thought about taking my life, but I was too scared to. And to me, I thought I was inferior to any damage, anything that could possibly happen. Because I always had people on my side, people always took care of me. I guess that's how I grew up, because my dad was - I was always giving, giving, giving, and not really taking. I used to have a lot of people protect me, and there was this one time where somebody just broke into my room in the middle of the night. They took all my stuff and I was cool with it. I didn't even put up a fight, because I knew I could get more. And then not for nothing, let's just say that kid didn't last for very long because I knew who he was and he was one of my regulars. And the people that I took care of took care of him. It's just one of those things where I'm not proud of what I did, I did what I did, but I learned a lot doing what I did. [00:41:28]</p>

<p>I do say this all the time, that's why I fear for weak people because in essence I was weak, because I was very weak when it came to drugs. I was very weak when it came to prescription pills and stuff like that, because like I mentioned last week, that was my closure. They never fought back. They never treated me like shit. They never abandoned me. They always wanted me. They always needed me. And that's kind of like where I got my comfort from, was doing the drugs. And I did get comfort from selling the drugs, because I knew those addicts needed me. I knew they'd be coming back to see me, because I had something they wanted. And for me now that I'm older, now I'm looking for that myself. I'm looking for someone to need me, I'm looking for someone to have what it is that I want. And I want to be able to go to them and go get it. [00:42:41]</p>

<p>But right now, they have what I want, but I don't know what it is, and I don't know how to get it. And for me, the best part is to just walk away. But there's always that thing pulling me, saying, "Where are you going? Come back over here. There's unfinished business." And I don't know what it is. And it's bothersome to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you can't close the door because something just keeps knocking on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I agree. And it's (pause) the curiosity in me, it's the unfinished part of me - I have no idea what it is. But I would like to just close that chapter and move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It almost seems like need is kind of a hot potato. Like when you feel you need, it makes you feel so vulnerable and powerless, and so it feels more empowering when you feel other people need you. [00:43:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you could say that. You could definitely say that. I do get a high off of people needing me. I do, actually. I guess that's kind of why I'm going into the field that I'm going in, because I do feel really good about myself when I can help someone. I mean, especially now at school when I'm helping kids. To me, kids look up to me, kids need me, and I guess they're looking at me for guidance, for help on stuff, for just anything, and they feel that they can talk to me. And if I can help provide them answers and solutions to what they need, it gives me that high. And I think that's what's comforting about what I'm doing now, is because I'm finally in a position where I can do something and it's right, where before I was doing something, but it wasn't. I mean, to me at the time it was right, but looking back on it, it was very wrong. And I guess this is how I deal with my needy personality or whatever, is because when people come to me and ask me questions and I can help them out, and I do help them out in a way that they feel satisfied it makes me feel good. And that's the best thing that I can say about this career change that I'm making, is that I do like helping people who are in need, I do like working with needy people mainly because I'm in so much need. And with me being in the need that I need, I don't know if I can get enough of it. [00:45:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enough of what you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Enough of what I need. (pause) I mean, there's always something that I need but I never know exactly what that need is. It's the same at the bar. There's a need there but I don't know what it is. There's a need for my parents, and I'm starting to get that need with the closure, with the support that I'm getting. There's a need with my girlfriend, where I want to be with her forever. I want to do things right, I don't know what it is that I need to do to get there. I don't know what steps to take to make all this happen. Everywhere I turn there's something else that I need, and to me it's just frustrating because there's just too much that I need, and I can't get it all at once. And that's where the control issue comes in. Because being in control, I could control all those needs, and I could usually get them when I wanted them. Now, I have to go looking for them. I can't control them, I have to let things play out. I can't dictate what's going on. I can't be in charge of how conversations are going to go or how situations are going to go. That control, that power in me is gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're not sure what to do about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, Jordan, we need to stop for today. So I'll see you next week. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care. Oh, thank you very much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nice seeing you. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have a good one.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, you know, I'm divorced recently but was five years separated. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Oh, how long were you married before the five-year separation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Six.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so that's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you've been 11 years technically married with him, but in the last five years you've been separated and now legally divorced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  Also, and the two children involved who are not my children biologically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean from your husband's first marriage? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where are they now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they-- I wanted them to stay with me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Did you adopt them legally, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh, so they're legally... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because it never occurred to me that what happen would (inaudible 00:05:56) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yeah. But does, does he have the custody then of the two children?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And does he live in New York?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm not from New York either. I am... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... from Washington and we both live in the area. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And, and are you seeing the children? Do you have any visiting rights and so on? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The arrangement we made and that's held generally  was that I would see the children two evenings a week and all day Saturday and some other special times that was arranged and that's held with no difficulty.  But, uh, and, and another thing that's important I think is that my husband was widowed when one child was a day old. The mother died I think because of leukemia and the children were two and three years old. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now they're about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're now twelve and thirteen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, boys or girls?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The boy is 13 and the girl is 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the problem is uhm, the divo-- the separation went through many stages because it began with my going into therapy because of the dissatisfaction I felt at that time with myself and particularly with the kind of mother-- I thought I was to the children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought you were a poor mother to these children? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because what were you doing that was so bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I felt that I was repeating many things that I felt had been errors in my mother's rearing. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which you had sort of resolved not to do, but then you were doing it ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then in my great effort... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ... to not do these things that I found myself doing them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also was encountering things in my children that I felt I didn't like and was causing (inaudible 00:07:43).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the time I went to therapy, I don't-- I know, I didn't think it was the marriage that was at fault, I felt (inaudible 00:07:54) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, then during therapy other things came out and finally I, I decided that-- and as I began bringing these things up to my husband, our relationship began deteriorating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you mean he wasn't the greatest father in the world and things like that (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And uhm, also it was very difficult to discuss with him things that, I felt were wrong. He was very hostile about anything. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he was quite defensive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the hostility reached the point that there was continual bickering and shouting and finally things got to the point where, to me, they were untenable. And, and I really thought that they weren't going to change and I also couldn't any longer take the kind of hostility  I was getting from my husband. And so I think, I at first I thought it was a temporary thing, I thought it just had to stop, I could only see it's getting worse, worse, worse and nothing being resolved. Maybe my leaving would stop it. And at my first-- when we first talked of this I said, "I wish you would leave, Harry because-- then, uhm, it could just go on this way because as it was, he was seeing very little of the children, he was self-employed. And he saw the children maybe a half hour or 45 minutes at bedtime. But it also began to occur to me that it was possible for him to see the children more than he was seeing them, that he didn't realize (indistinct sound)  he was arranging it this way. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That in fact he wanted to see me, not the children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And wanted a small amount of involvement with the children. He wanted his emotional involvement to be with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you guilty about that, that he wanted to see you more than the children?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I was resentful... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I see... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: because... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... he should have wanted to see the children more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because this was another thing that was happening that was a repetition of my family's situation. All of us in my family-- there are four children very close to my mother and were very distant from my father and then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who didn't want to see you that much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also was jealous of us very much. He wanted my mother exclusively (inaudible 00:10:08). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so once again I was in... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were following the pattern of your own family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, he said "No" because he did not want the separation. And then when it was first discussed he said yes, I could take the children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then as things went along, he said, "No, I could not."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because? Why did he finally take the children?  Did he really want them or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... what would the neighbors think if he didn't take them or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't think it was clear. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was mixed but I think part of it was that it was all he had left of another marriage and another relationship, so that it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and then he still had some bond with his ex-wife who died?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He, he told me that he felt he had married quite early to this other woman and then it had been a number of years until they were able to have children involved, and that he said he felt that he was much more involved in the marriage with me because he has married quite early and he had seen his wife who was really more eager to marry than he was, but that to the degree that he had been able to love her, he had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now, in the meantime, despite the fact that you thought you were treating those children badly, were you quite attached to them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. (crosstalk) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So-- and did you feel it was daunting by the fact that he finally took the children when he first said that you could have them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I also felt that his-- at the time, I felt how dare he for doing this, not that he wanted the children, but he thought this would keep me from leaving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. So he was blackmailing you by saying that if you leave me, I will take the children?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now, all of these happened five years ago because you separated and for the last five years you've seen the children (indistinct sound), uh, as a, uh, visitor, sort of? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he is ready. Does he have a housekeeper?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Uh, when I left, there was, uh, a woman whose child had been in our baby sitter... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... who lived in an apartment in New York and I went and told her I was leaving. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And after, if she would consider taking care of them after school because I really may be... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... a competent person.  (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she agreed to do this.  (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she had done so all the time (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And on weekends or so, sort of, taking care (inaudible 00:12:26)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. On Saturday, I'm there. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it. </p>

<p>CLIENT:  And there's only their father is there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:12:33)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:12:34) right? Now have they gotten along well okay with this arrangement when they started?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, seemingly they have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... outwardly, people tell me they think that they're-- seem like very healthy children. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  What they told me the damage is, you know, I, I think probably I'm too close to evaluate (inaudible 00:12:51). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But now, why are you disturbed right now? Here it was Friday. It's late and the children seemingly have gotten along, you still don't want to go back to your husband do you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, then what are you upset about then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I'm upset about is myself and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that is that I don't really want to go back to live with my husband. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, I don't really think in order to get involved with somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, have you tried during the last five years, have you gone with men?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't gotten out of my way to meet men, but when I have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... met them, I have gone out, not a lot, but sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just haven't gotten involved with anybody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some degree, I did, but one correct (inaudible 00:13:32) and with also somebody that I really knew at the beginning, I was never afraid to get more of (inaudible 00:13:37) involved and this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Uh, now, but you weren't avoiding men you could get involved with, is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just happen to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... partly, it's, it's, uhm, the nature of my accounting. I work full time. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see the children and I go to school. I don't know why I should (inaudible 00:13:52) (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. And do you meet in the course of work and school any amount of eligible males at the right age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. My age is not a problem. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm 39.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, and the problem when you're at school? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:14:02) I, I don't do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I mean, I'm the graduate (inaudible 00:14:07). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:14:08).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the men you're meeting at school, the younger... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... are younger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so that's how-- right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:   I said the teachers. How about the teacher? (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were women who (inaudible 00:14:18).  (laughing) (crosstalk) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:14:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Women who (inaudible 10:14:20). I'm not really a big fan to them (inaudible 00:14:22) ambition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean that, uh, you know, in college level, a lot of teachers are males, is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but many-- I've got a class and (inaudible 00:14:30) class and I ended up meeting him. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. And so one of the reasons is that you haven't met any number of males in the last five years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but I also have as you would say, do you want to introduce me. That, and I really haven't gone out of my way either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that there is still-- and I think that this is also encouraged by the children. In other words, the children, although they know we're separated and all the... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...(inaudible 14:58:00) but still, it seems to me, think of us as married people...  (crosstalk)</p> 

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, because there is (inaudible 00:15:05)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, for five years in the age of 12 and 13, you'd think they'd be getting the idea that did not exactly-- the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but the thing is, our relationship was consummated at age 2. First of all, my husband, after I left, went into therapy himself. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there have been changes in him. And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the better we hope. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:15:29) Yeah. Okay. (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... definitely do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, when you say, therefore, that as against five years ago when you left him, separated, that you're getting on better with him or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now, how does he really see you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I see him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:15:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not, not like in terms of time. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On Saturdays, for example, when you are there, is he there or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is he working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And on Sunday, he's there and you're not there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but, uhm, the amount of time varies. For instance, he may come home earlier... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... than the time... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that he generally does. And I would, I would say that I see him probably two or three or maybe four hours total... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And do you have sex relations with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? So it's just a matter of getting along with the guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, therefore, you're in doubt whether you should try-- does he still wanna get back with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. At first, he did... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah..</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but, I think that, uhm, I think at, at this point, he's more separated from me than he ever has been before he went ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, we have to know whether he has another girl?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That he's pretty busy shows not likely that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He doesn't have (inaudible 00:16:47) of time. No.  (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He is home in the evening... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and he's home on Sundays and Saturday he works?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:16:57).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know he does-- I know he does have, uh, still a great (indistinct sound) involved with me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So because you haven't found anybody yet, and because he's still theoretically available and because you're getting along better with him, you sometimes wonder whether you shouldn't try to go back and live with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think so. And I also think that...(crosstalk)</p> 

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:17:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I think that sometimes I wish to-- that he would openly either marry or get involved with somebody else... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that would (inaudible 00:17:27)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I don't know to what degree. It's because I-- just that late and came back the door (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or whether I really am involved with him more than I realize. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. In other words, it might be either A, be involved with, with him or B, your own fear of getting involved? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And have you got any indication from him what he would really like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, uh, there had been times, many times where he's come home with the children have been in bed and  we've had coffee and talk... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and talk for a long period of time. And he told me things that-- saying that he cares for me very much, but he didn't really know whether they had brought us together again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because? Did he give any cause?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think, uhm, feeling that even though we have both learned something we can change somewhat, we're still basically quite the same. We're still basically quite neurotic, and that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you rejected him, but didn't he originally... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, yes, and I think he also recognizes that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that-- and the difficult thing we have to (inaudible 00:18:39) and that, in a sense, I might always be paying for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Further rejection?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he might not want to take you back but then punish you for rejecting him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, was it not for the (inaudible 00:18:51), you knew I can think of get rejected, and you...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:18:54)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... back to live with him a few weeks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is another matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, have you ever considered either of you just tried to live together for the moment, uh, without getting married just to see what it is like? "Cause you haven't lived together for five years now. Now have you considered either in that house for those of (inaudible 00:19:12) together or going off for a few weeks on a vacation and trying together just to see how you do get along?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think, uh, here, we're getting to think about the children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The children would know that you're together and then they... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... they feel sad again if you left?(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I won't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's why I suggested what you could do theoretically is, uh, put the children with somebody like a woman around there, someone who could take care of them for a few weeks or send them to camp; they're 12 and 13 and so on, and bound you either if perhaps they were at camp, either in that house or elsewhere go off and try it for a weeks. You both get a vacations? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...  so it would be feasible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 00:19:55)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now why not consider something like that? So the two won't know 'cause they can't-- they know now, "Great, mommy and daddy are together again," and then a few weeks later that you're apart again, which will be a little rough... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... on them. So I agree that might not be a good idea to let them know. But if they didn't know what you could arrange, why don't you experiment on that kind of a basis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet, uhm, I don't know how measured off these things are, but it seems to me if I do, uh, (inaudible 00:20:26) like you're-- rather than bother children...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:20:29).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or anything... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that, uhm, I behave so differently now with him. I think I had an attitude that was too indulgent and then realistic at one point. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you let it get away there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it seems to me that the least little thing... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that annoys me ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or a difference in opinion, I think to myself as I'm putting on my coat, "Well, thanks God I'm not married to him and walk out the door and go off to my own apartment. (inaudible 00:20:58) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:20:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (inaudible 00:20:59) when it ended.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you get hostile at him when needed? Well, why do you have to get hostile?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think there's initially a disagreement. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he is still very short tempered. And usually, he will become angry with me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but then usually it's at that point that I would back off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, but backing off is one thing and getting hostile is another. Now, why can't you back off by saying, "Look, (inaudible 00:21:24) that he's still short-tempered?" (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I do that too. I don't always get angry with him. Sometimes, I'll just say, "Well, okay. We'll discuss it another time." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something anyway... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But most of the time, how do you feel when he gets hostile at you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just think, well, there it is, you know. Is that really what you want? Is that any... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't get so upset most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean after... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What they would... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... being with him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean feeling, you know, I mean go and kick him in the balls or anything that mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel that, uh, I'm very glad that I'm not married to him or that I feel that because of this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in addition to that, which is perfectly (inaudible 00:22:02) a deal also (inaudible 00:22:04). Hurts, upset, angry or anything like that, usually when he acts short-temperedly to you and is a result of one of these quarrel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the feeling I had then is that it's impossible that we really can't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...  relate to one another. (inaudible 00:22:19). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that may be so but that, that may be an objective, feeling that a, a good chance you can't relate. That I feel what you feel more that, that if you really do get upset. And as long as you're gonna get upset by his getting short-tempered and as long as he's short-tempered despite his therapy is gone, it won't work out. Now, why can't you get to the point where you don't get upset when he gets short-tempered? You just feel, as you've said before, okay, he's still pretty nutty. Who needs it? It's good I'm not living with him. Period.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was my reaction at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the other times, a lot of times you were implying it's not. You really get a feel, and I don't think (inaudible 00:22:57) foaming at the mouth or anything, but fear, hurt, upset and then go, etcetera, is that correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think what I think I feel is that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

 <p>CLIENT: ... I'm not married anymore, but I might as well be married because I'm getting the same kinds of reactions with him as I did when I was married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, but, but only saying if he's the same person he was. And that, that he hasn't changed that much. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:23:24).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I, I don't think I also resent having to be involved when I'm supposedly not married anymore. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, but the reason you're involved is largely because of the children. Now you have picked this advantage. You're not even the mother of these children technically. Sociologically, you're the mother and you feel like the mother and you have elected to be with these children twice a week and again on Saturday, two weekday nights on Saturday and you maintain a good emotional relationship, which I gather you have with the children, and that's satisfying to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, you were saying I elected this and goddamnit it, I shouldn't have the disadvantage of this short-tempered son of a bitch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my feelings with him. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Only shouldn't you have the disadvantage without advantages. Why should he not be the way he is, not why would he loved me if he weren't, but why shouldn't he be? But that's what you're thinking when you're resentful, aren't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now, why shouldn't he be exactly the way he is? A little better than he was, but still basically in denial (inaudible 00:24:26). (Laughter) I can see there isn't any reason. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  And yet, you're demanding, and as long as you're demanding like that, it's pretty obvious that you better not go back with him yet. Isn't that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, why can't you-- like you were demanding this, in which case, incidentally, maybe he wouldn't even act, feel better. Then obviously, he can see you're getting upset. So, he's says to himself, "Shit. There she goes again just as if we were married." (laughs) (inaudible 00:24:58) you're not married.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would I wanna have this when I'm not even married to that bitch? (inaudible 00:25:06)Well, you're both saying (inaudible 00:25:07)things. Now, you really could not feel upset, I don't mean give up that and (inaudible 00:25:12) it, and not (inaudible 00:25:14) that could feel. Isn't it too bad that he is they way he is? Now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also. It seems to be many times when I'm with Harry, I am feeling one way and acting another. And that-- and I don't really like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now which way do you feel and which way do you act?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In other words, I'm with him many times and he would say was either to that. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I-- and instead of telling him how I feel... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I, I talk through that but before I do it, I catch myself and say, "Oh well, you just didn't know because, well, so forget it. And then I don't react... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't show him your feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't react so that he knows I'm reacting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If-- right. Because you're afraid to react and just take it (inaudible 00:25:56)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because it seems to me I know why he's doing it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that sooner or later, he's not gonna do it or he's gonna see why he's doing it and that (inaudible 00:26:07)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm afraid to do it, afraid you're take it a little too magical. I think it would be wiser if you said it to yourself, "Look, I know why he's doing it and maybe sooner or later he won't do it, but maybe he won't (inaudible 00:26:14). Now why do I have to upset myself underneath, not overtly, but underneath, because he's doing what he's doing?" And I still think your feeling encroaching, feeling resentment larger than they have been discussing it, rather, you're getting to the point where you really don't feel resentful by sort of 100 percent or 90 percent or 80 percent, at least, accepting truly the fact the he is what he is, tough, even if he's always this way. That's too bad. But it doesn't mean anything about me and it doesn't mean that he should be otherwise. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're not really doing that, and incidentally, it seems to me that you're hanging yourself up on this hope, that with enough therapy and enough this and enough that, he will change and everything will be hunky-dory and you are pushing away your involvement with other men because you sort of think, you'll be saying to yourself that if I let myself get hung up on another guy and really leave him, go off and marry, even if I see the children, maybe all day long that magical day will arrive when he is washed clean and what a horrible mistake I will have made. So I better not chance it while the years are passing. Is that, isn't that obviously what you're doing? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT:  I think, I think uh, some of it is that it's the way I would like, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: to add that would... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, but aren't you saying that if you don't end the way I would like it to end this especially if made a mistake, that would be awfull. Aren't you afraid of picking the wrong one? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (indistinct sound) I don't really know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I'm really... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Incidentally, you know, why are you crying now? Why, what, what just got to you right at this moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I really-- just having a real relationship with him I'm not so sure why I haven't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one of the reasons is that you're not trying very hard to have it elsewhere. You're still having hope spring eternal. It should be over here because it would be lovely, because we have the children and so on. Why should I risk it elsewhere?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and another thing is that that the amount of involvement I did have with another person, you know, I found myself very guilty about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, because I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was wrong with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I thought-- at the time I was not divorced, I was separated or legally separated... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I felt that I wasn't divorced. I really had no reason. No... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why (inaudible 00:28:51) it off?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I think the children take it lightly (coughs), but still... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but now-- but whom thought the children to take a (inaudible 00:28:58)? That because you weren't divorced, you had no right to go and have a relationship. How did children get so moralistic, if they are, let's assume they are, how did they get so moralistic about marriage and divorce... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and relationships. Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... well, and if, and then you go-- I have to deal with this and them too that may still-- another thing is... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the divorce just became final at the end of January. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did they know about it? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the time we were separated, Harry told me that it was up to me to tell them we were separating, and I did.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he also told me that he wanted to tell them about the divorce. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, very well (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He hasn't done so yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When did it become final, in January?(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The end of January.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he's dilly-dallying? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because, why do you think he's dilly-dallying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I asked him several times and he said, uhm, "It, it hasn't been the right time for him and what is the big hurry? It doesn't matter." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he's probably (inaudible 00:29:55) out. He figures one of these days, somehow, easily he'll be able to tell them.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but are you resenting that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you know, I think that if it is a fact, well, then they should know.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think you're saying because it would be better for him to do it, he should-- still condemning him for not doing the right thing, assuming it wouldn't be the right thing? Isn't that so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why...</p> 

<p>CLIENT: And then I also think this would be easier for me. And I wondered if they really... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... finally that we're divorced... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then the (inaudible 00:30:32)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (inaudible 00:30:32) ...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that is when you and daddy get back together again and it's not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if go with another man, you'll be able to do it guiltlessly because your own children won't resent you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it means that you are too condemnable. You really are condemning you and accepting that kind of thing. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And again, it seems to me that you're not teaching those children how not to condemn people for not doing the right thing. You're going along for their ride. Yes dears. If you're (inaudible 00:31:00) if I not technically divorced go out and have an affair with another man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's more than that. I cannot openly them it is a fact. Your father and I are not going to get together again. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if I do, they will condemn me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What(ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Simply that I, I guess can't risk ending this for them... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not because they... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... if that's what they wanted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't deprive them even though that'll give me freedom to go out and be... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right now, aren't you leaning over a little too broad to protect them and aren't you trying to teach them inferentially that they must have what they want? It's plausible for them not to have what they want. They'll never be able to survive without him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes, but I also think I feel very guilty about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't that what you're saying? Why you were out that you, you didn't get along with this man in six years of marriage but now in five years of separation, you still don't get along with him that well even though you don't see him that much. Now, why is that a horrible failure?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not one needs it. But it was also my second marriage, I'm not failing the fourth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right so you, you knocked off two (inaudible 00:00:33) in a rock. ( audience laughing) Now-- and isn't that awful, so that proves you must be no good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess (audience laughing).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because what should you have done in those marriages?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. Isn't that normal enough?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who is deliriously happily married, to your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, then why should you be like her? How, how has her marriage gone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but I don't do-- I don't condemn people (indistinct sound) about divorces, but on the other hand I don't admire them either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you condemned you, if you don't make that special success that a woman should... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not the image I like to have... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. That you demand the image you'd like to have. You are demanding that I be the kind of woman who picks the right man in the first place and succeed nobly with them even though I picked the wrong one... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not very nice. (audience laughing) (inaudible 00:01:23). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:01:23)Well, with that kind of a demand you're bound to beat yourself and I think that's your problem that you make these unrealistic demands on yourself. And then when the children make their unrealistic demands, and they really are unrealistic at that for five years, they haven't got used to the fact that you're not living with him and you're probably not going back to their father. You go along with their unrealistic demands 'coz they're really yours. And that's why you're not teaching them to be realistic and to accept the hard facts of life. See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're being perfectionistic about you in allowing their perfectionism to affect you. And unless you denounce that their perfectionism, you'll carry it around and beat yourself and I'm sure you could find so many things that you were imperfect for, including and especially right now, this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think-- I didn't realize that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have to counter your perfectionism, and how could you do that? What could you do to counter your perfectionism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:02:37) I can't answer to that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the answer is simple. This is probably why you can't answer it. You have to ask, "Why do I have to be so goddamn perfect?" That's such a great image of why can't I be me with my imperfection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that you mentioned really-- I do think, generally, I have very good relationship with my children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And have been told by other people with the opinion, opinion of respecting that; the kids are easy with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my son took something that he went long ago, and it, it, has hurt me very much. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was-- eluding I wanted him to do, and he, he has to do it, and he's 13 and he didn't do anything. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More than he... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that is a fairly common perfectionism, it's not a big thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this particular thing, I have no idea. I don't even know what it was because my reaction was to what he said to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what did he say to you? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "Well, it's important to me that you do this." And he said, "Well, we can't all be perfect like you." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "I never said I was perfect," and he said, "Oh, yes! You're the one who works all the time, and you don't believe in any play at all. And you're the one who thinks everybody has to be perfect." (indistinct sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Don't you think there's some truth to what he said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Upset me terribly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But don't you get that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't think I had given him the dealing with. I thought I was a perfect partner, but evidently I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right, and, and I don't know how you gave it to him, whether it's the demands about yourself or your demands about him, the system. But it seems to me from the moment you said, here, "that I get the feeling that you definitely know what the right thing is and if you don't do that, that image isn't great, that is awful and you're awful. And if that's perfectionism, and I think they've seen it from you, and incidentally, it means that they're gonna start internalizing it about themselves. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Why-- I do know why it's that is being so... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Partly, and that is that my mother... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I came from a small town, and my mother had this--  she was the only person in the world of this small town, which is my world for many years. I absolutely never hear anyone say an unkind word about. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She must have led an awfully dull life. (audience laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it was a very strange thing. Now, I constantly know this morally wonderfully woman and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that's a wonderful woman. She is a very lucky girl to have, such a wonderful... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... until I really began feeling terribly guilty because I suddenly moved. The last thing I wanted to be in the world was a wonderful woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know? (audience laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet, I had to learn to reflect... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because my mother had picked me to be a wonderful woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And who else has picked you to be wonderful woman? Won't tell us (audience laughing)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... is that right? Haven't you really, you, you got conflict there: A. I don't wanna be like my mother and have everybody think I'm a wonderful woman and sell my soul, you better run, but I really do wanna be a wonderful woman too. And I don't wanna harm my children or really break-up a marriage or go out and have a third marriage, which wonderful women never do (audience laughing). That's, that's what I need to think. So, I think you really have the, the image that your mother had except your mother worked her ass off to get it, to maintain it and got it and probably, as I said, sold her soul, and you see on some level that it's not exactly the best thing to do and still, you want that image. You want the best of two possible worlds, being yourself and having that wonderful image.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my conflict was always-- whenever I depart from that place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You beat yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your children are blaming you or your husband's blaming you is not the issue. It's you blaming you. But let's have question and discussion.</p>

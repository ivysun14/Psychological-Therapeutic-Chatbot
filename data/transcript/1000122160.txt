<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 15.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I had [something I wanted to mention] (ph) before we started. I — my supervisor for my research has decided that it wouldn't be a good idea for me to play this summer because there's some stuff — you have to be done by September, [so my schedule] (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you got to start working?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I started Friday as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). (Coughs).</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as what happened this weekend, I was going to meet all sorts of new people and I did really. I saw one guy that I knew from high school, you know, haven't seen him in years. And then I saw some people — well, I saw one — I met some people yesterday, but they weren't people that I was going to meet (inaudible). Great time. But it was a nice relaxing weekend, but I didn't interact much, so it didn't matter. However, I think I got something figured out. You know, I was sort of into this — what we're doing here — [0:01:04.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I began think why I'm into it, and it's sort of all pieces together very easily now. Of course, then again, by the end of this interview or maybe next time it will be different — but anyhow, the way it looks right now is that it wasn't really bothering me that I was making myself feel bad at any encounters. I was only feeling bad because I'd — well, yeah, it made me feel bad, but the reason it made me feel bad is not because I was being dishonest and it wasn't the true me showing through, but because the other people thought I was an ass. You know, if I was acting like an ass and they thought I was an ass; that made me feel bad. If I was acting like an ass and they didn't think so, that was all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's what they think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I didn't come here for me, I came here for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [0:01:50.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now if that is indeed the case, then it's perfectly clear that this is just another hurdle, another thing that I wanted to do. See, I have this superego that tells me that I can do anything, and one of the things that I think I can do is interact well with other people. And so I found myself not doing just that, and consequently I really — I decided that I — this is the only way I could do it — you know, I could correct that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To correct learning how to interact with other people well?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And not for any honesty purposes or anything like that, but because I didn't come off good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Coughs). Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought I was — I should have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So therefore — well, I guess I haven't been approaching it wrong. I just say — I just haven't realized why [I've been] (ph) approaching it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [That's what it boils down to] (ph). But that's sort of the macro/micro thing you were talking about last time. It sort of fits together now that this is just another part of the whole thing. I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That this is another — [0:03:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Another — this is another — well, rather than miss being something — rather than miss being something deeper and more meaning than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather it's just another manifestation of a conceit in me that I can feel I can do anything, and one of the things I think I can do is interact with people and have them come away from the interaction pleased with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So trying to get better at interacting with people is just really kind of evidence of being conceited (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, you see — you see, formerly, it seemed to me as though — well, when I came — well, our initial — you know, Interview 7 through 8, 9, 10 or 11, something like that, whatever it was — it was all this big thing about I wasn't being honest with myself and wasn't projecting my true self, and I think now I could really give a damn about doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. You really don't care about that now. [0:03:56.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think not. I think it was — it's more a matter of interacting in such a way that would please other people, and when I came away from new people, from new encounters feeling bad, I've been telling myself — through everything prior to Interview 15 — that it was because I wasn't being honest, but really it was because I didn't come off well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Really that was the source of why you felt bad about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now had I come off well, it would have been okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I didn't come off well, so therefore this is not like a new reorient — it hasn't been up till now — a new reorientation of an entire me, but rather, it fits very neatly into me that is here already, and it's just another thing that I wanted to do to make myself pleasing to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it all seems very (inaudible), so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you disappointed (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't decided about that. I'm just kind of pleased with the fact that I came up with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you just [thought of this] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Okay, now am I disappointed? Let's see — let's see if I can be disappointed about it. [0:05:03.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See if you can be disappointed about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's comforting to see things fit together because if things fit together, it's easy to figure out what is happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I haven't decided whether that's a bad thing or not. I think we've probably been through this before, but it hasn't really fit in as well. Yeah, I think — you see what — initially we were always talking about I wanted to — but what I didn't like about myself was interacting so other people — you know, with other people's image of me, when actually my whole purpose in coming here was to interact — well, let's go back a few sentences. My — formerly when we were talking about it I would be — I would say — well, "I only confront people with the image they want to see of me and this is bad," right? [0:06:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I don't — I was bad at giving the image to those people, the image that I did want — do want to see and I botched it, so I came in here to help me from botching it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get you to do it better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or even to change the approach in some way. See if I wasn't good at acting, then I'd have to find that out here and find out that I can't act, and it made me realize that I'm not going to please someone, I'm not going to interact or — come up with some other conclusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. Or get good at acting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So therefore I guess I — well, as I say, I'm comforted that it fits.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. To see this as another hurdle — I mean is a nice way —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be able to put it all together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, rather than figuring as — well, my life lies outside this room and we're sort of analyzing it from in here and figure everything out, rather this is indeed a part of the whole thing. [0:07:08.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just the fact that I came here is something we can discuss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It puts it more together with the rest of your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. It's — I think I really meant — well, I don't know. I guess honesty to me is sort of a vague and ill-defined term because I've been so dishonest so many times, but I think really to me when I initially came in here, it was that the — the feeling that I was being dishonest with other people and that bothered me, but now, I think that really my whole purpose in coming here was to become good at being dishonest rather than stop.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it seems to you now that you thought you were coming here for one reason, but really you were coming here for the other reason? [0:08:03.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's hard to say. I mean it's been a while and my head has been really twisted since I started telling you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's hard to remember back exactly how I felt initially. But — yeah, I don't think my motives were what I made them out to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now the question is what are — what are the alternatives? I mean how do I approach the thing now that I can look at it in a new light? I don't know if this is new light No. 36 in the conversation and there's going to be No. 37, it's going to throw it out the window, but I have to go with what I have now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems reasonable to assume that a person of 25 years old cannot change much of his really deep life — I mean, you know? What really matters to him. I think it is reasonable though that a person who is my age can begin to realize more and more his motives for why he does things, and live with them better. [0:09:22.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But is —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) terms of the way you are (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But — so I think rather than trying to — yeah, I should realize why I act the way I do, I should be pleased with it — somewhat. If I'm not, I mean I've got another 50 years of — however — what the life — maybe five minutes — but I could be miserable if I don't — because I think it's very hard to change a lifestyle completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're — one of the things you're trying to (inaudible at 0:10:01.1) is how much can I change my lifestyle, and how much do I want to go the way of accepting the way it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if — the first question is not how much I want to accept it and how much I want to change, but what are the real alternatives?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much can I?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, how much can I change?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and a feeling that you really can't change much below a certain level.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I think this last little that I've come up with this realization that this just fits in rather than fits out, I mean our — what we're doing here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just reaffirms the belief that my behavior patterns in my approach — my outlook is pretty much ingrained and hard to change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) it seems yeah, but this shows that you can't really change it below a certain level, (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that doesn't mean of course that I can't be healthier by looking at it in the right way and realizing what it is, which is now I think probably the best thing that I can do. [0:11:10.8]</p>

<p>So — so just to realize that I'm going to behave in that particular manner, and I'm going to always be cognizant of what other people think of me, either consciously or subconsciously and to live with that, and to try to decide what is a healthy way for me to act with that attitude, and try to decide what is the way that's going to be most comfortable for me and for other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's the task at hand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think the task at hand is to change any motivations or you know, deep feelings (inaudible) my life because I don't think it can be done. [0:12:09.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. The task at hand is to sort of work with how you are basically and accept that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a couple of really good examples, this — the people I was with yesterday, and I know a couple of them and know a little bit the other people — and they aren't really much like me at all, but I sort of fit into that (inaudible at 0:12:33.6) and was getting along pretty well. I don't think I ever had to come out and really lie, I just avoided any discussions that would make my true feelings come up. They were fascist rednecks is what they were, but you know, I just tried to avoid — you know, we talked about the Cubs instead of about the politics which is — can be done. But I think that just — that was just an example and now when I have time to that are how I interacted, but I still do this sort of dishonest interaction with people because you know, my true feelings didn't come out. They did know what my inclinations were. [0:13:17.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You still do the dishonest. It's the way you're saying, "I haven't really change."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's just another —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must be like you think, "I've been fooling myself all the time. Here I thought I was really doing something meaningful."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I was fooling myself, I just — I'm most amazed at my ignorance of not seeing how this fits.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. It seems so clear now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it seems — well, you see, the thing is you can keep taking a step backwards and looking at everything that has transpired, and then that will all fit together. But when I first came in here I was taking a step backwards of everything outside of these doors — of this door. [0:14:07.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not what was inside (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not — well, not — why was this happening. I mean why are we — why am I discussing this? Why are — why, you know? But now, rather than doing that, now I sort of sit back and say, "Well, let's look at everything," and now this fits in. And the fact that this fits in lends new light onto everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything outside the door and within in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. It changes the nature when you look at the whole thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to a certain extent it — yeah, it — more — well, it shows me that it's really hard to change a person deeply.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You mean it's discouraging in that sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if discouraging or encouraging are good words to hang onto it because see, I don't know enough about it. I don't know enough about why anyone acts the way they do, much less myself. And I look at it more as an observation rather than — you know? [0:15:14.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. Like a new fact you learned —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About how you operate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Operate is a good — yes — good word in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, and how — it's like seeing something about yourself that you just didn't see before. How difficult it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now see, the thing is, maybe next time I come in and we'll go back another step and I'll say, "Wow, look what happened last time," and I'll analyze what's happening this time, and that will all fit in, and then we'll just have to have an infinite number of sessions, but unfortunately that's not the — well, fortunately or unfortunately, I'm not sure which — that's not the case. But I think I'm pretty much back all the way now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. I think you got a pretty good understanding of (crosstalk). [0:16:02.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think — yeah. I think the last thing that I could have looked at was us, what transpires here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I've looked at that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't think there's anything that I've left out of any consequence, at least I've tried to make that effort, and I've made that effort honestly because this is an honest effort for me to please other people. I mean it's just another hurdle. See, it was the thing I found in my life that I didn't like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want — I wanted to show people that I was accomplished in human relations too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just another accomplishment that I was driven to achieve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, are you feeling more subdued in the way you're approaching it today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if subdued is the right word. I think I really (inaudible) [more comfortable] (ph). [0:17:05.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoy the order of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The fact that it fits in is very pleasing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the thing — I don't know, things — I think it would — that line has been said before, but at different levels of fitting — fitting these together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think this is — makes things fairly complete.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. And that feels good to have the complete.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. And now that it's — you know, at this stage relatively complete and motivations are clear that it's a good point you know, to sort of say, "Well now, what does one do?" That — that hasn't quite — that hasn't gotten square in my mind yet. I'm really sort of pleased with figuring it out. [0:18:02.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>PATIENT: What was I going to mention? Oh yeah, I just — I don't know if it really matters a lot, I thought I might bring it up. Yeah, since the exam was over I have imbibed somewhat and got stoned a couple times. It was — it's a lot of fun, it really is, and we had some good times. But afterwards when I was alone, I did notice the — this — the alcohol and the sexual problem creeping back into my life, and I don't know whether it's because I came here and decided it only happens when I'm stoned, or because there is something physiological that sort of takes away inhibitions. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [0:19:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it — the fantasies did recur and there was a — the same sort of thing that happened before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it worried you that (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not too much. I mean I'm not going to smoke much, no, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It didn't worry you then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it bothered me a little, but it seems so clear what the solution is, you know? Just don't smoke. No big thing. I can get along without it with — it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seemed like that would be easy just to stay away from the smoking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then of course the problem comes up does it — is what I'm really like brought out because of the fact that I'm smoking? I mean if it were something that were — you know, just happened that once or twice, I could see that — I could easily write it off as something strange that's going on in my head because I'm all messed up, but the fact that it generally happens when I get stoned — [0:20:02.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. It's like you're saying, "Is that what I'm really like —"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "And it comes out when I'm stoned?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there are two possible answers, No. 1, that's what you just said. No. 2 — it happened once or twice when I was stoned. I came in here and decided that that's what — you know, that's what caused it, and now I have it in my mind that that will happen whenever I get stoned and therefore when I get stoned it happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it might be because you expect it to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but —</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the more comforting way to look at it [I think] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's more comforting, but there is a more — well, two ways to look at it: No. 1, the more comforting way is that — you know, what you just said. No. 2 is that this is not really the best way to solve the problem is just stop smoking. Well, yeah, it is the best way. (Chuckles). It is the best way as far as one shouldn't mess with one's mind and things like that, but it's not necessarily the best way that's going to make me feel confident with my solution. [0:21:05.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't ease your mind about the whole problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, see I can write it off somewhat this way —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And go back to normal heterosexuality and not worry anything about any strange fantasies that I (inaudible). But I haven't really worked it out, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Somewhere it lingers —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thoughts (ph) (inaudible at 0:21:26.9), yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although — it bothers me not so much as part of me as rather just that that it's just another unsolved problem that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Neither am I really. Because it seems to be — you know, I have to bring something alien into my system in order for it to occur — it seems to be something that I can write off as not part of me too much. [0:22:01.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. Yeah, but something strange or foreign.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like — yeah. And so in that way it could be just those two cells in my brain happen to be close together and this chemical will — you know, join them. It's a perfectly reasonable explanation. I — you can tell how much I know about medicine, but it seems that could be the type of explanation it is and it that's the case, why should I worry about some small membrane that some chemical is (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Why should you be concerned about it (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when all I have to do is avoid that chemical, so — yeah, that's — I just thought I'd bring that up, not that I'm — I want to — I don't want to not discuss it because I'm afraid of it or don't — can't figure — well, one of the reasons is I don't think I can figure it out, No. 2 is I don't —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, that's one of the reasons you don't want to bring it —</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a minor reason. The major reason is I don't think there's any point in discussing it and I don't see it becoming a major factor in my life. [0:23:05.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if it isn't important (crosstalk) —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't see myself smoking much in the future, and therefore I don't think it will occur.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then there's a little part of you that's sort of like really discouraged [I guess] (ph) about saying you really can't do anything about it (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not only can I not do anything about it — that's part of it — the other part of it is I can't really figure it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm, and if you can't understand it —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's — yeah, that's basically —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it's more sort of beyond you [or something] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Beyond not only me, I think beyond medical science.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or not even medical science — beyond — well, (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So — yeah, we're not going to figure it out I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it still kind of bothers you at the back of your mind even though you (crosstalk). [0:24:01.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds like you kind of want it to bother me so we can have another deeper problem to discuss, I don't know. (Chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well it sounded — I guess it sounded to me like — I had the feeling that it bothered you more than you were saying I guess. Are you saying that's not true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I'd like to think about this one a while. I hadn't even thought of bringing it up, but it has happened and that's why I brought it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But by thinking about it for a while, you mean you'd like to not talk about it, but —</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, well, we'll talk about it. I'll give you all of my thoughts on it. It's just that I don't think we're going to come up with anything. It's — well, I sort of — well — well, I mean — let's backtrack just a little. [0:25:00.0]</p>

<p>This would — the second half of the talk by the way was going to be another part of — another something that happened, and I think (inaudible) I'll do it now and then it will draw in better. June got a hold of me and wanted to know how I did on the test, and she's taking a course that has some math in it, and what — the only intention of going to — well, we went out to the point out here at 33rd Street — the only intention was to help her with her math exclusively and entirely and nothing else in my mind, and I haven't seen her in months and months and months. And I — she ended up inviting me up for dinner and low and behold, we ended up in bed again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that — I don't know how it happened, I really — because there was absolutely no intent in either of our minds I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what are you saying? It surprised you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I thought it was — you know, I had this affair straightened out. [0:26:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it made you realize you didn't feel so clearly about it as you thought — (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or — yeah. Yeah, I mean I — I guess I just having my sexual self all figured out is what it boils down to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That — see, when I can look at it rationally and be away from the problem, there is a logical solution that I'm not really being fair and honest with this girl, so I should not really in any way lead her on. There's just no way anything is going to happen, and yet when we get together it — something gels and — I don't feel good about it when I get home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm, it's like somehow all your resolve not to do so-and-so when you're with her like changes when you're with her. [0:27:04.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you regret it after you leave.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I feel so much like I'm taking advantage of her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now especially — I've mentioned to you that I'm leaving in a year; I'm going to Germany.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And wow, there's just no way in the world that anything is going to become serious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just — that just solidifies it period. There's just no way, and — whereas before it was 99 percent sure, now it's like 100 percent sure, and so I really feel bad because I get the idea that she feels that way. She — I get the idea that she should feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should feel what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Should feel as though this would mean something; that it's — there could be something developing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think she should feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean — yeah, I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by that. [0:28:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she's somewhere in her early 30s and she's not the type that messes around too much with guys, and then I came into her life and it seemed as though — for a while she was much more serious about it than I, and then I sort of left it, and now we're back again and wow. That's — well, although it's hard to do visualizing myself as a single girl that age, which was pretty well off — well, she's a bright girl and she's got a good job — and I would think that one of her intentions — and she really loves kids, I mean just — she's got nieces and nephews that she just talks about all the time. And I would think that one of the important things for her would be to think about settling down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. [0:29:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's just no way in the world that — well —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That that's going to work out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With us, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet we're — we're really — well, I suppose I'm the closest thing she's had to someone to whom — with whom she might settle down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm pretty sure about that. So yeah, I feel bad about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So — yeah, so it makes you feel uncomfortable —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be in that kind of situation — and guilty I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. But anyhow, the reason I wanted to bring that up now was, that evening — it was only — well, yeah. I'm trying to get all the days straightened out. It's only been a week since the test. That particular evening my mind was clear and straight and everything and everything went fine, and I just — nothing bothered me sexually. And the next evening wasn't that way. [0:30:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The next evening things did bother you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I — again, had problems with my mind and had the same sexual problem recurring. It's not as though it's a problem when it occurs, it's a problem the next morning when you think about what you thought about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. When you're thinking about it —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right now it's a problem. It isn't necessarily a problem when it happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it happens you're enjoying it or (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's — so you see, I see two sides of me. One completely normal side and the other side that — that can bother me. But again, then I can just avoid the problem — very easily just avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So — as a matter of fact I'm almost certainly going to — well, I see no — when — after I get to France I see no desire to get in any trouble, being — you know, a foreign student in a foreign — in another land, so I'm not even going to — I don't think I'm going to speed much less — [0:31:13.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In any trouble?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I — you see there's always the risk of —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of trouble?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there's always a risk of getting nailed for anything (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting busted, getting — having the police come in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, for (inaudible at 0:31:22.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and so therefore I — I see now that like a — I'm not going to smoke much in the future, therefore I — and I'm certainly not going to smoke when I get to France, so it's not something that's going to happen. So I can sort of write it off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So you can write it off and stop smoking, and that'll be the end of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Is that a good solution?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess — yeah, I guess you're wondering if it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm wondering what you think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're wondering what I think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or is that pretty much like an easy way out? [0:32:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckling). Is that what you think, it's an easy way out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have two very strong conflicting opinions. No. 1 is that I really shouldn't be messing around with this stuff and that serves me right. No. 2 is that this stuff is kind of breaking down any inhibitions against "normal" — quote — sexuality that I have in my mind, and therefore that's more like me. Therefore really I'm avoiding something very, very important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So either I'm avoiding something very, very important, or I'm messing around with a bunch of kid stuff and I should forget about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The "kid stuff" meaning the grass?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I can't decide — and there's —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't decide how seriously to take it. (Coughs).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, although I know the solution, I can't decide whether or not it should matter to me, and now the point is — well, is that the right way? I mean I just wondered what — yeah, I'm torn. I don't know what to think about it. [0:33:01.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. You go back and forth like, "Is this just from the grass and doesn't mean anything really about me?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or, "Is it something really about me that just comes out when I use this?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just thought — I'd wondered if you had an opinion as to that because that — those are two — are very different answers to a problem. I mean is there any indication that one would be —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's see. It's like — the only way I can answer that is I think how I would feel if it were me —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. [0:33:56.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is — I think it would be — I don't know, it's a complained question. I think if it were me personally, I would not be totally comfortable with just letting it drop, but on the other hand that would mean that I thought it was a big part of me, but I'd want to explore it more — I think — if it were me. And I wouldn't —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It just opens up so much more to explore and that's the problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you have already too much? [0:35:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there's a lot. I don't know if it's too much. Another thing about opening up more to explore, is that I haven't really dealt with — well, I don't know if this is specifics versus generalities. No, I guess that's not a good point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is there something about it, it's too much to explore all at once?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just so — first of all, I don't — I think with — you know, we could have a bevy of psychiatrists here, and they'd come up with just — each one of them we don't have a different answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So what you're saying is all of this — a lot of exploration leads to just confusion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then again, avoiding it is no solution either as we both pointed out. [0:36:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But very tempting I guess to avoid it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm, and very easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I were — another thing — here we go, here we go — I forgot, and here's motivation No. 3: Maybe I'm afraid of what I might find.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You mean you're afraid to really look at it, afraid of what it might say about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, now see, if I were just in Samoa now or somewhere where I wouldn't have to worry and could just behave sexually honest all the time and it would be no problem, but I just can't quite confront myself with the sexual honesty involved. I mean if I really had to figure it all out. [0:37:15.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not (inaudible) what you're saying. Are you saying, "If it really turned out that I wasn't just heterosexual —"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "That I had another feeling, then what on earth would I do with that?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. That's a good point that I use the word honest there too. I think I have a lingering suspicion that — that avoiding it is not being honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So — yeah, but I mean look it, since when is the last time we talked about this? Months and months and months ago, and — so — and if the — I really think it's — there's a causal relationship between messing my mind up and having this reoccur. [0:38:16.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no doubt I think that — well, now you see, it could be causal because —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Coughs).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is causal — granted, it's causal. But is it causal because I expect it to be or because there is something chemical that causes it? I think we're really getting — maybe we wouldn't have this trouble if I weren't a scientist. Maybe I could look at it a little better. But you see, the stuff we've been talking about, seems to be pretty far removed from any — not necessarily a scientific approach, certainly it isn't — but from any really basic understanding of the workings of what's happening. [0:39:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what you're saying is like this has more to do with chemistry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this has more to do with — yeah, you see, the other thing is in my head, and it's something I can straighten around in my head, something that we're not going to get to really other than by talking about it. We're not going to be able to figure out whey the brain does this particular thing, but now we're getting down to something that's very — very — we were talking more about feeling previously, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And attitudes and approaches. But now we're talking about actions, and we're talking about —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) actions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, what — oh, well certainly. I mean there are actions involved in —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just didn't know quite what you meant. You're talking about what should we do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And we're also talking about introducing a matter, you know, (inaudible) into my system, and what that does to me. And therefore it's now bordering on something that's — something that one could delve into with — well the Masters and Johnson approach rather than — you know, rather than more of a scientific approach rather than — [0:40:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you saying — something about I could talk about this in terms of — well, it's got to do with — the big question is, "What does that drug do to me?" Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's not it. That's part of it, that's part of it. It's really hard to put my feelings into words here. You see that — when we — when — all right, look, here we are. It would not be possible for us to work together on other parts of my life on what we've been working about before this last 20 minutes without my being completely honest and telling you everything that's going on in my head. [0:41:03.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm I — however, it would be possible for a person to not talk to me and give me this chemical and observe what reactions take place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. That doesn't depend on your being honest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's a physical manifestation of something that's going on in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's more — I think that what — with the state of the art the way it is now, it — at least in my lifetime it's something that's insoluble I mean to figure out what happens, but it is something that I can visualize people figuring out what's happening in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What certain things do to certain people and why I'm behaving this way. However, the other part that we've been talking about, I can't visualize that being put on good firm — [0:42:11.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scientific.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, scientific biochemical basis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's something about the fact that this could be put on a basis that does —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that makes me want to stay away from it. I don't know. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:42:28.2) you mentioned (inaudible) stay away from (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know what it is. Maybe I enjoy the other part, the fact that you're really depending upon me to tell you where — well, actually you're depending on me exclusively aren't you? You need to depend on me for what happens to me sexually. I mean it can be observed. It couldn't be observed, it's physically impossible to (crosstalk). [0:43:05.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It somehow changes our relationship, or it changes something else — how important your being honest is — something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Keep going. You (inaudible). I don't know what it changes, but it changes something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It changes something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then too, maybe I'm just afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Afraid because it could be objectively shown or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, afraid that I'm not normal and I want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. And afraid that that might come out — you might realize (inaudible) —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Find it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah — I don't know. I was really confused about —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) your theory is a lot more charged (inaudible), you might find out worse things (inaudible) —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:44:01.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scary things. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean — yeah, I could see — ideally see what's going to happen now is it'll never happen again and we have five more sessions left and everything will be straight and squared around and I'll walk out of here — not necessarily a new man, but at least living with the old one. And — yeah, everything — you know, you'll get a gold star to put on your wall for straightening me out. You know, I'll be really happy. I'll remember it forever and ever and indebted for life. On the other hand, I could go into this and just get messed up more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I could keep smoking and never figure it out, and let it bother me and gnaw at me. Is it so bad to do the former? Is it so bad to avoid something like that when everything else really is straightened around? When everything else makes sense and everything else — [0:45:13.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't it maybe okay just to leave that one part —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I can just by living a normal life, have a perfectly normal heterosexual life with no problems at all, why not just do it? If I'm comfortable with everything that occurs and I can avoid —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. Like why not just do that and put this away, like seal it off somewhere and go lead a heterosexual life and not worry about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wouldn't that be okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. It seems perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would — I think that I wouldn't necessarily have to feel as though it's a skeleton in the closet. I don't think that feeling would predominate. I think that I could come to the conclusion — and I nearly have — [0:46:07.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it's — there's just something in there that I can't quite figure out what's going on and it's merely a chemical reaction in my brain. Or another perfectly valid explanation that would make me not feel bad about the skeleton — not make me look at it as a skeleton in the closet — would be that it was something that I got into my head once that this happens when I smoke. And once it got into my head, every time I smoked it happened, and therefore — you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Either of those two ways of looking at it would really be satisfying an okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Contrary wise, (whispers something to himself) — I could forget about it, close it up and let it gnaw at me the rest of my life merely as an unsolved problem. [0:47:08.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you could know that it was there, but choose to leave it —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unlooked at. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And thinking, "The rest of my life is in order and I know that this isn't solved, but I'll just leave it there and not pay too much attention to it."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's — the fact that I feel a little bit bad about it now is not comforting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that the fact that it worries you —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a little bit bad about it — maybe in that way I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the — the fact that I'm having trouble in my head in that right now I can't figure out what to do with it. [0:48:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of bothers me. Well, I think — I'm sure what's — I'm sure I know what's going to happen. What's going to happen is I'm going to — I mean as far as the next few weeks and months are concerned. I'm going to not deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just incapable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you — you couldn't deal with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too big.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's a whole new problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too much to face you mean right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so either one way or the other, it — let's — so what's going to happen is No. 1, I'm not going to look at it as a skeleton in the closet for some reason, and I'm going to — you know, the two alternatives I gave you before. So it won't bother me, or No. 2, it's going to bother me and maybe five years from now I'll be back — you know, another 20 sessions — or someone else. (inaudible) somewhere maybe. (inaudible). [0:49:14.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it the fact that it's only 20 sessions that you're deciding that you can't deal with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me think. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think that I'd like to live with it a few more years and hash it out a little and see if I stop smoking if it just never occurs. I mean you know, if it doesn't — if I stop smoking and it doesn't occur for two years, why should something like that bother me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You mean that it would stop bothering you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The longer between a problem. I mean if you've got a stomachache and it goes away —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You forget about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And if it doesn't bother you for years and years, why let it bother you at all? [0:50:00.0]</p>

<p>Yeah, time can easily cover that problem. I might — I might without resolving it see how it fits in a little (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. You mean (crosstalk) —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without resolving — without deciding why — the whys of it or without deciding what I will do with it other than avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see how it might fit into everything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um, hm. That would be more doable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be a smaller piece and maybe you could do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really amazing how little people know about everything, you know? I mean I'm finding that out now, I'm not just saying that — I'm not saying it just because I'm a natural scientist and I should — because I — the same thing happens there, it just — you're confronted by ignorance all the time, and now I can see where it would be a really futile thing to — or not a — I wouldn't futile — but a discouraging thing to not know what's really happening in a mind. [0:51:13.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you're feeling discouraged? Or you think I'm feeling discouraged (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could — I just — no, no. I guess — well, no one should feel discouraged. I mean — I just can see now a strong parallel between the type — lack of knowledge — ignorance — that I am confronting and the type that you're confronting. Mine is just about — well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can see the parallels, is that what you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's just the same type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are problems now, but you just got to wait years and years and years for someone to come — you know, somebody who's going to come up with a solution or certain parts of the solution. Everyone is just working on some little small part of how everything is going to fit together. And then even when get that to fit together they come up with something else that does that is beyond that. And the same thing is happening to me now — I feel anyhow. [0:52:12.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that I'm feeling —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I don't understand this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't know that you don't understand it, I'm just saying that — yeah, I'm — yeah, yeah, I guess maybe that's a good — that's right that you don't necessarily — no one understands what's happening, you know, how the brain works, how it functions, but as you get farther along and realize how it functions, (inaudible) something else you know, that one doesn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can never really figure it all out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. But now that that — it's something about that being applied (inaudible) that you've got something that your mind can't figure out that brought that home to you more? [0:52:55.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah — um hm. Not just — yeah, you see, the thing is, one of the sad things about studying anything, about being a student, is we are I guess not 9-5ing it, but they're punching the clock. Is the fact that we're going to die with the arts — our respective arts — in the same relative position. That is to say we will have advanced our level of knowledge, but we certainly won't — you know, there'll always be something beyond, we won't know. And that one is condemned to that when one decides to be a student. And I don't mean a student student, I mean a student of something, a student of physics — psychology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, condemned (ph) to know — really knowing everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Now one of those things that one will never know with me is why I behave sexually the way I do. [0:54:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You're saying nobody really knows that now —</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And won't know by the time you die.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think it will ever be straightened out. So I don't want to work with — for that reason. If I were born 2000 years from now and people could put their proper electrodes in their proper places and figure out what brain waves are causing this and that and the other thing, and then say to you, "Well, this causes it." And then I'd say, "Well, thank you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine, but we're not going to get that far. We're not going to get close to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems useless to really try to solve it at all because you know that you can't get that kind of information .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah, that's (inaudible). Okay, now (inaudible) gotten that out of the way we'll forget about the sexual problem. Well, the fact that I call it a problem though — well, I guess I feel comfortable with leaving that alone. [0:55:09.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you have mixed feelings — from the way it sounds (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they're mixed now, but I'm sure that they're not — a year from now they won't be mixed, but I'll say, "Oh, that was just something happened (inaudible at 0:55:24.3), [no big deal] (ph). I'm pretty sure I'll ride through that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might be worth my while to fit it in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm, um hm. You need to think about how it relates to other things [you're feeling] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there have been and there are societies when this wouldn't or shouldn't have bothered me. I think — you see the — well, just to complete it for you — the — I — the fear I have when I — the next morning fear is that I am becoming bisexual. [0:56:09.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. I don't know if that's — well, that's the term I use.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We'll use that term. There have been times and places when that is not necessarily a fear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that would be all right to be bisexual.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So maybe you know — you know, big deal, what's the — why should I care that the 20th century is just that way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. And maybe if I'm bisexual, then maybe that's all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe I shouldn't let the way other people feel about it bother me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But at any rate, I need not confront the problem anymore as far as the problem is concerned. As far as other problems are concerned in my head and how this might help me solve them, I think that would — I might confront — I might re-confront it, [but I don't know] (ph). Well, I'm [going to have to] (ph) do some thinking. [0:57:22.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's the — can I — is 9:00 o'clock your earliest appointment always?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what why do you need?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was thinking — you know because now — well, what Dr. Rosen said was he said, "Well, I'd like you to work really hard this summer, so — because he has some people leaving at the end of the summer</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he wants me to be familiar with their work, and he'd like me to put in full days, and I'd like to be in before 10:00 — or come in — either come in later or earlier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I could come earlier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, great. How about Monday next?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Monday next, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that all right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now — well, let's see, how early you were talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, 6:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No!</p>

<p>(Chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eight-thirty? [0:58:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, that'll be fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight-thirty of Monday next, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

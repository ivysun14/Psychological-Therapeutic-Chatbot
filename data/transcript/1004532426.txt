<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. So, [?] I've been sitting in my advisor's office working and getting reports from the people who have funded my research. Yesterday I felt like I had everything pulled together about 3 o'clock and my advisor asked me for my laptop back next week and I was like, but the semester's not over and there are still these open questions that we just described in this paper. I assumed that I would be working on addressing at least some of them until the semester's over. And she was like, "No, actually as far as I'm concerned you have done a credit's worth of work on this project and I'm ready to consider this your final paper. You're done."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which just completely blindsided me. I came home in hysterics and asked Dave to come home and just like cried on his shoulder for a couple of hours. And (sighs), I don't know, there's (long pause), there's a bunch of things going on. The first is that I haven't talked to my department head. My advisor's in my department so I haven't talked to my department head or my department advisor about what I need to do to graduate. Like, do I need to do a defense [inaudible at 1:31] thesis? I've been putting it off because I'm terrified. And also I didn't see this coming so it was kind of like out of nowhere. And part of me feels like (pause) the work I did wasn't good enough and so I shouldn't be allowed to graduate because I didn't do my real thesis. And part of me feels like my advisor is just saying this not because I actually did a credit's worth of work, but because she's willing to do anything and sign anything to get me out of her hair because she's sick of me. And then there's what she actually said, which is much less what I should believe. But that's really hard for me.</p>

<p>[2:07] What she said was, but she wants me to leave with the feeling of accomplishment and to know that I absolutely could do a PhD if I put my mind to it and straightened out some of my personal issues. This is all her words. I'm just changing the pronouns. And that she's enjoyed working with me, but honestly given the number of conversations we've had where she's been frustrated and where she said things like, "You know, to be honest, working with you has been hell on earth these past two weeks," and things like that. Like, I have a hard time believing what she said yesterday and, I don't know, I just feel very bereft because now I've got two months where I don't miss the class I was taking because I couldn't handle it. So, I have nothing else to do for school, like except get my paperwork in order and figure out if I need to do a defense, which, oh god, I hope I don't. But, like (laughs) [3:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [That's an awful lot] (ph) (laughs) (long pause) (crying?)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what made you cry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feeling like I got fired essentially (pause). For my advisor essentially said that there was nothing I could do between now and mid-May is worth the time and effort for her to mentor me through it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So whatever the realities are, whatever like she may have really meant, this is how it felt to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean, in addition to the whole, you know, "I want you to feel like you really could do a PhD if you, you know, sorted out your personal issues and you absolutely have the ability," blah blah blah. She also said, when I pushed her further and said that I really want to clean up these issues that have been bugging me, and you know, she said, "To be honest I want Colin to get started on this project because working with him is really easy and he needs the laptop and working with you is really tiring." So, so it's possible she believes both things simultaneously. It certainly would not be unusual for people to hold contradictory beliefs at the same time. But, like, I don't know.</p>

<p>[5:25] Also, I still think the project I was doing was completely stupid. And it turns out, when we looked at all the data together this week, like from all of the different experiments I've run, the only real conclusion I came to that she knew and that hasn't been published is that about the methodology that my predecessor on the project was using is wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Which I guess adds to body of knowledge in the field, but like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, in the negative result.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I haven't really learned anything new about how SOI technology works. I just learned that the previous ways we had of doing simulations of it were not accurate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, I feel like crap. And I don't feel proud of what I've done, especially because, a big part that's bugging me is that it's a project not a thesis. (sighs) (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, clearly you're not feeling relief from this so much as, like, rejection and disappointment with yourself. [6:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also I realized, I started working in South Carolina and in 2008 I moved back up here and was telecommuting from them on a contractor basis until 2009. I was taking classes through this online program for all of the academic year 2008 to 2009, 2009-2010. So I've been basically doing nothing but school for four years and a lot of that time has been spent, spending days on end sitting at home, you know, playing on the computer being miserable and, yeah. After we ate dinner last night I realized I didn't know what to do with myself because I had no work to procrastinate and now the games I usually play weren't interesting to me. Like I fooled around with the game that's been consuming a lot of my time for the last couple of months for like ten minutes and I got bored of it and put it down. And was just, as I said I didn't know what to do and, I don't know, it was a very unpleasant feeling. (pause) Yeah. (pause) [8:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has you worried about the next couple of months. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there are all kinds of things I could do, that I've been wanting to do, but I've been too stressed and busy and I've had too much work to do. Yeah, I've been meaning to get back into working out regularly and getting into a rhythm of that before work starts would probably be good because I'll be in the habit when work starts. I've been wanting to take voice lessons and haven't had time to fit them in my schedule. There are a couple of textile art techniques that I'd really like to spend some time practicing on, but I've never had a two hour block where I felt I could just devote two solid hours to practicing as opposed to, I would say working, but in reality I didn't work, I just spent that time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Procrastinating...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Berating myself about not working. I mean there's all of these thing I could do, but (pause) I don't know. I started thinking about things I could do now that I have all this time. All of a sudden all of these things I wanted to do seem like chores now, like, I don't know. It's not making any sense. [9:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I think I understand clearly what you mean. That the, you're feeling about doing them has changed from wishing you had the time to, feeling more like they're chores and not things you're enthusiastic about in the same way. But I'm not sure why. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure either. That's why I'm bringing it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure, I (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's ok. (long pause) Well wait, sorry for what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For being a little snide there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, are you a little frustrated that I don't know what it means?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I was trying to head off the, "what do you think that means?" question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't know. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Do I ask that a lot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's challenging, that's a difficult question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually it is (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I can understand why you wouldn't like it. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know, I actually have more things I could talk about, but if you want to stay on the thesis project advisor topic, if you think that would be helpful, it's six half dozen, one of the other. [12:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go with what else comes to mind. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So a friend of mine, her church is doing a, I'm not sure what to call it, a small group I guess. It's got like eight people working through a book called The Way, which is, bills itself as recovery for your inner artist and unblocking your creativity. And a bunch of it strikes me as a bunch of New Age mumbo-jumbo and or, like the same crap you see in every self-help book in the bookstore that has never worked for me in the past. But, the friend that's doing this swears by it and I was thinking about the difficulty I have with open-ended questions or blank pages we were talking about last week, so I decided to pick up a copy of the book and start working through it myself and a lot of it is hokey or stupid so I'm skipping parts of it. But the thing that struck me as really helpful about it was to just force yourself to fill up three pages every morning with something, anything, it doesn't matter what. So, the advice was if you can't think of anything to write just, you know, write out [counting] (ph) the lines until you're done. (laughs)</p>

<p>[13:40] So I'm on day three of that and it's kind of terrifying. I hate the feel of those three blank pages sitting in front of me that I have to fill up no matter what. (pause) But on the other hand, by the time I'm down to about a quarter of a page life I realize that there's so much I want fit in and I don't have enough room to write it all. Completely crazy, so I don't know if anything's going to come from that. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's certainly interesting partly in demonstrating that you actually do have things to say (pause), but they can be hard to access.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also got my panel assignments for the convention this week and I'm super excited about that. It's a feminist science fiction convention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the end of May, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll be on some panels there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know Brenda has talked to you about it before so you probably have some idea of what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She has mentioned it, so I have the slightest idea of what it is, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) It's a lot of fun for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've spending time of the assignments and I'm super excited about them and there's some people who I really respect and admire a great deal who are on the same panels I am. So, I'm having a little bit of, oh my gosh I can't believe that anyone thinks that I have, you know, the same quality of things to say as, say Brenda Sherman, but, you know. Yeah, I'm excited to do research for those panels and figure out what I'm going to say. [15:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are they on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One is the imaginary book club so the five panelists each describe or give a review of a book that's never been written and they we critique each other's unwritten books. So, you know, maybe you would talk about Neil Stevenson's foray into zombie apocalyptica or, you know. One is Asian ancient ancestry [inaudible] talking about female heroes and legends, history myths of Asia. Baba Yaga and other hidden goddesses, there's been a number of science fiction books published in the last year about Baba Yaga.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She is a crone like goddess from Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In some legends she is a goddess of death, in some legends she's a witch, in others she is a goddess of chaos and destruction. So, we'll be talking about her, talking about the Morrigan goddess from the British Isles and I need to do research on other because my knowledge of European myth is very scant on the ground. Another panel is the Arab/Muslim East in science fiction and fantasy. How to do it, who does it well and who doesn't and tips for writers on how to not be offensive to [shawafels] (ph) when they write about Arabs and Muslims in science fiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To shawafels, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 16:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) There's a fifth one that I'm blanking, ah right, geek girls and the problem with self-objectification. (pause) It's exciting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The nice thing about being on a panel is that, you know, in a number of geek settings there is, I often feel like I shouldn't talk too much or too loudly or be too opinionated because I don't want people to think I'm being bitchy or shrill or [inaudible] or whatever gender insult comes to mind here. And the great thing about being on a panel is I don't have to worry about that, you know, know-it-allitis or I don't have to worry about putting my hand up too often in class and that other kids will get jealous of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. At the panel you're supposed to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a central committee of authority figures within this community who have decided that yes, I actually have useful things to say on the subject and people would enjoy hearing them and, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem excited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. A lot of my friends have a lot of anxiety about talking on panels. They don't want to be on panels and "what if people think what I have to say isn't valuable?" Well you don't know the programming committee's job is to research people who have applied to panels and figure out if you have something valuable to say or not, so (laughs). [19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe they had to call you just to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I find it far less anxiety inducing than lots of other things in my life so I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. When is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: End of May. (long pause) The other thing I really get out of it is there are so many people who I admire and respect show up. And there's so many people who are really, really smart there who are not mathematicians or scientists or engineers and the, the four years since I started it have been really therapeutic for me and kind of debunking some of these beliefs I grew up with that if you don't do math or science you're not really smart. You know if you want to do English or History or whatever it's because you're not smart enough. Well, actually what's the theory that there are actually seven different types of intellect and most people are only good at two or three? I know I've heard that somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's this guy Howard Gardner who has that theory, but I don't know, like (pause) like sort of how [inaudible] that to be, but whatever, yeah. [21:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah it's really hard to be condescending of other fields of human endeavor when surrounded by all of these brilliant minds who are very, very good at what they do, but, you know I have no understanding of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who have you met there that you admire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've met a bunch of authors there who I admire.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like whose work you've read before going there?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Uh-hmm. There are a couple of professors of literature and history from various universities who attend and have fans, essentially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are, like smart of that [book] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Like, I mean, I don't know, maybe if this is horribly elitist of me, but you know when you're having a conversation with someone it's really easy to tell people who have just really, just brilliant minds from people who are not, you know. But, that sounds horrible to me when I say it out loud, but, like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I imagine that the experience is actually reassuring, like (pause) my guess would be that it's a relief for you to know that there are really smart people outside the, whatever you call the few select standard fields. And (pause) like, but it's nice not to have to feel so critical of all those folks because they're not doing whatever, [science researching or something] (ph) [23:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's also, there are all of these people who are really, really smart and doing all of things that I don't know how to do and a lot of things that I probably couldn't do, but those aren't things I've been raised with to value. So, it's this experience of being around people who are better than me without feeling the crushing despair of, oh I could never be that awesome because they're doing completely different things from what I want to do, right? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if that makes any sense, but it's like when I meet a really, really brilliant engineer there's a huge part of me that's just like, Foley you suck, you'll never be as smart or as cool as all [inaudible]. You suck for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. If you're a really awesome science fiction author, like that can just be really cool without stirring up the kind of envy and self-recrimination that Foley the engineer stirs up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of my friends just finished his PhD last week and he has a job at this lab and I am horribly bitterly jealous because he's not that smart (laughs). He's really not. But he managed to finish his PhD, his thesis was bullshit, but he finished it and got a committee to sign it, which is more than I've done. And he got a job at this great lab which is my dream job which I don't have. And it's just (sighs) very frustrating. (long pause)</p>

<p>[25:31] I wish I could be happy for him because, you know, he defended his thesis and that's huge, but instead all I can think is, you know what the hell is wrong with me that this guy who is not as smart as I am is getting his PhD and I'm dropping out and not even submitting a Master's thesis, I'm doing a second year professional Master's project? (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and that means that in some basic way there's just something fundamentally very wrong with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'm not as smart as I think I am because if I were smart I would have been able to the goddamn thesis or PhD or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't have anything to do with smarts. I mean, I don't know exactly how smart you are, but I do know that it's not at all to do with that. (long pause) I mean it (long pause), it's a fantasy that you wish if you possessed more of some particular viewable quality, almost like possessing one particular virtue, then you would be exactly who you're supposed to grow up to be. And your parents, maybe especially your dad, would be really psyched and excited about you. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I thought I had given that up. I thought I had realized that there is nothing I can do that would make my parents actually respect me. Maybe I just need to say "hope" instead of "thought" in that sentence, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My interpretation is that that's nothing something one learns one day and then knows forever. You know, like you can know it in your head and then yet it doesn't feel like that a lot of times in a lot of ways. [28:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which part's not fair? I think a lot of things that you said are, I was just wondering which part you have in mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But my parents have essentially set me up to fail because no matter what I do it will never be good enough to them. And so no matter what I do I will always feel like I'm a failure. And that's not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd go bigger and use the word tragic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate this little censoring hateful voice in my head is sitting here telling me, go ahead wallow in self pity, that's certainly going to be useful. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's something they had a big part in creating too. And you give yourself a really hard time when you're upset. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just hear my father shouting, "You want to cry? I'll give you a goddamn reason to cry." And I wasn't supposed to cry. He really hated it when I cried and did everything he could to keep me and my sisters from crying. [30:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's ridiculous. What's the matter with a kid crying when they're upset? Like, I mean people react differently to things like that, but actually I think of a thing like that is actually twofold in a way. Like a, I have a feeling that, you know, in some ways it's what you grew up with that it, like, it's hard to have perspective on how off the wall it is, frankly. On the other hand, I guess I don't want to be disrespectful about that having been your experience and how, you know, you were sort of told to look and react to things. So like, on one hand I want to say like, yeah that's ridiculous, what the hell, when the kid gets upset, everybody gets upset. But, like kids are often easier upset by things and there's nothing wrong with it and like, generally you do kids a disservice when you don't get upset when they're already upset or you if you give them a really hard time for being upset. And like, especially your dad, your parents were on the extreme end of that. And [everything was bad] (ph) [inaudible at 32:21] about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And they'd say crying is a sign of weakness and you don't want other people to know what your weaknesses are. So you should never cry, you should show your upsetness and also if I was upset about something they did I was just being irrational and stupid. And I should do it their way because it was the smart thing to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because clearly that's made them such strong people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think sometimes they wouldn't even be able to rationalize it with those bullshit rationalizations. I think sometimes they just completely lost their temper and flew off the handle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Sure. (long pause) [inaudible at 33:17] disrespectful in the sense that given what your father went through, like even though it's hard to imagine, but that doesn't make his rationalizations around (pause) pain, sadness, anger any more accurate. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, but anyway my mother has no excuse for being that completely bat shit crazy. And whatever damage or psychological scars my dad has, he also trained in neurology and psychology. You think he would learn the minimum of like, he's a fucking pediatrician. (sighs) His patients all love him. They all think he is like the best thing, God's gift to mankind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? I didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has won all kinds of awards from patient advocacy groups, from the professional associations he belongs to from the hospitals he's worked at. His bosses hate him which is why he keeps changing jobs and he's a pain in the ass to work with, but his patients all adore him and I don't understand how he manages to charm them so much because no one else can stand him. (sighs) (long pause) [35:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I appreciate [inaudible] the same way like, it seems very plausible to me that he could be a very different way with somebody that probably wasn't nearly as identified with it his oldest daughter, I mean any of his daughters, but especially his oldest daughter. That he could be a lot more flexible and then, you know, their emotionality wouldn't be so dangerous and evocative for him because they don't [deal with him] (ph) in the same way as you. (long pause)</p>

<p>[37:05] There may be an indication of how much this stuff is like very much alive with you. And it seems like your relationship with your advisor concerns a lot of that kind of stuff. (pause) And it was really upsetting when you felt like she was telling you to go away. (long pause) I don't know, I think that [inaudible] as much as you didn't believe in the project, as much as you didn't believe in her as an advisor in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, don't get me wrong. She is very, very smart, but she didn't have the background knowledge or experience to be working on this project.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not even a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You're actually right, you never even said to me that she's a bad person, just that she, she had been misleading and taking you on which was really unfair to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really didn't know what she was doing as far as this project and kept championing ideas that seemed quite stupid to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't say stupid, that's awfully harsh, but the ways that, the majority of this field had already decided were not useful and valuable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And which, as I understood, you already had quite a lot of evidence and some pretty reasonable thinking that showed...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't work (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that she didn't listen to. [long pause] And (long pause), and you knew that she didn't clear that because she wanted the [interview wise] (ph) because she didn't want to be there. (39:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even like on, when I was working closely with her this past week and other instances where, you know, we spent two or three hours hashing out a particular problem I was stuck on, a lot of it would be she would make a suggestion and I would say, that doesn't make sense and explain and she would argue with me and I'd explain and in the midst of explaining I would, but maybe this other thing would work. And then she'd ask me to explain that and I'd defend it and she would tell me to go do it. It wasn't even that she was coming up with ideas for debugging the problems I was having for the research; it was just that having something to push back against was what prompted me to think of the next step. Whereas sitting by myself spinning my wheels there was not real traction. Right? Like (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is my impression that there were ways in which she was there as an advisor for you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there was something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: She always made time for me if I needed to see her, which not every advisor will do, but I have plenty of friends who trying to get face time with their advisors was like pulling teeth. And (pause), no, but I don't (pause), I think what it boiled down to was I didn't respect her as an authority figure. Like, if we had been co-workers, peers, I would have all the respect in the world for her because she's really smart and she works really hard, but, but I didn't see her as a valid position of authority for this project. She made everything hard. Like in addition to the problems I have because I was the only student working on it so I had no peers on this project.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just you and her really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really sucked a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now.</p>

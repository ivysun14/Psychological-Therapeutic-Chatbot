<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before we get too deep in to this, I want to make sure, do we have an appointment for Thursday set up yet? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I at present, don't have a regular time in the afternoon on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I think Thursday morning should be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let me take a look to see if I have anything else in the afternoon. And I should have some things opening up in the next month or two. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just wanted to let you know because I know afternoon's better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think at the moment, I don't have anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, you don't have morning either?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I do have the morning; the morning appointment we have. I have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, can I still take that one then?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh absolutely. I guess I sort of assumed we were on for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't certain if you gave it away or not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What time is that at?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's at 9:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 9:15. Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to make sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>[00:2:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gosh, it's so weird because it's always hard to come in here and start talking. I usually get, unfortunately a rant until we're leaving, but when I come in I have no idea what I'm going to say. I really don't have anything coming to mind right now. </p>

<p>And we're being quiz-teamed my hours at work just a little bit. Our new lead came in. I talked with him and I think I'm going to just make my Sundays and Mondays longer to see, temporarily see how that goes. And then see where that goes from there. So we'll see. </p>

<p>[03:01]</p>

<p>There seems to be pretty good, I don't know; it's been evidently for me again, this is sort of weird for summer for me. But I mean I'm not super full of energy, but I mean—during the summer—but usually it's not like the I come home and I immediately have to go to sleep kind of thing. The past couple of days I've just been kind of coming home and going straight to sleep or just been sort of inconvenient. It takes up a lot of time, you know. </p>

<p>I've been really really glad that Mike's been going to work a lot more often lately. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't say it's 40 hours a week, but he did go in on a Sunday for prep day, which is like a big deal if I don't; can't have any time that he's done that in a long time. I know it's exhausting him, but I think much like going to the gym, he just has never never really worked that hard in his life. So you know. So it's good to see him going in and doing that. I think that eventually it's going to pay off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that's good. Partially, it's also getting him out of my hair sometimes, which sounds weird to say it that way, but if he is avoiding work, he's usually not helpful. It's different than I've taken a day off to spend with you. If he is, for some reason, can't get around the house for some reason, he's already in a place that makes it very difficult to...you know. So, though I am going to try and talk to him about his gaming thing because it's starting to really bother me. </p>

<p>[05:02]</p>

<p>I called Friday night and about 10:30 or 11:00 or something like that and said you know what, I'm really feeling kind of depressed and lonely. Can you come home? And he, to get out of the game that he was playing, I guess he had to say like there is an emergency at home and he had to leave because it would screw up the game. I don't really understand exactly. But then he went out the next day and did it for a few more hours. </p>

<p>And so now it's become sort of a Friday night and Saturday afternoon as of late and to me, it's kind of getting to be...to him, I guess, in his mind, since he had to come home early on Friday night, it was kind of like an avoided trial, so Saturday afternoon was justified. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of made me feel bad, so I just needed; I needed my own way to probably talk to him because I don't want to sound so blunt and jerky about it. But Friday night is the only night that both of us have together where neither one of us need to be somewhere in the morning. Saturday night I need to be back up in the morning to go to work on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so whether or not we do something, I want to have that time open to us. Yes it is true that we have not utilized it well, but there is a possibility of intimacy or romance, or even going for a walk late at night or something, and I feel kind of...the only reason why I even really felt like I could actually make a fuss about this is he was mentioning it to somebody at work; he was telling me about this and he's like yeah it would be really great except for the fact that there's no way in hell I'd be able to get away with my relationship spending every Friday night playing board games with a bunch of guys. And I'm like wait a second here. There are people that like aren't jerks that can put these boundaries down, you know. Like I knew that, but the fact that once somebody that he works with told him that he couldn't—he would know that, but it's not like in the schedule of his relationship, then I thought to myself well, not just that I've heard about it, but he's been told my somebody else that this is a...so, we'll see. </p>

<p>[07:21]</p>

<p>I hate taking the stuff away from him, but you know, it would be different if it were like a Tuesday night or even a Saturday night technically because I need to be in bed early anyways. But it seems awfully lonely. </p>

<p>I would occasionally chat with people online, but there is a group of ladies that I do occasionally. But to be honest, come summertime, most of them have other things that they're doing too, you know. They're not spending their Friday nights or their Saturday nights on the Internet really. They've got plans. Which is [inaudible 07:53] February when it's cold and winter; yes, you don't really want to do much. </p>

<p>But although I'm completely exhausted and I have no idea how to make any of this stuff happen as a reality, I really want to go out and do something, you know. I have no clue—like I said—make some of these things happen though. I mean some of the things; I mean it's just a matter of money. Some of them are a matter of juggling time and resources and things like that/dog or whatever. But some of it is just...just I'm tired, you know. </p>

<p>I haven't been to the shore yet since we moved here, which everyone is really shocked about. Like I haven't seen the Atlantic Ocean in years. I'm not a huge beach person. I don't really do well with downtime. At one point, we had discussed many many years ago going on a vacation just specifically because there's nothing around; there's nothing we could do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Going to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On vacation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh on vacation. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to sit on the beach for a while. This is actually—long story short—we were going to go right around the time I got married and I don't remember what it is; there was something that was going on at that time, so we ended up switching and going somewhere else. But I know; terrible first world problems. But we just never did it. </p>

<p>[09:33]</p>

<p>We lived in Orlando which also has the ocean. We went to the beach, literally, for less than five minutes once. Found out as soon as we got there the reason why there was nobody there is because there was a hurricane coming in and they drove right back out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know I'd like to try and...I'm not talking like even a day or a whole day; maybe like an hour or two. But the sheer concept of, first of all, dealing with people because Mike is really bad with crowds and extremely bad with traffic even more so. So picking out like a middle of the day thing and doing that, I'd like to do that. Maybe something I don't normally do; it's nothing I usually find pleasurable, but you know what, I haven't done it in so long, how do I even know if I like anymore? If I like it or dislike it, you know?</p>

<p>[00:10:23]</p>

<p>I remember a couple of times I've done things where I really thought I was going to extremely dislike it. I had a really bad attitude, and I had the time of my life. Fortunately what I'm thinking about is when I went tubing, got burned within an inch of my life. But you know that's neither here nor there. But I'd like to like go and do something, you know. We have literally have lived in this city—we jokingly justified the cost of our apartment...why we never go out anywhere is because the cost of the apartment sucks as much utility out as possible. But, I mean, it's really partially because we're broke. </p>

<p>But like, you know, I have actually never been to some places nearby. I live in here. I've never been downtown. I have never been to most of the city, you know. Yeah, like we literally don't do much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Downtown is not that far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, but it's not like, you know, I don't know. There are a lot of things about it that makes it complicated sort of. But there are just things we haven't done and I'd like to do them. And whether or not we actually do them on that Friday night, I don't know, but I'd like to have it open, you know. Especially because sometimes I feel like I'm consciously; I'm not saying most of it out loud, but I hear it in my head, and he's like, well I got an e-mail they're starting at 4:30 today. I'm like, "4:30? Are you freaking kidding me?" Every single one of those dorks are skipping out of work early and starting gaming at fucking 4:30. They don't come home until after midnight. You've got to be kidding me. </p>

<p>I don't mean to...I never swear. I swear this is the...has been my place that I have somehow picked up a really bad habit of swearing now. But it's like you've got to be kidding me here. Like why? And I also feel really guilty because I've asked him one time, "Why don't you just play one game?" Because often when I call him, he's like, "I only played one game," but it took like three hours. And I'm like, "Well why don't you just play one game?" He just seemed so crush over the concept of only doing one game that I just...because I found this for him and it am like his fun thing he does, I hate to ask him not to do it. But I don't know. It just feels like it's taking away our ability to go do things together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean he comes back and he comes back kind of frustrated. He gets very upset about the fact that the people that he...Mike used to be really really like goal oriented towards winning games. I have actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>[00:13:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's really good at them; not good, but really goal oriented. I've never been like that. I spent, I mean I spent a good part of my life playing Dungeons and Dragons back in high school. I played a lot with my friend Jimmy and just other people such that we at certain points we started playing it, setting it up in different situations to see if it's possible to have things happen in certain ways. So I've played a lot of games. But like after a certain point, I don't really care if I win or lose; I'm just doing this for the interaction and just for the interest of seeing what happens. And he's slowly becoming like that. It took him a long time because he's like—it's hard to explain, but he used to be so like focused on...maybe I used to be like that too now that I think about it; just not as much. His was really obvious.</p>

<p>Like when playing with people that have never played a game before, he would beat them in to the ground; like something complicated and strategic like Dungeons and Dragons. Like yeah; they don't really understand how this game...I mean they'd understand vaguely how the game play works, but you just like totally set them up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never been like that. Okay great I win. Awesome, you know. Whatever. And it's not that I don't try to win; it's just there's more, especially when I'm around people that aren't necessarily the same time of intellectual heavy weight when it comes to certain things—I'm really neutral towards this. I think part of it came from the fact that I started doing stuff with kids at that point in time. And you can't—when you're teaching kids something like Chess, if you throw them to the ground, come on; that's not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I got like that. He's getting a little bit like this because he comes home and he's like the people—he's like talking about this being analysis paralysis thing of like he's like 25 minutes; I went through 25 minutes to figure out what they were going to do for their turn. You know like, he's obviously frustrated because he's around these people who see the massive decision tree and cannot make; they're so stuck in getting more information that they can't get past that. Pardon me for just a minute. Okay, hold on. He's getting a migraine and I have to remind him to take caffeine. Okay. </p>

<p>[00:15:40] </p>

<p>And so I'm like I can't imagine why that...to be honest, being around some people that are seriously aggressive and lack of social skills personalities, to me, strips away all the fun of that kind of thing. Years ago we used to do the thing where—we lived really close to my primary [inaudible 16:00] and she used to have the thing called Bitchfest, which was basically craftiness, that kind of thing. So she used to live three doors down and at my house, we hosted [inaudible 16:09], which is mostly Bitchfest was women and mostly [inaudible 16:13] was guys; almost all the same three departments. And so they would be playing like war games and grilling stuff and then we would be doing stuff over there. And so we mingled, actually, a little bit. </p>

<p>[00:16:23]</p>

<p>And so but the thing is that we knew other people and the personalities were great. It was fun. But being around people that are like rules lawyers and you know what I mean; that might not be pleasurable to me. And it doesn't seem like he is happy with it. He's coming home really frustrated. And I don't understand, like why it makes him so happy if he's around so many personalities that drive him crazy. </p>

<p>These are people who, like if we were invited to their house and they had a dinner party, he would conveniently somehow get sick. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the impression that you would feel less guilty about wanting him home Friday night if you could explain how he really doesn't enjoy it anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I would feel less guilty about him being, about him going—I feel less upset about him being gone Friday night if he came back every night and told me he was having the time of his life. Similar. I would feel; I would stop feeling the pull towards wanting to do things together if he came back and told me how he was having the time of his life. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know what you're saying. I guess I'm surprised.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's probably a blend of the two. But it's like yeah. I spent my Friday night along and now you're coming back and telling me all about these people I've never met before who you're really annoyed by. I mean hearing stories the whole night about how this one person is, you know, completely convinced that somebody is like stealing from the bank or whatever, you know. </p>

<p>[00:18:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing I don't understand is how that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he were gleefully happy afterwards, I don't think I'd feel so bad. I mean I would feel bad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you talked about initially in terms of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want couple time too. I do, but I think that; I think that if he was in a better mood when he came back that it would help overall. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it would be easier to feel close to him in general because he was in a better mood from having [inaudible 19:05]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's not in a bad mood, but he is definitely irritated by a lot of stuff, you know. It's both, but I think you're right on at least part of it. It's just weird. I have; I just [inaudible 19:29] he went off and did stuff before when he's just had a blast and I had been thrilled about it because he comes home and he's in such a good mood. He's having a great time; all that stuff. And maybe it just becomes; it was just so infrequent that I think of it positively. But I mean I never really felt like it was a big deal. I don't know. It's kind of a weird thing. I actually kind of feel guilty about not really wanting to play games anymore either you know, a little bit. Like I don't want to go there. Lots of reasons why, one of which is, quite frankly, over four hours of anything, I lose interest. Like when I went to a friend's house and that happens, I can be like, 'I'm going to go take a nap. Can somebody come play my turn for the next few rounds?" or something like that. Like somebody that knows me well enough that I've done that for. I can't do that. I get really bored after a while and maybe it's because I was so good at it. Maybe it's because I have very little tolerance for that kind of thing. I don't know. But I kind of felt guilty because the one time that we were discussing me going to go do it, oh God, I feel really like I'm airing dirty laundry on this one because this sounds...this make him sound like the world's biggest jerk. </p>

<p>[00:21:18]</p>

<p>Last Saturday when he went, we had originally planned—I was going to go out with him just because. But then we had the tragedy of, oh my God. There was reason to believe that we had bed bugs. We don't. He had a bunch of bug bites in which like I guess he took pictures of them and then sent them to his friend who is an entomologist, who said either bug bites or spider bites. Bed bugs [inaudible 21:48].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what happened was is I'm like, "Okay great." If we have that happen, we can't just let this sit here. So I'm going to stay at home now—I didn't say I'm going to stay home; this is just sort of how it came out and ended up me staying home and washing literally every single thing in the house until I found the spider nest on hot water and hauling this around and being miserable while you go out and play games, you know. </p>

<p>And I guess I possibly could have said, "Hey, I want you to call this off," but he was already sad because last Friday night I asked him to come home near three and a half hours in to his gaming thing, so. So you know it just...I feel like I'm being so biased while telling the story. I mean I'm not telling it truly impartially at this point, but I'm telling you how I was feeling at the time. Because I'm hauling like a featherbed and pillows and everything to have to wash on high heat, which means that the tumble and like, I am feeling like here I am trying to do this for something that, first of all, I didn't necessarily know about. I mean I cared about, but he's the one that started the whole, "I think we have bed bugs thing." And then I'm the one that's taking care of it, you know. I was like, oh man, this is really annoying. </p>

<p>So we don't, thank God. But the point though is we got well in to the nightmare of having to try and steam clean everything in the house. But it just...it sounds like he's a really big jerk, but he really; most of the time he isn't and I love him to death. It's just that sometimes he is not able to handle disappointment in life very well, you know. He just does not handle life disappointments at all. And so I've been trying really hard all of my life to make sure his life is the least disappointing as humanly possible, you know. </p>

<p>[00:24:06]</p>

<p>There are so many things, just little things in my life that you know, I know that when things are very very hard, I just go out of my way to make sure, like I said, it was; it didn't make up for it, but at least mitigated it. Sometimes it's better than something; something like that. In the end it feels like...I mean I feel like because I'm doing this, in some way, I have to be emasculating him in terms of like, okay, well don't worry; this is going to be vastly disappointing, so therefore I'm going to step in and do something. Like I bought my own engagement ring. He didn't have a job. He didn't have a cent to his name. I had a trust fund. I could...and quite frankly, he knew that I probably wanted something fairly expensive and so I'm like don't worry; I'll get it taken care of. That kind of thing. And he was really upset that he couldn't do that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you keep sort of describing these ways that you mostly feel guilty about like asserting yourself with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As though his fragility place like severe limitations on what you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. It depends on what it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean in what you can allow yourself to want in certain cases.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and no. It's more—[inaudible 26:05] that it's mostly that I know that if he's upset or disappointed or something like that, I know it's going to lead to the cascade of him being self destructive. So it's in my best interest long term to cut him off the path. You know. </p>

<p>[00:26:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that can involve quite a lot of sacrifice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, totally. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: About which I think you have some [inaudible 26:37].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, I mean that's extremely frustrating. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very. You know, it's...I have told him in certain situations how I feel about it and I am 99 percent certain that when I tell him that he understands and he really really feels like he wants to make changes and things like that. And I don't know how this is happening and I'm not trying to be like over dramatic in any way or trying to like use euphemisms. I swear to you that five minutes later that he does not remember it. He has some vague memory probably five minutes later, but by the next day, no memory of it at all. </p>

<p>[00:27:48]</p>

<p>And so it's not that he doesn't want to remember it, you know. Occasionally he writes it down and I find these notes around the house. You know, like I must be better to Debra. That's really sweet stuff. But then it gets lost because he is like; he's got a lot of ripped up pieces of notes with notes like you know, call this, do this, and be nicer to Debra and things like that. So it's like, I don't know. I mean I just keeping hoping that if I can make his life as non-miserable as possible, that he will be happy with himself, you know. I think that he's a pretty okay guy, you know. And he is a good person. He is a bright person. All the things that he has ungood feelings about himself are untrue. It's the self sabotage. But there is nothing; I mean in the moment he totally gets it. But the minute that something's uncomfortable, he ditches. And trust me, I've had those moments. I have done that in my life. I can't think of anytime recent. Oh yes I am. I am avoiding going to the surgeon. Yeah. So it's not entirely not non-recently, but I've had that thing where I've angered someone in my life and so I do everything possible to avoid them.</p>

<p>[00:29:46]</p>

<p>I haven't angered the surgeon; I just don't want to deal with it. I don't want to deal with all the stuff involved with it. But you know that whole thing of just doing anything humanly possible not to have to. So I understand that. But I'm just wondering when it's going to stick. You know, when...I've been helping him through a lot of things. When is it going to be able to...when is he going to be able to do it on his own? When is he going to be able to construct his own e-mail like it's, you know, asking for advice on something from his advisor or you know, I don't write them entirely, but I do talk to him. Like I have no idea how to say this to him. Okay, well we'll talk about it; that kind of thing.</p>

<p>But I just wish I knew why it is that he thinks he is so inherently bad. That's probably the only thing negative. He's been told his whole life that just because he's a Y chromosome, he's evil, you know. </p>

<p>I have told him not to say those negative things, just not things I know that cut to close, you know. But at the end of the day, you know, I just truly wish that he thought of us as a couple first as opposed to him. Not us as a couple as in like, oh my God; I've got to go pick up Debra from work. I have to go pick up the dog or whatever. But like hey, let's do this. Or Debra might like this. Or something like that as opposed to I'm afraid that she'll be pissed if I do this. That's more self preservation. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this is difficult to talk about.</p>

<p>[00:32:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is; really difficult to talk about because I mean, aside from just incidents we're talking about some of these things, he's like this long term flaw. Like yesterday he sent me a text message saying, you know, "How are you doing?" And I said, "I'm exhausted and hungry." And he said, "Well sleep and eat." I said, "Okay." And then 20 minutes later, he calls me and wakes me up. Like why did you do that? And he said well I figured you'd still be eating or something like that. I'm like, okay, you know. </p>

<p>And then like a few weeks ago I told him I was having asthma problems and I was having trouble breathing. He calls me. I'm not saying that...there are a lot of women out there whose husbands don't ever call them, so I'm not necessarily saying...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Pausing and thinking before doing action, you know. But sometimes he can be fantastic about things. Like right now after this, I'm supposed to meet up with him because he does not want me walking home—I usually walk home—in this kind of heat. So he's going to make sure that I get a ride home. That's wonderful. There are some many things in which he's really really so doting on, but sometimes he's so oblivious that, like what is and is not the best situation; the way to deal with something, you know.</p>

<p>[00:34:18]</p>

<p>Like I said, yeah, it is really uncomfortable to talk about because I have been trying very hard to be the best most supportive person who is non-judgmental as possible, but you know what, like I'm communicating...a lot of times I am communicating my feelings and my needs. It just happens to be that I've been throwing them away in to like this bucket for like a long time because they haven't really been addressed.</p>

<p>Now they're sort of being addressed, but they're not really making it in to...they're going to RAM, but they're never making it in to the hard drive. They're getting discarded after a certain point. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I think sometimes, I know you kind of, not quite, but almost pretend a bit like they're not there; you don't have them, or they're not that important or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Just more of keeping focused on what's in front of me, you know. Looking away from them. I'm not sure. Sometimes it's just because at any given time there is something else; there's a difference between important and critical for this moment. A lot of times you have to be critical for this moment. Things have to be taken care of or when you get back to the other part it's just like well; how do I be pissed at this anymore because I've obviously sort of put it aside for a while? </p>

<p>And it just...it's exhausting. It's really exhausting. And the problem is that personally for me, what's happening is now the one thing in my life that I really always hated about certain people and I never wanted to be like this is the one argument turns in to everything that's ever happened thing. It's because I don't feel like it's ever really absorbed. Like it becomes like the—and this is not really the—the taking out the garbage becomes everything that the grand sum of 30 years of problems kind of thing. I have always detested people like that. Mom does it a little bit. She's better than most people. But it just drives me up the wall people like that, and now I've already turned in to that and it makes me hate myself. </p>

<p>[00:36:49]</p>

<p>Like I will make jumps from one point to another in terms of like not necessarily about that situation and he's been knocked down to the point where it becomes like a, "I need to tell you about this," and then it becomes so much more than that. He's overwhelmed, you know. After this point, you know, where you're talking about like I need to spend some couple time, and then it becomes like talking about the pain of not spending time together and then it becomes like...and then it becomes like the reliving the ruins of our sex life. Like how in the world are you supposed to like, you know in terms of like catastrophically magnifying each other...?</p>

<p>Anyway, so like how in the world am I supposed to handle that? I meant that's...how is he supposed to handle that? I mean that's being beaten up on...when it has happened to me, the few times it has, I've hated it. But I have so many things that for so long have gone unresolved or even really especially acknowledged. They just keep jumping out in these ugly situations. And so I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>[00:38:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not great at all because you don't want to beat up on him in a way, you know, you've been deprived of something for a long time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, also getting extremely extremely upset sometimes is the only way that it really gets taken care of. Which I don't like being conditioned like that. I'm not a dolphin, you know, but usually when I know that sometimes if I get really upset about something, maybe something might happen, you know. But I just don't want to be like that. </p>

<p>I think the problem is that both of us, actually, want to be too fair about certain things though. The problem he has is when he hears all this stuff. He's like, "Yep, I 100 percent agree with her." So there's nothing for me to say other than to hang my head in shame.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: God, it's true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well actually...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there's more that can be done, but in his head that's what...we've talked about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's plenty that can be said and done, but he's so overwhelmed and he's like wow; everything she says is really compelling. I've been like that too where it's like, well, you know this isn't really all that fair to put you in this situation, therefore I'm just going to, you know, I don't know. So it's kind of hard. </p>

<p>[00:39:54]</p>

<p>Both of us were discussing how much we need a vacation. And I was just thinking to myself, yeah, that sounds great, you know; even just for a little bit. But then I realized, oh my God, the stress of having Mike deal with a vacation right now is like the stress of having to like pre-think all these situations is kind of stressing me out a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to make it okay; the fact that he can't deal with pressure or things that are...he chemically is unable. He doesn't make enough cortisol to be able to handle things like a lot of people or like a lot of cars or something like that, you know. But it still doesn't make it any better just to know ahead of time cringing about like the fact that it's not going to be restful at all, you know. Possibly for him; definitely not for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like in certain ways, both of us have become a lot less flexible with that kind of stuff. Ten years ago, you know, when we; when something went wrong while trying to go do something, it was fun. It was fun. We laughed it off. Now it's a lot more stressful. </p>

<p>[00:41:33]</p>

<p>For me, most of the time I'd still be like, okay, so as long as we make it back by the 19th, everything's fine, you know. He still gets very stressed out by that kind of stuff now. But to me, it's also a little bit like that too. I'm just like I would rather not deal with the hassle of X, Y or Z, you know. It just...I don't know; like I said it's just frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When all said and done, I don't see how he puts up with my weird quirks. And for the most part, does understand when I say something along the lines of, "You can keep talking at me, but I'm not processing anything at the moment. You're going to have to tell me this later again." If I told that to most people in my life, they would probably think that was pretty...they would think that was kind of like a jerky thing to say. Like you think you're talking. I may say something that makes sense, but I'm not really processing any of this. At the end of the day I'm exhausted, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You come and talk to me about like some new chip design you have which normally is not in my field, but I do understand enough of it to talk about this or that, but you know what, I can't really give you adequate feedback on a protocol because, to be honest, from one sentence to the next, I'm not really getting it anymore. He takes that pretty well most of the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>[00:43:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I've had very few people in my life that really—and maybe because I'm so harsh about it—but like when I...there are so many things about it that just being quirky things about levity sticks really really well. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to stop?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I will see you Thursday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Thursday morning. Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

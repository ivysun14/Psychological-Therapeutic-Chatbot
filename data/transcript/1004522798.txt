<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll have to experiment with it at some point and see what actually matters, it doesn't...hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When are you running?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just cold, unworked, and really frustrated because I know what the next steps are for work I need to submit to my advisor. And none of them are that hard, and none of them are that tedious. But I've just been staring at my lists for two days now and not making any progress. I spent two hours working this afternoon. I had a lunch date at my work until I came here and managed to do one task which the actual doing of the task took me about seven minutes. It's really frustrating that I can't just be productive. I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>I've also been stalling on getting some paperwork done so I can graduate. You know, I brought up the idea of doing a project instead of a paper to my advisor and she said to be honest she didn't think I had enough meat in the work I was doing to do a thesis at all, which is a little disappointing to hear because I've been working my tail off for a better part of a year. But that means I need to transfer that credit from NYU and I'm just so ashamed of the bad grades on my transcripts that I don't want anyone to see them even though the class I'm trying to transfer I got an A in. And it's just, it's weighing on me and it feels horrible and I just need to do it and get it over with. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And doing means going to talk to the Dean, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The department head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The department head? Is there more that comes to mind? I'm not yet sure what to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see. I don't know. Mark and Trish are moving this weekend and I've been trying not to think about it because that's awfully depressing. Especially because they're moving for what I consider the stupid reasons. I supposed that's what happens when you date someone who's only 23.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are they moving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: New Jersey, mostly because Trish says that she has been here too long and has slept with too many people around here and she needs a fresh start in a new city where no one knows her, which I consider to be a really dumb reason for moving but I suppose that's the sort of thing - well I did exactly the same thing when I was 24 so I can't really blame her for it. But... [00:04:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the same reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No for exactly the same reasons but for similar reasons. That I had been in too many political and interpersonal conflicts and there was just too much drama in my social group. And our whole social group was really incestuous and I just needed to get away and get a fresh start. Yes, and that lasted a year and then I got sick of living in the South and moved back and so and started hanging with all the same people again. (Laughing). But yes. See I intend to phone (ph) about that but what can you do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it going to be like without them around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean we're all so busy that I only see once every two weeks or so. So I don't expect there'll be a huge change but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will you be in touch with them much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're going to try to stay in touch but I'm not very good at that and neither are they so I'm not going to get my hopes up too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you not talking about how sad this is going to be? [00:06:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Figured I'd ask. Try to think that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'll certainly miss them and I'm sad they're moving. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when you say things like I'm trying not to think about it and there's a little bit of - I mean you can think the reasons for moving are stupid regardless of how much of attitude that may remain, but there was a bit of a deal at least it seems to me that it was probably because you were upset at them moving. Like that added a little bit of deal to the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Critical thought about their reasons I guess. And then, you said I really don't see her for two weeks anyway. It all sort of sounds like dancing around how it's going to suck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But on the other hand if I think too much about how it's going to suck that whole - I'm worried that that will cause my productivity to collapse even more since work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Although it's not possible to be less productive than I've been the last couple of weeks so, maybe that's just a rationalization for my desire to be in denial about my feelings. [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like you're worried that if you get tattered down about them going it would make it even harder to work. It sounds like I guess that's probably part of why you don't want to think about and I guess I imagined one of the things you said is also that you're not supposed to be sad or upset about things like this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's not so much I'm not supposed to as being sad or upset won't do me any good, right? And I've already had the conversation with Trish that I'm going to miss her and I would be thrilled if she decided not to move and would love it if she decided to stay here but, she's moving anyway. So what good would it do to get sad and upset about it or at least to dwell on being sad and upset about it when that's not going to change anything? And I realize how I run and [inaudible at 00:10:17] since I dwell on plenty of other things I can't change. [00:10:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it also seems to me that acknowledging you're sad and paying attention to being sad aren't necessarily the same as dwelling on being sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I'm not sure where to draw the line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess something else inherent in this is the idea like paying attention about how sad you are about it would not make you feel any better. I mean, a lot of times for people it can be almost like metabolism or metabolizing something, like the feeling stay with it or stuck with it for a while and then it lives with it or it gets better. Does it work that way for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it's really hard for me to admit to feeling anything other than anger or frustration or - yes, pretty much anger and frustration - and those tend to stick and get worse the more I think about them. [00:12:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're kind of sticky. And I know this may sound tiresome but what do you mean they get worse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I get angrier or more frustrated. Like something that starts out as a minor irritation the more I think about it the more it grows. Well here's an example. My dad wants to take the family vacation this summer. And he's been talking about this since last summer and he hasn't decided where he wants to go yet. Maybe Asia, maybe Australia, maybe Europe. He doesn't know. And he hasn't set dates for the trip yet. And my middle sister and I are both interviewing for jobs. And my younger sister and my mom both have jobs where they have to put in months in advance for leave time. [00:14:02]</p>

<p>He hasn't picked dates yet and this is irritating and when this song and dance first started in January it was like Dad, this is really irritating. You need to pick a date because if you don't I'm not going to be able to go because I might need to take leave, I need to interview for jobs and tell them when I can start. Mom and Jane need to put in for leave. And he just hasn't picked dates. And every time I think about it I get angrier. So now it's not just Dad's being irritating but oh my God. He's the worst person in the world and I am so mad I can't even bring myself to talk to him because he's so selfish and not even concerned about the rest of us. I mean I went on a rant for easily about 10 minutes about this to Dave last night. I suppose that's not a good example because the situation hasn't ended yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess I'm also imagining that being angry at your dad may be a very important special case. (Laughing). You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fair enough, fair enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean if to pick a silly domestic example, like if Dave left dishes in the sink or didn't do something for you he said he was going to do, I don't know, is it the same? [00:15:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually yes. His big thing is he'll come home from yoga practice and strip off his sweaty nasty yoga clothes in the living room and drape them over our living room chair to dry. And drape his yoga mat over the coffee table. And I've asked him a jillion times not to do that. Hang them up in the bathroom, Goddamn it. And he keeps doing it every time. And this is rather minor as irritations go, I mean, it's not like he's letting smelly garbage pile up or anything. But yes, it'll be the first time I walk past it it'll be an irritation, and then the second time I walk past on the same night I'll be really irritated, and by the fourth time I'm picking them up and slinging them down the hallway and yelling at him at the top of my lungs and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But yes, as did the last one. It's probably like you're getting angry because he hadn't fixed it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but if I haven't mentioned it to him until the fourth time I get annoyed and start throwing it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yes. But what about when it's over? What about when he says oh, you know, yes, you're right, or whatever he says, and picks it up and puts it out of the way some place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, once I don't see it any more I don't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although now I'm getting angry. This has happened several dozen times and he still hasn't learned not to keep his sweaty yoga clothes in the living room. It's gross.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he hasn't seemed to have gotten the message or something. [00:18:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And the thing with Trish and Mark is Trish gets avoidance in the same way in many of the same kinds of things that I do, which means after - we haven't seen each other in a month because after the last time we saw each other and I had opened the conversation about what are we going to do when you leave, it was left unresolved. It was basically, I think, filed emotional I love you, I love you too. I'm going to miss you. I don't know what to do about this. Long distance relationships are hard, what can we do, open-ended and - and then she didn't get in touch with me for 2-1/2 weeks.</p>

<p>And I didn't want to push the issue and contact her because I didn't want to be too pushy because she's the one who wants - she's the one driving the move and having been in her position before I definitely didn't want to come across as I'm being queen, I don't want you to move and oh my gosh don't leave me. So I was waiting for her to contact me and it took her 2-1/2 weeks to do so because she was stressed and overwhelmed by preparing for the move and things were going crappy for her at work and - yes, so... And I see (inaudible) relationship difficult the fact that we're both - both of us when we get stressed we just shut down communication, which if we're both stressed at the same time means...[00:20:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't work so well. I know it's switching gears a little bit but I guess I'm mindful that you both today and yesterday brought up the issue of your work and we got into talking about other things, which is fine with me but I don't want giving it self-importance and pressing like I don't want to be meandering away. It's up to you. I guess I want to raise the prospect of talking about it seeing as you brought it up a couple of times and really bothering you a lot it seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean if, how do I want to say this? I want to talk about in a productive way but I feel like I'm very [inaudible at 00:22:05] falling into the gaping pit of beating myself up for not getting enough done and I don't think that would be useful. [00:22:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or put it another way I haven't really found anything further to say and then I'm angry and frustrated at myself and don't understand what's going on. I'll be happy to hear your thoughts on the matter but I think anything else I have to say would just be repeating that sentiment in different sentiments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yet it's not yet clear to me what's going on there. I mean it's very clear to me that you beat yourself up a lot; it's very clear to me that you're really shut down around it. It seems to me that you're really at war with yourself over it, like there's clearly one part of you that absolutely, positively does not want to work and kind of shuts down much of the time whenever there's work in front of you, and another part of you that is exasperated and infuriated by this. [00:24:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think last week you described them as the parent and the toddler.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I guess it seems that way to me. Yes. But I'm not sure quite what else to say. I mean I guess I was struck by the metaphor you just used, like the gaping pit of beating yourself up because those are two very different things, gaping pits and beating yourself up. I think I know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's easy to fall into that pit and once I do it's really hard to get out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you know, as I think about it's actually exactly what you're saying about being angry at your dad or Dave with the yoga mat and picking up the clothes in the living room. Where when you start to get more wound up and angry you really get stuck in it. And it sounds the same. I could imagine worse with beating yourself up. Another thing that seems the same to me with the family trip, yoga stuff and the move is that you're kind of being ignored or what you want I think really feels like it's being ignored. [00:26:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess in terms of those three cases what I want is actually quite reasonable. I don't know if it's quite reasonable to want someone not to move when they think they need to, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I think it's completely reasonable to want it. I mean to expect it or demand it is something else but to want it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. But I think it's totally reasonable to expect or demand that the yoga clothes be tossed [inaudible at 00:27:14].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely, no, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my dad told us - like I think we can quickly find a man's mink.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think with that I completely agree. The only thing I was taking exception to was of course you don't want them to leave. But I see your point. I think we're actually going to go from the same page of that part again. Yes, yes. He was making a marriage contract in there about stinky yoga clothes on everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) I think what this one said is honor and respect, yes. It's not like it stays in the locker room in the yoga studio. He's just really, really self-conscious about his body hair and so he doesn't like changing or showering in the locker room with the other guys. He has a lot of hair. He's a hairy beast. [00:28:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's very self-conscious about it? How do you think that makes him feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And once he's walked home his clothes are wet and clammy and gross. I totally sympathize with him just wanting to take them off and get in the shower but given that he's heading to the shower anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes, right. Right, it can't be that far of a detour to the laundry basket.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't even mind if he wanted to just like throw them over the shower curtain rod or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So why is he throwing you on this one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I really have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that like him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The ignoring me is not like him. I mean leaving his clothes all over the house, in general being slovenly about his appearance...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Is it contentious between you in other ways as well? Like the slovenliness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was and then I won the argument we've been having for six months over whether to get a housekeeper or not. And now the housekeeper keeps his slovenliness corralled, so... [00:30:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Glad that worked out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not as if I'm a neat freak either but both my father and Dave's mother are hoarders, Dave's mother more worse than my father. Her house is a nightmare. She has piles of stuff everywhere. There's nowhere for me and Dave to sleep when we go to visit because she's taken the beds out of their two guest rooms in order to make more room for her piles of crap so I sleep on the twin bed that Dave had when he was a kid and he sleeps on the couch. Like there isn't even enough floor space for us to inflate a double-sized air mattress. The stairs are covered in stuff. There's a path about this wide up the stairs. It's horrible.</p>

<p>And my dad has the same tendencies, although not as extreme as Dave's mom but he still - my dad collects all kinds of stuff. Our house is a nightmare. Piles of stuff everywhere. It's just, it's — I've gotten terrified of ending up like that and I can see in myself hoarding instincts. Like it's very hard for me to throw away things, I like collections, I like complete collections. And so I'm really harsh with myself and make myself throw away a lot and declutter my areas of the house a lot and not hang onto stuff and get rid of stuff because I'm terrified of ending up with piles of stuff. And narrow, inch-wide walkways through the house are my nightmare.</p>

<p>And Dave also has both these same tendencies. He keeps stuff; he doesn't like to throw things out. He likes to collect stuff but he doesn't ever get rid of stuff or declutter. He just collects and collects and collects.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:32:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's messy about it. He doesn't put things away, he leaves things everywhere and I'm not. I'm not perfect. I certainly generate my fair share of the clutter but it's like Dave doesn't even see the mess sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is what it sounds like to me. I mean that makes me think of your work. This is how I imagine it's like for you to try to work. Your headspace with your work is every bit as cluttered as Dave's mom's house. And it's all sorts of things I guess mostly infuriating. I mean in other words wherever literally you are, I would imagine when you're sitting in front of the work there's just like there's so much history and so much resentment and so much shame and so much frustration all piled up around you all the time that it's incredibly difficult and claustrophobic or incredibly it's all crowded around you. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Interesting analogy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes and I get it a little bit because it [inaudible] thinking about things like hoarding and obsessionality (ph) relief and anger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But I don't know. We also [inaudible at 00:34:03] together. We were talking about it. Or, for that matter, I guess I imagined thinking about your dad or being angry at your dad is like that as well. It's like what pile of stuff do you start with? (Laughing). [00:34:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) Yes. Start with my father sitting over on his piles of stuff. He constantly yells at my mom for generating clutter and making a mess in the house and I mean, I don't know. My mom doesn't collect stuff. She doesn't hoard things. But she is filthy, disgusting. Like she won't clean the kitchen, she'll leave food out on the stove overnight and then eat it cold from the pot for breakfast the next morning and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like really unhygienic and ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's gross. Like there's green mold growing on her bathroom sink and it's, it's nasty. But my dad will just keep generating piles of clutter. And he'll have - he's completely taken over the planning desk in my parent's kitchen, half the counter space in my parent's kitchen has been taken over by his stacks of imported papers. Half the couch seating space is covered with his papers. He's got stacks of papers next to the couch, on the side table by the couch, overflowing the coffee table, under the coffee table, overflowing the computer desk in the den.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What papers are these?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Receipts. Anything he's ever bought in the last five years he's saved the receipts. Bank statements, statements from his brokerage accounts, old journals of professional magazines. He subscribes to newspaper articles that he thinks are interesting and doesn't want to lose track of. Coupons, some of which are 10 years old that he might use one day. Clippings of recipes from newspapers that he wants my mom to make. It's just, it's a mess. [00:36:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he'll sit there in his throne in the middle of the living room - it's actually an armchair but he sits on it like a king in his palace, or a dragon on his hoard - and will complain about how messy everything is and why can't you people keep things clean and look at how much stuff is all over the floor. And it's all his stuff. But there'll be one piece of mail my mom left or one of my mom's library books sitting on top of his pile of shit and all of the sudden he yells at mom, you're such a mess. You're such a slob. Why can't you clean up? And it's like seriously?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes it sounds like it's almost delusional. I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds pretty crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. This whole thing, the family vacation, made me remember the thing my dad used to say about my grandmother. And dad holds a grudge even worse than I do. It's where I get it from. And until this week when I have this insight, I had always subscribed to dad's understanding of this incident. So what happened was I was eight years old and we were living in Missouri and my sisters were four and nine months old. And we were moving South and for whatever reason, I have no - I don't think I ever knew. I mean this was not a case of me forgetting but I don't think I ever knew - but my parents had trouble fixing the date for our move, like getting the moving company and scheduling the actual date. And my grandparents were going to fly out to be extra drivers for the cars and help bring the kids on the drive. [00:38:31]</p>

<p>And the way my dad tells it, my grandmother said it's not like I work in a hospital. My job is important and I can't take time off so we just can't help you move. But they did come help us move. And given the whole fiasco with his not fixing a date for this trip for summer, what I suspect actually happened was it's not like I'm a salaried worker and the head of my department and I can just take vacation time. I have to schedule time off because I'm a wage earner (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the way my dad phrases it, my grandmother's like being an operator at the phone company is so much more important than being a doctor and I'm more important than you, which...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I waited [inaudible at 00:38:31]. So like he describes it like she was being very haughty and dismissive of him and what he does as compared to what she does. But you think what probably happened is that she was just saying it was harder for her and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he needed to fix some dates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because they did end up coming and helping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes, you evaluating that made me think some other things that happened around the same time in my life. Things like my mom's grandfather died earlier that year and my dad tried to talk her out of going to the funeral.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? [00:40:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it was too expensive to travel and he needed her here and her grandfather wasn't even that nice to him so why should they spend that money going to see the family. And funerals aren't really for the dead they're for the living and you can honor him here and...Or, you know, my dad would tell my mom not to call her parents. If they really loved her they would call her. That drive was really where the infamous fistfight over American versus Japanese happened. And after that, we didn't visit my grandparents and they weren't welcome in our house for another four years before that. And then my dad only let them in the house because he was going on a job interview and the people interviewing him wanted him to bring his wife and my parents didn't want the expense of a household traveling with kids. So my dad actually had the balls to call my grandparents and ask them to come baby-sit without ever apologizing [inaudible at 00:41:24].</p>

<p>I was just thinking, you know, it's not just that my dad was a crappy parent; he's a crappy husband also. Like if Dave pulled even a tenth of that shit on me, well we never would've gotten married in the first place. My parents married seven months after they met [inaudible at 00:41:45]. Dave and I had known each other for eight years, dating for four when we got married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why did your parents marry so quickly after meeting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was just what they're - well my mom's families and her friends when she was growing up and my dad's culture courtships were fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's actually -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty respectable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, all of my mom's cousins and her brother got married within about a year and a half of meeting their spouses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it wasn't anything significant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now. We'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:42:46]</p>

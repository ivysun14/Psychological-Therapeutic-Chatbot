<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: This is the 19th Interview, this is Interview Number 19.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking I really don't have much to say, I mean I guess I should think about it. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just one of those days where I just don't have; I mean there's just other than talking about him...those particular [fun points,] (ph) um, except kind of with my basic hassle with sex has been cropping up pretty bad now, which is discomforting, but I really think that a great deal of it is going through this bladder (ph) thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, because that, that's really frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, you were sick, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The bladder thing, right, and I still have it and sometimes it causes me a great deal of discomfort during and after intercourse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my whole feelings about sex with (ph) is back and that the only thing I can do is try and cure it, which I've been trying to do for over (chuckling) a year and a half, um, but in the meantime it just leave me really in a strange position and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does, what do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know how much of what I feel is a reaction from the illness and how much of it is what I really feel, um, is that I, I really don't know my sexual reactions at all. I'm getting closer to them I think just by being more honest within myself and more honest with Murphy, but it's very hard and it's very discomforting and it just seems like our needs are so completely different as to make it very difficult. I mean the way it looks now I don't know if they really are, I just notice that I really don't, I don't like having sex much. Usually afterwards it hurts, it seems to me there's a connection between those two things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it doesn't hurt him and he does want to have sex often. And, and it just leaves me feeling very strange, as if there is something wrong with me emotionally and... [overlapping voices at 0:02:45.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Emotionally and it's not just a matter of this disconnection...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...between pain and sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, are you, I mean and you're like you're kind of saying that there's kind of a conditioned thing, like you have a kind of conditioned fear of sex now... [0:03:12.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Oh, yeah.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because of so much, after it that then you're in pain, right? Um, but what I can't tell or what I'm not sure about is whether you mean that's still continuing so that there's still that rational basis that when you sleep with him, when you have sex with him then that means that you're going to hurt, feel hurt, feel pain...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or whether it's kind of just from back there I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a combination of both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I have less pain than I have had in like the past year, like it really looks like maybe in a few months it will like go away, (chuckling) then when we knew what to do, like there was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At one time you would've known what to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I was really, really freaked out that it didn't hurt but like there was just no sensation of pain in it and there was this, I, I kind of remember myself thinking, "Hey, this is nice." You know but it was just really weird because I had completely forgotten what it felt like not to hurt in the middle and not to be uptight about it and it was just, it was just a completely different feeling. It was nice, (chuckling) saying that again and I said, "Yes, this is why people have sex, this is okay!" (both chuckling) You know I was really feeling very strange and I was freaked out, completely freaked out. And, um, it would be nice, okay. Um, but...it was impossible for me to find out and I talked about this once...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then Jesus, why do you sleep with him at all if it really hurts that much every time? I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there are times when it hurts more than others.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like if you're wondering why people - if it hurts or is unpleasant enough that you wonder why people, kind of do wonder why people do this thing...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...all right, what are you doing it for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, there's a certain amount of pleasure in it and there's a certain amount of pleasure in the foreplay which I really like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and also I just realize, um, after a certain point it stops being pleasurable for me and I mean it's kind of a matter of indifference to me whether we continue or not, but it's not a matter of indifference to Murphy and I realize that, and that's one very major reason why I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so there are times when it's been very, very pleasurable and not very painful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in general it's a kind of favor to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and a kind of hoping that this is (chuckling)...this is just really highly touted thing that's supposed to get better, right, I mean it's supposed to be good, um, so let's not give up on it, (chuckling)...sometimes, at times the way I feel about it. Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Do you think that your tension, um, and you're expecting it to hurt makes it worse for you? [0:06:17.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (big sigh) sometimes yes and sometimes no, I mean that's directly related to how much it hurt the last time. And there are also all these signs I can tell before and just during the day whether the affection is, is very [bad if at all,] (ph) I mean it's possible for me to tell that this is going to be a really painful intercourse so let's just not do it, um, which...we do and I'm being able to control it by just drinking immense amounts of liquids and it's going to be flushing my system out. And it's strange that I have pleasurable feelings up to a point, at which point it just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, at which point what, you become indifferent or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you become or you start feeling the change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I become indifferent and sometimes at this point I don't feel much pain to allow me to forestall if at all, only towards the very, very end, um, the pain usually comes about five or ten minutes afterwards which colors the whole thing in my mind...just looking back at the good feelings that I do have and just kind of the warmth, it kind of just becomes very resentful if I hurt a lot, I mean I just, I just, I kind of just turn a different color and it makes me very bitter when it, when I start to hurt a lot. Um, I really wonder if just exactly...what my sexual reactions are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean whether you kind of basically need to find...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or I just have a very low-key sex drive. Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well but if, um, [you finally have time,] (ph) if you, um, had a good time, so I mean with Murphy every time you slept with him would you still only want to do it once a week or once a month or whatever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, um, and it's really hard to tell because before I got this infection, I mean I was so, there were so many strange things happening in my head built around sex that it was impossible for me to tell what my real reactions were, I mean it was taking me all this time to break down and...start to get at how I'm really reacting. I think and kind of the way I react is if...um, I said that I really didn't want to have sex a lot because the bladder thing is acting up or something like that, um, and I feel, and I start to feel okay physically, what happens is I get intensely (chuckling) horny, and we have sex and I'm fine. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ...I could go like about once or twice a week and then I just get these flashes and rages (ph) and so that's it. [0:09:19.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if you think that it's good, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, even if it's good, and I'm perfectly happy that way...just to have the really close physical contact in a very, in a very comforting way that's not particularly sexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The rest of the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, that's perfectly satisfying to me; I mean that's perfectly fine. Um, see the problem is I never quite know whether I react that way because what usually happens is any sort of sexual activity leads to intercourse eventually, I mean within the space of a day, um, for me at this point and, and whether I'm just taking it a step further saying, "Well if I mess around here then we'll sleep together and it will hurt." I mean I don't know, I mean I'm really confused as to whether [to say about it.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want to really talk about it. It seems like that one way of telling that is to do an experiment on it, and I think it's one of the things you aren't exactly wanting to do, um, which is to disconnect those things, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, and not to have, not to mean that if you started fooling around or doing kind of foreplay things that that is going to mean that you're going to have or are given sexual intercourse after that, um, it appears that what that comes up against is your feelings of obligation to Murphy then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah. Um, I mean that is something I'd like to do, I'd like to disconnect those things and I'd kind of like, I'd kind of like to take the system apart and just stick it back together and see it clear, I mean where it will...clean out pipe and things (chuckling) like that and make it all flow nicely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but that's very difficult because I'm just not working with me, I'm working with somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could do it if I were kind of like sleeping around...where I had no feeling of obligation to whoever I was with and then I could be very...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's funny, I would've thought it would be the opposite because with someone you're just sleeping with, sleeping around with and kind of have, you have to fill your obligations to keep on seeing them, in an ordinary sense they aren't so willing to make allowances unless they're really after your ass. (both chuckling) And, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well like it depends on the situation, I mean it's possible to do that, I mean it's, it's not nice, (chuckling) I mean but it's possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, but it seems to me that it's, I mean in seeing where I think it's less possible in an ongoing relationship. See and I would...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really confusing because, and like I threw out just there some very basic things which are, which are very strange, which I don't like about it, I mean it's kind of on the level of, well I can do that depending on how much I'm putting out but I'm not putting out much and it's not really very fair to him. [0:12:25.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're not putting out much what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just raw sex, I mean if we're just not having much sex, and he's really frustrated for me to say, "Let's start playing around a little, let's tumble around in bed and then let's...kind of wonder around." (chuckling) But it's really nasty! I mean that's really kind of the way I feel about it because that's kind of what I've been told by him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it's kind of nasty. I mean that it's very difficult for him...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're tantalizing him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and that's not going to get where I want to go. I mean that is, that is going to turn him on and that is going to want him, want, make him want me much more and more often. And what I'm trying to do is kind of disconnect the whole thing and just, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but now you're sounding like what you want is for him to want you less, not for you to do anything about it, but for you to create conditions so that he isn't, uh, wanting you sexually as much, so that he'll come down to your level?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I really don't. Um, it seems to me that's impossible or just, I mean it seems to me there's got to be some kind of compromise just on a practical basis. I mean he's got his sex drives and I've got whatever my sex drives are, I don't know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and that's what I'd like to find out, I mean I really would and that would be enlightening, I mean much easier in that. (big sigh)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do think that the best tactic for you finding that out is to disconnect the two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, um, why I think that is, well that's what Masters and Johnson do with people basically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, and it also seems like that, in your case, would tell you whether, um, well that you're kind of operating under a conditioning...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a conditioning thing or whether there's a more rational basis for it, the more rational basis being that sex now, I mean foreplay now is associated with pain now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, so I guess and I would just like to hear more about why you don't think that's practical and a good thing or something that you could do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What, disconnecting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, yeah, well I don't mean disconnecting but making an agreement and talking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I'm going to try it out, I mean I'd have to talk to Murphy about it and see how he reacts. Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it seems like you had more reason, you weren't just saying, well like...we'd have to talk about it of course until we can... [overlapping chuckling] ...but you're saying that you were kind of reluctant or didn't think it was really fair to him? [0:15:31.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know, see that's, that's the whole problem, um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you owe him something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I, and I never quite know exactly what...the sexual obligations of the woman is, if there even is such a thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I feel my emotional reactions are that usually it always happens, as much as I can remember, um, after a certain point it's just my obligation to continue, um, it's not necessarily my desire to and my pleasure but just something, well I've gotten into it this far and it's just something much easier to just finish it than to cut it off. And I've, I got into one really horrible, hideous situation [with women,] (ph) absolutely the worst experience (chuckling) of my life with having sex...um, and it, it doesn't matter particularly who it is either. Um, and with Murphy I just feel it more keenly because I do feel very close to him and I do feel for him, um, and it's impossible for me to know the truth. I mean how much of it is the truth that, that men just kind of lay on, on women and how much of it is an actual physical need of theirs and, and...just, just their desire?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I get completely contradictory information [from him,] (ph) um, from really the same source on it and, um, and it confuses me, I, and I end up feeling obligated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the fact you don't exactly end up confused, you end up making it one source of information just rather than asking...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...him...if it's that men have to deal with all this and they have a much stronger sexual drive and it's very demanding and it should be [your place to...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right and that it... [overlapping voices at 0:17:38.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[even if it makes you uncomfortable?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...after a certain point - right, and then after a certain point it's painful, physically painful for them to stop and very uncomfortable. Um, it's also very emotionally trying, I mean when you stop in the middle and say, "Hey, cool it, I don't feel like it, (chuckling) turn over on your back and go to sleep."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, well there's other things to do than flop over on your back and go to sleep...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of course, right, besides just straight...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...straight... [inaudible at 0:18:03.9] ...I mean there's other things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...right, but the, I mean but it's strange, it may just be the men that I've associated with but I've, the, my sexual orientation would've, I mean what I know of it, the last thing it's oriented towards is genital, I am just not genitally sexually oriented. The act of intercourse in itself is not particularly satisfying to me but every male that I've ever had sexual relations of any sort with has always been very genitally oriented, um, and, and that that creates a problem and that's where the obligation kind of fits in. Um... [0:18:57.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. But doesn't that mean that they should be doing other things for you? I mean maybe you should be doing something for them but like I don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yes, but they do up to a certain point. I mean at which point they just do, (chuckling) I mean they just become so genitally oriented, I mean at a certain point very close to climax, um, for the man. I mean my experience has been that they just really become totally encompassed that way, um, and I just don't, I mean I, I find it (chuckling) very boring at times but, and so actually I become bored. It's the same thing that happens when it...the one or two times that I've tried to masturbate and I just got bored and I stopped, (chuckling) and thinking it just was nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and this has always been presented to me as a physical reality, kind of that the physical reality is that the man is genitally oriented, um, and my experiences has always been from, from the sort of sex that men seem to enjoy the most that it's very heavily genitally oriented.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so I end up kind of under an obligation after a certain point to just continue in that way but that it's not satisfy to me, it's not even very interesting to me. It's not; it's not interesting to me at all. (chuckling) Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound like you just, um, realized that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean kind of where, going around it without actually coming at it and then I just didn't want to say it like for a really long time, maybe a couple of months, but that's not what interests me about sex at all. I've now question what does but I'm pretty, I mean...I kind of have some feelings about what does, I mean I have definite thoughts but I think that's really interesting. Kind of what happens I think with this, it's sort of a vicious circle, um, in order for me to get any real pleasure out of sex it has to be really, really [in the moment,] (ph) and what's happened since I've been sick is that I just can't because it really starts to hurt after maybe the first five or ten minutes and so I push and Murphy comes, and what's happened - and also because I've been hurting we've had sex a lot less often and so that when we do have sex he comes much quicker, and so each time I become less and less satisfied when it gets shorter and shorter. Um, I mean that it's just this incredible, [so boring,] (ph) I mean it's just turning into something I don't, I don't recognize at all, I mean it's not, these, these aren't the sexual... [0:22:46.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...reactions that I built up to show, um, and I don't think they're my real sexual reactions either, I mean they're just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...they just seem to be so much based around, around my particular physical condition right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you find that they're really atypical and don't, and [so you don't know if they are true or?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know whether they are, I mean they're just, they're just something that I'm, I'm just not used to, I mean even after, after he... [overlapping voices at 0:23:13.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm and they're circumstantial, but they're circumstantial and when the circumstances change that will help more than most things, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Are you getting cured, I mean just by that, what I mean, (chuckling) are you going to a doctor and [has he been able to help you?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I've been going to a doctor for, I've been, I went to several specialists, like a gynecologist here and the urology department here, in fact. Um, they did all kinds of tests and they stuck things inside of me and they took this thing and they took that, and it was really very, it was moderately unpleasant. And (chuckling) what happened was, as I was having a particularly uncomfortable day, I got a jubilant telephone call from the urologist telling me I was cured, (chuckling) telling me that all my bacteriological tests had proved that I had nothing anymore! And I said, "Listen, I'm in a great deal of discomfort." And he said, "Well, you're cured." And hung up and that was it, and so like...I've been taking this medicine and, um, I think what's happening is that since I've gotten off the pill and I'm drinking a lot of liquids and I haven't been taking the antibiotics much but I've just been, um, just drinking a lot and keeping it in my system, just flushing it out all the time, but yeah, I think I'm getting better and I'm thinking it has to do with the pill.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I figured what was happening was that I was just taking so many antibiotics that they weren't cleaning (ph) out, I was just swallowing four a day and I think that that was just, just having an effect, so I stopped taking them and...just started drinking a lot of water.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you're not going to a doctor now, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think there's nothing they can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you sure?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Positive, I've been to all of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But...but you've, I mean you've been to billings and they haven't been able to do anything but that doesn't mean anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but I have friends who have the same thing and have had it for like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You're sure...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...three to four or five years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because I don't know about the advisability of just doctoring it yourself. I don't like doctors too much but, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But see the thing is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because sometimes I think it's a serious interference with your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but see the thing is that when I first came down with this and they, they said that the main thing that they would give me all these hot-shot antibiotics but what I had to do and what was the most important thing was drink a gallon of water a day... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which I did, and within a day and a half I began to feel much better. Um, and...it was impossible when I really got it the first time and I just couldn't move, I was just going crazy. [0:25:50.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and the best cure for it is just a lot of liquids, just continually - what happens is you literally, you wash the bacteria out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and that's all they're telling me to do. And you've got all these medicines, good, because you usually take them and drink water with those. And I've learned some things from various doctors, and one doctor told me to be sure and urinate after sex, which I do now, which does help, um, otherwise it's impossible I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd love to, and I really loved, I mean like I've had all kinds of interesting thoughts about this (chuckling) and I'd really love to take a survey, a medical survey if that were possible, and find out whether this is a recent illness or not, um, and then like if 75 percent of Victorian women had this problem it explains a lot... (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know and things like that, um, but there's a theory afoot that it comes from chlorinated water, that it comes from having too many chemicals in the water, which is, is a really appalling (ph) thing because women would get it much more than men that way, just from bathing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and not (ph) taking showers and it could be you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, yeah, I mean that it's getting much better, I mean like actually, there was actually a week where I thought it was gone and what I just really wonder is why it came back, (chuckling) um, and so that I stopped drinking a lot of water. (chuckling) Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, anyway, okay, so you, it's kind of going away...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you expect it to be gone...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in a couple of months?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I hope it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's your problem, knowing whether just to ascribe your problems with sex solely to this disease?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't know if...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's going to be gone in two months or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that leaves you uncertain and what does it do to your reactions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (yawning) Um, well kind of what's happening with my actions is even though I feel and to admit that I'm reacting because of all of the infection, um, I'm starting to react that way anyway, just kind of as personal honesty within myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And explaining to Murphy kind of what's happening is, "I'm not reacting to you, I'm reacting to my own body."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And trying to get him to understand that and to deal with that and really, um, just not to become upset when a lot of the times I just don't want to go on every time and I'm just not sexual attracted, and it's because I'm just feeling sick and I'm hurting, um, and that that does not mean he's not attracted   to me, which is the problem we've come into time and time again, he feels that he's not being, but that I'm not attracted to him and that that's a great problem. [0:28:49.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you really think it's that that's not or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I, I don't know. There are times when, yes, I am sexually attracted to him and there are times when, no, I am just not sexually attracted to him at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I still love him a great deal, and if, and when there are times when I'm not sexually attracted to him I still enjoy being with him very much and it does upset me. I mean it doesn't really upset me as me, it upsets me in relation to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It screws up more like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with what's happening between you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I mean I get upset because of his reactions to how I'm feeling and now I am upset with my own reaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I think there are just times I look...and I say he's great and think it's probably some of my own, an unknown attraction, I mean...I'm all right...even if he looks skinny and scrawny and rather stupid. (chuckling) And the next morning he just looks really, really fine and I just feel really good, um, and that it just didn't upset me at all, but it upsets him. And I guess I'm more used to living with my moods (chuckling) than he is, um, really, I mean it sometimes just comes down to the little [question that depends on how my mood, I mean if I'm overreacting it's possible] (ph) (chuckling) and he might as well forget it. Um, and it was just starting to be a fact (ph) to me now though that I've really been dieting seriously for a while and it looks like I will for a while longer, that getting him to realize there are two factors that have to be dealt with, that it's not necessarily him and him that rules, always influencing how I'm reacting to him, that often it's just, just I'm either hurting or else I am ferociously hungry and I hate everything, snap. Um, and it's very hard because like usually what happens is he gets upset at a time where I'm being cranky (chuckling) and...I'm very pissed that he's not realizing what's happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but this and it doesn't happen too frequently but it does happen, I mean the hungrier I become the more impossible I am to get along with, um, the more really cranky I get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it appears that when there's external factors...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like you can ascribe you're not feeling, not wanting sex with him or, like a moment ago, you can ascribed it to your particularly bad disease, and like, um, you don't have any problems about doing something about it... [inaudible at 0:31:38.5]...is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's other times... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, where I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...where it really is personal, um, in a sense...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...um, and those are the times when you don't kind of think you should act on them, I mean? [0:31:56.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It hurts him and I mean very basically hurts him emotionally. Um, he's often, in many ways got, is insecure about himself and especially when it's personal and that makes it very difficult. Um, because he's much more secure and he's much happier with himself when he is getting it, um, and I wouldn't damage that for the world really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you mean you wouldn't do things, um, that would undermine, that would have the effect of undermining him, even if you don't mean them to or you think you mean something quite different about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, yeah, I mean I can see why anybody wouldn't do something on purpose to damage someone and be careful not to do that. But the situation you're describing sounds like is one where you're saying that he reacts badly to things that you don't mean badly, and if you mean different you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...even with I guess the thing about attractiveness, sometimes I'm sure you don't mean it to be a personal...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, not at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...um, thing. And he takes it as one...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and reacts to it as if it's one, but that's not how you mean it though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it isn't at all, and it isn't how I mean it at all. I mean I mean it, I mean it's just not a barometer of my "love".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when he keeps thinking it is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is upsetting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then he's wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're going to stop saying things, those things, even though you think he's wrong to take them that way and even though that you claim that he puts great cost on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, usually I don't deal with this in a straightforward way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh! (both chuckling) [overlapping voices at 0:34:22.3]...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]... See usually what I do is I hide behind the physical condition, where I really don't feel like, um, when it's really like in an indirectly a personal reaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, so there's not anything to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right or I just say, "Well look, I don't feel like it, my stomach is upset." Or I really feel like that the infection is kicking our buts and that's not okay. Um, but it upsets me that he does take it in that way and I don't know... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then to work around that the way you do...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:34:56.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to get in your moods, what kind of solution is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. I mean I haven't come up with a solution and I don't like that at all, I really don't. Um, I more often saying, "I just don't feel like it right now." Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But one, it's easier not to say that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so just kind of being less personal I guess; and two, you don't feel guilty about doing that, about rejecting him that way, like you do if you... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel less guilty...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...than if I were just to say, "I don't want you right now" or "you're not attractive to me right now and I just want to be by myself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. How come that doesn't count as a good a reason as sickness or something if it's basic in a sense... [overlapping voices at 0:36:02.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's strictly built around his reaction, he reacts differently, I mean really stupid, I mean he can accept sickness and he finds it very difficult to, to accept, um, that he's not attractive by then and he gets very upset, he gets very down, he gets very depressed. That's pretty much, and that's pretty intolerable when I'm in a mood where I don't want to have to hassle with him very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that makes it really, really difficult because right now, that I just don't think the idea is, something's not clicking in me right then and basically what is happening is I want him to do his business and let me do mine and if I say that in so many words there is, it is then followed by an hour of real confrontational fighting and I feel that we, um, which to me isn't very effective, which seems to have just totally muddied the entire situation. I mean it starts creating all kinds of false situations on this completely temporary structure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it builds into a crisis very easily, and it's not!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's not for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and that it won't be tomorrow for him either because I'll be feeling completely differently, I think, I mean I, I guess for him it is a crisis and every time this happens it's, it's very, very difficult for him. Um, I guess it hurts him when this happens and then like, and I don't quite know how to deal with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be better to be lied to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it will? [0:37:57.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that really doesn't help much because he usually knows what's happening I mean, um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if your lies worked then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, they very rarely do (chuckling) so I really can't define that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: but then you, so why do you keep hoping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could see keeping, in a sense keeping on doing it if they worked but if they really don't work what's the point?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't know, I mean it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're kind of saying a euphemism instead of say it truly...it becomes a euphemism to say you're sick...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...unless you say, "We're ready!" (both chuckling) [Instead of saying, "You're just not up for it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Um, I keep on doing it because it seems to me much simpler not to have, to have to deal with so many reactions and interrelations which I, I don't understand, um, and which I don't seem, I've never seemed to have been able to really deal with and it would just be juggling around all of these feelings for one another and all these confusions and creating more confusions. I get very confused and now I'm completely confused right now. Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't see how it creates, um, less confusions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't really but I seem to think it does. I mean, I mean that's just the way I feel about lying, I mean that's kind of just the way I've always felt about lying, it does create more confusions but I don't lie in that way, I mean in the hopes of creating less, because there have been times when it has, um, and I don't like it, I dislike it a lot. When I think about it, it upset very much because like I've gotten to the point where I just don't know when I'm lying and when I'm not, which is...my basic sexual habit (ph), I don't know what my sexual triumphs (ph) are, I don't know when I'm lying and when I'm not and I would very much like to know, I mean just so that I could then deal with them in some sort of permanent way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Okay, so you've found in this very lack (ph) consequences to your lying about your sexual needs...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean just meaning what kinds of things like maybe we've been talking about, about you being, not being able to refuse (ph) so, I mean directly? 0:41:07.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and kind of feelings of obligation and like just a feeling of distrust in yourself and not...liking yourself afterwards, feeling very, um... [inaudible at 0:41:19.0] ...very dishonest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean not only, not only mentally...but not only mentally dishonest or consciously dishonest but physically dishonest and emotionally dishonest, like no degree of honesty whatsoever. Um, [which is in a way why I start learning] (ph) out of it, I think there have been times with kind of saying, "I don't want to just because I don't want to" has lead to long sessions of kind of - the best way to calm Murphy down was to kind of seduce him, um, which (chuckling) really completely, well it's just...just really is very, very disagreeable on the whole, I mean I just really just disliked what I was doing entirely, um, my motives for doing it and, and actually the fact that I was just actually doing it in that way and it seemed such a bad way to handle everything. (chuckling) Um, well yes, he can be fooled, I mean he can be sexually fooled pretty easily, that's just not hard, that's when it's much harder to tell the truth, much, much more difficult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, difficult in a different way with me, like it just, then I have to deal with him and me, whereas if I lie to him I only have to deal with me. Um, but it's come to the point where, where it's intolerable to deal with myself after that and I just, I just stop and I just have sex and I do that now and I just go crazy, I hate it so much and I just feel so terrible. I mean, um, and I just have, actually just terribly have to get up and go somewhere else and just, just cry because I feel so bad. Um, I haven't told him that in a very long time. But I do feel constantly there's, that there's kind of this way of, of obligation and it's really funny, um, because at times what's happened is, um, we've both felt obligated at the same time about either one of us feeling any real sexual desire under it and that seemed really strange, um, and kind of like when, when he's made some sort of move to me which was not overtly sexual and I interpreted it that way and got my, my head into the thing, "Well now...you kind of should do this" and just continued on that way and then found out (chuckling) later...after we finished and [by that time I listen what happens and say,] (ph) "that was kind of strange" and you discuss it, whereas, as neither one of us wanted it but felt the other did, um, but when it happens it kind of upsets me more. I mean I, I think that's kind of something that strikes me as not very weird but it's just something that happens, um... [0:45:05.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well but it's the... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like a certain way of acting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what happens that upsets me is when I'm really uptight and confused, um, being very, very withdrawn, kind of sexually inhibited without actually being physically inhibited but be more mentally and emotionally inhibited, um, and I psych myself up into this obligation thing. Um, what happens with Murphy is that he becomes very fearful and he becomes very physically withdrawn and inhibited, um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In response to what, by being told?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In response to not knowing how I really feel and then kind of feeling more confusion because he kind of picks it up and knows that I'm confused and, and doesn't know whether I'm hurting or not and doesn't know whether I want him or not, basically because I don't know, and he in turn, um, just becomes very fearful and very inhibited and gets, and he feels all kinds of guilt about causing me pain and, and not knowing how to react to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we're in the situation that's, that just I think upsets me more than any other. And then I, I feel that not only is my body fucking my head up, it's also fucking his head up. I mean before when I was kind of reacting to all these things and I was reacting with a negative approach or with a positive approach or...just feeling that the way he was reacting was correct or incorrect, I was always sure it was the way he was reacting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But what was it that he was reacting to?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well whatever way in which he was reacting, um, that he was feeling put down that I didn't want him right then, that was the, that was the genuine response, that he knew in his mind, he knew how he felt and he was responding as he felt when he really wants me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, you haven't discerned it yet, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You haven't discerned when he wasn't faking it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Um, I mean then that at least, at least one of us knows when, knows what they're doing in the middle of this mess and knows what they want! But just that there's a certain amount of, well I don't think it's that, isn't more that one of, one of, one of us is showing what they want or even getting what they want?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Um, that to me indicates that they know what they want to a certain degree, at least. [0:48:09.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless that it doesn't necessarily mean anything, because that knowing what you want doesn't necessarily lead to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, okay, um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and now it's different, in a way you mean he's hiding too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well when that does happen, and it does at times, um, it like...it is different. Um, I mean my whole sexual hang-up is just built so much around, a lot of it is, is that, the obligation thing is just so closely attached with guilt as to be interchangeable, and it is, it's guilt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not obligation it's guilt. I mean it's obligation when I do it and it's guilt when it's, when I don't. Um, and that's so completely damaging and demoralizing, um, and it frightens me to see myself doing this to someone else, putting them in the position where they feel guilty for everything I do. Um, and it really scares me a lot, because it's playing with kind of sensitivities, I mean it's playing with the [possibility that something is going to happen.] (ph) Um, and I think it comes directly from lying to him, physically lying to him, I mean not wanting him to know how I really feel or worse, being ambiguous, I mean trying, trying very hard to lie to him and just not being able to do it, um, and of course he can tell that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So [I'd like to set,] (ph) to summarize, he, it appears that he doesn't really feel like it's a good inspection (ph) point...</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and you're involved with me now?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't feel that's in your best interest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel like you've done something good when you've fulfilled this obligation or is it [until you finally go for it?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...yeah, a positive... [0:51:14.3]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (4-minute silence, Sigh) Well the thing that I was thinking right at the beginning was uhm, something I can't sort out, then I sort of left it.  (Clears throat) But I think I must have felt I was in some way, being defiant, and I'm not sure, uhm, when you came out to say you were ready.  Uh, I'm not even sure what I did do, but I think I had the feeling that instead of getting up immediately, not saying another word to FEN, or just about that, I sort of saw you were there, and then I, I got up.  But I sort of finished whatever the conversation was we were having.</p>

<p>And uhm, well I think then I assumed you were displeased.  But the thing I, I am not sure of is, I'm not sure exactly what I did, and, and it just seems like it's just different than the way I used to feel, or have always felt before, which was that I'd practically be unaware of FEN, after you came out.</p>

<p>And I immediately thought of something I did once with FHYZ when I was her assistant, that uhm, in a sense, was an act of defiance, and that's why I think I must have felt that way today.  And this was over, it was sometime during the second year, I think, that I'd been with her.  And uh, I don't know, they're just some little things that I was beginning to assert myself on, that before I'd been almost like a slave to her. </p>

<p>And uh, one was, th, this particular instance I think of was when the telephone rang in our room, and I hadn't heard it.  And I was in the middle of telling something and she was she and some other people who were there, were listening.  And she heard the phone.  Instead of just going and getting it herself, she said something to me about it, as if, since you're my assistant, you should go, run over across the hall and get the phone.  And stop what you're saying, and just go.  And I, I don't remember what I said, I don't think I was rude, but I said something that indicated, I don't know, that I was annoyed that she hadn't just gone and gotten it.</p>

<p>And, and that really made her mad, I mean that li—, did make her mad, I wasn't just imagining it.  But it was one of those things that, where I, I know I was feeling defiant, or s—, a—, a—, i—, asserting myself in some way.  And uhm, I don't know, somehow I had that feeling about today.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   All right.  What are you feeling defiant about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, then I think of uhm, (Sniff) I think it must have been at, near the end yesterday.  And I'd been having trouble remembering the end of yesterday when I got home.  I was thinking of some of the things that we said.  And it seemed to me there was something particularly about the very end that I just couldn't remember, and it was bothering me.  And now I find I'm not sure either, what it is that I was trying to remember.    

But uhm, it seems that at some point near the end, I was thinking about wanting to, I, I suppose I was thinking about the way I divided my feelings between you and MSCZ.  And was feeling that I wanted to make love with you here, and that I was being very destructive in my feelings toward MSCZ.  And that they must be part of the same thing, actually.  And uhm, then I don't know, at some point — I think I said this — I started thinking about the idea of just feeling defiant about being a woman.  And actually feeling it was really bad, but then feeling defiant about it.  I don't know, as if the attitude is, well I'll show you, or I, maybe any male, I don't, I'm not sure.  Uhm, that I'm really not what you might think, since I'm a woman.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well then I start thinking about having seen FNI today.  And uhm, as so often happens when I go, she was nursing MYDN.  Uh, and I don't know, I m—, I m—, this is all part of this feeling I've had toward FNI, lately.  But it seems very much this time, instead of finding MYDN ugly and horrible and all, that I think I did recently, uhm, I was just very curious, and i—, as if I were watching FNI do something that was just totally out of my experience. </p>

<p>And then it, other little things would come to my mind, of things FNI knew about, or knew how to do, or I don't know, just that she'd be more capable.  But essentially it was, I don't know, as if I, I just wanted to sit and look and hear anything she had to say about things that would then give me knowledge I didn't have.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I also keep thinking of a feeling I've, I mean it's not a new feeling, but particularly noticed it today, and I think yesterday too.  But uhm, a—, it was one of those times when I'd have the feeling there was something very pressing I should be doing, and I wouldn't be able to think of anything that seemed that pressing, or I don't know, that the things I'd think of didn't seem to be the kind of thing that would give me that feeling.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And w, well, when I think about this feeling and (Clears throat) think about FNI, and what that (Sigh), seeing her sort of vaguely makes me feel, I also sort of mix all this up, with thinking about uhm, last night MSCZ wanted to make love.  And I could tell on one hand that I wanted him to want to.  It was almost like I wanted to be a tease, a, and respond to a certain extent.  But then, I also felt that (Sigh) somehow that I just couldn't do it. </p>

<p>And I don't know, I knew if, if he insisted, then I'd go through my usual performance of getting to the point where he'd just get mad at me.  And then, then I'd, I suppose, that would change things.  I'd be punished, or whatever.  And, I just didn't want to go through that, and he was not upset, or, I mean he didn't like it, but he d—, he didn't just insist, when it was clear that I was either going to have to go through that performance, or I — and if I knew I was going to go through that performance, I don't see why I just wouldn't go through it.  But, well it just made me feel sick to my stomach.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And another thing that bothers me about all this, is one point, he was just saying, "I love you."  And I don't know, I used to get a feeling, or even initiate that type of thing, and feel I really meant it.  And, and I don't know how long now it's been going on, but for some time, whenever he said that, and t—, last night was true of this, I'd get the feeling on the one hand, that I can't believe he really can, because how could he?  I suppose partly, because I'm being so hateful to him, in a way.  And, though sometimes I think sometimes I hide it, and sometimes it's clear, and I deny it.  But uhm, and then on the other hand th, th, the fact that I am being hateful to him, I can't feel in return that I love him.  And — (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, now, what came to my mind, was of, uhm, getting a letter from a friend of mine who's living in PBB.  And (Clears throat) she enclosed some pictures she took last summer, of me and FSO.  And one of the things I was thinking about, was just ho—, I don't know, I suppose how appalled I was at how heavy I looked.  And uhm, well, too, that I, I guess, that I want her to know I'm not so heavy now.  And, and then I just started thinking, that with her, because I was trying to remember if she—, her address is different, and I'd known she'd moved.  But I think if I sent her a card — which I'm, I always do, so I, I think I must have — I would have sent it to the wrong address.  And I was just thinking about that. </p>

<p>And then it made me think of the kind of thing that I often start thinking when I write to her, and it's, I'm not even this much that way when I'm with her, but when I write to her, it's uhm, (Sigh) I just get very, well, seems like, concerned about working, and (Sniff) if I'm not, that I should be showing interest in working.  And uhm, (Pause) well I d—, I don't know, it's, it's as if I get feeling, which in a way that I'm not really feeling, uhm, or at least not as strongly, is that I'll make it sound when I write to her that I'm discontented with the domestic side of my life, and that I want more of a career. </p>

<p>And it must be something to do with just some ideas I have anyway, but, or feelings.  But also the fact that she isn't married and is working, and uhm, doesn't have a family.  So I must somehow feel that that's what, that's almost what she wants to hear, or uh, I don't know, that I'd bore her if I were happy with a more domestic kind of life.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, I think uh, the feeling you had at the beginning, that you were defying me, when you finished whatever you were saying to FEN when I came out, really doesn't have much to do with that.  But what I'm struck by is that after the things I've said, uh, last week or so, it's perfectly clear that I've been calling your attention to your relationship with MSCZ, and how you have avoided it.  And you do exactly the same thing again today.  An encounter last night, and you mention it sort of in between other things.  Then you go off thinking about a friend in PBB.  And it's clear you don't even take seriously what you're saying about it.  That is you know, you're not even sure what you even feel about it.  It's a way to get off the subject.  I think in that sense, you must feel that you are defying me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Now I immediately think of uhm, the times, I don't know for how long, but at least since FSO's been born, whenever MSCZ and I have sort of talked about where we are with each other, and uhm, where he's usually either criticized or complained that I don't seem to be getting anywhere here, I'm not, and, and he puts it, I'm not making enough of an effort, or something.  And then I always have felt very defiant toward him.  And what he's wanted me to talk about is what you've been calling my attention to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, the thing I don't understand, because I remember, I think it was yesterday, thinking about it, and uh, I don't know, this feeling I get, of wanting to talk about it, because I want to change this way of behaving toward him, or feeling toward him.  And yet, on the other hand, then I know I do resist it, because just, when I was coming here today, I was thinking about last night, and well I don't know if I were looking forward to talking about it here, but I was thinking I wanted to, in any case. </p>

<p>And I don't know, almost feeling well, at least I'm more on the subject now than it seems like I have been for a long time.  And uh, feeling sort of hopeful that maybe I will be able to get somewhere this time.  But maybe then, I'm being irresponsible, because I'm thinking you're now bringing my attention to it in a way that, so you're sort of doing it.  But then when I got here, suddenly last night just didn't seem so immediate to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, do you think it's possible, that really, uh, this is the kind of arrangement that you would be, you know, willing to have go on indefinitely?  Because you said some things in the last month or two, well for example, like uh, thinking you wanted to come in and pay me to have fantasies about me, and have it go on forever, and so forth.  That this is a kind of equilibrium that uh, you feel you can live with.  Can, you know, go on forever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not sure, uhm, because part of what I was thinking when I was coming here, and maybe when I, once I got in here I had exactly the reverse feeling.  But uh, in thinking about finally talking about some things concerning me and MSCZ, I somehow have always, or not, I don't know how long, but now, anyway, I feel that that's so central to problems of my own right now.  If I could straighten that out, then I don't know, there'd probably be other things.  But that seems to me to be one of the major things.  And then I was thinking, so I don't know how much longer I'd need to come, after that.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's just what I was meaning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.  And I think then maybe I got kind of scared.  (Silence) Well I also think of uh, (Sniff) I mean, this is part of feeling defiant toward MSCZ and what you were saying.  But uhm, sometimes when we were talking, and I would, I would just think, well it, it's too hard for me to do what MSCZ wanted me to do, and which sometimes I was thinking, and I've said I wanted to do. </p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, it was almost like I wanted to just take time to enjoy fantasizing about you, which I could do only by continuing to come here, and not solve these other problems.  So it was as if MSCZ were saying to me, and perhaps this is the way I felt about your bringing my attention to the problems between us, I mea—, it's literally the same thing, I guess.  That I don't know whether it's that I don't want to be hurried or pushed, or that I'm doing something I want, and in a very selfish way, I want to continue doing it, as I want, until I don't want to any more.  (Sigh, 5-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I, I sort of I guess, I just can't seem to sort out how I'm feeling about this.  Because I, I was just thinking again of this way, I mean, it's very similar to my wanting, and not wanting to talk about MSCZ, my wanting and it seems like, I mean, there are sometimes when I feel as if I want to reach a point where I don't need to come here.  And then, on the other hand, I can't, I don't know if I think of it directly that I want to continue to come forever, except maybe that time I said it.  But it's more, I can't imagine not coming.  And, I don't know, it's almost like, I think nothing will go right, if I don't come. </p>

<p>And yet, then I also have this feeling that if I could talk about MSCZ and work out some of the things that get in the way of our relationship now, that probably then I'd turn more to him, and not need to come so much.  And (Silence) well it seems to get down to, I look at it as replacing you with MSCZ, and I just resist that.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

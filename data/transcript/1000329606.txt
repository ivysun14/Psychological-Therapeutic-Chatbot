<p>PATIENT: (5-minute silence) I was just thinking about the weekend and uhm, something that happened between me and MSCZ is not that unusual, but I suppose I'm a little bit more aware of how I contribute to what happened and uhm, just how we both are reacting to each other.  Because very often when the weekend comes both of us have on our minds the fact that I've made up good reasons why we couldn't have intercourse during the week.  So of course it's on our minds when the weekend comes.  And uhm, if we do have it, then usually, very often, we have a fight afterwards.  Not — well, fight is not the right word but we're both left feeling extremely unhappy about the situation.  And I think MSCZ, more then than any other time, feels a certain lack of respect for him on my part or lack of reaction to him as an individual, which I know is true.  And he gets feeling very upset at this and feels that he has to have self-respect.  So he will respond by, I don't know, withdrawing isn't quite the right word, but in a sense it is, and, and really uh, suggesting that uhm, perhaps our marriage just won't work out and maybe we should just face this or face the possibility anyway.</p>

<p>And it's only then, after he does that, or just after he indicates how unhappy he is and how unwilling he is to continue accepting our relationship as it is, that I can begin to respond to him, really respond to him.  And I just — this weekend, when it happened, I couldn't tell whether it was the fear again — I think I mentioned this — of our marriage not working, or whether I finally have to admit that I need somebody.  Because, for the first time, very often he'll just feel he can't stay in the apartment anymore and he'll go out for a walk.  And I've never — if he goes I've always just been sort of defiant.  And this time I just didn't want him to go and, and I found it very hard to ask him to stay and not go.</p>

<p>So I suppose in a way my whole reaction to him is, in effect, trying to hold back from needing somebody.  And in doing that I, I can see where perhaps I'm saying to myself well, how do I know I need him for the right reasons?  And so maybe I shouldn't need him, because what if it's for the wrong reasons?  Because I would think to myself, well, maybe I just need him because I'm afraid of being alone, and that I really don't care about him.  Because if I really cared about him how could I be the way I am toward him at other times?  And then, even when we were trying to talk about it, just seemed like we were so far apart.  And at one point I just wanted to go, when we were literally across the room, and I just wanted to go sit near him and I found that very hard to do too.  And I had to really make myself do, I mean it was what I wanted to do, but I had to argue with myself in a way to do it.  And when I was going to him it just — I don't know whether it was a real image that came to my mind or — anyway, I just, it occurred to me that, what if he rejected me the way I could see my father rejecting me?</p>

<p>And then the whole, my whole thought process went to all the times when we'd be greeting each other or saying good-by and just anytime when there'd be any display of emotion or just the fact that I never would have conceived going to my father that way because you just knew he would get very awkward and sort of draw back and then sort of give you a pat on the shoulder.  And, in a w—, actually it would be in a, a rejection because he wouldn't participate, although he wouldn't actually just say, "Get away from me."  But I was afraid that MSCZ would do the same thing, that he'd just kind of draw back and tolerate my being there rather than participating in the fact that I was there.</p>

<p>And another thing, when we were talking about it, that came to my mind too — uhm, well, when we were just talking about how I respond to him and it just suddenly occurred to me that, of my grandmother's sisters, she, and only one other married.  And that, and she had 3 other sisters, I think, and then she had several brothers who all married.  But these 3 sisters never did, and 2 of them were extremely attractive.  And then the third one, who was just pleasant and I guess quite intelligent, had been engaged and then I don't know what happened, but something happened.  But the other two could have been married because there were plenty of people who were interested.  And one had actually been engaged and she had asked her fiance to give up smoking and he promised her he would.  And then she caught him smoking one day and she broke the engagement, because she felt that she couldn't trust him if, if he couldn't keep his promise.</p>

<p>And then later somebody made the comment that she had once admitted that what she couldn't face about marriage was the physical aspect of it.  And it just again made me wonder how much of all this permeates everybody's thinking in my family.  Although from what my mother has said once, I got the feeling that she enjoys it.  And that it isn't something that you tolerate because you're married.  But I know many times I respond to MSCZ in a way that, or I anticipate responses from him that would be like my father's, because I was thinking of the time when we were setting up our bed, I think I mentioned, and I was always afraid he'd start yelling at me that I was doing something wrong.</p>

<p>And then last night I was doing a dry flower arrangement and MSCZ has quite a bit of interest in arranging flowers and, and has actually had more experience than I in dealing with flowers.  So he was around, and at first we were going to do it together but then I disagreed with the way he was doing it and he just wouldn't even listen to me.  So I just said, "Well, you do it,"  because I couldn't stand the tension of disagreeing and feeling it was completely wrong.  And I, I suppose in a way I couldn't share in, in how he participated in it.  But then he insisted that I do it and he sat and watched.  Which in a way I wanted him to do but every time he sta—, sighed or opened his mouth to say anything or indicated in any way that he was having a reaction, I anticipated a criticism.  And it was true that every time he made any comment it was in terms of well, why don't you do it?</p>

<p>And I suppose — well, I can't really remember too much about things my parents said on what I did, but my impression is that they were constantly saying, well, all we want you to do is your best, try your best.  And I th—, seems to me it implied to me that I wasn't doing my best or that my best wasn't adequate, but that, that was all they could accept and that there was never any enthusiasm for anything I did.</p>

<p>And I was thinking just today too about the artwork children are doing in school for me and the great importance that it has in their whole school program at this age.  And how much you can do through it, connected with other subjects and things.  And this may not have anything to do with my parents — it might be the school — but I have absolutely no memory of doing any artwork at all.  And I ha—, by the time I was in junior high school I hated art.  It was just a class I had to go to until it wasn't required anymore.  And yet for english projects or something, if it ever could be turned around so I could do any artwork for it, I'd love to.  But I know I had the feeling then that what I did was for the, for me and for the teacher.  It wasn't something that would get wide attention and that it would be accepted that there was a certain feeling of freedom on the type of thing you did.  And that's the only time I remembered doing anything in that way.  But I have sort of the feeling that my parents would have thought that it was kind of frivolous and maybe they just tried to direct me in another direction on —</p>

<p>If I, oh, I remember in around 4th grade doing book reports.  And the thing I liked best was to do the book jackets.  And you'd design something and then your report you could put on the jacket as if it were the little blurb write-up that they do nowadays.  And the part I liked best was doing the jacket.  But I can just see my parents putting the emphasis on the thing you wrote.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I also remembered now that I said I couldn't remember anything.  I'm beginning to remember things but there are always projects done sort of without my parents' knowledge in a way.  Or I don't ever remember getting their reactions on them.  And this was a, a project I think in the 3rd grade.  It was the time I was in the room with 2 different grades and there was a committee working on making, I think probably different scenes of different types of houses.  And I was doing a uhm, house that was on, built up, over water — I, I think probably — and I had a very elaborate idea in mind of what I wanted to do and I was very enthusiastic about it and worked very hard on it.  And I'm not sure it was working out so well and I was kind of disappointed but I just loved doing that kind of thing.  And then my whole feeling for it sort of ended and my whole confidence that I could do anything like that or create anything with my hands ended.</p>

<p>And I can recall wondering why FYC, who used to do a lot of little things with her hands, uhm, like at one point she was making little dolls that were kind of cute, uhm why she could be so good at it.  And what had happened to me that I didn't have any of that ability.  And it wasn't until I started teaching younger children that I found I could do anything at all, and then I was kind of surprised to find out I could do it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking how far away I am from where I started in my thoughts and sometimes I've noticed that if I'm talking about something I don't really want to talk about and I'm really aware that I don't want to talk about it, I'll say it and then I'll sort of run away from it by immediately getting on to other things.  Although today I'm not that aware of not wanting to talk about the whole th—, problem I'm having with MSCZ.  Another thing that I know I do — and it's all part of my not knowing how I can help myself once I start realizing things — but I'll often say that I don't like being the way I am, but I am the way I am and what do I do about it?  And in particular, the thing I'm thinking about right now, is the tendency or practically always the way I take everything too seriously, including myself well, especially myself.  And MSCZ said to me this weekend it was kind of a, well, in a way it wasn't a new thought but in a way it sort of jolted me, that I took things too seriously because that's how I was comfortable.  And so I, I was keeping myself that way, in effect, because I was most comfortable doing it.  And I've always assumed that there wasn't anything I could do about the fact that I took things so seriously, unless I could just get more relaxed in general and I suppose it's all connected.  But his implication was so—, and I think I do do this, that I just sort of sit back and say, well, that's the way I am, and there's nothing</p>

<p>And we saw the uhm, film, uh, "The Odd Couple", which I'd never seen in the play either, and there were just so many things that uh, Jack Lemmon was doing that just made me think of me and it was, in a way it was funny.  But in a way it was very upsetting, because he was so ludicrous and it just wasn't even an exaggeration of what, what I do sometimes.  It was exactly what I do.  (Pause) And what I, what else I do — I was just thinking of how I thought the character Walter Matthau played was so attractive because it's exact opposite of me and I've always thought it would be kind of nice to be that way.  It's almost as if I take refuge in choosing something so opposite that I know that's not me and I know I can't be that way.  And then I'll sort of think, wouldn't it be nice if I could be?  And I just am not realistic about the problem at all.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking again about MSCZ and the whole way I respond to him and the need I have always of controlling everything.  And it is sort of the way even in intercourse.  If I'm trying to respond and I try too hard — and it's almost again like I'm controlling it — and then I'll just suddenly stop and give up in a way and sort of control it then by just telling him to hurry up or something like that.  And if I feel any kind of strong emotion for him just in any odd time, and I show it and he responds, I can't take it.  I, the, I don't know, it's, I don't know whether it's because I can't stand feeling as strongly as I was, so I have to stop or if I can't stand his response.  Sometimes I can.  But I know sometimes I just tighten right up and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Would you give me an instance?  I'm not sure, I'm —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  We're driving along and I'll just suddenly feel very close to him and I might take his hand or something, and, and then if he responds I'll suddenly lose that feeling of feeling very close to him and very warm toward him.  And right before then I'll feel that I really want him to know how glad I am that we're together and how happy I feel and everything and I suddenly can just feel myself pulling away from that.  And I'll feel sort of cold and he might as well not be there.</p>

<p>And it often happens if we're having intercourse, I might start feeling pleasure and then I'll, I can just feel myself stopping myself from enjoying it.  I was just thinking, it's almost like I can't forget myself.  I have to keep making myself think about myself.  Which I suppose is another way to be sure that I have control.  (Pause) And I think I'm not probably being honest with myself, because I think that I'd like to have an orgasm when we're having intercourse and then I don't know, I suppose I keep thinking about the time, or the first time that I did, and as soon as I did I started crying.  And I didn't expect to, there was absolutely no preparation for my crying, but I just started crying.  And I just felt all mixed-up afterwards.  And then sort of, the control was to think, well, it'll never happen again and I'll be afraid it won't, so I won't be able to do it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  When you say you felt all mixed-up, can you tell me any more about that?   In what way do you mean, confused or you were in turmoil or anxious?  Uh, I'm not quite sure what, what you mean there —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not quite sure either.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  — Mixed-up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It just, well, I felt happy and sad.  And in a way, I suppose confused that I was crying, and, but mainly a mixture of happy and sad.  And already I could see, I can see, when I think about it, I was — it made me feel very close to MSCZ but I was already pulling away from him.  We'd gotten too close.  (Pause) And it's only occasionally, even if I'm still feeling very unhappy about intercourse, but if it wasn't a too unpleasant experience for me or if I was actually enjoying it, except that I didn't have an orgasm, I will feel — I don't know if "A certain respect"  for MSCZ is the word, but he takes on a certain importance to me.  And then the only other time is when he gets very upset and then angry if it comes to that, and threatens to leave me even if it's only to go out and take a walk now and not in terms of leaving me permanently, maybe sometimes even that.  But it's only at those 2 different times that I can really think about him as somebody that's an individual and important to me in my life.  And it disturbs me that the main time that I do respect him is when he threatens to leave me.  But I can't tell whether that's my finally really respecting him or if it's my finally having to admit that I need him, which may be in the same way as respecting him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's been strange after seeing that movie and seeing so many parallels between myself and the character Jack Lemmon played.  And then today I was having a conference with a mother whose child is very compulsive and again I could see many parallels in the way he is and I was trying to think.  And I know he, I know what kind of pressure he's under because his mother is extremely anxious that he do well academically and that he be liked by others.  And I was trying to see what one central problem he had where to really focus attention on how to help him.  And in a way it seemed like he was just so concerned with himself that he — all the things he did that in turn would make things worse for himself were because he was unaware of other people.</p>

<p>And it just occurred to me that in a sense that is what happens between MSCZ and me or many other times too with other people.  That somehow I'm so concerned about myself that I just think I should come first and I am not sympathetic to MSCZ or I'm not understanding or I'm not compromising or whatever.  I just think of myself first, and maybe exclusively.  And something that often comes to my mind that I suppose is just another example of this, is when I used to react to people, and still do, who are ill.  And I have to make myself feel sympathetic or show concern when people are ill, because my attitude wa—, is that they should get themselves into shape and get better or why waste sympathy on that because you can't help it if you're ill and you'll be better soon anyway.  And I don't know exactly how I think about it, but it, I do have a very hard attitude toward people who are ill and I, and I know I have to make myself show concern.  And it's sort of, I'm playing a role or a part when I will do things for somebody who's ill and act nice.  It's not really the way I feel.</p>

<p>And roommates at college — the same thing happened — that I, I can see I thought of myself first and that the way I understood things was the way things should be.  And I couldn't understand the fact that anybody else would see things differently or do things differently.  And so the problems always came when I would get put-out because knowing how I was and what I considered important, it seemed as if they weren't thinking of me when they did things, when in effect I was doing just what I was complaining to myself about.  And very often I can say I did this with MSCZ too, I think in terms of well, he should consider me.  Or he knows that bothers me, so he shouldn't do it and I don't think in terms of what I know bothers him and so I shouldn't do it.</p>

<p>And when I was speaking of playing a role when people are ill, just made me think of how I felt when we were married.  And I hated the whole thing.  And I had, in a way I'd wanted a very small wedding or doing it very suddenly or just very quickly without a lot of planning ahead, and, and yet in another way I wanted to do what according to the way everybody does these things, and my mother was applying pressure this way too in planning everything way ahead and having a nice, pretty wedding and a big one.  And so this was a conflict the whole time before we were married, which way to have it.  And during the wedding itself, and the reception, I felt very much that I was just playing a part, and I was thinking of what I should do or how I should be or what was most attractive for a way a bride should act, and I was never just being myself.  And I felt very unhappy that day and that bothered me too because I knew I shouldn't feel unhappy and my reaction — finally we were alone and I didn't want to be alone with MSCZ — was to be very aggressive and just sort of find fault with him.  I can't remember specifically what I did, but I think that that was sort of the pattern of the way I reacted to him right afterwards.</p>

<p>And I can remember then too, if I didn't want to have intercourse and we had talked about it somewhat before and the fact that I felt this way and he had promised me that he wouldn't force it.  And then that night, because I had withdrawn from him so much and was being so awful to him, I think he must have felt that he just had to have it to kind of prove that we were close after all.  And I almost hated him for doing that to me.  And often times after that there were times when I really just wanted to hurt him.  And if he hadn't been bigger and stronger than me (chuckle) I probably wouldn't have withheld myself from hurting him.  Or I'd make up excuses on why I couldn't handle intercourse yet, by thinking well, it's so hot now, and, or else we're just married and we're staying somewhere else.  Or just any excuse, just so I could kind of get out of the fact that I wasn't able to respond.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then the way I reacted to him — I think I might have mentioned this part, but it just disturbs me too, when we first would go back home after being married and in my thinking he was just so totally unimportant when I was back home.  I was never considerate of him and sometimes it just seemed as if he were in the way, or else I'd be angry at him.  And yet I would feel aw—, I would be aware that I was feeling this way and I'd feel very guilty or very badly that I did.  So I wouldn't really know how to act.  And I think again, I was continuing this role playing of how does a young married woman react to her husband.  And my thinking always came to the point that they should, a young married couple, newly married couple, should be feeling quite affectionate toward each other and showing it in public.  And I just didn't feel that way at all toward him and that was the last thing I could even pretend to show.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was thinking of another aspect of this boy who in so many ways does things that are like things that I did or thought, in a, and in everything he does, it's very evid—, uh, well, the whole compulsive way he acts, suppose it's part of it, he — there's only 1 way things can be done.  Or if he's working on a project or if he's painting a picture or if he wants our attention, or anything, there's always just 1 way that things can be done.  He can't accept any other possibilities.  And this whole inflexibility is again something that I can see has been part of my way of thinking and responding to situations.  And I think in particular of just right now, in the kitchen at home, which is why I thought of myself when I saw Jack Lemmon.  Uhm, if MSCZ's making something I'm always in there kind of checking up on him.  And if he, as soon as he finishes something, I'm cleaning up after him.  And it drives him crazy and I can see why it does.  Although when I'm doing it, I'm not aware that that's what I'm doing to him until he complains that I'm just in there checking up on him.  And the way I rationalize it is that well, I might as well clean it up now because I'm going to have to clean it up sometime.  And it's easier now while I know it's there because I always clean up after myself as I go along.  And I can't accept that the mess can stay there for a few minutes and nothing will happen, and won't be that hard to clean up.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [PATIENT NAME], how have you been?  What've you been up to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Everything?  Like for what?  Give me an instance of what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's happening?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mother's happening?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  She made me go into [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To [DEIDENTIFIED], the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just for the summer?  For the summer or you're going in the fall back to that school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  Actually we're trying to get him into regular school.  I think he's ready.  He's been doing very well.  He's had no problems all summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Behaving well?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No fits, no hitting, nothing but, you know, out of the ordinary.  I mean of course [NAME OTHER], they're going to fight, sibling fight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is a bully.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's an older sister and older sisters tend to not want little brothers hanging around.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't tell her I said that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd let you tell her that but I wouldn't tell her that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  I wouldn't tell her it either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so your concentration has been okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's been doing very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's his thinking doing for the most part?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Been fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More organized?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	More—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's been more controlled.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He, since he's been going to [DEIDENTIFIED], he's learned, he's even being more compassionate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Kind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind, thoughtful of other people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well that's weird cause they said I'm mean.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At the school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They tell me different.  They tell me different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I like that shirt by the way.  Is that a Donkey Kong shirt?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mario.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mario, all right.  That's cool.  I tried playing that.  I was never good at it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I can't.  It makes me dizzy.  I, I can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I bet you're good at it, though, aren't you, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't see how you can play it either.  It makes my head swim.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are you doing for the rest of the summer?  You getting a lot of exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He walks almost every day with his dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They walk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and look what [NAME OTHER] did to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did, what did he burn you or just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twist your arm?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Scratch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just a scratch.  The kids he goes with are more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tough?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well it's like that they're more, um, mentally challenged and more autistic than he, you know.  They have, they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I beat up [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You knocked him down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're smiling about it too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.  I keep telling him that's wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you enjoyed doing that, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Did he deserve it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did he do to you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well he was picking on a blind boy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was picking on a blind boy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you decided to give it to him for doing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He attacked the blind boy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you protected him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's good.  How, how's your sleep at night?  You sleeping, any bad dreams or nightmares?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You hearing anything that you shouldn't hear or any voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never hear voices.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  He sleeps well with that?  Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  He has no problem sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your focus with, I guess Strattera also helps you focus with your—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	During the day.  Good.  So what are you doing for the rest of the summer?  Are you going take time off or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He goes, he goes to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh he does?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  I don't send him every day.  He doesn't go every day but 3 or 4 times a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been looking forward to this appointment for a while now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  You wanted to tell me something.  You had some complaints so did I hear all your complaints or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, what are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One thing [NAME OTHER] in my class, he's annoying as heck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How does he annoy you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't explain it.  There's too many details.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's because [NAME OTHER] has the behavior of a [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's very, yeah</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Disruptive and acts up?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah and he likes to sit on your lap, and he likes to give, keep giving you things and he gets upset if you, I've been in the class with him and he acts just like, he has the behavior of a [AGE] or [AGE] year old, and he doesn't understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  He likes you, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I understand perfectly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He likes you and aggravates you, though?  Maybe he looks up to you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He sits in my lap when I go and sit in the class with him.  He sits on my lap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cuddly kid?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hm, he likes attention, but it's just like the, it just reminds me of a [AGE] or [AGE] year old.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he puts everything in his mouth.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  See he, he puts everything in his mouth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's a shame.  He—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean everything.  He eats dirt.  He eats what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rocks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Rocks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is he, [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's like [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eleven.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's [AGE] but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's severely—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Retarded?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  He, he, he's severely, yeah.  I don't know if he's mentally challenged or if he's severely—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Definitely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Autistic but yeah.  He's not all, yeah.  There is a lot of problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sound pretty good, though.  You sound like you had a good summer.  How are you getting out with your sister?  You spending time with her?  She looked like she was unhappy when I saw her out in the waiting room.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah well she's going through that phase where everything annoyed her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] thinks I'm annoying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right well—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He can't do anything right.  He can't do anything right with, with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She says I'm a brat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you worry about that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No he ignores her pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Unless she hits him.  She's got a bad thing with hitting cause she's been in trouble a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So but she's bad about hitting for everything he does, and I told her you can't do that but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Overall his eye contact is pretty good, and he's not as shy as he used to be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  He's growing out of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's growing up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] attacked me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got a birthday coming up too the end of this month, don't you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They think I'm turning [AGE] in school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Who, did you tell them that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They all think that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well you tell them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you more mature than the others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They say they know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He, he's the only one that really, he's the most normal acting in the school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But it's been good for him cause he's calmed down cause up in [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He needed the time to get rid of the anxiety and, and the anger, and he's done very well.  They don't know why I even put him in there.  The teacher said, "Why is he here?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you said you thought he should go back to regular school this fall?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where are you going to send him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Where we live, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] did really well there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So the only thing I'm going to tell them is, you know, the only thing he might need help with is, um, like, having an aide walk him to class.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't need an aide walking me to class.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When, until he adjusts because it's a big school and there's a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Of kids in it.  And still the special bus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Those are the only 2 things I think he'll—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can handle the regular bus.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  No.  I'm not so sure because you still have problems with noise and you still have a little bit of anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he seems so much more mature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I can handle the bus now, and I don't need an aide to walk me to class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have to pay those people extra money so I'm sure if they don't think that you need it—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Stop picking at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're doing okay, they'll stop it.  They'll stop the aide.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I mean just in the beginning to get him adjusted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Accustomed to going.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because it's going to be a super shock to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm so proud.  Look how tall he's gotten.  He's, he got leaner too and he's getting tall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it's going to be there's hallways everywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah it's a big school, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't care.  I'll find my way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, listen to that confidence.  He's had a good summer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He does.  He's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's matured a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He really has.  It's me mostly not him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mom's worried about you.  She has anxiety and you don't, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I do.  I, I worry about him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm supposed to be doing the [INAUDIBLE] I mean the talking.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well I can talk too, can't I?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to talk by yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want Mom to step out?  No?  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'll leave the room.  You want me to leave?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  But you, there's so much growth taking place this year.  That's good.  All right.  I'm going to leave everything as is.  I will see you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am not done talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh I'm sorry I cut you off then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Mom needs medicine too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'll get it ready.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes keep talking.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's listening.  Tell him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have been arguing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With who?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're always arguing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With yourself or with other people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With my sister, my little sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She argues about stuff she has no clue about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The great debater.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she argues points and she doesn't have any facts to back her up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I bet she still insists that she's won the argument, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yep.  [NAME OTHER] says she's right.  That's exactly right because she's the girl.  So I keep telling him it's a girl thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not a girl thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can't figure it out.  Not even a grown, a grown man can figure women out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes and you know Freud who founded psychiatry said of all things he could never understand women.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	See.  Even [PHYSICIAN NAME] tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that was one of the greatest, ah, minds supposedly in terms of how the brain functions around.  He had a hard time understanding what women do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway I'm—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Women are strange characters I'll admit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you're just at the beginning of adolescence.  This is going to be a big test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to regular high school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I already told you.  I already started the process.  I got to call them Monday and get them started.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're getting a new principal in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  The other one resigned.  She was a nice lady too.  They're really nice there.  They're very nice.  The teachers are great.  The aides are really good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They even let him go on, with other classes on field trips because he behaves so well, and he's a big help with the other kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  He's really done an awful lot of good growth and I'm proud of how you've come along.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He even kept a kid from getting killed in [DEIDENTIFIED], huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  How did you do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He almost got hit by a car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you were watching so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He reached out and grabbed him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why is that good for me?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause it was a good thing to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're a hero, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You were, well he was aware of what's going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was really paying attention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  You should be proud of yourself.  So it's going to be another good year.  What grade are you going into?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are these, are these the, um, 3 month ones?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are the 3 month, 90 days, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're much cheaper for us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are we done?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll be done and I'll see you I guess in about 3 months.  Keep up the good work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any problems when he goes back to school call me and we'll get on top of it right away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll be in the process of annoying [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  You're going to leave [NAME OTHER] alone because I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Don't annoy your sister.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Please don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  All right, mom.</p>

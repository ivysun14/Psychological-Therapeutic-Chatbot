<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client Grogan interview five, Client Grogan interview five. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, a new mike?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Old microphone just..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Different?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tied with the rubber bands around the..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I thought it was a different color before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I really did. Must have been the tabletop that it was resting on. I didn't want to come here so much today. It was like an obligation. But now I'm relaxed more about it. I had no specific reason. It was just, I made myself get tired. I guess it was because I still had stage fright. 0:01:25.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But now I'm just laughing at myself because it's so repetitious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I had the feeling as you said that you're laughing at yourself like in retrospect it seems sort of funny or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just end up doing that over and over again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not very pleasing to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I imagine also like tiring. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kinda bugged anticipating...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, partly I didn't want to come here because it's so far. But that's probably not why. I wanted to take a nap but I don't think that's probably why I didn't really want to come. 0:02:28.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well. It's not bad now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to ask you. I don't get it. It sounds like those are two pretty plausible reasons. Like one is I guess is you're tired, ok?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other is like, it's a hell of a drive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess. I don't know..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I live on the North side. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It feels like a hell of a drive and you're tired. What's wrong with those two reasons? Why don't they feel right to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I thought I was making them up. I thought I was making myself tired because the same thing happened on Tuesday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And usually I do take a nap after school if I don't come here. But usually I'm not tired when I lay down to take this nap either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's why I felt that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the drive. It is long. But if it were something that I really wanted to do I wouldn't mind, I'm sure. 0:03:37.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was trying to think of a parallel. Like it was, the only thing I could think of were things that friends made me do that really didn't want to do but I felt like I should. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I feel I should do this only there's nobody I feel like I should do it for but me. And therefore I don't want to do it. I'd rather take a nap. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're, one thing you're saying is that when it comes to doing for your, nuh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I feel the same way as I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can just think of doing things with friends that's all. I just didn't want to do it. 0:04:23.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was exactly the same kind of feeling I had today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like sorta being obliged to do something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know who's obliging me. Yeah, the other day the thought struck me that I although I semi-trusted my boyfriend, I mean this came into my head that I felt that I trusted him and then immediately on top of that was the thought that I really don't think that I trust very many people. And maybe it's men, I'm not sure. Probably it's men. 0:05:15.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And in fact I can't remember the last person that I've trusted. But I don't know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've nothing else to say about that so I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were going to say something else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like what you mean by that or would it be like that's just a fact. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. I'm afraid of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh. Frightening. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel that he's going to let me down. And I don't know. I don't know how or why. 0:06:19.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I trust him with my feelings. That's the thing. More than trusting him what? To not go out with other women, or trusting him to do what he says he's going to do. I can't trust him with my feelings. And I must have, fuck, had them, must have had something happen a lot of times or something to make this seem like such an astounding thing to me, that's all. It's probably not that astounding. But it really struck me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it sounds like the things you're talking about is like you trust him so that you can express how you feel. Is that what you mean? 0:07:13.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I guess that's it. I mean to him. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. And like that's a very different kinda experience for you. That's a red letter experience for you. And..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I trust him not to hurt my feelings. That's what I mean. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that..</p>

<p>CLIENT: More, to, or is that the same thing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, that sounds, that's what I was saying, like that didn't, sounds like what you mean is something like you trust him not to kinda crush you or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hurt your feelings. Like crush you with bad things. 0:08:00.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: What ever you know. Yeah, yeah. Not make fun of them, maybe, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, whatever it is, it's like a way that you are vulnerable, potentially vulnerable with him and you're saying you couldn't be whatever that way is with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't follow you either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. You can, you mean being vulnerable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I just didn't, yeah, the very last couple of things you said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like it's a way that you can show your weakness or something with him and trust that he's not going to lower the boom on you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe that's it. When I was thinking about that, something really dissimilar came into my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. 0:08:55.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I worked, I worked for an insurance company for quite a while. And I was a claims adjuster. And I was always like the star, I mean I always did a good job. And then I started going out with this man in the office, this married man. The one that I dated for so long. And it was oh a big messy thing, a horrible thing. And it ended up with both of us getting fired because of this. And that, that was a horrible experience for me. And it was a horrible, not because of getting fired. It was like, it was like, I don't know. It was very personal to me. It's like I was personally what? Like let down? I don't know. I personally lost faith in my boss. And it was really unrealistically shattering to me. I can remember meeting people on the street from that company a long time after that happened and getting very upset when I saw them. Really upset. And that, I don't know if that's related at all. 0:10:26.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It sounds like you really, you just expected your boss and them to understand. To, you know..</p>

<p>CLIENT: My boss, one day I didn't go to work and my boss came to my apartment to see, oh to see if I was there with this man. And then the next day we got fired. I mean I wasn't there with somebody, but it didn't matter. So that was when I felt it was him especially. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That, well I'm sure what it is, it's like you, you kinda just expected him to kinda accept how you were or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know either. I guess it's not important either. 0:11:07.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it may not be important but I'm confused and the sticking point for me is it sounds like it was a horribly hurtful experience for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was. Yeah, it was like he personally, what did he do? I don't know what he did. He let me down. I don't know exactly how. It was like he and I were very good friends until this happened. Maybe that's it. </p>

<p>Yeah. Yeah, I trusted him until then. Maybe that's why it came into my mind when I was thinking about my boyfriend. 0:12:05.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It sounds like you trusted him and in some way felt, must have felt kinda good with him if he was your friend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then he did that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like (inaudible at 0:12:14.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. It was ridiculous. Yeah, oh well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh well what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, I don't have anything else to say about it. I don't even know why I was thinking about any, oh wow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. What wow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess that's silly to think about trusting people or something. Maybe I was very naive, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm hearing two things in what you're saying. I'm not sure. I'm not totally clear. One thing I heard you saying was that whole subject's sorta dumb. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other thing I thought you were saying was, "I was pretty dumb then, maybe."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To trust, to say both of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Let's see. See I guess I know you should, you should, I guess this is what I think is that you shouldn't need other people, or maybe I feel that it's weak to rely on other people but I want to. To a certain extent anyway. 0:14:41.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If that makes any sense. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know what I'm talking about really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The sense I'm making out of it is something like, kinda like you just shouldn't. You know, that's not right in some way to want people or feel yourself dependent on them but sorta like your feelings want to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I think that it's ok to need other people if you're, if you can get along without them. Then to be able to get along with them is fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you shouldn't just rely on them. And maybe that's what I was doing, or do now. 0:15:35.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Not so much that you shouldn't rely on other people, it's like you shouldn't rely on other people unless you know you can be on your on and make it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you're feeling really dependent on them and lost without them..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't fit, feel right to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it doesn't. I don't, I really don't think that's good. But I guess that I do this, or feel that I have to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. If you rely on other people, it really feels like a chancy world if you're doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I, yeah. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why shouldn't it? What's the answer for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess what I'm asking you is isn't that the right way to be? That's what I'm asking you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry. Isn't what the right way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This, what I said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, isn't it better? You said you're wondering like isn't it better if I can get along by myself and to feel as though like abject in front of others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. See and I always thought I could get along by myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's somehow, realizing that you can't is like new for you? 0:17:18.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it is. I always have gotten along by myself. Maybe it was like I was forced to and didn't want to, maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was a fairly fat child. And I really think that had a lot to do with that. Like I didn't go out a lot. I wasn't real fat. But I didn't go out a lot in high school and stuff. And I think I probably really wanted to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know I did. I can't remember being upset, real upset about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But maybe I was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's, and when I was younger I was alone all the time because we lived in a resort town and in the winter there was nobody else around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe I was just forced to. But I always thought I could be on my own but I just didn't want to be and now I'm almost the other way. 0:18:34.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. The other way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I need somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ever since I've been, I'm 24. And ever since I was 21 I've had a boyfriend almost all the time. And I think that's almost wrong from what, the standpoint I'm talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It sounds like it's wrong from the standpoint that you're talking about and also, also somehow makes sense to you. Like you look back at your childhood and growing up and adolescence and like see yourself as having been very lonely even if in some way you didn't feel it. Like in retrospect it feels like you must have been lonely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think that I felt lonely. But I think that I probably was. 0:19:43.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right. And now I don't know why I'm talking about this issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know whether you like treated, like the question whether you should be talking about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I can't see where it, I can't see why I should be because I guess I wasn't, I was just restating what I already thought, that's all. I wasn't, sometimes as you talk you think more and you learn more things but I wasn't then, that's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew all that stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I want to play a toy, I don't know what to talk about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you want to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Now I want to play a toy, I don't know what to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was feeling that I wasn't performing well because I was talking to my roommate about all this trouble that I had Tuesday. And she said that happened to her once. But I can feel it happening all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you kinda compare yourself to her..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you wind up a very, very poor second. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. I mean I'm not progressing very well I don't believe at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It only took her one session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes it did. (chuckle) She had a jumping off point though. She was getting a divorce. She had something to talk about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she had an excuse. Maybe if you had a jumping off point then you'd be equal or you'd be better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And something traumatic happens to her every week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're Sarah Burnhart it's very easy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No, it's just..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you're you get kinda caught up in looking at yourself in a mirror and can't get past that. 0:22:26.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't. And I don't know why I get so upset about it. See that really bothers me that I get so upset. I was getting upset on the way home from school today. I mean, yeah I was. And it's about performing, I know it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where's the audience in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think that, I don't think it's necessarily you really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it is you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it's me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Can you instead of talking for a minute just like close your eyes and see where, you know like try to think of who's looking at you. Pay attention to what's going on for you. Don't fight it or try to come up with something clever. You don't have to come up with anything. See if you can find out who's looking. 0:23:54.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There are a hundred names running through my head. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A flood of things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Pardon me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A flood of things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It reminded me of this dream I had about my mother and I wanted to tell you about it a week ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. A whole week ago. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounded like you were saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I forgot it Tuesday when I was so stymied. It was right after I was here and I was, maybe it was right after I saw my mother. Anyway I had this dream about my mother. She was a flat, like a pancake doll dressed in pink. And with a coned head on. And her hair was there and, but her eyes were full of hate. And then it would flash to her as she really was and she was saying oh, it wasn't true. But then this doll would come back on full of hate. So maybe I'm performing for my mother since that's the strongest thing that came into my mind. I don't know. 0:25:28.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't make any sense to me at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say it doesn't make any sense, you mean that's not reasonable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she didn't do that at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well she's not here anyway. I mean I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what, like literally. Yeah. I mean I thought it was the match and the cigarette (inaudible at 0:25:49.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you shouldn't, you couldn't feel like you're performing for your mother because only you and I are here? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I never see her. I mean once every two months. That's what I mean. 0:26:06.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Well I, ok. I know what I'm hung up on. Is it like that it feels to you like it may, granted that it's crazy in some way, you know. Because you don't see her and she's not here. But are you saying like somehow in some crazy way it feels like that may be what you're doing, or what? That you are performing for her even though it's crazy to think that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds too Freudian for me to say it, but I'm going to admit it, that's the truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? It sounds too Freudian to admit, to say it. What does Freudian mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I don't know. I don't know. I don't know very much about that. But it just you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what does it mean to do? I don't know..</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means that everything, almost everything that you do has a meaning first of all. And that it's all related to your childhood and sex</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's, that's what I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what are you saying? Are you saying like it makes me uncomfortable to entertain the notion that anything that I do has to do with my childhood or sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like having fate govern your life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or being predestined. That, that, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's sorta like saying make, it's sorta like saying that I'm not responsible. It's God, or..0:28:12.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's a very comfortable idea to think that you don't have to do anything. But no I don't like it. I reject that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that it's possible at all, I mean..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like behavior patterns. I wonder, do they, are they, do they always start in your early childhood really or can they be developed on like when you're in puberty or something like that? I don't know. I just (inaudible at 0:29:08.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. It also sounds like it's like can you really change. Or are you kinda, sexually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see. Maybe if you're aware, really aware. More than just saying well I intellectually accept that it's fact. That's different I think than really feeling something. You don't follow that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And really being aware of it. Maybe if you're aware of something you can change it. And the reason that I ask that is that I don't understand, if you think that, that when you're very small how you can really remember or know. 0:30:02.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't, I don't get that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't get that. Let me tell you what I, that, just repeat what I heard you say, maybe I just misheard you. If these start when you're very young, how can you remember them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why shouldn't you be able to remember them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember a lot of things, that's why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, now what does that, you don't remember a lot of things..</p>

<p>CLIENT: So how, if I don't, if I'm not aware of how things that I do started, or why I do things I do, how can I hope to change them. I think. Maybe that's not true. Maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. But see that has to be true because I intellectually know about my compulsive eating. I know about that. I've read a real lot about it and I know about it. But it doesn't help. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or about just, yeah. 0:31:13.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you, kinda I sorta think (inaudible at 0:31:21.7) something like feeling like how can you, how can you change, How can you change. How can, I mean you know a lot of things anyway about why you do things and..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, good. You think you do and you haven't changed for the knowledge. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how can you change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not a blas� how can you change. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. It's like how can therapy help me? How can I be different? What's this going to do for me? I don't see anything it's going to do for me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd like me to tell you how. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No. No, I was just, no, I don't know what I was asking.0:32:15.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I was asking. Maybe I just, maybe I'm looking for, you know, a goal or something. Instead of just being relaxed and I'm not. And I would think, I thought, that I would really like the opportunity just to talk to someone about myself. But I'm finding out that it's very difficult. Maybe I think that it's pointless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like it had been something that you really kinda had eagerly anticipated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you know, feel good. And the fact that it's, in contrast so painful and difficult and taxing makes you wonder whether maybe it isn't the right thing at all to do. I mean how can that help? 0:33:37.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: My reaction to what you said was that, you know, that you were rejecting me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. I don't..</p>

<p>CLIENT: You were telling me, yeah, that I was right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. That I was sorta agreeing with you. How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sad. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you have liked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe just add at the end that that's not true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Let's role play then for a minute. And I'll be you and you be me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember what was said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's ok. We'll take it like what you might have said. I mean, close enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm you. You're me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have to tell you back what you said to me? 0:35:14.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no. Sit here. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you. I'm going to tell you what you told me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then what I want you to do is tell me as, and me..</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I thought you said?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, what you'd like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What I'd like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What would you like me to have said? When I think about how much I liked, well I thought about coming here. And I thought it would be awfully good to be able to tell somebody about myself and it turns out it's really very difficult to. Very hard. And that makes me wonder if it's worthwhile at all. Whether it's really worth it. Whether it's any good or not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I understand how you feel but you'll find out that it's going to be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's going to be all right for me. It's going to work out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If you just relax. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's that make you feel? Just doing that? 0:37:01.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: It made me feel better. It made me feel more relaxed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was reassuring myself. I don't know. No, I don't know if that's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that may just be poetry or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I felt like I wasn't on the wall. That's the truth. I mean I felt like I wasn't, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the wall like, what's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, strapped to the wall or pinned to the wall. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It sounds like you usually feel strapped or pinned to the wall. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what's it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I fell like I'm expected to do something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. And right then you didn't feel that you were expected. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I didn't. I should have felt more but I didn't because I wasn't me, I was you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Where does that leave you? 0:39:00.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. 0:39:01.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I was trying to think of all the things that I felt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't hear you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I was trying to think of other times that I felt like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tense. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to think of other times and you can't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know, I know that I had them but I can't think of anything. There are times that I physically felt like going like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Going like how? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like moving, moving to feel that you're not held in a vice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Moving my head but my body's held in a vice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Get your chair back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to move? 0:40:12.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't care enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pardon me? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't care enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, do you want to move? Do you feel uncomfortable there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's where you're supposed to be. It's like my kids in the classroom. They want their desk in rows instead of in circles because that's where they're supposed to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a place for everything and everything in its place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't really ascribe, subscribe to that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I am ashamed of my feelings a lot of times. I know a lot of times people have feelings that, you know, probably aren't acceptable. Like maybe, I don't know, an extremely (inaudible at 0:41:24.7) A lot of times I'm very ashamed of my feelings. 0:41:29.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. A lot of times you really feel like they're kinda awful and you should hide them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're always awful to me. Even though I'm trying to hide them I feel like they're awful to whoever else is around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even when you hide them do they still feel it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. If I hide them, they don't know. But I want to express them a lot of times but I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because they're awful, I guess you'd say awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I don't know who they're awful to. Maybe they're awful, I don't think they're awful until I think about the reaction that they'll get. And then I think they're awful but I don't think..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you kinda anticipate what somebody else would say, that's when you start feeling queasy about showing how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I used to be real kinda spontaneous. Maybe I got that done a lot. I don't really remember. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know where it comes from.0:42:41.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I, I know that, I know that I was a lot more (inaudible at 0:42:47.6) for sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I suppose that's normal but I still want to do these things. Whatever they are, like, just silly things like when I'm walking down the street or something I want to go, I wanted to run down the curb. That's a silly example. Or when I'm happy I want to hug someone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you have those feelings in you and you really want to act on them and then wham, it's like putting yourself in a box. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Because I don't think they're acceptable. Yeah, I don't. I don't that's all me. Maybe it is but I don't think that it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. Like some of that's reality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. And I think what upsets me, yeah, what upsets me is that I still have them. Like I feel like I should have outgrown them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The feelings. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Except I act out anger, but I do it badly. I mean what I think is badly. I try not to show it or else I will take it out on an inanimate object. Or if I'm very angry I'll probably cry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I won't do that in front of anyone. So I guess that's the same thing. I'm still ashamed of it. Like I cannot, it's very difficult for me to say something in anger. In fact I don't know if I hardly ever do.0:44:55.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. Sounds like when you get angry the words inside of you just get choked off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they do. Maybe I feel if I talk I would, yeah, I feel if I talk I would say something very hateful or hurting which I really do feel is wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like with all these other things that, I feel that if I, yeah, I could go to extremes. Which probably isn't true. But that's the way I feel though. 0:45:48.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. True or not, the feeling is that you could be damn destructive. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh but for all the other feelings too. Not just anger. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know what all the other feelings are but it makes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What other, I don't know. What other feelings you have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean the one, you know like, something like kinda running down the street being real silly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Skipping or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah I feel like I could keep it up for a long time. Way past it's normal limit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that? Normal limit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what a normal limit is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whatever it is, it isn't for you, yeah. 0:46:32.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And then those, that's probably not true because I don't do any, or very rarely do I do these things. So that's probably why I feel like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. The fact that you haven't done it at all makes, or do it very rarely makes you think that if you were to do it that it'd just be really out of control. You'd be out of control. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. For everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anger's one but love too </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Both. When I was in the country visiting a friend just a couple of, last weekend, I was out running around in the woods with their ten year old child for like two hours. And, no I didn't feel stupid then. But, I mean that's the kind of thing that I'd do when I was young. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You really liked that. 0:47:55.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I did. I mean we weren't taking a walk through the woods. We were running through the woods. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were, yeah, you were playing and having fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was acting like a child, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, I guess it's like you think back on that and it's really sorta nice but it also makes you uncomfortable somewhat. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah, I feel that most adult people don't do those things. Maybe they want to. I don't think they want to though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See that's the thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like there's something wrong with you. Other people have outgrown that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a, I mean, you were there like a secret child in a world of adults. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except like for expressing love. I'm afraid to. Really. The same as anger, or probably the same amount, I'm afraid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the people you care for, very hard to like to know them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel that once I let them know that I get it done almost sloppy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Kinda like, the image I have is like become like a puppy dog. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this is good. Who wants a puppy dog? I don't even want a puppy dog. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no way you'd like something to be toward you. 0:49:58.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it isn't. I feel nicer but I don't know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel nicer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. More relaxed, that's..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Internally. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something's happened for you. You don't know what it is but it makes you feel a little better, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Because I, I just, I've never said that before that's all. Like, and I was only just aware of it the other day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having shared something new with somebody else does something for you. 0:51:16.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I knew that you weren't going to laugh at me for saying that. The times when I feel the most stupid are the times, I think I've said this before, when I say something that I feel fairly strongly. And I've been watching myself do it for the past several days. And I, you know, it's like I have this, I have a physical reaction to it. And it's almost like kinda silly but it is. It's like, it's like when I buy a gift for someone I'm very excited about it. But when I give it to them, I like want to run away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you. You feel very silly about it and what? 0:52:12.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want to run away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't want to see their reaction to it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you want to put down the gift and run away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because I'm ashamed of it by the time I give it to them. But before that I was happy about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By ashamed of it you don't mean the gift isn't good enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I feel like that or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. The association for me is ashamed of your gift like they're going to laugh at you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But be too polite not to, no they wouldn't laugh. I'd just know that they didn't like it anyway. 0:52:57.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really can remember, this is something that I can really remember. It's coming home from school and telling my mother about things that I was excited about. And she would say, "That's nice." And that's all. And I can remember that, it happening in high school for sure. And I, and I think that's when I started to, when that happens to me it's like I have a constriction right here in my chest. I really do. I mean it's just a physical thing. And I know that's when that started. 0:53:38.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. When you feel put down that way, like you really feel it. It really hurts you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sure that's psychosomatic. It doesn't matter that it is or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I thought, yeah I thought you were saying too like when you feel yourself, you really put yourself on the line in some way that the reaction inside you is so great that like it's a physical reaction. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're knotted and tied up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Kinda. But the only times that you put yourself on the line really are the, when you're saying things about yourself that matter. Otherwise you aren't putting yourself on the line. I mean to me that's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Like when you give somebody a gift you're not putting..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes, but that's, hmm. That's an extension of your feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like saying, "Look, I care for you."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. What I meant was it's not like in a job. That was what I meant. I'm done. 0:55:49.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I'm done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if you're saying that you want to stop or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't, I don't want to start talking about something. Is that all right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to check out too, it's not like you want to stop talking about that, it's like that's over. That's all there is to that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Now that's not true. 0:56:23.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, what is it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt like I had to go on and on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I knew that the time was almost over so I wanted to stop. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:56:57.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a great (inaudible at 0:57:00.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The sixth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The sixth, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Here's my coke. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good bye. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good bye. 0:57:27.4</p>
